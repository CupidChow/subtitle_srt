1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This building is worth the money.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Is there anyone who wants to buy it?

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The guest is Lin Wei Min.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:24,300
He is the owner of the

5
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,300
Hello, Rachel.

6
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,300
Where are you?

7
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,300
Has Mr. Lin arrived?

8
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,300
Mr. Lin is here.

9
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,300
Sorry, I think I can't go today.

10
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,300
How about you tell Mr. Lin yourself?

11
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,300
Okay.

12
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,300
Sorry, Miss Luo is looking for you.

13
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,300
Miss Luo.

14
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,300
Mr. Lin, sorry.

15
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,300
I have something urgent at home.

16
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
I can't go now.

17
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
Talk to my colleague first.

18
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,300
Family is important.

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,300
You can handle it.

20
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,300
Thank you.

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,300
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,300
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,300
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,300
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,300
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,300
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,300
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,300
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,300
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,300
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,300
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Thank you.

34
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,300
Thank you.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,300
Thank you.

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,300
Thank you.

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,300
Thank you.

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,300
Thank you.

39
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,300
I can't find it.

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,300
He didn't answer the phone again.

41
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
You are so angry.

42
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,300
I left for a while to buy things.

43
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,300
Why is my sister gone?

44
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,300
You didn't find it.

45
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,300
I suddenly felt so bored.

46
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,300
I was going to find some medicine.

47
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,300
But I couldn't find her after taking the medicine.

48
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,300
Enough, mom.

49
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,300
Stop talking.

50
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,300
Dad said he was not feeling well.

51
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,300
What should we do?

52
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Should we call the police?

53
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,300
I'll go around and look for him.

54
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Thank you Yan Yuying.

55
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,300
You're welcome.

56
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
Sister.

57
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Why did you run away so late?

58
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,300
I wanted to help farther away.

59
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
I don't know whether you see what happened.

60
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
The red carpet is very cool

61
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,300
very new

62
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,300
I wear too much.

63
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Isn't it cool?

64
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
Never.

65
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,540
If something happens to your brother

66
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,300
I'm not afraid

67
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,540
he won't come back.

68
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,540
situation

69
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,540
This can be an example for you.

70
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,300
Because you are the ether cat.

71
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,900
Why are you here alone? You scared us to death.

72
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,300
Little girl.

73
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,300
Sorry, my wheelchair just got stuck.

74
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,100
Ying Ying helped me push it up.

75
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,900
Yes, she thinks she needs help. I can't help.

76
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,500
Sister, you can't say that.

77
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,700
Sorry.

78
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,300
It's okay. I've been riding a wheelchair for many years.

79
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm fine. You guys can go.

80
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,900
No, I want to send you home.

81
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,100
Let me send you home with my sister.

82
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,500
Otherwise, she'll definitely scold me.

83
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,100
Okay, thank you.

84
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Mom, I found my sister. You don't have to worry. Go home first.

85
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,700
Bye bye.

86
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,100
Mr. Lin, you really have a good taste.

87
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,900
Near the 581 building, there are some old buildings that are being rebuilt.

88
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,500
The per square meter is 17,000 to 19,000.

89
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,100
So, it's a good time to wait for the demolition.

90
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,300
Mr. Lin, you seem to be not interested in what I said.

91
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm not interested. I don't plan to wait for it to be demolished.

92
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,100
I understand.

93
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,700
Mr. Lin, I've seen your internal city tour.

94
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,100
I know you're running a drug factory.

95
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:10,700
May I ask, apart from being brave and making drug tour, what else do you do?

96
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,900
I just read books and study the medicine.

97
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,900
Miss Sheng, do you plan to have a child?

98
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,100
Mr. Lin, why are you suddenly asking this?

99
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,900
Sorry, I know it's a bit rude.

100
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,500
I thought you're an honest person.

101
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Why are you asking me this for the first time?

102
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,300
Because I can't help myself seeing you dressed like this.

103
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,500
What can't you help yourself with?

104
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,500
I want to remind you.

105
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,300
If you don't cover your face, the cold air will enter your body.

106
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,900
It will affect the circulation of your blood.

107
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Also, if you wear a dress and expose your face,

108
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,700
you like to wear a short-sleeved shirt, and you like to drink cold drinks,

109
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
it will easily cause a cold.

110
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,900
That is to say, your baby's room will be blown up by the air conditioner all day long.

111
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,900
If you want a child in the future, it will be difficult.

112
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,500
Thank you, Mr. Lin. Thank you for reminding me.

113
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Actually, I also hope that we can work together happily.

114
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,500
As for that chess house, I really want to buy it.

115
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
I don't know if you can contact the owner.

116
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,900
No problem. Don't worry. I will try my best to help you.

117
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,900
Actually, I've already told Miss Luo before.

118
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,700
I still want to contact her.

119
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,900
Rachel is busy recently.

120
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,900
But I am her good friend.

121
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,100
Also, I am mainly responsible for this business.

122
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,700
So, you can contact me in the future.

123
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Thank you so much.

124
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,700
What is your name?

125
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,500
My name is Luo. You can call me Rachel.

126
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,300
Rachel.

127
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,100
She is my older sister.

128
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Sister, introduce yourself.

129
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,300
My name is Luo Ying Ying.

130
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,100
I am sorry. My sister doesn't really know how to communicate with others.

131
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,300
I understand.

132
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,100
I am Jinzhi's grandmother.

133
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,100
This is the left side of the six houses. Everyone calls me Grandma Ju.

134
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Hello, Grandma Ju.

135
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,100
I was just talking to you. I didn't remember to pour you some tea.

136
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,700
You don't have to be so polite, Grandma Ju. I will do it myself.

137
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,900
Let me use it to give you a calmly chat.

138
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:58,840
You're acting

139
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,500
I've cooked the rice.

140
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,300
Just a few more dumplings.

141
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,100
Let's have a meal here.

142
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,500
No, thanks. My sister is picky.

143
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,300
She doesn't like the dumplings.

144
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,700
I like fried dumplings.

145
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,700
I'm hungry.

146
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,500
Yes, you like fried dumplings.

147
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,100
I'll cook them for you.

148
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
Thank you.

149
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Hello.

150
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,300
Why don't you see me this morning?

151
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,900
Boss, I'm working hard.

152
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,100
I'm going to meet a client.

153
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,900
I met Mr. Ling who wants to buy a house for Rachel.

154
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,300
Your sister is a hot-handed girl.

155
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,500
Speaking of this,

156
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,300
Mr. Ling is a little weird.

157
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,100
Think about it.

158
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,900
That house has been in the building for more than 40 years.

159
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,500
So he can't apply for a loan.

160
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,100
Does he need to pay the rent once?

161
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,700
But I don't think Mr. Ling

162
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,100
will spend so much money once.

163
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,700
Can you get a permit from the owner?

164
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,500
I can't find the owner.

165
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,500
I checked the land registration office.

166
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,100
The owner's name is Zhou Youfu.

167
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,500
But I didn't contact him because I didn't have the contact information.

168
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,900
What are you laughing at?

169
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,300
No, I think it's weird.

170
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,300
You said Mr. Ling has no money.

171
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,300
He thinks he can't do this business.

172
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,300
But he still works hard to register and pay the rent.

173
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,700
You know my personality.

174
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,500
I'm a person who won't miss any chance to make money.

175
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,500
I admire the kind of person who is active.

176
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Okay, I'll ask about the owner.

177
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,100
Thank you, boss.

178
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,500
I'm sorry to trouble you to fry the dumplings.

179
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,300
I understand.

180
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,300
You've worked hard.

181
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,900
It's okay.

182
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,500
You've worked harder.

183
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,900
You're the only one who takes care of Jingzhi.

184
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,700
Her parents passed away a long time ago.

185
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,500
I've raised Jingzhi by making dumplings.

186
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,500
You're blessed today.

187
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,900
The dumplings you made are really beautiful.

188
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,300
Jingzhi was a picky child.

189
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,100
She was tired of eating ordinary dumplings.

190
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,500
I had to think of another way.

191
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,500
She felt fresh.

192
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,700
So I can't meet her requirements.

193
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
I promise you, I'll eat it.

194
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,500
It's beautiful.

195
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,700
See if you like it.

196
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Be careful, it's hot.

197
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,100
It's so crispy.

198
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,500
I want to eat it every day.

199
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Okay.

200
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,500
I'm going to make it again on the weekend.

201
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,300
You take her to eat.

202
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,700
Xiaomei, come with me.

203
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,100
I'm afraid to bother you.

204
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,700
How can it be?

205
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,500
No one comes to see me and grandma.

206
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
It'll be happier to have more people to eat.

207
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,300
It'll be happier to have more people to eat.

208
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,100
It'll be happier to have more people to eat.

209
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,700
Yes.

210
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,500
I'm so happy.

211
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,900
I'm so happy.

212
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,100
It'll be happier to have more people to eat.

213
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,700
Yes.

214
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,100
Thank you.

215
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,500
How is it?

216
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,900
Did you meet Mr. Ling last time?

217
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,500
Is he sincere?

218
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,100
I think he's weird.

219
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,100
His business is not as good as his.

220
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
But it doesn't matter.

221
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,100
We often meet those weird people in this industry.

222
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,700
How could it be?

223
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,700
I saw him before.

224
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,900
He said he must buy it.

225
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,700
It seems to be very interested.

226
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,500
Maybe it's because I didn't show up.

227
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,100
Forget it.

228
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,900
I'll take care of the building.

229
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
I'll call him and apologize to him.

230
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,300
No need.

231
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
I told him.

232
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
If he's interested,

233
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,100
he'll call you immediately.

234
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,700
If you bother him,

235
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,300
it'll be easy to mess up.

236
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,700
Wait for his call.

237
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
You too.

238
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,700
Okay.

239
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,900
I'll give it to you in two days.

240
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,900
I'm going to make a contract.

241
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,700
And you have to prepare yourself.

242
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,100
Hello.

243
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,900
I'm Miss Shen from Chengfeng Real Estate.

244
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,900
I'm looking for Mr. Deng.

245
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Okay, I'll check it for you.

246
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,100
Thank you.

247
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,100
Your father doesn't know what he's doing recently.

248
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,700
He always comes with me when we have a big meal.

249
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Today, he suddenly changed his mood.

250
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,900
Why does he love his job so much?

251
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
It's good for me to have a career.

252
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,500
Mom.

253
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,100
What?

254
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,100
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,700
Take a pill and have afternoon tea.

256
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,500
Your blood sugar will be stable after taking the pill.

257
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,300
My son finally knows to care about his mom.

258
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,700
So sweet.

259
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,900
It's so dark.

260
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,900
Be careful, you'll have a bad eyesight.

261
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,900
Let's talk about serious things.

262
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,900
Have you prepared the money?

263
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,300
Your digestive system is so strong.

264
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,900
I can't concentrate on the political affairs.

265
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,700
If you don't get close to me,

266
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,700
you won't smell it.

267
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,700
Of course not.

268
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,100
I haven't smelled it for a long time.

269
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,900
Of course I have to smell it.

270
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
I'll get it for you.

271
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Why isn't there any?

272
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,100
I'll go find it.

273
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,700
I have a loan.

274
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,700
Did you leave it in dad's office?

275
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,100
Maybe.

276
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,300
Let's go back.

277
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
So weird.

278
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,300
Hello, dad.

279
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,300
Mom and I are on our way back.

280
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,900
We'll arrive in two minutes.

281
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,100
I'm sorry, I have to attend an emergency meeting.

282
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,500
I'll give you a discount tomorrow.

283
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,100
Tomorrow?

284
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,100
Yes, tomorrow.

285
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,900
Mr. Deng.

286
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,900
I'll call you back.

287
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,700
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,300
I have something to take from Mr. Deng.

289
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,300
I want to take it.

290
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Mr. Deng, you're late.

291
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,700
You're the real estate agent.

292
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,700
What's the matter?

293
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,900
I forgot my phone.

294
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,700
Bring it to me.

295
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,700
You don't mind?

296
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,100
No.

297
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,100
Thank you.

298
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,100
Mom.

299
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,100
Did you find it?

300
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,900
No.

301
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,300
I couldn't find it.

302
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,700
Maybe it's in the catering area.

303
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,700
Who dares to touch my stuff?

304
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
I'm so worried.

305
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,100
I found it.

306
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,500
It's in the sofa.

307
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,100
Thank god you're here.

308
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,100
Eat it.

309
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,700
Come here, I'll get you some water.

310
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I'm so scared.

311
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,900
It's a disaster if it's gone.

312
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
It's good that you found it.

313
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,900
Why are you in such a hurry?

314
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,700
You forgot your phone?

315
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,700
Thank you.

316
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,300
I'm a careless person.

317
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,100
You're so good at talking about the house.

318
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,100
Mr. Deng is an important client of our company.

319
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,500
This is my business card.

320
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,900
I knew your dad couldn't stand the temptation.

321
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,700
Now he changed his mind

322
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,900
to go to the fish-sauce house with us.

323
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,300
Who is he?

324
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,900
Oh.

325
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,700
She's Miss Shen of Chengfeng Real Estate.

326
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,500
She's in charge of the house we just bought.

327
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,100
She's supposed to

328
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,900
get my dad to do the rest of the paperwork.

329
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,500
But you're going to eat with my mom now.

330
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,100
You don't have time.

331
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:33,900
Right.

332
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,300
Sorry, Miss Shen.

333
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
It's okay.

334
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,100
My dad.

335
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,500
You know him, right?

336
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,900
My mom.

337
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Hello, Mrs. Deng.

338
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
But the paperwork is almost done.

339
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,700
How about leaving the rest to me?

340
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,500
Dad.

341
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,500
Just keep her company.

342
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,700
Okay.

343
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,300
Okay.

344
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
It's good to leave it to you.

345
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,100
I'm in charge of the house.

346
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,100
So you don't need to find another Mr. Deng.

347
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,300
First, he's busy.

348
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,300
Second, Mrs. Deng is too stingy.

349
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Sorry.

350
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,900
I don't quite understand.

351
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,100
I know what your relationship with my dad is.

352
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,100
If you say so,

353
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,900
you must be very experienced.

354
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,100
We'll have a good cooperation.

355
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,700
I'm different from my dad.

356
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,500
I only do serious things in the company.

357
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,300
If you don't believe me,

358
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
go to find Mr. Deng.

359
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,300
What are you doing here?

360
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,100
No one lives here for so long.

361
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,300
Don't ask too much.

362
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,500
Just go find one.

363
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
See if there's an old letter.

364
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,500
I don't know where to find your letter.

365
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,100
I just see a lot of cockroaches, dust and Lion.

366
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,100
It's bitten.

367
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,700
You want to leave now, don't you?

368
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Hurry up.

369
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100
So itchy.

370
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Hello, come here.

371
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Do you know her?

372
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Oh, Mrs. Fu.

373
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
The owner of Fu Ji Grocery.

374
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I remember the person next to me.

375
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
I just ate a bite of sugar cake.

376
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
And my hand was so light.

377
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Don't let me see you again.

378
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
I'll hit you to death if I play Tai Chi.

379
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
I don't know if it's still a middle grade.

380
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Hey, big brother.

381
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Hello, is Ji Wen Fu here?

382
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Mom, I'm looking for you.

383
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Great.

384
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Don't touch your stuff.

385
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
It doesn't matter if you eat it.

386
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
If you don't, people will see it.

387
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
It's so delicious.

388
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
I said don't eat it.

389
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm not eating it.

390
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
I'm not eating it.

391
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I'm not eating it.

392
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
I'm not eating it.

393
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
I'm not eating it.

394
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
I'm not eating it.

395
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm not eating it.

396
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
I'm not eating it.

397
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I said don't eat it.

398
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
People will see it.

399
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
You thief.

400
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
You're dead.

401
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Mom, thief.

402
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
No, we didn't steal anything.

403
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Who told you to steal?

404
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Why are you so noisy?

405
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Are you okay?

406
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
You're Lin Yixing's son, A Ming.

407
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Yes, God Fu.

408
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,500
We're here to help mom send the spicy meat.

409
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Of course not.

410
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
These two thieves stole things when I didn't notice.

411
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Right.

412
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
No, he didn't mean it.

413
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
He's greedy.

414
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
I'll compensate you.

415
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
No need.

416
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
I should thank you.

417
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Take more buns and eat them.

418
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Remember to thank Mrs. Lin for me.

419
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Okay.

420
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Thank you, God Fu.

421
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Good boy.

422
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
This is the best stuffed bun.

423
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Spicy stuffed bun.

424
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
I made the spicy stuffed buns myself.

425
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,500
I bought the best pork belly and added more rosewood.

426
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,500
It tastes much better than the ones we have now.

427
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
I remember when I was a kid,

428
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
mom asked me to take some spicy stuffed buns

429
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
to the store in Fuji, Yuanzhou Street.

430
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I gave it to the owner.

431
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Do you remember?

432
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Fuji?

433
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
The woman in the photo.

434
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I remember.

435
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Why did you mention her?

436
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Are you close to her?

437
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
We're not that close.

438
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
But she was the head of the household meeting.

439
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
We were members.

440
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,500
So it was three or four decades ago.

441
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
By the way, mom, do you know her name?

442
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Fu Shen.

443
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
What about her full name?

444
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
We were all Fu Shen.

445
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Who knows what her full name was?

446
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
You should have collected many documents

447
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
in the meeting.

448
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Those documents should have her full name.

449
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Right.

450
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Wait for me.

451
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Mom, did you find it?

452
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
I'm looking for it.

453
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,500
It should be in this notebook.

454
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
This is the name of the head of the household meeting.

455
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Chen Jinju.

456
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Here, coffee.

457
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Thank you.

458
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Mr. Lin.

459
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Miss Luo,

460
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
have you found the owner of the 581 building?

461
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
We haven't found her yet.

462
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I want to tell you

463
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
that I was really embarrassed that day.

464
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
I found a name.

465
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
She used to run a grocery store

466
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
in the 581 building.

467
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
I don't know if it can help.

468
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Okay, tell me the name.

469
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I'll see if I can find it.

470
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Wait a minute.

471
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
What's wrong, mom?

472
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
What did you promise your sister?

473
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
What?

474
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
She was angry and refused to eat.

475
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
She said she would wait for you to take her to her friend's house to eat dumplings.

476
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Who is she?

477
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Right, I promised her.

478
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
You know your sister is serious about everything.

479
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Your dad and I can't handle her.

480
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
You should think of something.

481
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Okay, I'll be right back.

482
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Mr. Lin, I'm sorry.

483
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
I'm in a hurry.

484
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Can I call you later?

485
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Okay, I'll wait for your call.

486
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Okay, thank you.

487
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
What's wrong?

488
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Mr. Lin said he had found the owner of the 581 building.

489
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Hello?

490
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
I'll be right back.

491
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Give me some time.

492
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Actually, I can help you with your work.

493
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Okay, then help me call Mr. Lin.

494
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Be careful on the road.

495
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Bye.

496
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
You don't have to stare for 24 hours.

497
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
It's not that fast.

498
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Miss Luo.

499
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Hello, Mr. Lin.

500
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I'm Natalie.

501
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
That Miss Shen.

502
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Hello.

503
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Richard is a little busy now.

504
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
He said he would like you to leave the owner's name.

505
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
I'll help you check his information.

506
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Actually, I'm not sure if he's the owner or not.

507
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
But even if he's not,

508
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
I think it should be related.

509
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
His name is Chen Jinju.

510
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
No problem, I'll help you check it.

511
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Okay, thank you.

512
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
You're welcome.

513
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
I don't understand why you're so nervous.

514
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Your uncle can buy a mansion with 30 million.

515
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Of course you should buy it more expensive than him.

516
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Don't buy a building anymore.

517
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
It's broken, old and has bugs.

518
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
It could even become a micro-room.

519
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
I'll be right back.

520
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Don't be angry, daughter.

521
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
I'm sorry.

522
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I'm sorry.

523
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
I'm sorry.

524
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
I'm sorry.

525
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I'm sorry.

526
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
I'm sorry.

527
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
I'm sorry.

528
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I'm sorry.

529
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,500
I'm sorry.

530
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Thank you, daughter.

531
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Daughter.

532
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,500
It's already 2.20 pm.

533
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
You're late for 50 minutes.

534
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
You can't be late.

535
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Come here, sister.

536
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Sister.

537
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
You're late.

538
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I asked you to go to Grandma's house.

539
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,500
You're late for 51 minutes.

540
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm sorry.

541
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I almost forgot it when I was working.

542
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Please forgive me.

543
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
I'll take you to Grandma's house now.

544
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,500
What's wrong with your hair?

545
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
How are they?

546
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Let's go to your room and tidy up.

547
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
I'll wait for you.

548
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Don't forget about sister.

549
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
You know her character.

550
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
She's not just going out.

551
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
She's going to work on Saturday.

552
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Don't you think it's tiring?

553
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
I take care of you and Yingying every day.

554
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm tired too.

555
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,980
You only know to speak for your sister.

556
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,660
No.

557
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,260
I'm not feeling well.

558
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,220
Help me take the medicine.

559
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,140
You're always saying that.

560
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,980
You're always saying that.

561
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,180
I don't know if it's true or not.

562
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,460
Is it true that I want to die in front of you?

563
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,180
Why do you say that?

564
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,940
Enough.

565
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,260
Stop arguing.

566
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,580
It's my fault, okay?

567
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,780
I shouldn't have agreed to it.

568
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,780
Let it go.

569
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,020
Nie Heng.

570
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,660
Hello.

571
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,500
I want to ask Miss Chen Jin Xu.

572
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,900
What do you want from me?

573
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,300
Hi.am Shen, the landlord.

574
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,620
My client is interested in small buildings

575
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,220
I'm not interested. I'm asking for a very high price. Can I talk to you?

576
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,220
I'm not the owner of the business.

577
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,220
Old lady, I've checked.

578
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,420
In 581, the owner is your husband.

579
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,820
But your husband, your son, and your daughter-in-law

580
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,020
haven't been able to get a new name after they passed away.

581
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,620
So in the law, the right to work belongs to you.

582
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,220
My client is paying 60 million. He's very sincere. Can you consider it?

583
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,220
I won't sell it.

584
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,620
Grandma, I think you didn't hear it clearly. 60 million?

585
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,220
Actually, as long as you agree,

586
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,820
I can ask the lawyer to do the process of revocation. Then you'll have money.

587
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,220
Is there something wrong with your ears?

588
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,620
I said I won't sell it.

589
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,420
Old lady, if 60 million isn't enough, we can discuss it again.

590
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,620
Or if you don't have anyone else, we can discuss it together.

591
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,220
If you give me 10 billion, I'll talk to you.

592
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,620
10 billion?

593
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,420
What's wrong, Grandma?

594
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,220
Those boring people think that having money is great?

595
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,020
Don't be angry. It'll hurt your body.

596
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,220
How can I be angry? It's really ridiculous.

597
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,820
Actually, what's the use of having money?

598
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:49,620
Money can be exchanged for family reunion.

599
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,620
30 years of marriage

600
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,120
48 day separation

601
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,020
13 day研 Kyle

602
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,620
Theздán

603
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,220
19 day dinner

604
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:54,920
21 day reunion

605
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,520
A day separated by life

606
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,720
20 day reunion

607
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,620
40 day reunion

608
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:16,860
An indicated yet

609
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
What?

610
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860
45 million.

611
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,860
A mansion with a good view.

612
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,860
Two houses with three rooms, two pavilions, and a garden with flowers.

613
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,860
This is what people live in.

614
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,860
Don't care about that strange building, okay?

615
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,860
Living on the beach, the humidity is very high.

616
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,860
The humidity is the evil of the insects.

617
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
It's hard to live in.

618
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,860
Your strange building has many bugs.

619
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,860
It's hard to endure the pain of skin and flesh.

620
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,860
You're right.

621
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,860
But there's a saying that

622
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,860
it's hard to buy a new number.

623
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
You said it.

624
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,860
Hello?

625
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Hello, Mr. Lin.

626
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,860
I found Chen Jinju.

627
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,860
I went to his house to find him.

628
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,860
Is he the owner?

629
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
Yes.

630
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,860
But he's worth 1 billion.

631
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,860
1 billion?

632
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Maybe he doesn't want to sell Chen Nv.

633
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
How about this?

634
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,860
I'll give you more buildings as a reference.

635
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
I'll send you some information later.

636
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,860
I'll think about it.

637
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,860
Please send me the address of Chen Jinju's present address.

638
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,860
Thank you.

639
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,860
Thank you.

640
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,860
Eat first.

641
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
I don't want to eat it.

642
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,860
Sister.

643
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Wait a minute.

644
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,860
I'll be done soon.

645
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,860
By the way, don't you have a color card?

646
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,860
Take it out.

647
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,860
Let's paint together.

648
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,860
Mrs. Ju.

649
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,860
You don't look well.

650
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,860
Are you okay?

651
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,860
I'm fine.

652
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
I have a poor real estate economy.

653
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,860
It's good for me to sell my house.

654
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,860
If the price is good,

655
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,860
it's good for you to sell it and change a better environment.

656
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,860
What's the difference?

657
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,860
What can I do with more money?

658
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,860
Look at my Jinju.

659
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,860
He's been a doctor for so many years.

660
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,860
He's just taking medicine and doing surgery.

661
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,860
He just wants to die.

662
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,860
Mrs. Ju, don't say that.

663
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Jinju is so good.

664
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,860
He'll be sad to hear you say that.

665
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,860
Hello, what can I do for you?

666
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,860
Hello, I'm looking for Mr. Ling.

667
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,860
Mr. Ling is not back.

668
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,860
I'll take you in and have a seat.

669
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,860
Okay.

670
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,860
Ten o'clock on the left, ten o'clock on the right.

671
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,860
Eleven o'clock on the left foot.

672
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,860
Eleven o'clock on the right foot.

673
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,860
Eleven thirty on the right foot.

674
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,860
Can you get me a Jiu Long Tang?

675
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,860
I think so.

676
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
Okay.

677
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
I'm sorry.

678
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,860
Lend me your mirror.

679
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,860
That's enough.

680
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,860
Lend me your mirror.

681
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
Here you are.

682
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
What are you doing?

683
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,860
I'm looking for a mirror.

684
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,860
Beauty, what can I do for you?

685
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,860
I'm looking for Mr. Ling.

686
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,860
Min Zai is out doing his business.

687
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,860
You can talk to me.

688
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,860
You are...

689
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,860
The manager of the drugstore, Liang Yanzu.

690
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,860
Mr. Liang.

691
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
Just call me Azu.

692
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,860
Azu, I'll come another day.

693
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,860
Since you're here, don't waste your time.

694
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,860
I'll take you around.

695
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
I'm not here to visit.

696
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,860
I'm here to talk to Mr. Ling.

697
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,860
Great.

698
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,860
I can make the decision that Min Zai can make.

699
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Let's go inside.

700
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,860
Bye, Mrs. Ju.

701
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,860
Bye, Jingzhi.

702
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
Bye.

703
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,860
Remember to listen to your family when you go home.

704
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,860
Bring Yingying here to eat dumplings.

705
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,860
I will.

706
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,860
Take care.

707
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,860
Okay.

708
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
Let's go, sister.

709
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,860
Mrs. Ju's dumplings are delicious. I've had 12.

710
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,860
I know. You've had many.

711
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,860
Wait until next week.

712
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,860
I will. I'll bring you here next week.

713
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
See if you can break the record.

714
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,860
God of Fortune, I'm glad you're here.

715
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,860
Do you still remember me?

716
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,860
You are...

717
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,860
You are...

718
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,860
Ling Renyuan, Ling Yishi's son, Ling Wei Min.

719
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,860
Ling Yishi's son, Wei Min.

720
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,860
Come in.

721
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860
I've thought of many ways to find you.

722
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,860
Really?

723
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,860
This is my granddaughter. Her name is Jingzhi.

724
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Hello.

725
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,860
Hello.

726
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,860
Come in.

727
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,860
It's been a long time.

728
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
You still remember me?

729
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,860
How's your mother?

730
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,860
My father passed away long ago.

731
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,860
My mother is still in good health.

732
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,860
It's been decades.

733
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,860
Our neighbors would go to see Ling Yishi

734
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,860
whenever they had any difficulties.

735
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,860
I remember that I was a member of the committee.

736
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,860
Your mother was also a member.

737
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,860
I could find you thanks to the committee.

738
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,860
I see. You know I live here.

739
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,860
I asked the real estate agent to find you.

740
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,860
I want to buy the house 581 you used to run the grocery store.

741
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,860
I thought you came to see me.

742
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,860
You wanted to buy my house.

743
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,860
I won't sell it. You can go.

744
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,860
Actually...

745
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,860
Go. I said I won't sell it.

746
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,860
I left my phone here by accident.

747
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,860
Jingzhi, we...

748
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,860
Jingzhi, you gave the house to that man.

749
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,860
He's here, too.

750
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,860
Mr. Ling.

751
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,860
The relationship between me and Min Zai

752
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,860
is really a four-word description.

753
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,860
We were born and died.

754
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
Do you want to know how we met?

755
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,860
I want to know when Mr. Ling will come.

756
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,860
I prepared some tiles for him.

757
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,860
That's great.

758
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,860
That's great.

759
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,860
We're so happy.

760
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,860
100 million is not a problem.

761
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
It's worth it.

762
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,860
But I don't think it's worth it.

763
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,860
The price can be discussed.

764
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
No need to discuss.

765
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
Help us find some luxury houses.

766
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,860
40 million.

767
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,860
I like this one.

768
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,860
This is not from our company.

769
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,860
It's okay. It's for your reference.

770
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,860
40 million.

771
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,860
It's a little expensive.

772
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,860
The most important thing is the environment, the air, and the style.

773
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,860
If the backyard can be used as a golf course, it's the best.

774
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,860
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ju.

775
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,860
My colleague doesn't know about your situation.

776
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,860
So he may have a problem with you.

777
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,860
But he didn't mean it.

778
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
Actually, I was in a hurry.

779
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
I asked him to find a owner.

780
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,860
I didn't expect him to come straight to you.

781
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,860
Forget it.

782
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,860
Actually, there was a real estate agent looking for me before.

783
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,860
You saw it.

784
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,860
I have to take care of Jingzhi.

785
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,860
I don't have time and mood to take care of that kind of house.

786
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,860
Actually, Jingzhi found out when she was very young.

787
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Her brain is paralyzed.

788
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,860
It affects the waist.

789
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
The waist can't be straightened.

790
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,860
After the surgery,

791
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,860
it's worse.

792
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,860
She can't even walk.

793
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,860
She has to sit on a wheelchair.

794
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,860
Her parents don't want her daughter to be like this forever.

795
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,860
So they help her find a good doctor everywhere.

796
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,860
A neighbor immigrated to the United States.

797
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,860
She said there was a good doctor in the United States.

798
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:36,860
So they took Jingzhi's medical report to the United States.

799
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,860
She got off the plane and got into a car accident.

800
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,860
She passed away.

801
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,860
Have you ever thought of finding someone to treat her?

802
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,860
I have invited people more than once.

803
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,860
They came to the interview.

804
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:03,860
They saw us and thought we were troublesome and hard.

805
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,860
They left after less than two months.

806
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,860
They don't want to give money to others.

807
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,860
So you say,

808
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,860
what's the use of giving me money?

809
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,860
No matter how much money I have, I can't cure my grandson's leg.

810
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Let him walk.

811
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,860
Have some tea.

812
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,860
Can you let me see?

813
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,860
It's okay after you apply the medicine.

814
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
You must have done a lot of work.

815
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,860
So you got old wounds.

816
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,860
I have a bottle of medicine.

817
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
Let me help you apply it.

818
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,860
How is it? Is it better?

819
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,860
It's better.

820
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:51,860
I remember that Dr. Lin had a health oil that was very profitable.

821
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,860
It's very good.

822
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,860
Now there is a drug factory in the clinic.

823
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,860
Do you manage it?

824
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,860
There is no clinic.

825
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
The drug factory is handed over to relatives.

826
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
I have created a new brand.

827
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,860
It's this one.

828
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,860
Sell ​​and sell ​​through.

829
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,860
Sell ​​and sell ​​through?

830
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,860
It's very famous.

831
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,860
It must make money.

832
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,860
It's not bad.

833
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,860
You make so much money.

834
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,860
What's wrong with buying?

835
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,860
Why do you buy that old building?

836
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,860
Mrs. Ju, Mr. Lin is really affectionate about that building.

837
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,860
He really wants to buy it.

838
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,860
The building is a very local feature.

839
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,860
It used to be all over Hong Kong.

840
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,860
But now there are fewer and fewer features in Hong Kong.

841
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,860
Experts say that there are less than 100 holes left.

842
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,860
Protecting the building is not only to preserve a hole,

843
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,860
but also to preserve a very precious memory.

844
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:47,860
I thought you were going to dismantle it and rebuild it to make money.

845
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,860
Don't worry, Mrs. Fu.

846
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,860
I just want to keep the building in my memory.

847
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,860
But it's expensive to rebuild it without dismantling it.

848
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,860
It really costs a lot of money.

849
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,860
Yes.

850
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,860
I will pay for the repair.

851
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,860
But I can't afford to pay 100 million.

852
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
I'm just saying.

853
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,860
100 million.

854
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,860
If you really don't dismantle that house,

855
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,860
it doesn't matter how much it costs.

856
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Are you okay?

857
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,860
Are you hurt?

858
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,860
I'm fine.

859
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,860
Look, there's not a single car on the street.

860
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,860
I told you this jam is getting to me.

861
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,160
voor hearing or later, you could stay on the streets and wait?

862
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,860
Oh, where's your company?

863
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,860
Sorry.

864
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,860
Saint Dark Reggiet pot had fallen in.

865
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,460
After you cross the sea,

866
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,060
find a place for me to get off the car.

867
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,860
Sure.

868
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,460
Thank you.

869
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,660
What's wrong?

870
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,660
I'm a small road, but I'm a big road.

871
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,260
You don't understand this?

872
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,260
It's your first day driving.

873
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,660
What's wrong with the road?

874
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,860
You're playing with me?

875
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,260
I'll play with you.

876
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,060
You're so stubborn.

877
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,260
How can you drive on purpose?

878
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,460
You're a loser.

879
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,660
So you're a fool.

880
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,660
Who's the fool?

881
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,460
Let's have a race.

882
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:21,860
I'm afraid of you.

883
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,060
I want to get off the car.

884
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,060
You're playing with me?

885
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,060
Stop the car.

886
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,460
I want to vomit.

887
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,460
Do you have a seat belt?

888
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,660
I don't want to play with you.

889
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,260
Are you okay?

890
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,060
What do you think?

891
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:09,860
Hey.

892
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,260
Hey.

893
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,060
You're a loser.

894
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,860
You're suddenly killed.

895
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,060
I won't let you go.

896
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,460
Why did you turn my car?

897
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
I'm a loser.

898
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,860
Why did you turn my car?

899
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,660
What's wrong with you?

900
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,460
You know the car behind you

901
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,460
should keep two seconds of safe distance

902
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,460
to the car in front of you.

903
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,060
You're a small road, but you're a big road.

904
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,260
Will you drive?

905
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,260
Don't look at me.

906
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,060
I'll hit you.

907
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,660
Come on.

908
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,660
Stop it.

909
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,660
You.

910
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,060
Are you okay?

911
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,260
I'm fine.

912
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,260
Sir.

913
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,260
I want to report a victim.

914
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,060
I have a witness.

915
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,660
Did you see her?

916
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,060
It happened so suddenly.

917
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,260
So I didn't see her.

918
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,460
I'm sorry, sir.

919
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,260
She said she didn't see her.

920
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,060
She was provoking me.

921
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,260
She suddenly hit me

922
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,460
with a car.

923
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,660
Who provoked who first?

924
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,460
Who made my nose like this?

925
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,060
An Cong.

926
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,060
The police are here.

927
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,060
You're messing with me.

928
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
So you found my cousin as an ambulance.

929
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,460
You came with Mr. Ling?

930
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,860
Which side are you on?

931
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,860
I'm on my side.

932
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,660
Forget it.

933
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,260
Since my cousin is here,

934
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,060
we're all on our own.

935
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,660
Sir.

936
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,060
I don't want to deal with it.

937
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,260
If you guys are in a good relationship,

938
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,660
you can solve it privately.

939
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,660
Then it's okay.

940
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,460
Okay.

941
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,260
Thank you, sir.

942
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:37,860
Thank you.

943
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,660
But my car is so damaged.

944
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,460
I have to apologize.

945
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,460
I'll hit you.

946
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,060
You...

947
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,660
You...

948
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,460
You...

949
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,260
Shi Kang.

950
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,660
Your car is damaged.

951
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,660
But look at her.

952
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,660
She's injured.

953
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,860
Forget it.

954
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,460
Fine.

955
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,460
Rachel.

956
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,460
I'm sorry.

957
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,460
I want to see her.

958
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
We'll meet another day.

959
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:02,860
Okay.

960
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,460
It's okay.

961
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,060
Cousin.

962
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,860
Your girlfriend.

963
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,260
You don't have time to see her off.

964
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,060
I'll help you.

965
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,260
Rachel is my colleague.

966
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,660
Mr. Ling is our client.

967
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,460
Are you going to buy a house?

968
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
You have money to buy a house.

969
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,660
We have money to buy a house.

970
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,260
Forget it.

971
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,060
Say something else.

972
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,060
Actually, I can call a taxi myself.

973
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,860
Thank you.

974
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,660
No need.

975
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,860
I'm also a client of your company.

976
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,660
I can also send Natalie.

977
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,460
Together.

978
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,860
Rachel, right?

979
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,660
Get in the car.

980
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,660
Let's go.

981
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,660
Mr. Ling, we'll contact you later.

982
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,860
Goodbye.

983
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,460
Hey.

984
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,460
Both women were taken away by the loser.

985
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,660
Stinky brat.

986
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,660
You always want to change cars.

987
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,660
Now you're like a bird.

988
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,260
Sitting in the office all day long.

989
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,460
Blowing air conditioner.

990
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,260
It's easy to have a sore shoulder and neck.

991
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,460
In addition to doing the shoulder and brain exercise.

992
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,860
In addition to the action of the chest and chest muscles.

993
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,860
You can also be in a tight position.

994
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,460
Use some medicine oil massage with some ingredients.

995
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,060
Or massage the back of the neck.

996
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,860
Feng Chi and An Nian.

997
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,860
This will improve your pain more effectively.
