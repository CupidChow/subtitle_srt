1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't know what's wrong.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I feel a little dizzy.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Sis!

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Sis!

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Sis!

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sis, what's wrong?

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Doctor, is my sister all right?

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
She's stable and resting.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But this time, the fever is serious.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I suggest you stay in hospital for an observation.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Make sure there's nothing wrong.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
She has autism.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She had a fever before.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Is there any problem with her sudden fever?

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Did she feel any pressure or stimulation before her fever?

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
She was scared when she saw her dad vomitting blood.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
She almost got hit by a car on the road.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then she fell on the ground and started to pull.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The pressure or strong emotional fluctuations may be caused by her.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And I saw her medical record.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
She was taking medicine to control her emotions.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But she stopped taking medicine and didn't get a regular checkup.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This may also affect her condition.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Because she's not having a fever, we...

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll prescribe some medicine to help her control her emotions.

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It'll lower the risk of her fever.

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you, doctor.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Auntie!

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mom, how's dad?

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He just finished his gastrointestinal checkup.

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The doctor said Mr. Lin was right.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Because he's taking some rare medicines.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
They're anti-cancer medicines.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He's having an accident with Chinese medicine.

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You're awake, sister.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Sister.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Sister, where are we?

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is the hospital.

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We're all here. Don't be afraid.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No, I want to go home.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Luo Ying Ying, you need to take this medicine twice a day.

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
One every time.

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let's take it now, okay?

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Sister, listen to the nurse.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No, I want to go home.

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll stay with you tonight, okay?

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You'll stay with me?

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No. You can't stay at home if you don't take your medicine.

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But if you stay here for the night,

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll talk to you on the phone and watch TV with you.

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Really?

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I really thank you.

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know what to do without you.

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Don't say that.

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Your family is the most important.

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But now my sister and my dad are like this.

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I think I can't go to work at the company for the time being.

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't worry about the company.

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now Ying Ying needs your care.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We need to stabilize her mood.

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't let her get sick again.

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When my sister got sick,

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you helped her to drink, right?

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You've been helping her for a long time, right?

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
How did you know?

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You've learned Chinese medicine?

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Actually, I have Chinese medicine qualification.

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But I've been taking it off for a long time.

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But the situation was more urgent.

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I thought you usually read the emperor's inner scriptures.

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And your dad has a clinic.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So you know Chinese medicine.

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So you really have a certificate.

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You really think I'm talking nonsense?

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I just didn't expect you to do business and be a Chinese doctor.

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I want to ask if Chinese medicine's salary is really low?

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I saw it on TV.

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's lower than nurses.

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Forget it.

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But it's a little bit different from western medicine.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No wonder you don't want to be a Chinese doctor.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You have a big business.

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It must be better than your daily business.

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You'll make a lot of money.

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Will you be like those heroes in the martial arts drama?

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You'll be a good student.

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm not like that.

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But when you were giving my sister the wine,

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you were like a god.

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're so cool.

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Teach me some moves.

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Jiajun, it's time to eat.

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm not eating.

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You're going out?

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm going to go. I'm afraid I'll be late.

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Be careful.

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Afraid of being late?

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He's meeting someone?

133
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Flying Dumplings.

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Interesting.

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The dumplings are cute.

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The photographer we hired this time needs to cooperate with the exhibition.

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We'll be in many different exhibitions.

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Even going to overseas exhibitions.

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The photographer has to go to many different places.

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Even do live activities.

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Based on your current situation,

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I think there are a lot of problems in terms of cooperation.

143
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Our company doesn't have this resource for the time being.

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How about this?

145
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
How about changing the shape?

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Flying Dumplings really has a lot of market potential.

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I want to buy this IP.

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
With our design team,

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
if we continue to develop,

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
it will definitely work.

151
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thank you for appreciating me so much.

152
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But I'm sorry.

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I will only cooperate with those who respect the original.

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I won't sell Flying Dumplings no matter how much money I have.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
How is it? What do they think?

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Good.

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're still very knowledgeable.

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're just praising my words.

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're just not satisfied with me.

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It doesn't matter.

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Your family doesn't have money.

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
My cousin bought your grandmother's house.

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He paid so much.

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You don't have to go to work, right?

165
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't lack money.

166
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Not lacking money doesn't mean I have to be trapped at home all day long.

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Lie down at home.

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't want to be a useless person.

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm not talking about you.

170
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No, I understand.

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The so-called useless person is like me.

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I know how to play games at home.

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Then I'm hungry and eat instant noodles.

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I sleep when I'm tired.

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Is this what you call useless?

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Compared to me, I don't think you're useless.

177
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's just that you don't think I'm useless.

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But in the eyes of others,

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm still a useless person.

180
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Do you want to know how useless I am?

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Come with me.

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'd better go get some oil.

183
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Come on.

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Didn't you say that it was for no advantage for you?

185
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is not a conversation mode.

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why do we come here?

187
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's pretty. Did you draw this?

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This painting shows that this girl has been feeling lonely since she was young.

189
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
She thinks that everyone around her won't understand.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But it's good that she has the company of the flying dumplings

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
so that she feels that life is full of hope.

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
She can face life with strength.

193
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This painting is very meaningful.

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It should be seen by more people.

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You can see what's going on here.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you think that someone will really care about this painting?

197
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Actually, this exhibition is not art for them.

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's decoration.

199
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The reason why they left this position to us

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
is because they want to tell us that

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
we have already tolerated you.

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This exhibition also talks about paying attention to mental health.

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Drawing like this

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
is a waste of your work.

205
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I won't tolerate this time.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Can you do it?

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What can't I do? Is this my own painting?

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The man next to you is looking at us.

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So what?

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Give it to me.

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Is this right?

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm leaving.

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm leaving.

214
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why did you take so many painkillers?

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Come.

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Come.

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't stop taking them.

218
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Every time I finish taking them,

219
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
my head hurts a lot.

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I can't tell

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
if it's because my body is inflamed

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
or if the painkiller is working.

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't tell.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can't tell.

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't tell.

226
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
How about I ask my brother to help you?

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Sister, it's a bit busy later.

228
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But don't be afraid.

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Brother, I believe you.

230
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Why are you looking at the needle and going crazy?

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You want to use the needle to needle someone for a long time?

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I finally picked up the needle today

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and helped someone.

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Who is it?

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Is it very serious?

236
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Sister Rachel has a stroke today.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I helped her to get the needle after her condition was stable.

238
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
How is she now?

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I called an ambulance to take her to the hospital.

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
She needs to be hospitalized, but it's okay.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Look at you.

242
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You always carry the needle bag on your back.

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Isn't it just in case

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
to see when it will be useful?

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I understand.

246
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There are many things that are really hard to let go.

247
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There are many things that you can't control.

248
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, you've broken the ring.

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It doesn't matter later, right?

250
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I hurt my back when I moved the goods today.

251
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It hurts a little. Help me to help you.

252
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Come on.

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You're so stupid.

254
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're tired, so you ask others to massage you.

255
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Don't insult my needle.

256
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Speaking of which, why did you buy so many dust skins?

257
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
These are the authentic dust skins of ten years.

258
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I bought them to boil water for my family.

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're being fooled again.

260
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What?

261
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Look at it yourself.

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It doesn't taste like dust.

263
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's a fake.

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What? Is there a fake dust skin?

265
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is the good stuff.

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Smell it first.

267
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Wait a minute.

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm so happy to borrow it and dry it myself.

269
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I can't buy it with the money I have.

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is really delicious.

271
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What's wrong? Are you going to cook it for Nana?

272
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes. She has a bad stomach.

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Nana is a person who has a bad stomach.

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So I'm going to add some two blackberries.

275
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And a few slices of ginger.

276
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Remember to drink hot water.

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The skin is warm and the blackberries are golden.

278
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The ginger is warm and suitable for her.

279
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Boil it on high heat and simmer for ten minutes on low heat.

280
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay, it's done.

281
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You're so petty.

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're so generous this time.

283
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What? It's like eating someone.

284
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What do you mean? I'm just eating her.

285
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm just a dad.

286
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What time do you have a appointment with the guest?

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
One hour left. Don't worry.

288
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You can take your time.

289
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What are you doing here?

290
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I made some orange peel water for you.

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm going to work. I want to see the guests.

292
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's okay. You can take it to see the guests.

293
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Orange peel water is good for your skin.

294
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You must drink it while it's hot.

295
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It can be the most effective.

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Okay, okay, okay. Give it to me.

297
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm leaving.

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll take you to eat something delicious after work.

299
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Bye.

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This middle-aged girl can't stand her.

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
She used this orange peel water to show her affection.

302
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Did she look in the mirror?

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Do you think she can catch up with you?

304
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This low-class old man is really a dog.

305
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He thinks he's embarrassing you.

306
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Don't let him get close to you.

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Otherwise, people will think you have a bad taste.

308
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Are you done?

309
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm done.

310
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm the one who takes care of the dog.

311
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm the one who takes care of everything.

312
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But being my dog is my person.

313
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So you don't have to have so many opinions.

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
A'Zou.

315
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes.

316
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Take me to see the guests.

317
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Okay, get in the car.

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Drink it while it's hot. It's warm.

319
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Thank you.

320
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you like it,

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I can cook it for you every day.

322
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Hello, sir.

323
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hello, sir.

324
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why is the beggar's car here?

325
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What is he doing?

326
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Where is it?

327
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Miss, I want to ask where Mr. Deng is.

328
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't know.

329
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What a coincidence.

330
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Mr. Deng,

331
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
shouldn't you tell me first

332
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
when you bring your friend here?

333
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Young Master Keng,

334
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
your friend is quite rude.

335
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Ignore them.

336
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Forget it.

337
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'd better go.

338
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'll contact you later.

339
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'll have a guest to see the house later.

340
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If you make a mess here

341
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and make the house so messy,

342
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
how can I rent it for you?

343
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why are you so petty?

344
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm not petty.

345
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Since your father gave me the key,

346
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll bring someone to see the house at any time.

347
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You're blocking my work.

348
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's not because I care about you.

349
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You think my dad and your key

350
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
really want to find a tenant?

351
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He's looking for an excuse to see you.

352
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He's really sick.

353
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Hello.

354
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes, Mr. Zhang.

355
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You're here.

356
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yes, I'm in the house.

357
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll pick you up now.

358
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay, bye.

359
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Stop making trouble.

360
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You're not old enough to wear pants.

361
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You've seen it before.

362
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That day we were in the bar.

363
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You saw the photo

364
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
that Nell took for me.

365
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Delete Nell's photo.

366
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Delete Nell's photo.

367
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay.

368
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But the photo is a bit old.

369
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I need to find it.

370
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Give it to me.

371
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But in this world,

372
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
there's not only Nell.

373
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Do you like empty-braided girls?

374
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Do you like backup girls?

375
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Delete it.

376
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Delete it?

377
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Okay.

378
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Delete it yourself.

379
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Give it to me.

380
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I won't give it to you.

381
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Give it to me.

382
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're sick.

383
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Take your time.

384
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Actually, it's really neat here.

385
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The living room in front of you

386
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
is your favorite...

387
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You can sit there.

388
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Don't rain.

389
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Honey, this house is nice.

390
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Mrs. Zhang, I'm glad you like it.

391
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
If you think about it,

392
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
you can call me anytime.

393
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's raining outside.

394
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Do you have an umbrella?

395
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll get you an umbrella.

396
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay, thank you.

397
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You're welcome.

398
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
A-Zhu!

399
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's raining!

400
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What are you doing here?

401
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes, it's raining.

402
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Go inside. I'm looking for something.

403
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What are you looking for?

404
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Come up here.

405
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
There's your photo in the phone of that loser.

406
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Go inside.

407
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Photo?

408
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Leave it.

409
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't care.

410
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I care.

411
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I found it!

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Come up here!

413
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's broken!

414
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Come on!

415
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Look at you!

416
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's broken!

417
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Her phone is broken!

418
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
She can't use it anymore!

419
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You'll get sick if you go inside.

420
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm not sick.

421
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm not sick.

422
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm not sick.

423
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm not sick.

424
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm not sick.

425
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm not sick.

426
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm not sick.

427
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm not sick.

428
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm not sick.

429
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm not sick.

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It should be ready.

431
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
This is wolfberry and mandarin orange soup.

432
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's my family's five-leaf clover.

433
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's good for your health.

434
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's very suitable for your sister.

435
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Thank you.

436
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You're welcome.

437
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Since my dad drank the soup and the Western medicine,

438
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
my mom has been afraid to cook the soup.

439
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But you've been a Chinese doctor.

440
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You can rest assured.

441
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's right.

442
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The soup is medicinal.

443
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Everyone has a different body type.

444
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You should ask the Chinese doctor.

445
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And the Chinese medicine.

446
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You'd better eat it in two hours.

447
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And,

448
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
does your sister still need to take medicine after getting discharged?

449
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes.

450
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Ok.

451
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The patient can be discharged at any time.

452
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But you should take the medicine on time.

453
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That way you can stabilize your mood.

454
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Doctors,

455
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
In fact,

456
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
My sister has taken this medicine for a while.

457
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But after she took it,

458
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
she will feel tired.

459
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
She is very tired all day.

460
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
She is tired even when walking.

461
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I...

462
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Miss Luo,

463
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
If you stop taking medicine,

464
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
the disease will repeat.

465
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We don't suggest you do it.

466
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's better to take the medicine.

467
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I think it's better to use the medicine

468
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
My sister felt much better after you gave her acupuncture

469
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Can you continue to give her acupuncture so she won't need the medicine?

470
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Me?

471
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
No! No!

472
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Sis, I'm here

473
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Don't touch me!

474
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Don't be afraid

475
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Let me see if there's any medicine

476
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yes, I'll get it

477
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Relax, don't be afraid

478
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You're at home now

479
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Your sister and I are here to protect you

480
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Relax

481
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yaoyong!

482
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Sis, don't be afraid

483
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Relax

484
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Ling Weiming and I are here

485
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You're dreaming! It's not true

486
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Don't be afraid

487
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I think it's better

488
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'll get it for you

489
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
My sister often has nightmares when she's asleep

490
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I wish I could have a dark sleep like you

491
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Relax, it's nothing

492
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Don't worry

493
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's late. You should go to bed early

494
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Thank you for the soup. See you at work

495
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Bye

496
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Aunt, Uncle

497
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Mr. Ling, you're here

498
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Dad, you're out of the hospital

499
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yes, I went for a walk and bought some food

500
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Hello, Uncle

501
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hello, Mr. Ling

502
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I can finally see you

503
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You brought Yingchen home?

504
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No, he brought the soup for Sis

505
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
He's a good boss. He even takes care of the soup

506
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Mom, don't talk nonsense

507
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's late. I won't bother you

508
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll have tea with you another day

509
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Bye

510
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Bye

511
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Thank you. Bye

512
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Mr. Ling, come and play

513
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Bye

514
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Ming-di, come in

515
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Mr. Ling is nice, polite and willing to help

516
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He even cares about Sis

517
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
He's a man of the house. He's rare

518
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Don't think too much. He's my boss

519
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm not saying that. I'm just being nice

520
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You should take the initiative

521
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yes, Sis will take care of you more

522
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yes, good night

523
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Wait, I'll get an umbrella

524
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
A-zuo, those two...

525
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Are you going to take a walk?

526
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
No, I'm going to enjoy my life

527
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm worried that I might be too tired

528
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll see you tomorrow

529
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Okay

530
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Xiao-xing, it's very slippery

531
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Thank you

532
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You're welcome

533
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Go inside

534
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Thank you

535
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Have a rest

536
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Call me if you need anything

537
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
No, but...

538
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's okay. Just go inside

539
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm going inside. Bye

540
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,880
I'm fine.

541
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,920
What do you mean you're fine?

542
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,360
You have a fever.

543
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,160
What?

544
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
You can't drive in such a heavy rain.

545
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm fine. I can sit down.

546
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
How can you do that? Listen to me.

547
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,040
Hurry up.

548
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,000
Just put it anywhere.

549
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,560
Okay.

550
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,120
Here.

551
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,080
Be careful.

552
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,840
Be careful.

553
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,560
Be careful.

554
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,120
Okay.

555
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,840
Be careful.

556
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,400
Okay.

557
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,120
Be careful.

558
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,840
Be careful.

559
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,640
Be careful.

560
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,360
Be careful.

561
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,640
Sit down.

562
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,080
How is it? Is it cold?

563
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,840
A little.

564
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,800
It's so hot.

565
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,000
Wipe your body first.

566
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Then I see you with me

567
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,680
The fog lifting lonely when

568
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,320
Come on.

569
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,600
Take the medicine first.

570
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,160
Okay.

571
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,720
Thank you.

572
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,280
If I find myself in trouble

573
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,280
No matter where I am

574
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,240
Take another one.

575
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
You'll feel better after taking it.

576
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,520
I don't need you to take my hand

577
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,320
It's cold.

578
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,200
scolded

579
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,080
A little

580
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,760
How about that?

581
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,080
I want to say

582
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,440
Stop talking.

583
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,080
You're sick.

584
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,560
Hurry up and go to sleep.

585
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,040
I'm so happy with you with me.

586
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,280
You're must be fooled by Yuling.

587
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,880
Actually, Deng Shikeng is just playing with you.

588
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,120
You were really fooled by him.

589
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Actually,

590
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,480
you don't have to do so much for me.

591
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Not much.

592
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,840
I don't think it's enough.

593
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,680
I want to protect you.

594
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,960
I don't want Deng Shikang to continue to bully you.

595
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,880
I'm fine.

596
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,160
The photos have been taken.

597
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,560
If you don't get your phone back,

598
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,000
the photos will be gone.

599
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,720
They're all over the internet.

600
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
Whatever.

601
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,200
I'm so stupid.

602
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,000
Don't underestimate yourself.

603
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,600
You're not stupid.

604
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,440
In my heart,

605
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,600
you're a very good girl.

606
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,160
I'll always protect you.

607
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
I'll always be by your side.

608
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,560
All right.

609
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,000
Go to bed early.

610
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,360
Brother,

611
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
am I not getting better?

612
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,560
Can I stop swimming?

613
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,560
Brother,

614
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,400
why do you look so pale recently?

615
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,960
Is the clinic busy?

616
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,240
The clinic has been closed for a while.

617
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,200
Why?

618
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,560
Because I don't have time to take care of so many patients.

619
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,800
I only have one goal now.

620
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,440
To take care of you.

621
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,400
There's no place to see the doctor.

622
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,040
It's good that you know.

623
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,720
So you have to get well soon.

624
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,880
Inflammatory dyslipidemia

625
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,080
is usually a disease of multiple-signal

626
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Inflammatory dyslipidemia is usually a disease of multiple-signal

627
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,920
dyslipidemia.

628
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,360
Because of this,

629
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,800
the patient's lungs will be severely contaminated.

630
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,960
This will lead to blood loss and organ failure.

631
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,040
You wanted to take care of your sister

632
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,920
in the hospital.

633
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,360
But why don't you start over

634
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,680
and close the clinic?

635
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,400
You can't even cure your sister.

636
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,800
What's the point of opening a clinic?

637
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,000
Why are you looking so weak?

638
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,160
You're here at this hour?

639
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,920
It's rare that my parents are back home.

640
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,800
They can take care of my sister.

641
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,520
So I came out to practice archery.

642
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,280
You don't have to worry about me.

643
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,760
I can follow what you taught me that day.

644
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,600
I'll try it.

645
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,280
I'm free. I'll pay you.

646
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,000
You told me that the most important thing in archery is your breath.

647
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,600
You must breathe deeply.

648
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,040
You're in a hurry to shoot the second arrow

649
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,680
before you can adjust your breathing.

650
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,960
You can't shoot it.

651
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
I didn't expect you to say that about me.

652
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,080
Yes, I have a guilty conscience.

653
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,320
I can't do it right.

654
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
Don't learn from me.

655
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
You do it.

656
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
I'll do it.

657
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
You're a good boy.

658
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
You're a good boy.

659
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
You're a good boy.

660
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
You're a good boy.

661
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
You're a good boy.

662
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,320
You're a good boy.

663
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,320
You're a good boy.

664
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
Remember,

665
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,320
hold your feet and ears.

666
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,720
You should only attack with your hands.

667
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,720
You should only attack with your hands.

668
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,720
You can shoot after you're stable.

669
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,720
Actually, I'm not qualified to say that.

670
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,320
It's not easy to be calm.

671
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,320
That's the world.

672
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,720
I envy you. You envy me.

673
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
I have a hard time.

674
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,720
You can let go of everything else.

675
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
But your family,

676
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
no matter how much pressure you have,

677
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
you can't just let go.

678
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,720
Because they're my closest relatives.

679
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
I can't get rid of them.

680
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,720
There's a bitter and sweet side to it.

681
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
It's you.

682
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
Come and sit down.

683
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
You're hurt.

684
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
You want to call an ambulance?

685
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
I'll call it.

686
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Don't call it.

687
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
I can't go to the hospital.

688
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Please help me.

689
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
Help me get the emergency kit.

690
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,720
Your knife is injured.

691
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,720
But it's good that it's not internal injury.

692
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
I'll go get you a drink.

693
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
I finally helped you stop bleeding.

694
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720
You're so bruised.

695
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
It's not a heart injury or an old injury.

696
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
I told you many times to be careful of your back.

697
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
Your spine is protruding.

698
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
When you touch it,

699
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
it's the third and fourth vertebrae

700
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
that are pressed into the bone nerves.

701
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
You need to go to the hospital for a check-up.

702
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
You're walking in the martial arts world.

703
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
It's either you hit me or I hit you.

704
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
You can't go on like this.

705
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
When I was in the KMT,

706
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720
I was so poor that I couldn't even eat.

707
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,720
I could only go to college.

708
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
If I don't fight in Hong Kong,

709
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
what else can I do?

710
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,720
So you're the leader of the KMT.

711
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,720
But you don't have to sell your life to them.

712
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
You're trying to make money to fight for your life.

713
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
No one is blaming you.

714
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
But you only have one life.

715
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
How many times can you fight?

716
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,720
Survival is not the only way.

717
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,720
People are in the martial arts world.

718
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
There's no hurry.

719
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
I only believe in what people do.

720
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,720
But I won't force you.

721
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
Don't walk around today.

722
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Stay here and rest.

723
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,720
We'll talk about tomorrow.

724
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
There's a good thing about riding a bike.

725
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
It's raining without an umbrella.

726
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
You don't have to wait for me.

727
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
You should go back.

728
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,720
That bear is badly injured.

729
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,720
I'll wait for you in the car.

730
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
I'll leave when you get in the car.

731
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
When I saw you helping Zhixiong,

732
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,720
I really thought you were a real Chinese doctor.

733
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Why do you say that?

734
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
I came to see you.

735
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,720
When I saw you reading the Chinese medicine certificate,

736
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,720
I felt a little bit of longing in your eyes.

737
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,720
You bought this house to fulfill your father's wish.

738
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,720
But your father's wish is to open a clinic here.

739
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,720
But why don't you take one more step and open a clinic yourself?

740
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,720
I'm busy with the medicine and oil business.

741
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
You're busy.

742
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,720
You won't shoot arrows here every day.

743
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
The car is here.

744
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Be careful there.

745
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Be careful.

746
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,720
You're a very good girl in my heart.

747
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,720
You're a very good guy.

748
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,720
I like you too.

749
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
I like you too.

750
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,720
You're awake.

751
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,720
Yes.

752
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,720
You have a fever.

753
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
Take the medicine first.

754
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
No need to eat.

755
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,720
You won't die from the rain.

756
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
By the way, Anan, yesterday we...

757
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Yesterday, you were snoring so much that I almost couldn't sleep.

758
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
But you're sick, so I won't scold you.

759
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Take it.

760
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,720
By the way, you have a fever.

761
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,720
So I'll drive your car and send you back.

762
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Okay?

763
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
One more.

764
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Okay.

765
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
Hurry up and eat.

766
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Okay.

767
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,720
This is our pulse-tube.

768
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
It contains Chinese medicine.

769
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,720
It can help to relieve pain and relax muscles.

770
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Thank you.

771
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,720
The pulse-tube can only help you relieve symptoms temporarily.

772
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,720
The protruding part of the shoulder is a structural damage.

773
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
You need to be treated formally.

774
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,720
I'll listen to you and go to the hospital for a shoot.

775
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
I'll tell you again.

776
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,720
You can't keep your waist like this.

777
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,720
It won't be easy to get hurt again.

778
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Anyway, thank you so much.

779
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Doctor Ling...

780
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
I'm sorry.

781
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
I'm sorry.

782
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
I'm sorry.

783
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
I'm sorry.

784
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
I'm sorry.

785
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
I'm sorry.

786
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
I'm sorry.

787
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
I'm sorry.

788
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
I'm sorry.

789
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
I'm sorry.

790
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
I'm sorry.

791
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
I'm sorry.

792
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
I'm sorry.

793
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,720
I'm sorry.

794
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
I'm sorry.

795
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
I'm sorry.

796
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
I'm sorry.

797
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
I'm sorry.

798
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
I'm sorry.

799
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
I'm sorry.

800
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
I'm sorry.

801
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
I'm sorry.

802
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
I'm sorry.

803
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
I'm sorry.

804
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
I'm sorry.

805
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
I'm sorry.

806
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
I'm sorry.

807
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
I'm sorry.

808
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
I'm sorry.

809
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
I'm sorry.

810
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,720
I'm sorry.

811
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
I'm sorry.

812
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
I'm sorry.

813
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
I'm sorry.

814
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
I'm sorry.

815
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,720
I'm sorry.

816
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
I'm sorry.

817
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Please let me see it before.

818
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
I won't stop you from seeing it.

819
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
I will let you see it.

820
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Who gives you the right to believe that it's all my fault?

821
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
You think I'm a fool?

822
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,720
What are you afraid of?

823
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Don't lie.

824
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Don't you think it's too zou?

825
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,720
Who told you to make no mistakes?

826
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Who told you...

827
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Stop it.

828
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,160
Is there something on your mind?

829
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,040
Mom,

830
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
I'm often asked to reopen the clinic

831
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,240
and become a doctor.

832
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,800
It's like I hear a voice

833
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,840
saying that you've had enough rest,

834
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,920
and you should wear white clothes and get acupuncture.

835
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,760
It's a sign of your success.

836
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,800
Many patients are waiting for you outside.

837
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,920
So many years have passed since I got the job.

838
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,560
I can't get past this.

839
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm afraid

840
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,800
that the result will be the same.

841
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,200
Although I gave them hope,

842
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,640
in the end,

843
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,480
I let them down.

844
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,120
I'm sorry.

845
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,760
Where have you been all night?

846
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
I didn't answer your call.

847
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,480
Ming, we bought breakfast.

848
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,080
We bought yours.

849
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,600
Sit down.

850
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,400
Okay, thank you.

851
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,880
Brother, I'm a hero.

852
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,760
I was so busy yesterday

853
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,520
that I helped Ned find his phone.

854
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,400
I even successfully escorted him home.

855
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,920
But he had a fever

856
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,520
when he was in the rain.

857
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,600
A fever?

858
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,920
He had a high fever.

859
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,640
So I didn't let him drive back.

860
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,720
Yes.

861
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,920
Then Nana asked me to stay at his house for the night.

862
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,640
Then she helped me to wipe my body on the bed.

863
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,800
She even helped me to sweat.

864
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,080
So I feel much better.

865
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,880
How did she help you to sweat?

866
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,080
There are many ways to sweat.

867
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,720
I'm not Mudan.

868
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
What is Mudan?

869
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,840
Mudan means

870
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,320
a man who has never been in love,

871
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,520
or met a girl,

872
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,600
or a man who has never been in love.

873
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,640
So you and her are already...

874
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,440
that kind of men.

875
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,360
What's wrong?

876
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,240
What are you talking about?

877
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,960
Why are you laughing?

878
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,560
Nothing.

879
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,040
Nothing.

880
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,320
Besides, a boy

881
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,080
is a wonderful journey

882
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,440
for a man.

883
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,600
Then we can get chola for sure.

884
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,880
Okay.

885
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,360
All right, wait a moment, please.

886
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,440
Don't laugh so loudly.

887
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,240
I was lucky.

888
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,720
You did a great job.

889
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,000
Don't look at me.

890
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,600
You...

891
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,200
Ali, what happened?

892
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,040
Are you not feeling much?

893
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,040
It seems to be torn at the top.

894
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
What about the belly?

895
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
Try pressing it to see if it hurts.

896
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
It's a little uncomfortable.

897
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Is the menstrual cycle accurate?

898
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
Is it more or less?

899
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
What color is it?

900
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
And then is there any blood?

901
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,040
I usually come to the menstrual cycle

902
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
which is not accurate and will be delayed.

903
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,040
The color is dark red.

904
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,040
It's a little less and there's blood.

905
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
And I will feel pain.

906
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
Can you stick out your tongue and show me?

907
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
Your tongue is dark purple.

908
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
And there's a fishbone on the side of the tongue.

909
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,040
It should be the blood circulation and blood pressure.

910
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
The blood flow is not clear.

911
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,040
And the meridians are involved in your skin.

912
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
And the problem of the lower jaw

913
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,040
makes your upper abdomen uncomfortable.

914
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,040
Then what is the lower jaw?

915
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,040
It's your uterus and the lower jaw.

916
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,040
I would suggest you go to the doctor

917
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
to do a detailed re-examination.

918
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,040
I made you some water.

919
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,040
What's wrong?

920
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,040
It's stomach pain.

921
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
Then don't eat breakfast.

922
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,040
You drink this water

923
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,040
and go home and have a good rest.

924
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
Thank you.

925
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
I hope you remember my suggestion.

926
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
Don't worry, I understand.

927
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,040
Thank you, A Min.

928
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,040
Stop laughing.

929
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,040
People may think you have a bad brain

930
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,040
or you are possessed.

931
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,040
No, brother.

932
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,040
I remember that I was very weak

933
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,040
when I was with Ned.

934
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Don't you know that?

935
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,040
I was very confused yesterday.

936
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,040
I said some mean words.

937
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,040
I hugged him.

938
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,040
But I must have been wearing his clothes

939
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,040
when I woke up this morning.

940
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,040
Then you should ask him clearly.

941
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
Of course not.

942
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
If I ask him,

943
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
he will think I pretend not to remember

944
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
and I don't want to be responsible.

945
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,040
Brother, should I be responsible?

946
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
Of course you should be responsible.

947
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
You should be nice to him.

948
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
Of course I will.

949
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
I only have Ned in my heart.

950
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,040
I will be responsible.

951
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
The reason why the shoulder is protruding

952
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
is often an accident.

953
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,040
Or it is affected by long-term sitting.

954
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,040
In addition to back pain,

955
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,040
it will also affect the width,

956
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:06,560
knee joints and the

957
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
shoulder muscles.

958
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
Left hand, press the table to balance.

959
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
Right hand, hold the left foot.

960
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,560
Left and right, open the bow and stretch back.

961
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,560
Then you can stretch the spine

962
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,560
and push it to the side.

963
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,560
Let's go.
