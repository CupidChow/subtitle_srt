1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now he's bullying Shang Wen.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I can't help but fight back.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You have to do something extraordinary.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want you to help me.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
These three million is yours.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I think your money is dirty.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Did I get cancer?

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
My chest started to hurt last night.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There's still a piece of it.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Calm down.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What you need most now is rest.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No matter what happens,

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll face it with you.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The city people are busy.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They often lack exercise.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Today I'll teach you a simple move.

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's called the sword fall.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You can practice it easily.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's very effective.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is called sword basin.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The mouth is cold,

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the shoulders are cold, the muscles are thin.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The foot is hanging, the abdomen is cut.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This move can strengthen the blood circulation of the abdomen.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It helps the psoas muscle.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It also helps the pulmonary psoas muscle.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is called the sword brain.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The city people are stressed.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
They are not flexible.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You need to massage with a rolling pin.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The pain is on the fascia.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The pain is on the fascia.

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The pressure is on the fascia.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sorry.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Are you filming a sword fall tutorial today?

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Remember to sell our new series.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Remember to give us your suggestions.

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
When you edit the video,

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you'd better add subtitles.

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you receive any news,

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
please reply to me.

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Call me anytime.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Focus on your doctor.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Inform me if you get any news.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't make any more troubles.

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why is it so bad?

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What should I do?

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's only the second episode.

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The doctor said it's not spread.

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Just remove the psoas muscle.

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You have a psoas muscle.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You need to remove the psoas muscle.

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No.

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Luo Yingchen.

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Luo Yingchen.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Is Luo Yingchen here?

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes.

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You can go in and see the doctor.

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Dinner is ready.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Dinner is ready.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Fried chicken.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Fried chicken.

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Fried rice cake,

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
fried rice,

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
fried pancakes,

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and anything else.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why do you suddenly invite us to dinner?

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I had something to do this morning.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I didn't come to work.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I invited you to dinner.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Why did you come back?

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I came back to help you.

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Where's the report?

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why did you buy wine?

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The company told us not to drink.

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This bottle of wine is very good with the psoas muscle.

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Boss, let's drink.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's drink.

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're the best.

110
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's go.

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You don't eat fried food.

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why are you so hungry today?

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm lucky.

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll eat more when I can.

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You bought so many beautiful clothes.

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And they're all brand goods.

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You've made six money recently.

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Really?

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You should reward yourself.

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You can't keep money.

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I agree.

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a reward.

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Rachel, come with me.

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I need to talk to you.

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you think

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Boss is different from Rachel?

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You just found out.

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I knew it.

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Are we going to call her boss's mother?

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Even Boss

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
doesn't need to be single anymore.

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's your turn, Zuge.

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Eat, single dog.

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm telling you.

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you doing?

136
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Tell me the truth.

137
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Are you having a bad luck?

138
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What's the date?

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What? I'm fine.

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't lie to me.

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You bought so many things.

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You look so drunk.

143
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're saying goodbye to the world.

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're mistaken.

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm fine.

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm fine.

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's why I'm celebrating.

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Here's the report.

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's not a bad luck.

150
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's fine.

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But the report says you have an increase in breast cancer.

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
From a Chinese doctor's point of view,

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
it's called breast cancer.

154
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's very unlikely

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
that it will develop into an unusual increase.

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's a risk of cancer.

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You can't ignore it.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If a person has a breast,

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
he must have breast cancer.

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's normal to have breast cancer.

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The doctor also said

162
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
many girls have it.

163
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You're just a little bit timid.

164
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're just a little bit timid.

165
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not a little bit timid.

166
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm just a little bit timid.

167
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I just took a breath.

168
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why do you have to say that?

169
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Western doctors usually treat patients when they have problems.

170
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But Chinese doctors emphasize that it's not necessarily.

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I hope you don't take it lightly.

172
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Go to the doctor's early.

173
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm not scaring you.

174
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I actually want to help you.

175
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Open Chinese medicine.

176
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It can nourish the blood.

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And then, with acupuncture.

178
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It will be easier to adjust your internal secret.

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Acupuncture?

180
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Where to acupuncture?

181
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Your sister is not afraid.

182
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You're not afraid, are you?

183
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Pain in the fascia.

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Head tight fascia pain pressure.

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Sister, you have to study hard.

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Help me press it at home.

187
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay.

188
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can teach dad to use a sword and a gun.

189
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You often have a headache, a footache, and a whole body hurts.

190
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You should let Lin Wei Min drink.

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He often says that treatment is not disease.

192
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Even if there is no disease, it should be treated.

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

194
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My waist was also treated by Brother Ming.

195
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Drink and push.

196
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Now you can move.

197
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can even hit two times at any time.

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Still want to fight?

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If you hurt your waist again, I won't treat you.

200
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Just kidding.

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I've washed my hands and left the martial arts world.

202
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Grandma Ju, Jiaxun is so good to accompany you today.

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Where is Jingzhi?

204
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
She is still working.

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I have time, so I accompanied Grandma Ju.

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Grandma Ju, you look very energetic and you are very steady.

207
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes, it's really much better.

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The acupuncture helped you to clear your dark circles.

209
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I will adjust your recovery progress.

210
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Adjust acupuncture, acupoint and treatment.

211
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So you can move more freely.

212
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Help Grandma Ju prepare for the re-診 and medicine.

213
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay.

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Grandma Ju, sit here and wait for a while.

215
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you.

216
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're welcome.

217
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can come up.

218
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Bye, sister.

219
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You're okay now.

220
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's your turn.

221
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Me too?

222
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I told you before.

223
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The disease is like a light Chinese medicine.

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The acupuncture can't be treated lightly.

225
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Acupuncture will help you.

226
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What is acupuncture?

227
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's a combination of the two.

228
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's like a soft toy.

229
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It doesn't hurt.

230
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It doesn't cause a fever.

231
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The skin color doesn't change.

232
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The harmony is like a happy mood.

233
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is called acupuncture.

234
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Stop talking.

235
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sister, it's okay.

236
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The doctor said many girls will have acupuncture.

237
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm a girl.

238
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't have...

239
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Lin Weiming is good at acupuncture.

240
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can let Lin Weiming treat you.

241
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then...

242
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
If you want acupuncture, where will you put it?

243
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Normally, we will put it in the middle of the chest.

244
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There are three acupuncture points.

245
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's the acupuncture point, the root of the breast and the seven gates.

246
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Then...

247
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No bra?

248
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

249
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't have a bra.

250
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't worry.

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The secret acupuncture point doesn't need to be revealed.

252
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We only focus on the middle of the breast and the bottom.

253
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The secret acupuncture point can be covered with cloth.

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You just need to show the skin of the acupuncture point.

255
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let me think about it first.

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm not cold today.

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
In fact, Chinese medicine is the same as Western medicine.

258
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
From diagnosis to treatment,

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
it will involve sensitive parts.

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The operation we are used to

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
will make a female nurse be present.

262
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If you feel uncomfortable,

263
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
you can call a female friend.

264
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm a female friend.

265
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I can take you here.

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Think about it.

267
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This is Hazel.

268
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
She is the PR manager of Lian Suo Dumpling Shop.

269
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
She came to talk about the joint plan with us.

270
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This is the author of Flying Sky Dumpling, Zhou Jingzhi.

271
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And her agent, Mo Jiajun.

272
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hello, Mr. Mo.

273
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hello, Miss Zhou.

274
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hello.

275
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I personally like Flying Sky Dumpling.

276
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I just bought the painting you just published.

277
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you for your support.

278
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm not only

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
seeing the popularity of Flying Sky Dumpling.

280
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I think it's really suitable for

281
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
our Dumpling Department's young and energetic image.

282
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So I want to cooperate with you.

283
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Please do the role of Dumpling Department.

284
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Thank you for appreciating my dumplings so much.

285
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Actually, I like dumplings.

286
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If my Flying Sky Dumpling

287
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
can cooperate with Dumpling Shop,

288
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
it will be perfect.

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't know what specific cooperation plan you have at the beginning.

290
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If it's okay,

291
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
we plan to launch the limited set of

292
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Flying Sky Dumpling's theme in the next three months.

293
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
At that time, the branch of the county

294
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
will post the poster of Flying Sky Dumpling.

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And

296
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
our油麻地 branch will open in a few days.

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I also want to invite you to attend the event.

298
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
At that time,

299
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
please announce the event.

300
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I will go.

301
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But I actually haven't attended

302
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
such an open event.

303
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I think you should attend it.

304
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You should thank your fans in person.

305
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes, you don't have to worry.

306
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I will be there.

307
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I will arrange everything.

308
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
On the day of our plan,

309
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
we will send the T-shirt of Flying Sky Dumpling

310
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and the key of Flying Sky Dumpling to the guests.

311
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And you just need to

312
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
sign and take photos there.

313
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's all.

314
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Well,

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Jia Jun,

316
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't want to hide anymore.

317
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If I go to see my fans,

318
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I will thank them for their support.

319
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Is it okay?

320
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay.

321
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Really?

322
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's good.

323
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
At that time,

324
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
you can stand beside me and help me to pay the bill.

325
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay.

326
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay, your fans are happy.

327
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Why are you so angry?

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You usually have nothing to be embarrassed about.

329
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Stop it.

330
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You are bleeding.

331
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why is your vision serious?

332
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You should see a doctor.

333
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What doctor?

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Look.

335
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's the same.

336
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Enough. Don't bother me.

337
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Get out.

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I beg you.

339
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Get out.

340
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Sorry.

341
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I really don't have time

342
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
for the opening of the dumpling shop tomorrow.

343
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I have to go to the office.

344
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I have to go to the office.

345
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I have to go to the office.

346
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I have to go to the office.

347
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I have to go to the office.

348
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You don't have time.

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What is more important than me?

350
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Leave it.

351
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I really don't have time.

352
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm leaving.

353
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why don't you answer my call?

354
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Jingzhi said that there would be a special dumpling.

355
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If I have to deliver it, I'll be the first one to get it.

356
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You silly girl.

357
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Even if you are the last one to get it,

358
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Jingzhi will still give it to you.

359
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No.

360
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Everyone has to line up.

361
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I have to line up too.

362
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's what I call support.

363
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I have to get it.

364
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I have to get it.

365
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I have to get it.

366
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I have to get it.

367
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I have to get it.

368
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's what support is.

369
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Jingzhi,

370
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll go to find Lin Weiming with you after I deliver the dumplings.

371
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Why do you want to find Lin Weiming?

372
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I want to find her for real wine.

373
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
She asked you to find a female friend to accompany you.

374
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm your female friend.

375
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Why do you want real wine?

376
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Are you not feeling well?

377
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes.

378
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Jingzhi, she has...

379
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm allergic to milk and protein.

380
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So I asked Lin Weiming to make real wine to cure it.

381
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Is it good?

382
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
No.

383
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Don't you like the dress I bought?

384
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Come here. I'll show you.

385
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why did you lie?

386
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's wrong to lie to your parents.

387
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I don't want your parents to worry.

388
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This is called a good lie.

389
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You don't have to lie when you're cured.

390
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You don't understand.

391
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I understand.

392
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm afraid of pain and I'm afraid of real wine.

393
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You're strong now.

394
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You're not afraid of real wine.

395
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Lin Weiming is strong in real wine.

396
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I know.

397
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But I'm also shy.

398
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I haven't prepared myself yet.

399
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't tell your parents about it.

400
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
They might get angry.

401
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay.

402
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Promise me you won't lie.

403
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay.

404
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I promise you.

405
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This wine is good, mind your words.

406
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Die a simple life like a poor man.

407
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
A sad man should be satisfied with life.

408
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Isn't there something you like about normal people?

409
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
SuChuan, can you tell us something about yourself?

410
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
SuChuan.

411
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Can I offer you a little advice?

412
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Fine.

413
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Everyone can have something to eat with heaven.

414
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let people outside get what they want.

415
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Tell me what you want.

416
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I want to see Awesome What You Want.

417
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Jingzhi.

418
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,400
Jingzhi.

419
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,600
You're here so early.

420
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,400
Yes, I'm very excited.

421
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,000
You asked me to go out so early.

422
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,800
I'm your number one fan.

423
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,000
I want to be the first one to get your autograph and T-shirt.

424
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,200
Thank you for your support.

425
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,100
Sit down and eat something first.

426
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
I'll treat you today. If you're not enough, order more.

427
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,400
We'll sit over there and wait for you.

428
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay.

429
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,400
Good luck.

430
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,400
Hello, everyone.

431
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,600
Thank you for coming today.

432
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,800
Jia Jun, I'm here.

433
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
There are a lot of people here,

434
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,200
but I still got my autographed T-shirt.

435
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,400
I saw it.

436
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Why don't I try walking around

437
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,000
and see what's going on at the scene?

438
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No problem.

439
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Jingzhi is signing here.

440
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,200
There's still a little time. Do you have any fans who want to ask questions?

441
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
Flying Tian Dumplings has so many friends.

442
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,000
Are they using your friends to make the prototype?

443
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,800
That's right. You're right.

444
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Actually, they are all important people in my life.

445
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,800
So I want to take this opportunity to thank them.

446
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,200
First, I want to thank my grandma.

447
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Then, my boss, Mr. Wang,

448
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
and all the fans who support me.

449
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,400
I hope you can be with Flying Tian Dumplings.

450
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,400
It's okay. You can continue watching.

451
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,400
Cousin, I want to ask how my autopsy is going.

452
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,200
The disease of autopsy is to treat the body as a medicine.

453
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,600
But the patient's condition is still very severe.

454
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,400
The disease can be repeated.

455
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
It will also develop rapidly.

456
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
The first thing is to relieve the disease.

457
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,600
It's just a medicine.

458
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,200
Once it's stable,

459
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,600
we will use the manual to treat it.

460
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Does this mean I've been so unbearable lately?

461
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,800
Actually, you don't have to hide from Jingzhi.

462
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,600
You've paid so much for her.

463
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,600
If there's anything she's happy about, she wants to share it with you.

464
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,800
When it comes to happiness, you have to be full of energy and energy.

465
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,400
Be patient.

466
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
If you're in a bad mood, your skin will get better.

467
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,400
Here, this three-yellow cream can help you relieve your disease.

468
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,200
Why are you here?

469
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
I saw you and Ying Ying's video.

470
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Can you see it clearly?

471
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,600
Ying Ying.

472
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,000
Since you've let Ying Ying show you,

473
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,200
why can't you come and accompany me personally?

474
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,400
It's not like that. Actually, I really want to go.

475
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:59,220
But my

476
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
I'm sorry.

477
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm sorry.

478
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
I'm sorry.

479
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
I'm sorry.

480
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
I'm sorry.

481
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I'm sorry.

482
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm sorry.

483
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
I'm sorry.

484
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
I'm sorry.

485
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
I'm sorry.

486
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
I'm sorry.

487
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
I'm sorry.

488
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
I'm sorry.

489
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I'm sorry.

490
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,600
He's drunk again.

491
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
He's drunk again.

492
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,920
You ancient people,

493
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,640
Why are you drunk?

494
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,680
What's the time?

495
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,440
Enough. Don't go too far.

496
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,920
Little girl, we're helping you.

497
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,400
This is a black shop.

498
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
Hey, what are you filming?

499
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,120
We're taking photos.

500
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,520
We're helping you, you know?

501
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,440
Let's take photos together.

502
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,640
My grandpa is here.

503
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,760
We're helping you to maintain justice.

504
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,840
What are you filming?

505
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,120
Don't film.

506
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,560
What are you doing? Go away.

507
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,920
What are you doing? This is a clinic.

508
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,280
Don't do anything.

509
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,800
This is a public place, right?

510
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,360
If you don't understand, don't show your face.

511
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,520
You don't understand.

512
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,680
Under the building is a private place of the property.

513
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,960
I'm representing the clinic now.

514
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,920
I'm telling you to leave.

515
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,880
Don't do anything. Leave.

516
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,600
Call the police.

517
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm calling the police now. I'm afraid of you.

518
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,240
Or I'll call the police.

519
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,360
If you want to make trouble, just come to me.

520
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,960
Don't get innocent people involved.

521
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,280
You again.

522
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,240
I'm not playing with you today.

523
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,240
I'll come here every day from tomorrow.

524
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,960
I'll smash the factory.

525
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,480
As long as someone dares to enter this clinic,

526
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,760
you must take care of him.

527
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,480
Okay.

528
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,240
I'll see how you do business.

529
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,920
Go.

530
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,680
How are you? Are you okay?

531
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,360
I'm fine.

532
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,840
You beat Wei Ye and his men so hard.

533
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,760
They dare to make trouble again.

534
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,080
Aren't we too cruel?

535
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,240
Don't beat and kill every day.

536
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,440
They are the side door.

537
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,080
But we are the right industry.

538
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,680
We can call the police if we want.

539
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,400
I know Wei Ye.

540
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,280
They really come to smash the factory every day.

541
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm really afraid that he'll affect the patients here.

542
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,800
His target is always me.

543
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,080
I'd better not stay here.

544
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,680
Listen to me.

545
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,480
Sit down first.

546
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,680
We can't give in to the evil forces.

547
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,400
Otherwise, they will be as stubborn as they can.

548
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,160
You're right.

549
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,840
They are all scammers.

550
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,200
As long as we don't back down,

551
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,880
he can't even deal with me, the girl.

552
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,600
You are too bold this time.

553
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,680
I'm afraid they will seek revenge.

554
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,960
If you're okay,

555
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,520
you'd better not come here recently.

556
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,040
You just said you don't have to be afraid.

557
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,120
Don't back down.

558
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm not afraid.

559
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,160
But I'm afraid that it will affect you.

560
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,400
What are you afraid of?

561
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,640
You and Zhixiong are both powerful.

562
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,400
You can be the witness.

563
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,680
Don't be afraid.

564
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,120
Then please keep an eye on my stock.

565
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,680
Thank you.

566
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,440
Brother, do you have time to talk?

567
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,720
Come in.

568
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,200
What's up?

569
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,480
Oh, a few days ago,

570
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,600
I received a letter from a private financial company.

571
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,360
It's a bank loan.

572
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,480
It turns out that KEN

573
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,240
used the company's name as a mortgage.

574
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,840
But after checking all the accounts,

575
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,760
I don't know where he used the money.

576
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,600
Do you have any clue?

577
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,400
Why do you ask so much?

578
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,440
You can just be an accountant and settle the accounts.

579
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,600
My son invests in the company.

580
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,080
Do I need to report to you?

581
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,800
But so much money is about the company.

582
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,520
I told you not to ask.

583
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,560
I'll ask him when I have time.

584
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,440
I'm in a hurry to have a meeting.

585
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,120
You go out first.

586
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Prade, if you want to give me something,

587
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,360
I'll take it.

588
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,440
Don't Mari Garden.

589
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,760
Why do you care about the trade secret?

590
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,360
merchants

591
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,280
There is no other place to Put마� gin

592
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,880
to sale according to my wish.

593
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,080
So there is a floor.

594
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,520
I'll think about it if I have a chance.

595
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Cheers

596
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Son, who was that?

597
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,520
The murderer seems to be a blacksmith

598
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
What are you going to do?

599
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
My friend

600
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
What's wrong?

601
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
Don't do too much

602
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Xia just came to me

603
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
She said she found out

604
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,520
You use the company's mansion to do the mortgage

605
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,520
You be careful

606
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Otherwise, it's easy to happen

607
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
What are you doing?

608
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,520
I'm so afraid to be asked

609
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
Do you know

610
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Our 11424 has grown to 120

611
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,520
We filled the pit and even have money to make

612
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
I know

613
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Fortunately, it has grown back

614
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,520
A while ago, that father made me panic

615
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
My agent told me

616
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Now Zhao Ming is making money

617
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
But I think you should not work too hard

618
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,520
You should just take it

619
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
What do you mean?

620
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
The previous father

621
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,520
My friend Zhuang's friend

622
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,520
He made a special deposit and left the house

623
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Otherwise, how could we buy it cheaply?

624
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
I received the news

625
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,520
The stock will rise again

626
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
So we are going to add more

627
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
Not withdraw

628
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
Are you sure?

629
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,520
I'm not familiar with the stock

630
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
It's better to use the company's assets

631
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Don't work too hard

632
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
If you don't have the courage, don't learn to play with stocks

633
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,520
If you want to make a lot of money, you have to live alone

634
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
I have to make money

635
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,520
To buy half of my aunt's shares

636
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
After buying

637
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,520
I will put the commission on the board

638
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,520
I don't know if I'm getting old

639
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,520
I'm getting out of my mind

640
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,520
I forgot to put salt in the soup yesterday

641
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,520
I forgot to take my phone this morning

642
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Thanks to Dalia

643
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
She found out

644
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,520
She took my phone and gave it to me

645
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
I'm old

646
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
I can't live without it

647
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Sister

648
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,520
Have you thought about your future plans?

649
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
You have so many employees and shares

650
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
They are important assets

651
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Have you thought about arranging it earlier?

652
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
I heard you say that

653
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Is there any problem with the company?

654
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
No

655
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
But recently

656
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
The company's accounts are a little messy

657
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
I don't know how to get into the account

658
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,520
I know that Atu and his father are doing things

659
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
I know it too

660
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,520
This company is my husband's hard work

661
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
I don't want him to be in a mess

662
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,520
My shares will be given to A Min sooner or later

663
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,520
It's right to arrange it earlier

664
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
If you need a lawyer, find me

665
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
I know someone

666
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Okay

667
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,520
You are taking painkillers?

668
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,520
Does your head hurt?

669
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Yes, I'm under a lot of pressure recently

670
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,520
So my head hurts frequently

671
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
Sometimes I get dizzy

672
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
It's not good to sleep

673
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
If A Min sees it

674
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
He will definitely nag you

675
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,520
He specifically prevents people from taking painkillers

676
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,520
Try this

677
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,520
It's a little bit sticky

678
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
Newly released

679
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,520
After applying it

680
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
It's not so sticky

681
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
It's very light

682
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,520
And it's effective for pain

683
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
Try it

684
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Thank you

685
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Sister, you are great

686
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
A Min is so great

687
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Miss, let's do it according to your draft

688
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
I'll show you after I finish the final version

689
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
Thank you

690
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
Thank you, Miss

691
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,520
We'll go back to work

692
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
T-shirt

693
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
T-shirt

694
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,520
月 Sebum

695
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Don't worry

696
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,520
It was her

697
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Sister

698
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
Hey, Pei!

699
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Are you crazy?

700
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,960
to do other people's business.

701
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,560
I paid you, not Deng Shuhuan.

702
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,520
I'm sorry.

703
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,000
Mai Maitong has taken away many of our business.

704
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,320
My son is under great pressure now.

705
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,840
You can't help him,

706
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,320
but you're doing other people's business.

707
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,280
Are you in pain here?

708
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,680
Or here?

709
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,080
I'm sorry.

710
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,360
Or you're out of your mind?

711
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,120
I'm sorry.

712
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,720
I didn't mean to.

713
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,360
Right?

714
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,560
I didn't mean to.

715
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,000
Why are you pushing A'xiang?

716
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,840
Stop it.

717
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,920
Why are you pushing her?

718
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,360
Listen,

719
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,800
you can't even take care of your sister.

720
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,800
Listen,

721
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,400
don't push other people's business.

722
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,200
Stop it.

723
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,240
There are many people out there.

724
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,040
Deng Litu,

725
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,480
you can't even take care of your sister.

726
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,600
You should check it.

727
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,160
There are many people passing by.

728
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,280
They can't see you well, right?

729
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,440
I want to say it out loud.

730
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,760
I want everyone to know

731
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,200
that you're doing nothing.

732
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,720
She's pushing other people's business today.

733
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,120
She'll be standing over there tomorrow.

734
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,000
You're a fool.

735
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,600
You're out of breath so soon?

736
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,880
I'm not.

737
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,800
I'm not out of breath.

738
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,440
I'm just thinking

739
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,920
how to break your bad moves.

740
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,480
Why are you so interested in

741
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,720
practicing stick with me today?

742
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
With you here,

743
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,520
I should practice my skills.

744
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,160
How can I know when they'll come to seek revenge?

745
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,640
You know that

746
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,440
their bad moves are much dirtier than yours.

747
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,640
I'm sorry.

748
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,920
I know I'm troublesome.

749
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,320
Forget it.

750
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,320
Keep practicing.

751
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,040
You should rest at 9 o'clock.

752
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,160
You're sweating all over.

753
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,120
You should practice more than your head.

754
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,240
What? A little sweat?

755
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,520
Haven't you heard that

756
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,680
when a person is unhappy,

757
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,040
he should exercise more

758
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,000
to produce more dopamine in his body.

759
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,560
Then he'll be happier.

760
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,840
Because of Natalie?

761
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,320
I'm hurt.

762
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,160
Lu,

763
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,320
there's no crash for you in the world.

764
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,400
You're handsome and good-looking.

765
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,400
And so nice.

766
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,120
In the future,

767
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,800
many other people will come to find you.

768
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,720
I know that.

769
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,040
So from now on,

770
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,360
I'll let him go

771
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,040
and forget him.

772
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,680
I'll stop thinking about him.

773
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,880
Hello?

774
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,520
This is a call from Manager Chu.

775
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,760
Thank you for Ooaked.

776
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,080
Keep going!

777
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,520
Bye!

778
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,680
Coming to See You On The Wharf.

779
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,680
�

780
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,760
Hello?

781
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,360
Zhu.

782
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,920
Do you have time today?

783
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,240
I want to see you.

784
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,680
When?

785
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,920
I'm sorry for hurting you.

786
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,120
I didn't care about your feelings that day.

787
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,680
I said some things you didn't want to hear.

788
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
I'm sorry.

789
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,960
It's okay.

790
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,160
It's all in the past.

791
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,920
And I'm the one who should say sorry to you.

792
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,200
So you're not angry with me anymore?

793
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
You can't not reply to my messages anymore?

794
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,120
Although you rejected me,

795
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,000
I still treat you as a friend.

796
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,760
I'm really worried about you.

797
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,560
Thank you.

798
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,280
Thank you for treating me as a friend.

799
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,360
But I asked you out today

800
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,600
because I want to ask you for help.

801
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,080
Go ahead. I'll help you.

802
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,800
After I left the clinic that day,

803
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,000
I went to find Rachel.

804
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,200
I said some bad things to her.

805
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,920
I even slapped her.

806
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,440
I can't help you.

807
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,240
You slapped her.

808
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,600
Why did you do that?

809
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,080
I know I did wrong.

810
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,560
I shouldn't have done that.

811
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,360
But I really lost my mind.

812
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,960
I didn't know what I was doing.

813
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,280
But the worst thing is

814
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,200
your brother came and saw it.

815
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,280
That serious?

816
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,400
Did he scold you or tell you the truth?

817
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,680
He made it clear to me.

818
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,520
He just treats me as a patient.

819
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,760
Nothing else.

820
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,880
He also told me not to bother Rachel.

821
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,280
I was hurt.

822
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,040
But when I got home,

823
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,360
I realized

824
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,720
I was being unreasonable.

825
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,040
I was willing to do that to Amin.

826
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,920
But Rachel was so nice to me.

827
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,800
I treated her like that.

828
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,520
I treated you like that.

829
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,960
So I was too embarrassed to see you three.

830
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,120
So I hid.

831
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,000
I wanted to reflect on myself.

832
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,040
You and Rachel are not the type to take revenge.

833
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,360
You were too impulsive.

834
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,720
So I wanted to apologize to them.

835
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,080
I'll take you to apologize to them.

836
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,760
Now?

837
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,640
Now.

838
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,600
It's harder to forgive you if you say it later.

839
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,920
Mom, how long will you be in the clinic?

840
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,560
You haven't left yet.

841
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,040
I need to take care of your sister and your dad.

842
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,720
Be careful.

843
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,000
Don't be rude.

844
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Be good.

845
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,280
Stop it.

846
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,840
What's wrong?

847
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,120
Don't run.

848
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,680
Are you okay?

849
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,320
What's wrong?

850
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,880
Why did you help me lie down?

851
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,960
Are you okay?

852
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,680
I'm fine.

853
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,440
Let's continue.

854
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,640
Okay.

855
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,280
You...

856
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,040
Yeah.

857
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,680
You'd better not come.

858
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Something happened in the clinic.

859
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,840
It's a mess.

860
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,000
They should be from the Tongren Club.

861
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,480
Since we moved here,

862
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,200
I've been taking revenge for the protection fee.

863
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,520
We'll make trouble when our clinic opens.

864
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,640
Brother.

865
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,760
My friend is back.

866
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,160
He helped you chase them.

867
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,400
Did you catch them?

868
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,440
I caught them in the alley.

869
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,840
But he ran away.

870
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,960
I asked Zhixiong, but he didn't catch them.

871
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,760
It's okay.

872
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,000
We'll record the case.

873
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,160
We'll make some criminal and terrorist crimes.

874
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,240
Thank you for your cooperation.

875
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,840
We'll contact you when we have progress.

876
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,520
Thank you.

877
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,960
Thank you.

878
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,120
Nana.

879
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,320
Are you okay?

880
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,280
I'm fine.

881
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,720
The water should be poured to me.

882
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,280
You should help me to stop the water.

883
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,080
I should be the one to say sorry.

884
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,880
I said such a bad thing to you in the hospital.

885
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,040
And you've been so nice to me.

886
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,160
But I treated you like that.

887
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,840
I didn't expect you to forgive me.

888
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,040
But I really want to let A'zu take me here.

889
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,720
So I can say sorry to you in person.

890
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,800
Although I did wrong,

891
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,960
she's so sincere to apologize to you.

892
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,040
Please forgive her.

893
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,880
Don't mention the past.

894
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,680
It's sour and sweet.

895
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,840
It's soothing and soothing.

896
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,920
It's more comfortable to drink.

897
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,560
Thank you, A'min.

898
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,000
I understand what you said to me.

899
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,880
I'm sorry.

900
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,560
But can I be your patient?

901
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,920
As long as you're my patient,

902
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,040
I'll always be your doctor.

903
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,440
Thank you.

904
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,720
Bi Yakeng, are you busy recently?

905
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,640
You look tired.

906
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,400
I'm busy with the company.

907
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,320
Hey, don't be busy with your phone.

908
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,600
Do you help your son in the company?

909
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,720
Do you push everything to your son?

910
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,440
Be careful of your son's fatigue.

911
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,040
He's good.

912
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,120
He can handle it himself.

913
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,200
I was reading the news.

914
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,000
It said that Wei Ming's clinic was attacked.

915
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,240
Hey, A'ke.

916
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,920
Did you do this?

917
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,160
What? When?

918
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,080
Did you make troubles and get revenge?

919
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,320
The police said it might be a business dispute.

920
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,400
It should have nothing to do with us.

921
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,000
By the way, A'ke.

922
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,920
I saw a person who works in the black community

923
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,200
enter your office that day.

924
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,120
A'ke, what are you looking for?

925
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,280
You don't think I'm so boring, do you?

926
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,800
I'm looking for some black-knit friends

927
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,600
to help me communicate.

928
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,640
That's right. It should be fine.

929
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,480
Although we have a conflict with Wei Ming in business,

930
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,000
we're a family.

931
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,760
We don't have to be so stubborn.

932
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,720
Right.

933
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,360
Who saw me looking for black-knit friends?

934
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,440
That's right.

935
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,840
It's not a coincidence, right?

936
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,080
A'zuo, why are you so upset?

937
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,560
Are you tired?

938
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,560
If you're tired, go home with Natalie.

939
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,640
I'm just thinking about whether I should send her home.

940
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,960
I've been thinking for a long time.

941
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,760
If she doesn't want me to send her home,

942
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,480
and I send her home,

943
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,360
wouldn't I be embarrassed?

944
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,080
No way.

945
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,120
What if...

946
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,160
It's so dirty.

947
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,680
Let me help you.

948
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,560
How about this?

949
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,080
I'll stay and clean it up with you.

950
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,720
No need.

951
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,800
You should go home and rest.

952
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,960
I'll send you home.

953
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,560
Okay, thank you.

954
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,440
Are you all right?

955
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,480
I rushed here after I saw the news.

956
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,160
Are you all right?

957
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,560
Are you a loser to make trouble?

958
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,400
Don't say that.

959
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,520
We're a family.

960
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,600
Cousin, are you all right?

961
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,040
But you're really...

962
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,880
You know that you'll attract people

963
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,640
who are not good-looking

964
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,880
in the restaurant in Sanjiao.

965
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,160
How about it?

966
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,440
Do you regret buying this house?

967
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Ming, I'll help you sweep the garbage.

968
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,720
I'm good at it.

969
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,640
Hey, you want to be kept?

970
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,960
By the way, I read the news that someone was dumped.

971
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,280
It's you, Natalie.

972
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,440
Are you all right?

973
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,360
It's none of your business.

974
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,520
You don't have to pretend to be close.

975
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,240
But Natalie, you should be lucky.

976
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,200
It's good that you didn't get dumped.

977
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,520
You know that.

978
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,760
You can make money by your face.

979
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,680
What did you say?

980
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
What are you doing?

981
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,440
Gao Rui, you're going too far.

982
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,120
Go away. No one is welcoming you.

983
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,480
Do you want to use the broom to drive you away?

984
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,160
Go away.

985
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,760
Take your time.

986
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Are you all right?

987
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,120
I'm fine.

988
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,280
It's because you friends are not able to meet them,

989
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,080
I feel bad that way.

990
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,520
Take a seat.

991
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,600
I'm happy as long as I clean up.

992
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,440
Or else, I really feel his pain.

993
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,200
More importantly, your relationship with Natalie isn't bad,

994
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,720
because I told you yesterday

995
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,420
we noticed something frequent lately.

996
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,220
I can't do it myself.

997
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:11,420
I originally asked my mom to accompany me, but now that this kind of thing has happened, I told her not to come.

998
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,420
Actually, you've already made a great move.

999
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,620
How about we call Auntie another day?

1000
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,020
These past two days, it really hurts.

1001
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,420
So if you have time, I'm okay.

1002
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,220
I can do it myself. I believe in you.

1003
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,820
Okay.

1004
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,420
I'm not that nervous.

1005
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,420
Thank you, Dr. Ling.

1006
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,420
Why are you suddenly so polite?

1007
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,420
It seems that calling you a doctor won't be that awkward.

1008
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,420
Miss Luo, then we'll start.

1009
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:52,420
Come.

1010
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,420
Relax a bit.

1011
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,420
Relax a bit.

1012
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,420
It's okay. Relax a bit.

1013
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,420
I'm fine.

1014
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,420
I've already paid you the fine, Lord Wei.

1015
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,820
Let those two guys who are doing things get away from here. Don't let the police find you.

1016
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,420
That's it.

1017
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,220
You're acting very well.

1018
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,020
You've been working hard for the whole person.

1019
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,020
It's not hard. The most important thing is to trick them.

1020
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:06,020
With Liang Yanzu, this idiot, helping the police, it's hard for them to not get into the police.

1021
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,020
You're done so quickly.

1022
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,220
No wonder you're so good.

1023
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,020
Go away.

1024
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,420
Let me tell you.

1025
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,820
My current goal is only one.

1026
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,020
It's Luo Yingchen, this damn old woman.

1027
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,020
Okay.

1028
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:35,220
Five.

1029
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,120
Many women think

1030
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,620
living content or orange color

1031
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,720
they think is the problem for adults.

1032
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,820
Actually, when women do not work with momentum

1033
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,900
When you're young,

1034
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,220
you may feel sick for a long time.

1035
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,020
It will affect your chest.

1036
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,460
If you feel sick for a long time,

1037
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,500
and your back is swollen,

1038
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,940
and your chest is swollen,

1039
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,700
it may be because of the malnutrition.

1040
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,620
You can find a Chinese doctor

1041
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,100
to treat your chest and make a plan.
