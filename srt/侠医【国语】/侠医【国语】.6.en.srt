1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,560
I'm so mad.

2
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,320
Do you want to see it?

3
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,360
If you can't win me, don't play with me.

4
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,520
Chuan.

5
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Do you like me?

6
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,320
Yes, I like you.

7
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,040
Brother, I'm dying.

8
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,760
You come to me first.

9
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,280
How about we split up to find it?

10
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,680
You go this way, I go this way.

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,560
Okay.

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,440
Hurry.

13
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,480
Why are you here?

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,760
Helps!

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,800
Release me! Help me!

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,280
Wait.

17
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:10,980
Stop shooting me, Don't shoot me,

18
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,740
I will...

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,940
I will kill you.

20
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,680
Shikang, listen to me.

21
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,660
It's lyric and act.

22
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,060
What do you guys want?

23
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,560
Actually how do you like to sing?

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,160
Uh, uh, yes.

25
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,660
Let me explain.

26
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,660
If you start to sing you need to be a bit really good at singing.

27
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,660
What?

28
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,660
Hmm, no you start already then.

29
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,960
I will continue singing later if you want to be a bit better at it.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,700
Not only sing for 2016

31
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,860
there is also a song called

32
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,060
listing all of yourGMC songs

33
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,860
I didn't expect that Shi Kang would be so unsteady after drinking the soup.

34
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,260
Good thing you came to help me out.

35
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,460
Oh, right. Are you okay? Are you hurt?

36
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,860
I just twisted a little bit, but it doesn't hurt.

37
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,660
Let's hurry and go find A-Zu and call him again.

38
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,060
That's right. Let's go find A-Zu.

39
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,060
A-Zu!

40
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,660
A-Zu!

41
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,060
Hey!

42
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,260
How are you?

43
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,260
What's wrong?

44
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,460
A-Zu!

45
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,860
Hurry and get up.

46
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,060
Get up first. You're drunk, so you're having a headache.

47
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,860
I'll help you relax.

48
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,060
My stomach hurts.

49
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,060
What?

50
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,260
My stomach hurts.

51
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,860
Your stomach hurts?

52
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,660
Big Brother, your stomach hurts?

53
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,260
Go and see him. I'll just massage it myself.

54
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,460
How are you? Let me see.

55
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,660
Is it the upper abdomen? How does it hurt?

56
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,260
My stomach...

57
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,860
My stomach feels like it's being held by someone.

58
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,260
It hurts so much.

59
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,260
Should we call an ambulance?

60
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,460
Don't worry. He's had too much alcohol.

61
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,860
He's had stomach cramps.

62
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,860
Actually, it'll be better if he just vomits and rests for a bit.

63
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,060
Can you apply some medicine on him?

64
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,260
No, I can't.

65
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,860
He's having stomach cramps.

66
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,860
The strong smell will stimulate him.

67
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,460
I'll massage his internal organs.

68
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,660
It can help him digest the alcohol and help him feel better.

69
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860
Is it better?

70
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,060
I think it's better.

71
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,460
Apply this first.

72
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,060
It's windy here. I'm worried that he'll catch a cold.

73
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,860
Let's continue.

74
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,860
Miss Shen, we're here.

75
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,860
Thank you.

76
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,660
I'll take you up.

77
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,660
Okay, let me do it.

78
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,060
You're drunk, too. Go home and rest.

79
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,460
Wait, this is the medicine oil for you.

80
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,460
If you still feel unwell, use this to massage the acupoints and stomach.

81
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,460
This will help to relieve stomach and headache.

82
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,860
Thank you, Miss Shen.

83
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,660
Thank you.

84
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,860
Get in the car.

85
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,860
What's wrong?

86
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,660
This is called a hundred times experiment.

87
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,860
It'll help you to wake up and have a good life.

88
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,860
You'll be a woman sooner or later.

89
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,260
Aren't you doing this for Miss Luo?

90
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,460
Why should I?

91
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,660
I asked her out to talk about serious matters.

92
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,460
She's not a woman.

93
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,260
She's a woman.

94
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,060
She's a woman.

95
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,060
She's a woman.

96
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,060
I asked her out to talk about serious matters.

97
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,460
I'm also talking about serious matters.

98
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,060
Natalie's order is gone and she's dumped by a man.

99
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,260
Do you know how empty and lonely she is?

100
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,060
I should help her fill her empty heart.

101
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,860
You're saying you're being too honest.

102
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,860
No, I'm saying I'm giving her a hard time.

103
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,660
Do you know how cold your cousin is when he's dumped by her?

104
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,860
Who's the one who's being left behind?

105
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,060
I know. He must have picked her up.

106
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,660
Who asked me to knock on your head?

107
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,260
I'm so dizzy. Can we go home?

108
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,260
Let's go.

109
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,260
Can you help me apply the ointment?

110
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,260
Thank you.

111
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,460
What's wrong?

112
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,860
It hurts a little again.

113
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Sit down first.

114
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,860
Okay.

115
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,460
I brought ginger tea bags with me. I'll make some for you.

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,060
Thank you.

117
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,660
I usually drink this when I have stomachache. It's very useful.

118
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,660
I said such harsh words that day.

119
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,660
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,660
Don't say it. I understand.

121
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
It's all my fault.

122
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
I asked for it.

123
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,660
I met a bitch like Deng Shikang.

124
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,660
I thought she was a treasure.

125
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,660
I helped her do so much.

126
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,660
You're so drunk today because of her?

127
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,660
What did she say? She's a rich second generation.

128
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,660
She has a car and a house.

129
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,060
If she likes me,

130
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,060
I'll be a successful woman.

131
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,860
I can live in a big house without having to live here.

132
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,460
I don't have to worry about money every day.

133
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,460
But I never thought

134
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,060
I'd be thrown away by Deng Shikang like a toy.

135
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,660
If I do, I'll have to step on it again.

136
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:54,460
Just now, she showed my naked face to everyone.

137
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,460
You're so cheap. It's a waste of time to be angry.

138
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,860
Stop being with bad people.

139
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,260
Isn't it better to rely on yourself?

140
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,060
Relying on myself?

141
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,860
It's not that easy.

142
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,260
So, I must marry a rich man in the future.

143
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,860
I want to live here.

144
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,660
I want to be a gold sparrow.

145
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,260
I'll be rolling on the bed.

146
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,860
I believe you'll find a good man.

147
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,060
I won't disturb you. I'll go now.

148
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,660
Director Rui.

149
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,460
Thank you.

150
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,460
Thank you.

151
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,260
What? You really are going to pack up and leave?

152
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,460
You can't return home after leaving the door.

153
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,060
Cai Zhixin, I'll give you another month.

154
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,060
I heard that Mr. Ling wants to buy that kind of house.

155
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,260
Since you're the one who's responsible for the customers,

156
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,460
you can stay and continue to be responsible. I'll go to the company to fight for it.

157
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,460
I'll give you 70% of the money. No need for you to share with that.

158
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,860
Is that enough to give you face? I'll just pretend that I didn't receive it.

159
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
Right now, there are so many real estate stores in the streets.

160
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,560
With such a huge business, you have to make a big choice.

161
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Why must you buy it here?

162
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,860
You guys are the ones who are still not out yet.

163
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,260
I already have a very good deal. What else do you want?

164
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,060
Think clearly. This business is very small.

165
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,460
That's enough already.

166
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,860
We don't need to tear up our faces. Just let it go.

167
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,660
Rachel, are you really leaving?

168
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,260
It's all because of you.

169
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,460
If you didn't fight with her, how could Rachel be angry and leave?

170
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,460
You two are good sisters. There's no need to be sentimental over small matters.

171
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,260
Come, let's persuade her.

172
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,060
No need to persuade her. I've wanted to leave for a long time.

173
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,860
You only know to talk about money and business. No feelings, no moral concept.

174
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,260
Who wants to stay here?

175
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,260
It's really amazing. Now, you have a big client and it's very precious.

176
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,860
Yes.

177
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,060
Every store is taking it from you. You are so precious and so noble.

178
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,860
You can't do anything anymore.

179
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,460
Have you said enough? I'll just let it go. Bye bye.

180
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,860
You...

181
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,260
Hey, I helped you clean up the mess. You're just going to stand here?

182
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,260
She already decided to leave. Didn't she say that she'll stay?

183
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,460
Also, didn't you help me clean up the mess?

184
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,860
You're the one who is greedy for her money.

185
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,860
Have you decided to convince that couple?

186
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,460
Have you convinced them not to sue us?

187
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,460
How would I know?

188
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,860
You don't know? I know that your relationship with that couple is not simple.

189
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,260
Grandma Ju, since you and Mr. Ling have already communicated,

190
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,660
you can consider that you can personally sign the cards

191
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,660
without having to go through the real estate agent.

192
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,460
You can directly go to the Lawyer's Office to sign a formal contract and transfer the money.

193
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,260
This way, the process will be easier and you will save a lot of money.

194
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,260
We will accompany you to see the lawyer, so don't worry.

195
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,260
I'm an old woman. I don't understand anything.

196
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,660
I really believe in you guys.

197
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,260
Yin Chen, you are really a good person.

198
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,860
You are already not working there anymore.

199
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,860
You even helped me with so much work. You are really very responsible.

200
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,060
Grandma Ju, the most important thing is that you continue to treat me and my sister to a meal.

201
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,460
That is just a small matter. You can eat as much as you want.

202
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,060
Right now, I don't need to worry about the house anymore.

203
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,060
Everything is already easy.

204
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,660
Moreover, after receiving this amount of money,

205
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,260
I can go abroad to study.

206
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Even getting married and having children is already enough.

207
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,860
I don't need to worry anymore.

208
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,060
Grandma, why are you thinking so long-term?

209
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,660
Didn't the doctor say that the brain is not good for treating?

210
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,060
Maybe you can live longer than me.

211
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,860
This girl is really talking nonsense.

212
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,860
Actually, the medicine has already improved a lot.

213
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,260
Even if you can't find a way to cure it,

214
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,860
it doesn't mean that there is no improvement method.

215
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,460
That's why, you don't need to think so negatively.

216
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,060
That's right. The image of the dumpling you drew is very happy and energetic.

217
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,460
You also need to be like her, be this confident.

218
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,060
Actually, I saw a company hiring a painter.

219
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,860
That's why, I plan to use this image to prove it.

220
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,660
Because I really want to make your dumpling's popularity bigger.

221
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,860
I have confidence in you.

222
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,060
Fighting, I, Jingzhi.

223
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,660
Jingzhi is really amazing.

224
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,860
She didn't get hit by her illness and is still so active in chasing dreams.

225
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,860
If it were me, I wouldn't be able to do it.

226
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,060
If the heart is not evil, then the body is not evil.

227
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,060
Everyone, as long as you are righteous and have a good attitude,

228
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,660
actually, your illness and pain will decrease.

229
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
Why do you always talk like a Chinese doctor?

230
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,860
You are just like a Chinese doctor.

231
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,060
If I didn't know that you are the owner of a drug factory, I would really think that you are a Chinese doctor.

232
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,460
I just like to read the emperor's inner book.

233
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,060
Oh, right. I know that you have resigned recently.

234
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,660
But this deal was done by you.

235
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,260
That's why, I think that I will still give you some money.

236
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,660
No need. I am not being polite to you.

237
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,260
It's just that I have resigned.

238
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,860
If I still accept your money, it will not meet the rules and there will be conflicts of interest.

239
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,460
Also, I didn't do anything.

240
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,460
If it's not money, then it's a job.

241
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,860
I heard that you studied interior design before.

242
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,660
Yes, but I only did internship and never did a job.

243
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,660
It's like this. I am thinking about how to renovate that chess house.

244
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,260
I plan to ask someone to help me do interior design.

245
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,660
I really like that chess house.

246
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,660
Also, if I can help you with your design, I can accumulate some experience.

247
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,860
Maybe I can be a good boss.

248
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,260
That's it? Then let's make a deal.

249
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,660
Have you thought about how I will think about it?

250
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,060
I plan to preserve the historical taste of this chess house.

251
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,660
And then, I will try to add some modern elements.

252
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,460
But the big premise is not to destroy the original structure of the chess house.

253
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,860
Then you have quite a lot of requirements. It sounds complicated.

254
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,460
Yes, I also know that it's troublesome. That's why I plan to ask you for help.

255
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,060
Then do you have any specific ideas?

256
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,860
For example, what material do you want to use? Or what kind of decoration style do you want?

257
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,060
What kind of furniture do you want to match?

258
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,260
Actually, I plan to go to the other side of the chess house to take a look.

259
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,660
Are you interested in going there to do some research?

260
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,860
That's good too.

261
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,460
Come.

262
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,460
Actually, you just need to return the clothes to my big brother and me.

263
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,660
Don't you need to return it to him yourself?

264
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
I was so drunk that day.

265
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,660
It's all thanks to your big brother helping me to get into the right position.

266
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,060
Then of course, I must personally thank him.

267
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,260
He helped you to get into the right position and you are already so considerate?

268
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,860
I am just doing this to repay his kindness.

269
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,260
Then that day, you were drunk and I helped you.

270
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,060
Why didn't you hug me and I only hugged my big brother?

271
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,060
We are so close. Don't be so considerate.

272
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,660
That's true. We are very close. Don't be considerate.

273
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,060
I hope to preserve the quality of this place.

274
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,060
I will try to use materials that are similar to the original.

275
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,060
I don't want to make it too new. Let this place be like another place.

276
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,060
There are a lot of old furniture here. Which ones are the ones you want to throw away?

277
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,260
There are. For example, this cabinet and this table.

278
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,260
My dad's clinic also had one. It was very durable.

279
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,660
That's why I really want to preserve it.

280
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,460
Also, the wall frames are so unique. I don't want to give them up.

281
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,460
I'm sorry. Am I being too greedy?

282
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,460
No. I agree.

283
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,860
These furniture are hard to find outside.

284
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,660
If we put them together, the whole place will have a good smell.

285
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,460
Big Brother.

286
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,260
I invited Miss Luo to do interior design.

287
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,860
She will help me study how to renovate this place.

288
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,460
Oh, interior design.

289
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,260
Oh, right. I'm looking for you.

290
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,660
Dr. Ling, I want to return your clothes.

291
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,460
Thank you for lending them to me before. I already washed them.

292
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,060
You're so polite, Miss Shen.

293
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,660
Why don't you call me Miss Shen instead?

294
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,660
You call me Nen. I'll call you Ming.

295
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,460
Okay, Nen. By the way, is your stomach feeling better?

296
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,060
I feel better. I heard you say that you won't drink anymore.

297
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,660
I heard that you won't drink anymore. You've been eating lightly lately.

298
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,460
But sometimes, you still have stomachache.

299
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,860
Maybe the medicine isn't working.

300
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,060
If your stomach is feeling better, your airway will be balanced.

301
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,260
There's a saying that says, when you move, you raise.

302
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,660
So, exercise can help you.

303
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,260
Exercise? I sometimes go to work out.

304
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,660
You're weak in your body.

305
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,060
Too much exercise will make your blood flow to the limbs and affect your digestion.

306
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,460
You should do some exercises like Tai Chi.

307
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,860
You can adjust your liver and skin by breathing deeply and slowly.

308
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,660
It will balance your airway.

309
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,060
But I don't know Tai Chi.

310
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,860
If you know, why don't you teach me?

311
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,660
I've been busy with my work lately. I don't have time.

312
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,660
It's okay, Brother. I know Tai Chi. I'll teach you.

313
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,660
I'll show you. Move aside.

314
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,460
Start.

315
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,660
You think Tai Chi is boring? Tai Quan is fine too.

316
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,060
That way.

317
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,260
It's okay. They're all dead.

318
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,060
It's a mess here. Take them away.

319
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,060
Go. Go. Go.

320
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,860
Hurry up.

321
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,060
There are so many cockroaches.

322
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,860
It seems that we should find the company to kill them first.

323
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,260
That's right. Girls are more afraid of cockroaches.

324
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,460
Ah!

325
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,260
Don't be afraid.

326
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,260
It seems that we can't wait for the company to kill them.

327
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,460
Let's go buy some smoke bombs.

328
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,060
The sun is really good here. The air is very good.

329
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,660
It's the best place to practice Tai Chi.

330
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,260
Wearing high heels and shoes, and even wearing a dress.

331
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,860
Are you going to practice now?

332
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
Of course. It's just a practice.

333
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,660
You should practice more. Your stomach will get better faster.

334
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,060
Whatever. I'll just practice for a while.

335
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,860
Okay. Follow me.

336
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,060
Start.

337
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,060
Start.

338
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,660
That's right. Your big brother is so nice.

339
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,260
Do you have a girlfriend?

340
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,860
No. He's been very clear-headed since he started studying.

341
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,260
He's very careful and has high standards.

342
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,060
What kind of girl does he like?

343
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,860
I really don't know about this.

344
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,260
He's never brought a girl home.

345
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,660
Richo!

346
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,660
He's been interested in buying a building.

347
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,060
He's also interested in designing.

348
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,860
Maybe he's also interested in the end.

349
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,060
They're just working.

350
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,860
They're just sitting around.

351
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,060
Look at us.

352
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,460
Don't talk nonsense.

353
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,860
Why are you so concerned about him?

354
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,060
No. I'm just gossiping.

355
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,060
Then, other than Tai Chi, is he interested in medicine and oil?

356
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,660
No.

357
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,660
He's just playing archery.

358
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,660
He's just playing archery.

359
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,860
Huh?

360
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,060
How come I don't know all his interests?

361
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,060
You're not loyal enough.

362
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,460
What?

363
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,660
Stand still. Stand still with your weight.

364
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,460
How can I stand still with high heels and shoes?

365
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,060
Okay. Focus.

366
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,660
Your legs are higher. That's right. Straighten your arms.

367
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,660
Then let's put your weight on your feet first.

368
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,260
Weight on my feet?

369
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
Weight on your feet. Left foot.

370
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,660
Yes.

371
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,460
Left foot. That's right.

372
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,060
Then...

373
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,660
Okay.

374
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,060
Huh?

375
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,260
Hey! Hey! Hey!

376
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,860
I'm not training anymore. I'm so hungry.

377
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,860
I didn't eat anything before I went up the mountain.

378
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,060
I don't know if I have the energy to go down the mountain later.

379
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,660
I'll take you to a place to eat. It's very beautiful.

380
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,660
Huh? Going up the mountain again?

381
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,060
No need. There's a lift.

382
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,660
Let's go.

383
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,460
A'Zuo, this place is quite interesting.

384
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,660
You can play and eat hot pot outside.

385
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,460
Don't think that it's only interesting.

386
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,260
These things are also very delicious.

387
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,860
Really?

388
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,060
But the food here isn't cheap.

389
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,460
So generous.

390
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,260
Because we're treating you to a meal, of course, you should eat better.

391
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,660
Okay. I won't be polite then.

392
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,860
Just order whatever you want.

393
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,260
Wow.

394
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,660
So great. So great.

395
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,460
I didn't think that the porridge was this delicious.

396
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,460
Of course.

397
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,260
The whole pot of porridge absorbed all the essence of the food.

398
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,060
I already asked my big brother.

399
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,060
If you often have stomachache, you should eat porridge.

400
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,460
Because it can nourish your stomach, it's mild and easy to absorb.

401
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,860
So I brought you here to eat.

402
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,660
Thank you.

403
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,260
Be careful. It's hot.

404
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,260
Hey, A'Zuo!

405
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,460
You finally showed up!

406
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,460
I've been waiting for you to take revenge for a long time.

407
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,860
Last time, I was so confused because you made me vomit.

408
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,060
I won't fight with you today.

409
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,260
Okay. Come. I'm afraid of you.

410
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,860
Come.

411
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,660
Come.

412
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,660
It's useless to add it. Let's go.

413
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,860
Hey, hey, let's play.

414
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,060
Let's try it. They're very good at cooking.

415
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,460
Okay.

416
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,060
Drink.

417
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,460
Your stomach hurts. I'll drink.

418
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,660
Can you do it?

419
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,260
Of course.

420
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,860
Cheers.

421
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,660
You're great.

422
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,260
Thank you.

423
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,460
Let's continue to play some other day.

424
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,860
You're still so good at cooking.

425
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,060
I didn't expect you to be so good.

426
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,260
I didn't expect you either.

427
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,460
Handsome, you played well just now.

428
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,660
I'll leave a contact information. Let's play another day.

429
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,260
Okay, okay, okay. You can scan me.

430
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,060
Wait a minute. I'll ask my girlfriend first.

431
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,860
You have a girlfriend.

432
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,660
Let's go back and eat hot pot.

433
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,460
You're using me, you brat.

434
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,460
I'll use you.

435
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,460
Hurry and eat.

436
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,660
Come.

437
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,260
Hey, why are you back so late?

438
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,860
Aren't you going to work?

439
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,660
I resigned from real estate.

440
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,860
No wonder you were so upset that day.

441
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,460
Are you not happy?

442
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,860
Where are you going to work?

443
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,260
Do you have other work to do?

444
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,660
I haven't started looking for a job yet.

445
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,660
I've taken on a temporary job to help people do interior design.

446
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,860
This is not bad.

447
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,760
You've learned this before.

448
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,260
Just try it first.

449
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,460
Of course not.

450
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,660
I'm just starting to learn how to do temporary work. What's so good about it?

451
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,060
Is it reliable?

452
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,860
Anyway, I don't need you to worry. I know what I'm doing.

453
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,860
Hey, little sister.

454
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,260
You moved out because it was convenient for you to work.

455
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,060
Your job is already gone.

456
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,260
This house is yours.

457
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,960
How about you move back and live here?

458
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,060
That's right. It's also good to save some rent.

459
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,460
Where are all my interior design books and tools?

460
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,460
I don't know.

461
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,260
Your sister often comes into your room. Go ask her.

462
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,260
Sister, have you seen my interior design books?

463
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,060
Yes.

464
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
Is it this one?

465
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,460
Let me see.

466
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,260
It's this one.

467
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,660
I haven't finished reading it. I can't take it.

468
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,660
I need to use it for work. Let me use it first.

469
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,060
I haven't finished reading it. I can't take it.

470
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,460
I'm in a rush to use it. I'll return it to you later.

471
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,260
I haven't finished reading it. I can't take it.

472
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,260
Let her use it. Don't irritate her.

473
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,260
I'm in a rush to use it. You can't always ask for help.

474
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
I'll return it to you.

475
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
Don't shout.

476
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
How is it?

477
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
Are you all right?

478
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
It's broken.

479
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
I'll buy you another one.

480
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,260
I told you to let her use it.

481
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,260
See if your head is injured.

482
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,260
Are you all right?

483
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,260
I'll buy you another one.

484
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,260
I want this one.

485
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,260
I want this one.

486
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,540
Tea

487
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,100
Condensed milk

488
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,460
Didn't I tell you don't keep taking pain跟 slept.

489
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,380
I know that but I really can't stand your piecing with internol

490
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,380
I know.

491
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,580
You also have your reasons.

492
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,580
Let's talk about serious things.

493
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,700
This is the 모두 flat in the earthen house.

494
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Did you think about how to use the three floors?

495
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,300
I have not actually finished thinking about it.

496
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,800
I'm planning to move in with A Zu

497
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
and leave some space for me to practice and shoot arrows.

498
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,000
At the same time, I need to protect it.

499
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,800
I don't want to make a big change and ruin the characteristics of the Qilou.

500
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,600
Then you can think about it slowly.

501
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
Let's first turn over the wall and the ground.

502
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,200
The brick inside has begun to fall and fall.

503
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,200
I've read a lot of reference books about Qilou history.

504
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
I saw that they usually use bricks like this.

505
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,000
See if you like it.

506
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,600
Yes, it really has a lot of characteristics.

507
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,800
Just use this brick.

508
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,200
This kind of brick is usually red, white, or yellow.

509
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,400
There was originally a book of color that you could choose.

510
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
But my sister tore it up.

511
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Oh, it's nothing. Let's buy another one.

512
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,200
Let's go buy it now, okay?

513
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Okay.

514
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,600
Sister, I'll take you to buy that book now.

515
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,000
Once the book is broken, we'll buy a new one. It'll be neat.

516
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,200
And we need to buy two books. One for Xiaomei.

517
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,000
This one. It's this one.

518
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,200
Good thing you're here. You found it so quickly.

519
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Let's buy another one for Xiaomei.

520
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Sister, I'll go with you to pay now.

521
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
No, we can only open it after paying.

522
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Yes, yes.

523
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
The design book seems to be on the second floor.

524
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,800
Let's go downstairs to pay first.

525
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,600
We can open it after paying. Okay?

526
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
No.

527
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,200
Why don't we ask the staff where the book is? It seems to be faster.

528
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Let's go downstairs to ask.

529
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
We can't open it. Give it to me.

530
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Give it to me.

531
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Sorry, sorry. We can only open it after paying.

532
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I know. I'm sorry.

533
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Sister, we can't open it.

534
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Someone scolded us. Give it to me.

535
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Let's go downstairs to pay first.

536
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
I know. Let's go downstairs to pay first.

537
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Let's not buy it today. Let's buy it another day.

538
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
I said let's go downstairs to pay first.

539
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
I'll open it.

540
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
I said give it to me.

541
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Be good.

542
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Dad.

543
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Please call an ambulance.

544
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Okay, I'll call an ambulance.

545
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
I'll help you.

546
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
How could this happen?

547
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Dad fell down. He can't move.

548
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
It's okay, sister.

549
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Let's go downstairs to pay first.

550
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
I'll help you.

551
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,200
He can't move. Dad fell down. He can't move.

552
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Dad.

553
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Uncle, how are you?

554
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Don't worry. He's fine.

555
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Dad.

556
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
How could this happen? What did the doctor say?

557
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
He hit his head when he fell down.

558
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
The doctor said it was an external injury.

559
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
But he had a stroke.

560
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
So he needs to be hospitalized for observation.

561
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Why did you suddenly go to the bookstore and end up in the hospital?

562
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
I was going to take sister to buy that broken book.

563
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
I didn't expect I couldn't get it done.

564
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
You're listening to me.

565
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,200
If you give the book to sister, everything will be fine.

566
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Your dad won't be as embarrassed as he is now.

567
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,200
It seems that I have to run away from home and the hospital.

568
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,200
I can't handle so many things alone.

569
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Sister, you don't have to work now.

570
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Why don't you move back and help take care of sister?

571
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,200
It's useless for you to force her if she doesn't want to move back.

572
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
You still say that.

573
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Sister, I really can't handle it.

574
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Just do as I say and help me, okay?

575
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Come on, drink some water first.

576
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
No need.

577
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Don't worry. Your dad is fine.

578
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Thank you, Ling Wei Ming.

579
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
You know my name?

580
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
You told my dad.

581
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Sister.

582
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
Thank you for taking care of him for me.

583
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
It's okay.

584
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
I'm fine.

585
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Xiao Meng.

586
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Thank you for taking care of him for me.

587
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
It's okay. It's nothing.

588
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Your dad is fine.

589
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
He's fine. Don't worry.

590
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Mom is going to be with dad tonight.

591
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
So I'm going home with you.

592
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Hungry? You want to eat?

593
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I'll take you to eat your favorite food.

594
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Sister, the food is here.

595
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Good night. It's crispy and delicious.

596
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,200
It's all made of fire.

597
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Eating too much will cause fatigue and

598
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
it will make you wet.

599
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
My sister likes to eat.

600
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
If you don't let her eat,

601
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
she will get angry.

602
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Do you like to eat

603
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
and feel like you have a voice?

604
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
You know.

605
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Ling Wei Ming.

606
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Fried chicken is mine.

607
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Just treat these as if you're treating me.

608
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
No.

609
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Then I'll treat you to other things.

610
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
I want to eat crispy.

611
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
I promise you.

612
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
What's Ling Wei Ming's phone number?

613
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Why do you ask her phone number?

614
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
She wants to take me to eat crispy.

615
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
You eat mine now.

616
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Good morning, sister.

617
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
What are you doing?

618
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Get up and make breakfast.

619
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Breakfast.

620
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
It's not even six o'clock.

621
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Why do you want to eat breakfast?

622
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
I don't eat breakfast so early.

623
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Three spoons.

624
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,200
One spoon, two spoons, three spoons.

625
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
You put four spoons.

626
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Cut it in half.

627
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Right.

628
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
It's not crispy enough.

629
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
The egg is not fried enough.

630
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
You have to make it again.

631
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Go to the park with me.

632
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
I want to work.

633
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Mom said someone must accompany you.

634
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Fine, I'll go with you.

635
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
I'll buy some painkillers.

636
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
We'll go to play other things.

637
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
Little girl, write.

638
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
It's beautiful.

639
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
I want it.

640
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Little girl, 3015, 4003 are all beautiful.

641
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Both are pink.

642
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
This is a blind box.

643
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
You can't pick.

644
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Buy both.

645
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Right.

646
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Right.

647
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
It's gone. Where did it go?

648
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
What?

649
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Sorry, I'll stop buying.

650
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Sis.

651
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
No.

652
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Stone Road.

653
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
No.

654
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
No.

655
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
No.

656
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
I found it.

657
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Here.

658
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
It's gone.

659
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Here.

660
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Pick it up.

661
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Be careful.

662
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Be careful.

663
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Go forward.

664
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Right.

665
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Go forward.

666
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
Right.

667
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Slow down.

668
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
You're good.

669
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
This is the right way.

670
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Don't let it go.

671
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Wait.

672
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Right.

673
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
It's gone.

674
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
It's gone.

675
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
This is the right way.

676
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Right.

677
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
It's gone.

678
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Right.

679
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Right.

680
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
It's gone.

681
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Here.

682
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Right.

683
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Please go.

684
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Go.

685
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Go.

686
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Right.

687
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Go.

688
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Go.

689
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Go.

690
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Hurry.

691
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Go.

692
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Hurry.

693
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Go.

694
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Go.

695
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
I'm very annoyed.

696
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Ling.

697
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,400
You surely aren't as annoying as my family.

698
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Okay, I won't bother you anymore.

699
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
Rest early.

700
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,200
I also want to rest early.

701
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,000
I woke up at 6 in the morning.

702
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Bye bye.

703
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,800
Bye bye.

704
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,800
Little sister, accompany me to watch the TV.

705
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,000
After the flying pig,

706
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
a group of犀牛 enjoy the sunshine here.

707
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
This kind of large grass-type animal

708
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,400
will take about one-third of the day to rest.

709
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,200
Little sister.

710
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,400
But this quiet scene

711
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,600
is about to be destroyed by the forest queen buried in the grass.

712
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,600
Little sister.

713
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,400
Little sister.

714
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,600
Little sister.

715
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
She isn't moving.

716
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,200

你姐姐出了门呢 你知不知道 Your sister is out of the house. Do you know?

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
你姐姐穿得花里胡哨的 Your sister is very beautiful.

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
还有啊 我看到他身边有个男人 And I saw a man by her side.

763
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
跟他在一起啊 He's with her.

764
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
到底发生什么事了 What happened?

765
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
姐姐 Sister

766
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
别再废话了 你赶紧下来 Stop talking nonsense. You come down quickly.

767
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
我先下楼 我先下楼 I'll go downstairs now.

768
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
姐姐 姐姐 Don't waste time. You come down quickly.

769
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
姐姐 姐姐 我先得下楼 我先得下楼 I'll go downstairs now. I'll go downstairs now.

770
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,400
那这个玉米粥去湿剑皮 The porridge is gone.

771
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
无糖豆浆清热润灶 Do you like it without sugar and soy milk?

772
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
你看喜不喜欢 Don't you like it?

773
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
不用 I don't want it.

774
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
不是说该吃早饭了吗 Didn't you say it's time for breakfast?

775
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,400
30154003粉色很好看 30154003 pink is very pretty.

776
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
你这个其实是盲盒 You are blind.

777
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
你不照会抽到什么的 You don't know what to get.

778
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
我知道 我懂 I know. I know.

779
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
那你要什么 What do you want?

780
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
这个 This one.

781
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Pick one of the two

782
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Mum!

783
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,400
I told you to look after Sis. Why didn't you tell me she was out?

784
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,400
How did I know she'd go out when I was asleep?

785
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
I called her

786
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,400
You don't have to. Didn't you charge her?

787
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
She wouldn't charge herself

788
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
That's because she didn't

789
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Where did you see her?

790
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
She went that way

791
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
There's a convenience store over there. Sis likes that area the most

792
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Go ask if you saw her

793
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
How is it?

794
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
I'm really a big fan of it

795
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
I've liked it for a long time

796
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
It's my first time to have it for you

797
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
I'll hang it up for you

798
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Big sister-in-law!

799
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Mum!

800
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
You big sister-in-law!

801
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
You got my daughter!

802
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
You got my daughter!

803
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,400
What?

804
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,400
I'm the guest! I'm helping her with the interior design

805
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Did you buy it for me?

806
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
She saved Dad's life

807
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Really?

808
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

809
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Why did you run so fast?

810
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Sorry, Mr. Lin

811
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Mr. Lin, have some tea

812
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,400
I'm sorry for the trouble earlier

813
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
I was rude to you on the street

814
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
It's okay. It's nothing

815
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,400
I haven't been back for two days. Why is it so messy?

816
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Pick it up first

817
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Little sister, you have to take care of me at home

818
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Can't you take sleeping pills?

819
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
You can't even wake up from the sleep

820
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Mr. Lin is a good person

821
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
We'll talk about it later

822
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Mr. Lin, sit down for a while

823
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
I'll go clean up the kitchen

824
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,400
I'll clean it up later. What are you doing?

825
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Mr. Lin, sorry to bother you again

826
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
It's okay

827
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
But there's one thing

828
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Your mum is right

829
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,400
It's a bad habit to rely on sleeping pills

830
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
I just want to sleep better

831
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,400
Sleeping pills can't really help you sleep

832
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
They suppress your nervous system

833
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Don't you think you'll be more tired after sleeping pills?

834
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,400
If I don't sleep at all, I can't work the next morning

835
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
Eating sleeping pills is like

836
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
Forcing your muscles to be closed and controlling your willpower

837
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
Eating for a long time will affect your heart and kidney

838
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
It will affect your five organs

839
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Do you understand?

840
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Yes

841
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,400
I'm a sister who takes care of my sister

842
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
I won't let her take pills

843
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
I'm worried about you

844
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Shouldn't you worry about yourself?

845
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
I'll try my best

846
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
I'll go change

847
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Wait

848
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
What are you doing?

849
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,400
I can't walk every time

850
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,400
But I only have too little

851
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
The body's circulation system

852
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Can be divided into three parts

853
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,400
The head, neck, and lower body

854
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
All three parts are closely related

855
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
For example, stomachache

856
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Most of the time the cause is mental stress

857
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Causing the sense of sense of smell to be inconsistent

858
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
The previous few studies

859
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Feng Shi, Yifeng, and Anmian

860
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Can help you relieve stress

861
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
You can say goodbye to your stomachache
