1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Wait for me.

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My stomach has been feeling uncomfortable lately.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Do you mind showing it to me?

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I think you should first get a good, stable drug.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I promise you.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will do some research.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll be waiting for you.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll leave the decoration to you.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll focus on the research.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Don't worry about me.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I didn't throw away my dad's stuff.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I believe that one day, they'll need it.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's all thanks to you that they can rebuild Tianri.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I still need you to find a good place for them.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll do it.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't worry about me.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll make sure everything is in order.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You can keep this and massage them.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So you're here.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So you're here.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hi.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why are you here?

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A'zu told me that you're moving everything to Qilou.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I want to see if there's anything I can help with.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I've been feeling a little bit sick lately.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I want you to massage my stomach.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is that okay?

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't worry.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I've got the time.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What about you?

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Boss, there's a customer calling you.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Call him.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, I'll go out and answer the phone.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You said you were here to help.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You said you didn't like the smell of medicine.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why did you come here?

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I wanted to help.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But I've been feeling a little bit sick lately.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And although it's a little bit old here,

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Ming helped me with the treatment.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And the massage technique is very good.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
By the way, have you tried it?

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He often helps me massage.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He's massaging my whole body.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Sometimes he asks me to massage his body.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But now I'm working for him.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't have to do those useless things.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're his subordinate.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't say so much.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Don't bother me to get close to him.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Help me.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Go.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's heavy.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh my god.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What are you doing?

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Done.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Actually, I use the medicine oil you gave me every day.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But I don't know why I press it by myself.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's not as accurate as you press it.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If you use the right one, you won't lose to the user.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Because it's small and stressed.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So it's easier to press the bottom of the muscle.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's more accurate to use it to find the pain point.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This bottle is actually three in one.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a bottle, a pig's head and a medicine oil.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can try it near our Chinese school.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Press it with a pig's head and circle it slowly.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
After finding that point, press it again and again.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It seems a little difficult.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How about you show me?

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It may be more accurate.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll know which one is which.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The Chinese school's wine is about a little above the belly button.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
About two to three fingers.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Can you feel it?

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, it's probably here.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Is it here?

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Is it sour?

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes, yes.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's sour and numb.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't touch it.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Give me the roughness of the bottle.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll take care of it.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll take care of it.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll take care of it.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll take care of it.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll take care of it.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Mr. Ren, give me the roughness of the bottle.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thank you.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Thank you.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You've been busy all day and you haven't stopped.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You must be hungry.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's late at night.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's eat together.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm not hungry.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No need.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have a lot of things to do.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You can't always wait until you're hungry to eat.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's easy to have a stomachache.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't have this problem.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You just worry about it.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm different from him.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I really come to do things.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can help you.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay, I'll give you this box.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Ah!

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you okay?

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't know why.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I didn't mean to break it.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Why don't you go in?

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There, there, there.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hurry up.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You're done.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This medicine bottle is my brother's favorite.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You can't buy it with money.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Stop arguing.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I know these things are very valuable to you.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I didn't mean to.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's okay.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's just an accident.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll handle it.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Rachel.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Ming.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I messed this place up.

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll clean it up later.

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Are you trying to repair the kettle?

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It was broken by me.

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You cherish this kettle.

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If I can repair it,

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll fix it for you.

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But it's a little difficult.

165
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You just put too much cement.

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It'll be too old.

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,600
I don't know. The video is not that detailed.

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,200
I just did what he said.

169
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,200
It's okay. I still have powder to add in.

170
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,200
This powder will make it sticky.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
How do you know so much?

172
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,000
Actually, this medicine pot is not broken for the first time.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Little sister, are you okay?

174
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,600
I want to help my parents wash the medicine pot.

175
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,800
But I accidentally broke it.

176
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,600
What should I do now?

177
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Go over there and hide.

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
Liu Wenming, what are you doing?

179
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,000
I want to help my parents wash the medicine pot.

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
But I accidentally broke it.

181
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,000
What's the use of apologizing?

183
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,200
Do you know that many patients are waiting for this medicine pot to be fried?

184
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
Don't touch it.

185
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll let you know now.

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,400
You have to be responsible for making the wrong food.

187
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
Give me your hand.

188
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't beat me.

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
I broke the pot.

190
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
You can punish me if you want.

191
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,600
Dad, little sister is very tired to see you.

192
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
Mom is not feeling well.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
She just wants to help you.

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
Little sister made a mistake. You help her.

195
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,800
Is she still young?

196
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,600
Are you old?

197
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you think you can be beaten by my mom?

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Since you help your sister, you have to bear the responsibility.

199
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,600
You can make up for it yourself.

200
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,400
Master, can this medicine pot be made up?

201
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
It can be made up.

202
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a bit expensive.

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,800
You have so much money.

204
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,000
You should keep this money to marry your wife.

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
I beg you, master.

206
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,600
I beg you. I beg you.

207
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,400
The pot is divided into three steps.

208
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,200
First, we need to start with steel and steel mud.

209
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,400
But we need to add water slowly.

210
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,400
How can we know if the water is enough?

211
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
We need to use our hands to dry it.

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,400
Put your hands in.

213
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,000
No need. You can touch it.

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is the right consistency.

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,600
Before we start to grind it, we need to see if it's smooth.

216
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,800
For example, we can use sandpaper to grind it.

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay. After we stick it,

218
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
the second step is to burn it with fire.

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The fire is the hardest to control.

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If the fire is too small, it won't stick.

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If the fire is too strong, it will explode.

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It takes some time to burn it.

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You don't need to accompany me.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No. I need to learn the third step.

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The third step is to cast a spell on it.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,400
The wire should be bent to the same level as the pot.

227
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,600
Cast it from the top to the bottom of the pot.

228
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,000
If you cast it well, it will be more durable than a new pot.

229
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,400
So you have a sister.

230
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,200
We have two siblings.

231
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Seeing you help her, you must be very worried.

232
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,000
She's still young. I'm older.

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
How old is she?

234
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,400
We are five years apart.

235
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,600
Then she's older than me.

236
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,400
Will she come back after the renovation?

237
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,200
Why? She's immigrated?

238
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,400
She passed away ten years ago.

239
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,400
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

240
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,200
It's okay. It's been a long time.

241
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I'll remember her when I see this pot.

242
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Wow, it's so pretty. Is it cute? Does it suit me?

243
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
It suits you.

244
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,600
The pink one and the pink one are a perfect match.

245
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,200
I like pink, too.

246
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,600
It's good that you like it. I like it, too.

247
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Thank you.

248
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
The rose is 5,800 yuan. How do you pay?

249
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,600
5,800? It's 5,800 yuan.

250
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Your brother is asking for money. It's a good deal.

251
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
We have to hurry.

252
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,000
We have to hurry. We'll be there in half an hour.

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,400
Yes, it's almost there.

254
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,600
Brother, I'm here.

255
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,400
Ming, congratulations on your wedding.

256
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,800
I bought a bear for her.

257
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,800
I named it Nanny Bear.

258
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,400
You can live here from now on.

259
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,200
Thank you. I'm glad.

260
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,600
Let's put it next to...

261
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Here you go.

262
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,000
It's really dirty here.

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What do we do?

264
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
How about this?

265
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,200
Give us 8,800 yuan to clean it.

266
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,400
If you don't give it to us,

267
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,000
I can't guarantee you that there will be any dirty stuff.

268
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
I'll try. I'll come.

269
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,600
Come on.

270
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,400
We won't give you money.

271
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,200
Pick up the trash and give it to me.

272
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,600
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

273
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Good.

274
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It seems that you don't like drinking.

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You underestimate our Shenzhui Club.

276
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
Brother, let's do it.

277
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,000
Don't break that pot!

278
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Hey, you trash!

279
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
You said you were running a boxing club in the station.

280
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Let's see how you explain to your boss.

281
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Let's go.

282
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,600
Pick up the trash or you'll get 8,800 yuan.

283
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
Trash!

284
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,400
Hey!

285
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,200
Have you been injured for a long time?

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,200
It's none of your business.

287
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
Stop fighting.

288
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,000
If you get hurt again, it'll be a big trouble.

289
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,000
Thank you for your advice.

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,400
I'm not hurt.

291
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm just a little bit hurt.

292
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,800
I'm just a little bit hurt.

293
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,600
I'm just a little bit hurt.

294
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,000
Thank you for your kindness.

296
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,000
A-Ming, are you okay?

297
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,400
I'm fine.

298
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,800
A-Ming, you played the stick so well.

299
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
Have you learned it for a long time?

300
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Can you teach me?

301
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,600
Let's tidy up here first.

302
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
It's almost time.

303
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Hey, you want to learn the stick technique?

304
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Actually, I can teach you.

305
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
How about it, Auntie Xu? Are you satisfied?

306
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,600
You don't regret selling it to me, right?

307
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Of course I don't regret it.

308
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,200
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

309
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,000
this old-fashioned chess house

310
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,200
would have been so well decorated.

311
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Now I finally understand

312
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,600
why A-Ming wanted to buy this chess house so much.

313
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,400
It's really a piece of art.

314
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
It's all spent.

315
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,600
Mom, everything here is Rachel's hard work.

316
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,200
Rachel, my mom said

317
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,400
she likes your decoration.

318
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Yes.

319
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,800
Thank you, Auntie.

320
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,600
It's really good.

321
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
It's very similar to the clothing store A-Yuan used to open.

322
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
Even the tools are the same.

323
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes, Mom.

324
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,200
We used a lot of things from Dad's past.

325
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,600
We can put all our memories

326
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,200
in this place.

327
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,800
Mom, do you remember this?

328
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,400
This pot?

329
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,800
You remember, right?

330
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,600
We broke it when we were kids.

331
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,800
This time we moved here, we broke it again.

332
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,600
But it's okay.

333
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,400
Rachel and I fixed it overnight.

334
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,600
Yes, Auntie.

335
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,800
They've been together for a long time.

336
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,200
They haven't been in a relationship, but they're in a relationship.

337
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
They're very cunning.

338
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,400
Auntie Ju,

339
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,000
we haven't seen each other for decades.

340
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,400
Let's take a picture.

341
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,600
Okay.

342
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,000
A-Ming, help us take a picture.

343
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Okay, I'll help you.

344
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,000
Mom, I'll help you.

345
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay, ready.

346
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Wait, wait.

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
This thing blocks the back shape.

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Move it away.

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600
A-Zuo, move this away quickly.

350
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Hurry up.

351
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
Forget it.

352
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,000
Okay, ready.

353
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay.

354
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Three, two, one.

355
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,200
Are you satisfied with the first shot?

356
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,400
Very good.

357
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I'm very clear.

358
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,600
Yes, very good.

359
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,400
I'll take you up there to take a look.

360
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Okay.

361
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,600
A-Xia, A-Xia, let's go up together.

362
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,000
Okay.

363
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,600
Be careful.

364
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,400
A-Ming,

365
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
that matter has been resolved.

366
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,600
They filled in the bill themselves.

367
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,200
They didn't force me to pay the money.

368
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,000
Thank you.

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,200
That's good.

370
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,400
Next time, if you have any trouble, don't carry it yourself.

371
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
You have to tell me.

372
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,600
You don't plan to pour me a drink?

373
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,200
You saw it.

374
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
My legs are not good, I can't go over.

375
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Pour me a drink.

376
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,800
Then, you drink this first.

377
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
I haven't drunk it before.

378
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,400
Thank you.

379
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,800
I want to use some salad.

380
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,600
Help me eat it.

381
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,200
Okay.

382
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,200
Put on some more pineapple.

383
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
I like it the most.

384
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,400
Okay.

385
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Thank you.

386
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,600
Put it here.

387
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,400
Here.

388
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,000
Thank you.

389
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,800
Thank you.

390
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,600
Is it necessary?

391
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,200
It's just a place. It's such a big mess.

392
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,600
That's right.

393
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,400
You brought so much money to decorate it, it looks like a museum.

394
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Aren't you afraid that you won't be able to earn it back?

395
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,200
There's no taste.

396
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Oh, right, Sister.

397
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,600
How are you? It's been a long time.

398
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,000
Every time I see you, there's no good news.

399
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,400
Tell me if it's good or not.

400
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,400
How is it? Did you think of any good idea to harm us?

401
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,200
Sister, it's not like that.

402
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,600
The TV station deliberately reported those fake news to make a fool of us.

403
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,800
I was also fooled by them.

404
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
It's not funny.

405
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,400
Wei Ming's friends are really interesting.

406
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,000
They call themselves teachers just because they're at home.

407
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
They don't even talk to their masters. When will they talk nonsense?

408
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Uncle, Auntie, you came here especially to fight, right?

409
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Enough.

410
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,400
Today, Qiao Qian is making everyone happy.

411
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,600
Don't mention the unhappy things.

412
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Okay, the auspicious time has come. Let's cut the roast pork.

413
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,000
Richo, come here.

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,600
Come and cut the roast pork.

415
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,000
No need. I'll stand by.

416
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,800
It's okay. Come.

417
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,000
Come. Come.

418
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,600
Come together.

419
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,200
Okay, coming.

420
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,400
Cheers.

421
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,000
Great.

422
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,600
Don't stop if you're so happy.

423
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,800
Let's celebrate.

424
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,400
Be more powerful.

425
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,800
You're so naughty.

426
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,200
What are you doing?

427
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
What are you doing?

428
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,600
Give it to me.

429
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,400
You've wet my bag.

430
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
I'll drive you.

431
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,200
It's hard to come here by car.

432
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,000
I have something to tell you. Get in the car.

433
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,000
You changed your target so quickly.

434
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You like my cousin?

435
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,800
It's none of your business.

436
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,600
Yes, it's not my business.

437
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,200
But it's not your business.

438
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm just a friend.

439
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,200
It's not my business.

440
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,800
But it's not your business.

441
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,000
You didn't make the contract.

442
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
You're not responsible for the design.

443
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,800
It's your ex-sister's responsibility.

444
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,600
Forget it. It's your business to save money.

445
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,400
Actually, I can't compare to you.

446
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,400
No matter how much I save money, I can't compare to you.

447
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,200
I know why you're in a bad mood.

448
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,400
You're so happy after a few million.

449
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,200
You're so proud of me after you've got my cousin.

450
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,200
My dad is looking for you.

451
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
He asked if you found the tenant.

452
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,800
Why? Your dad is fully responsible for you.

453
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,600
If you insist on dealing with me,

454
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
I'm welcome.

455
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,200
Do you think there's a difference between you and your dad in my heart?

456
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,600
I don't know how much I rent now.

457
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't know how much I can make.

458
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,400
What are you talking about?

459
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,600
You can have a price.

460
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,000
Why should I give you a price?

461
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,600
I must make your money.

462
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
I don't make any money.

463
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,800
I'm not making any money.

464
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Are you done? I'm in front of you.

465
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,400
I'll clean up here.

466
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,000
You've been busy all day. You must be tired.

467
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You should rest.

468
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm helping you.

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,600
What's wrong? You're twisted again.

470
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Yes, I'm used to it.

471
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,800
You can't do that.

472
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,000
Come and sit down.

473
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,600
This bottle doesn't sell well.

474
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This is a new formula. It hasn't been released yet.

475
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
You said you'd make a good medicine for me.

476
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,200
This bottle is stronger than before.

477
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,000
It's a bit like a wine.

478
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,200
This new medicine is called Jianjianning.

479
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,800
It's a combination of red flowers and fire blood.

480
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,000
It's very effective.

481
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,600
Especially for acute sprains and pain relief.

482
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,000
It's very effective.

483
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You're so good at talking.

484
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,800
Is it a good omen?

485
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,400
It's not difficult to treat pain.

486
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,800
But it's not easy to cure it.

487
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,400
The emperor's book says,

488
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
to cure pain, one must seek the essence.

489
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,200
You should rest.

490
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,400
Come with me to the second floor later.

491
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,800
I'll teach you some things.

492
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So you're so good at archery.

493
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
I'm skilled at it.

494
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,800
Actually, archery is a process of

495
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,200
reflecting on oneself, cultivating and improving one's health.

496
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
It requires high physical strength, high concentration,

497
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
and accurate judgment.

498
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,000
It can improve physical condition and improve one's health.

499
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,600
I usually practice archery here.

500
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,000
I also practice Tai Chi and Bai La Gan.

501
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
You said you wanted to teach me.

502
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Didn't you want me to learn everything?

503
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
I want to teach you archery.

504
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,600
Come, let me tie your belt first.

505
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Okay.

506
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,000
Turn around.

507
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,200
Actually, I noticed that

508
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,200
your left and right feet are different.

509
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,600
It's probably because of your old injury

510
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,200
that you always use one side of your body.

511
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,000
So your pelvis is a little bit irregular.

512
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,600
That's right.

513
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Give me your hand.

514
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,200
Right, because your posture is not correct,

515
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,800
you must correct it.

516
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,200
Archery requires us to coordinate our whole body.

517
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,800
Especially, your legs must be stable.

518
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Each of these can train us to use our toes to grab the ground.

519
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,600
It can help you not to use one side of your body to exert force.

520
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,400
That's really good.

521
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,000
Archery requires not only the strength of your arms,

522
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,600
but also the strength of your whole body, especially your back muscles.

523
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,200
Use your abdominal breathing to feel your chest expanding.

524
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,600
It can help you improve your back and your muscles.

525
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,200
Now, let's take a deep breath.

526
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,400
Breathe in.

527
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Your breathing is so messy.

528
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Didn't you hear me?

529
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Yes, I did.

530
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,800
You said that I should take a deep breath.

531
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Again. Okay, focus.

532
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Breathe in slowly when you're pulling the bow.

533
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
After you pull it fully, close your breath.

534
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Ready, go!

535
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I hit it!

536
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
It's actually not that hard.

537
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Of course, it's not hard to have you.

538
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,800
You can hit it because your posture is straight.

539
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Is this how you can fix my foot?

540
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
It will definitely help you to keep going.

541
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Seriously, when did you start to change your posture?

542
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Move aside! You're blocking the way!

543
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Move aside!

544
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Stop it! Don't bully my sister!

545
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,800
She's your sister! Go away!

546
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Hey, who's bullying my daughter?

547
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
How is it, sister?

548
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid!

549
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
I'm here, don't be afraid!

550
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Little girl, what are you doing?

551
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
I only went to buy something. Look at you!

552
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,800
You made my sister like this!

553
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid! I'm here!

554
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,800
You asked me if I felt wronged.

555
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
I felt wronged.

556
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
I don't blame them for being biased.

557
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Who can I blame?

558
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,800
You were still so young, and you've already suffered so much.

559
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
I think, besides the pain of your ankle,

560
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,800
your heart should also be in pain.

561
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,800
You've worked hard these years.

562
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Thank you.

563
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
What's wrong?

564
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Is your neck uncomfortable?

565
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
It's a little tight.

566
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
You're not used to archery for the first time.

567
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
If you're nervous, your muscles will be tense.

568
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Go sit down first.

569
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Wait a minute.

570
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
I'll apply this kind of medicine oil for you.

571
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
This bottle of medicine oil again?

572
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
This bottle of medicine oil is not the same as the previous one.

573
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
This bottle is different. Smell it.

574
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
It's not delicious?

575
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,800
I made this bottle of medicine oil especially for you.

576
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,800
I remember you said you didn't like the smell of medicine oil in the South.

577
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
This bottle is called Dian Dian Ning.

578
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
It smells like mint.

579
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
It feels cold when you rub it.

580
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
It helps to wake up your brain.

581
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,800
It's very helpful for headaches and shoulder pain.

582
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,800
It seems to be customized for me.

583
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Thank you.

584
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
It should be me thanking you.

585
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,800
I've always wanted to improve the medicine oil, but there's no direction.

586
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,800
You inspired me to develop a series of new products.

587
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
It hurts.

588
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Don't move.

589
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
It's right to find the pain point.

590
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Be good. Bear with it.

591
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
I'm coming.

592
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Three, two, one, hit.

593
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Forget it. Stop hitting.

594
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Hey, Gang Shao. Come here.

595
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Didn't you always tell me to bring you?

596
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,800
But you can't even get 5 million.

597
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Besides playing table tennis, I don't know what else he can do.

598
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
It's a little bit of a change.

599
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Just call me next time.

600
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Let's go back and have a meeting.

601
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
What kind of business do you think it is?

602
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
It's a small amount.

603
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Call Gang Shao to play together.

604
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
But it's not good.

605
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
How many pieces of medicine oil do you sell in a bottle?

606
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
I don't know how many bottles of white-fingered fingers are enough.

607
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,800
You're not a big shareholder and you're not the one who can be the master.

608
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
We don't have to make Gang Shao embarrassed, right?

609
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
That's right.

610
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
How much can the medicine oil make?

611
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
That's right. How much do you say it can make?

612
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
I'm also very curious.

613
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Everyone.

614
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Yue Shao, Jie Shao is here.

615
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Go over there and talk.

616
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Let's talk about business first.

617
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
You guys continue playing.

618
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
You're pretty good at playing basketball.

619
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
It's okay.

620
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,800
It's just that it's more flexible than a man with a belly on the table.

621
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
You're talking bad about Yue Shao.

622
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Aren't you afraid that I'll tell him?

623
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
What are you afraid of?

624
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,800
I saw you always come to your friend's side to help you out.

625
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
I usually see you cool.

626
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
I didn't expect you to be so sad about me.

627
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
It's a pity that you're at his side at this level.

628
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
How about it?

629
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Are you interested in changing your taste?

630
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
I'm not interested.

631
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
I'll be right there.

632
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Yue Shao, let's go.

633
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Dian Dian, you're very good.

634
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
This move is like a point.

635
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Pointing with your fingers.

636
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
It looks like one.

637
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Always ranked first.

638
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
You don't like it?

639
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Change to thumb.

640
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
This is great.

641
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
You're too straightforward and old-fashioned.

642
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Is it good to be straightforward?

643
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,800
All the people who buy medicine are old men and old women.

644
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,800
I don't think this flower is big enough.

645
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,800
I want to design a big red flower here.

646
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Hello.

647
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Yue Shao, you're here.

648
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Will it bother you?

649
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,800
I didn't take off many things because I had to move in a few days.

650
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
I finished the work after taking it off.

651
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
I...

652
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
It's okay.

653
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Actually, we're discussing the export of the company's design.

654
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
You should come and help.

655
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Okay.

656
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Come on.

657
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
New product packaging.

658
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,800
I'm not afraid to mention it because I don't think it's good.

659
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
It's a very traditional medicine oil.

660
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,800
It's thick and has a pattern of herbs.

661
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,800
The font is very honest.

662
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
I think it's a bit traditional.

663
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
I don't have any new ideas.

664
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Rachel is right.

665
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
New products are to open up a new market.

666
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
We're not only targeting old people.

667
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
We also attract young people.

668
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
You can continue.

669
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,800
I think your medicine oil can still be used as a glass bottle.

670
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,800
But the packaging paper can be used as a three-dimensional sculpture.

671
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
It has a sense of high quality and clean.

672
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,800
You're so good.

673
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
I think this packaging can...

674
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
By the way, what about the packaging?

675
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,800
I think the packaging must be good-looking and can be sent to people.

676
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
You can try black.

677
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
It's classic enough.

678
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,800
We can add a little red to represent the red flowers.

679
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,800
It's best to make the box a diamond shape.

680
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,800
So that everyone can see it's a high-class version.

681
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
I think it's very suitable for us to meet you.

682
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,800
By the way, what do you think about our Dian Dian Ning?

683
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
I've tried Dian Dian Ning before.

684
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,800
It has a little minty and cool feeling.

685
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Why don't you use green?

686
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Green is young enough.

687
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,800
If you're bold enough, you can use English words.

688
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
I think it's youthful and fashionable enough.

689
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Young people will like it.

690
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
It's almost the same as my idea.

691
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
You two are so close. Take your time.

692
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
I'll go back and tell my colleagues about your opinion.

693
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
I'm going to unpack now.

694
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Otherwise, I can't get the final payment.

695
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
You're forcing me to pay the final payment.

696
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
How dare you?

697
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,800
If you finish this, I'll find a job.

698
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Otherwise, my mom will scold me.

699
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,800
That is to say, I want you to help me with the packaging design.

700
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
I'm taking advantage of you.

701
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,800
That's right. I'm a graduate of design in the city.

702
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
I'm a professional.

703
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
But I think you're the one.

704
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
I'll give you money.

705
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
I'm kidding.

706
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
How can I pay you for a friend?

707
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Rachel, if I invite you to my company

708
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
to be the project manager of new products,

709
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,800
you'll be responsible for the packaging design.

710
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Are you interested?

711
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Are you serious?

712
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Am I lying to you?

713
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,800
I'll be counting on you.

714
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Why are you here?

715
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Why are you here, too?

716
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Maybe the workers threw it out by accident.

717
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Do they think it's unnecessary?

718
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
No.

719
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Look, how clean and beautiful the flowers are.

720
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Eternal flowers are really different.

721
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Take it home and enjoy it.

722
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Are you crazy?

723
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Why should I take it home?

724
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Mom!

725
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
You've eaten a lot.

726
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
You don't usually eat.

727
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
It's crispy and delicious like chips.

728
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Mr. Lin is really amazing.

729
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
You must remember to thank him.

730
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,800
But you've helped him to build a new building.

731
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
You've done it.

732
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
You won't have any chance to meet him.

733
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Have you started looking for a job?

734
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Actually, I've found a new job.

735
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
I'm selling my products.

736
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Mr. Lin asked me to be the project manager.

737
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,800
I'll be responsible for packaging design and marketing.

738
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Mr. Lin is so nice to you.

739
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Yes.

740
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,800
He asked you to buy a house and let you stick to it.

741
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Now he even gives you a job.

742
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,800
It seems that he really has a special interest in you.

743
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
You always think about these things.

744
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
He thinks I'm good at working, okay?

745
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
I don't remember taking out the soup.

746
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Here.

747
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Drink it while it's hot.

748
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
What's this?

749
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Single-sex three-phase chicken soup.

750
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
I saw you learning it on the phone.

751
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
It's good for your blood circulation.

752
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Drink it while it's hot.

753
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Little girl, help me drink some.

754
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
I'm tired of drinking it every day.

755
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Drink it.

756
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,800
The selling point of our drug oil is the grass and the green.

757
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Do we achieve the common green?

758
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,800
But I can't imagine the effect of green packaging paper.

759
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
You don't have to use packaging paper.

760
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
The whole bottle is green.

761
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,800
Try to imagine a light green sandglass bottle.

762
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Good idea.

763
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Little girl, I made a bowl of soup for you.

764
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Put it here. I'm working.

765
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Call Mr. Lin.

766
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Yes. Go out.

767
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,800
Mr. Lin, I'm Ying Chen's father.

768
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Father?

769
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Hello, uncle.

770
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,800
I've recovered after a while.

771
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
I haven't thanked you in person.

772
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
You're welcome.

773
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Would you like to have tea with me tomorrow noon?

774
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
I'll treat you.

775
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
It's rare to have you. Of course I'll go.

776
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
It's decided then. See you tomorrow.

777
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Father.

778
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Okay, see you tomorrow.

779
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Mr. Lin, I'm sorry.

780
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
My father is more enthusiastic.

781
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
Let's talk about it when we get back to the company tomorrow.

782
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Okay, it's okay. Bye.

783
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Okay, bye.

784
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Father, I'm working now.

785
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Mr. Lin is very good.

786
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,800
The most important thing is that he treats your sister well.

787
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
It's rare.

788
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Father, I have a lot of things to do.

789
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
I have to get up early tomorrow.

790
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
You go out.

791
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
I don't want to control you.

792
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
I just want to know if you're doing well.

793
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Is the money enough?

794
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Is it hard to work?

795
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm okay.

796
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
I'm okay.

797
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Good morning.

798
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Good morning.

799
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Good morning, sister.

800
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Come on, drink the soup first.

801
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
You have to drink soup for breakfast.

802
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
I have to drink it every day.

803
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
It's too much.

804
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Drink it while it's hot.

805
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
It's good for your blood.

806
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,800
Yes, drink it now.

807
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
I have to drink it every day.

808
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,800
If I don't drink it, will I feel sick?

809
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
I won't fart.

810
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Today is the first day of work.

811
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
You have to do it well.

812
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Sister, remember to make a tea this noon.

813
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
I know.

814
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Hurry up.

815
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Bye.

816
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Bye, sister.

817
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Come on.

818
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
Bye.

819
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Colleagues, let me introduce a new colleague.

820
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
You've all seen it.

821
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Miss Luo Yingchen.

822
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
She helped me design the Qilou building.

823
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Her design is very good.

824
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
So I invited her to be our new product's project manager.

825
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Hello, colleagues.

826
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
In addition to the design of the city,

827
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,800
Rachel can also help in marketing.

828
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Rachel, this is Helen, the executive director of the sales department.

829
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
She has been with me for many years.

830
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
If you have any questions, you can ask her.

831
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Hello, Helen.

832
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
I came here on the first day.

833
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
We will definitely cooperate a lot.

834
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
So please be kind to me.

835
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Our culture here is beautiful.

836
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
The best is the first.

837
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Even if the boss is here, I will say so.

838
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Xiao Mei, Michael, Jie Zai are from our sales department.

839
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
As for me, I don't need to introduce.

840
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
I'm in charge of the warehouse here.

841
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
These three are with me.

842
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Please tell me your names.

843
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Bai, Qiao, Feng.

844
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Hello.

845
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
Rachel, that's your seat.

846
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
If you have any questions, ask me.

847
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
Keep working.

848
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Thank you.

849
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Come on.

850
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Rachel, let's have lunch together.

851
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
I have a lot to do.

852
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Let's meet tomorrow.

853
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Okay.

854
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
What do you want to eat?

855
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Rachel.

856
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
You came just in time.

857
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
I have some ideas.

858
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
No, we are leaving.

859
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
We have an appointment with uncle for lunch.

860
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Don't you remember?

861
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Yes.

862
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
I forgot about it when I was busy.

863
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
We will come back later.

864
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
I'm so happy.

865
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,800
We can eat fried chicken, fried fish and fried oil fish later.

866
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Yes.

867
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
You should walk carefully.

868
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Brother.

869
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
What's wrong with you?

870
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
I don't know.

871
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
I feel a little dizzy.

872
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,800
I feel a little bloated.

873
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
My stomach is not comfortable.

874
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Sit there and have a rest.

875
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
I will go to the bathroom.

876
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
What's wrong with my dad?

877
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
How is he?

878
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Dad, what's wrong with you?

879
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
Uncle, what's wrong with you?

880
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
I feel a little bloated.

881
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Can you tell me if your pain comes from your chest or stomach?

882
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,800
It's from the chest and the middle of the stomach.

883
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Let me check it for you.

884
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Is it because of the heart?

885
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
My dad had a surgery on his chest.

886
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Did you eat anything?

887
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Just a normal breakfast.

888
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
He also had chicken soup.

889
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Yes, he had chicken soup for his third child.

890
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
Your dad had a heart surgery.

891
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
He should take the anti-cancer medicine.

892
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
But he has a third child.

893
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
He can turn into a fish.

894
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
He should have a fight with the Western medicine.

895
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
I suspect he has a bleeding stomach.

896
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
I suggest you go to the hospital.

897
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
I will take him there.

898
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
OK, take your time.

899
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
What's wrong with you?

900
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Are you OK?

901
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,800
Sis, don't run.

902
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Sis, calm down.

903
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Uncle, hold her.

904
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
Don't run.

905
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Sorry, sis.

906
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Sis, sis, sis.

907
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
Sis, sis, sis.

908
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
Sis, sis, sis.

909
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Sis, sis, sis.

910
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Sis, sis.

911
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
Sis, sis, what's wrong with you?

912
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,800
Sis, sis.

913
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
Stop, calm down.

914
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Call an ambulance.

915
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Yingying, how are you?

916
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Don't worry, it's OK.

917
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
I...I need an ambulance.

918
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,800
I need to get to the science tube.

919
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Sis.

920
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Yingying.

921
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
Yingying.

922
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Yingying.

923
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,520
I can't stay away from you and night again.

924
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,640
Look.

925
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,400
You can't run.

926
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,360
But...

927
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,760
You can pay a gift.

928
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,960
Lin programmed shit

929
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,200
by不錯.

930
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,600
and it always falls and hurts.

931
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,160
I have tried many methods but I can't improve them.

932
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,280
In addition to long-term pain and sleep problems,

933
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,320
it may be a systematic health problem

934
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,200
with a weak brain, central nerve and blood vessels.

935
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,640
Try the brain exercise I taught you before.

936
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,120
It can improve neck and brain blood circulation

937
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,720
and can help you.
