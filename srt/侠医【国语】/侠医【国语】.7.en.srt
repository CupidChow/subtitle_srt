1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What's going on?

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Boss, what's going on?

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What's going on?

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What's going on?

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
She was the one who woke me up.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Really?

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm a sister. I take care of my sister.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let her take the medicine.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Your sister said that.

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You really have to think for yourself.

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll try to change my clothes.

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Wait.

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What's wrong?

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Look over there.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's wrong?

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Lin Wei Ming and Xiao Mei hugged each other.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No, no, no.

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Aunt, it's not like that.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Because I saw her have a neck injury.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Her neck is not comfortable.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I was afraid that she would get sick.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So I helped her to stretch out.

53
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's just...

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Mom, it's not what you think.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Then who is the one who has a neck injury?

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not the one who has a neck injury.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Then, who has experienced this kind of injury?

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why are you hugging and pulling yourself up?

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Aunt, actually, it's like this.

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Our neck is also this part.

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's a twisted tendon.

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The temperament is blood.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Blood is painful.

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Pain is inevitable.

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can't ignore it.

66
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
After Mr. Lin helped me to stretch out,

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
my neck really got better.

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You are all so old.

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can do whatever you want.

70
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Sister, come here.

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Help mom cook together.

72
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you.

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Really better?

74
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Much better.

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll go change.

76
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mr. Lin, this is a normal meal.

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't mind it.

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
My favorite food is this normal meal.

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But today,

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
isn't there a lot of fried food?

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Didn't I tell you before

82
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
that if you don't feed my sister what she wants to eat,

83
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
she will get angry?

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I also know that fried food is unhealthy.

85
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But my daughter

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
eats fried food better than not eating.

87
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No bones are good for your health.

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No fruits are good for your health.

89
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No food is good for your health.

90
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You need to eat balanced food

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
so that you can get better.

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm a good person.

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I eat crispy food.

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Aunt, I also have crispy food.

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Please eat.

96
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Wait a minute.

97
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Aunt, these are crispy like fries.

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Try it.

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Delicious.

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Crispy.

101
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When I was eating with Ying Ying,

102
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I found that

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
she really enjoyed the crispy food

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
that has sound.

105
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So she doesn't have to eat fried food.

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Apple is flat and healthy.

107
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It also helps to eliminate oiliness.

108
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's cool,

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
it's warm and dry.

110
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's also good for your health.

111
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I also like the sound of the sound.

112
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's good for your health.

113
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's good for your health.

114
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's good for your health.

115
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's good for your health.

116
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's cool,

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
it's warm and dry.

118
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's good for your stomach.

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Both foods are good for your health.

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Mr. Ling is really good.

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No matter how we force him,

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
he won't eat.

123
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can do it.

124
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Your father knows that you like vegetables.

125
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He will be very happy.

126
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
By the way,

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
how is your uncle?

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Much better.

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But the doctor said

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
he needs to stay for a few more days

131
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
to be able to leave the hospital.

132
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Little girl,

133
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
you will stay here to help me, right?

134
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
By the way,

135
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
don't mind it.

136
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Actually, I think

137
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
you should move back

138
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and live with them.

139
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's rare for a family

140
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
to be able to get along well.

141
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You should cherish

142
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
the time you spent together.

143
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Actually, I have this plan.

144
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I moved back.

145
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's not that easy to get away.

146
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank you.

147
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And you may think

148
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
your sister is a kind of pressure.

149
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But I can see that

150
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
she is very nervous.

151
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
She found that she can't wake you up.

152
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The whole person is in a panic.

153
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I know.

154
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Little girl, you're back.

155
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Take porridge for Dad.

156
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

157
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Your dad said the hospital food was not good.

158
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He said the soup was too bland.

159
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So I made porridge for him.

160
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I put enough ingredients.

161
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Look at me.

162
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I haven't even sat down.

163
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Now I'm rushing to go to the hospital.

164
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm rushing to send him food.

165
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let me help you.

166
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No need.

167
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I want to see your dad too.

168
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
To be honest,

169
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I can do it quickly

170
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
if I'm alone.

171
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But to take your sister with me...

172
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mom, you want to take me to see Dad?

173
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No.

174
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll watch TV with you later.

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mom,

176
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll move back and live in a rented house.

177
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll help take care of my sister.

178
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't worry.

179
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Really?

180
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You heard Mr. Ling's advice, right?

181
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I didn't expect Mr. Ling to say one word

182
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
that's more useful than me saying ten words.

183
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What do you want to say?

184
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Both my sister and I like Lin Weiming.

185
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If you like him, then you like him.

186
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's none of my business.

187
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I like him, but you don't like him.

188
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you like him, I don't like him.

189
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No, little girl.

190
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Actually, you and Mr. Ling are a good match.

191
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Think about it.

192
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Think about it.

193
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't worry, Mrs. Ling.

194
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll send you there on time.

195
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry to have you send me there in a hurry.

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Did they say they were in a hurry to see you?

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't know.

198
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's Tu.

199
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He suddenly called me and said he wanted me to go.

200
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll talk to him.

201
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Then you have to be careful.

202
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You know how dangerous their father and son are.

203
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Anyway, don't sign whatever he tells you to sign.

204
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I told you it wasn't this one.

205
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How many times do I have to tell you to remember?

206
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He called the reporter to come.

207
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's a long time.

208
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's okay.

209
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Dad, mom, aunt is here.

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Sister, you're here.

211
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm sorry. I'll introduce you.

212
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is my sister.

213
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
She is the director of our company.

214
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
She is also the founder of Ren Yuan.

215
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Mrs. Ling Ren Yuan.

216
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hello, Mrs. Ling.

217
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I've prepared the machine.

218
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Please wait a moment.

219
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sister, don't worry.

220
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll ask the reporter to do a small interview.

221
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Do some publicity.

222
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can do these things.

223
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I haven't been to the company for a long time.

224
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm afraid I'll say something wrong.

225
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They want to know how my brother-in-law started his family.

226
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Who knows this better than you?

227
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes, aunt.

228
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You are the board of directors of the company.

229
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
How can publicity be less than you?

230
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm not used to facing the camera.

231
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't be nervous.

232
00:07:38,000 --> 00:08:01,680
Sister, it's all the fault of this

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But your father is a drug addict.

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Your son is a drug addict.

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You said that there is no relationship between the two families.

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It seems that it is not clear.

237
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You have already left the topic.

239
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I think I'm going to end today's interview.

240
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Since Lin Ren Yuan and Lin Weiming's father and son are both drug addicts.

241
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Why does Lin Weiming make another stove?

242
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He has another brand.

243
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Then we have to ask Ren Yuan's health care.

244
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I want to ask Mrs. Ling.

245
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Did he pass on the formula to his son?

246
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
My son is not in the company.

247
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He established his own door.

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He developed another kind of drug oil.

249
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He is also a drug addict.

250
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then will it be using his father's formula?

251
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He did follow his father when he was young.

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Learn how to make drug oil

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It will affect

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Ren Yuan's health care oil was created by your father.

255
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You created the sell and sell.

256
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you want to call for everyone to buy

257
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What kind of drug oil will you buy?

258
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The consumer can choose a drug oil that suits his body according to his needs.

259
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Finally, I hope everyone can recognize the brand.

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Which one is the old self-satisfaction?

261
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
If one side is the original product

262
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The other side is Zhao Hu Luo Hua Piao

263
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I believe that smart consumers will not support the mountain debt.

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You must know how to choose.

265
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This episode is almost over.

266
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
See you next time. Bye bye.

267
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If you have a positive energy, you have to have a positive track.

268
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Recognize Ren Yuan's health care oil

269
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Help you sell and sell.

270
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What is the positive track?

271
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's just chasing after our dad to attack.

272
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Enough, stop talking.

273
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I went and knew that it was going to be an interview.

274
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't know how to talk.

275
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Worried about saying the wrong thing

276
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I would have listened to A Zu if I knew it.

277
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Forget it, mom.

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You can't blame you. You said the truth.

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
They deliberately tricked us.

280
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Ren Yuan's health care oil formula is indeed original.

281
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How about this?

282
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's find the opponent TV station.

283
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll do an interview to clarify the whole thing.

284
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Isn't that getting bigger and bigger?

285
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I just don't want to continue making trouble.

286
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't want my mom to be a good daughter-in-law.

287
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Otherwise, everyone will think that we really plagiarized Ren Yuan.

288
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The fact is that my dad inspired me to sell and sell.

289
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Our ingredients are similar.

290
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What's there to clarify?

291
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's okay, mom. Don't worry.

292
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This money is really worth it.

293
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Last time, Ah Ming made us lose three million.

294
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm so worried about him.

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm afraid he will lose this time.

296
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What I like the most is to say his son

297
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
sold his son's goods through his mother.

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's funny to think about it.

299
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's what I said.

300
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But even if we make a profit,

301
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
we still have to give half of our share to aunt.

302
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You and your father are fighting for life.

303
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
They both sit on the ground and divide the money.

304
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What can I do?

305
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Who told my sister to have half of Ren Yuan's shares?

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There's no way.

307
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
As long as aunt has half of the shares,

308
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
we have to be restricted by her.

309
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So I want to leave for her.

310
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What are you going to do?

311
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll take it one step at a time.

312
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Now, we have to store the ammunition.

313
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
At the best time,

314
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
we have to swallow the entire Ren Yuan's factory.

315
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's go.

316
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's go.

317
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Hi.

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're here so late.

319
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I want to measure my size.

320
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
How about you?

321
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You're still practicing at this late hour.

322
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and the gold valley.

323
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then,

324
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
instead of hiding it in your heart,

325
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
you'd better vent it out.

326
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Do you know what happened?

327
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Are you okay?

328
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm fine.

329
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The emperor said in the inner capital,

330
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yin and Yang are the principles of heaven and earth.

331
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yin and Yang will change and balance.

332
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Don't be persistent in what happened.

333
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You should think about how to adapt it

334
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and how to change it.

335
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
How can we change it?

336
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Shouldn't we make medicine oil and cream?

337
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's right.

338
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
My dad makes medicine oil and I make it too.

339
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
There will be a comparison between one bottle of medicine oil and another.

340
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If I make two or three more medicine oils,

341
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the differences between our companies will be much greater.

342
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Much greater?

343
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Then, can your company make more products?

344
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The concept of selling and selling through the city

345
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
is to provide a simple method

346
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
to help Hong Kong people get rid of their fatigue.

347
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's right.

348
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You can really try it.

349
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I think you should make a good medicine oil first.

350
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I promise you.

351
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll do some research.

352
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll wait for you.

353
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll leave the decoration to you.

354
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll focus on the research.

355
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Leave this to me.

356
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I really want to buy this building.

357
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But it's really old.

358
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The decoration will be very expensive.

359
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's a third-class historical building.

360
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
My responsibility is to protect it.

361
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The key is to preserve the characteristics of the building

362
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and at the same time, to meet the needs of the modern people.

363
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Don't run!

364
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You'll feel much better after I rub it for you.

365
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's so comfortable.

366
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You don't like the smell?

367
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm giving my all

368
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I know I could fall

369
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If you let go

370
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So why you been running around

371
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Just tell me why you run

372
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You won't let me down

373
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Just let me know

374
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Why you been running around

375
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Just tell me why you run

376
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You won't let me down

377
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Just let me know

378
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why you been running around

379
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Just tell me why you run

380
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You won't let me down

381
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Just let me know

382
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Why you been running around

383
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Just let me know

384
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Love is lost

385
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And I'm feeling better than ever

386
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And whatever we do

387
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We'll do it together

388
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
One of these smiles is nothing

389
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Compared to this day

390
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We will laugh and we will make

391
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,600
I'll make you cause I don't pray

392
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,000
I've got a good new feeling

393
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,720
When did you come?

394
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,400
You didn't want to see me?

395
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,600
I didn't want to bother you

396
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,800
I was thinking of the furniture cabinet

397
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,520
I want to put a set of red wood chairs and tea machines here

398
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,480
because we have guests.

399
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,480
I want to put a glass shelf here.

400
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,680
And a small cabinet here.

401
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,520
Then we can...

402
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,680
We can put my dad's old stuff there.

403
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,520
And over there.

404
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,360
I've made up my mind.

405
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,000
We should put a white cabinet here.

406
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,080
White cabinet.

407
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,360
You're thinking of me.

408
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,560
How about it?

409
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,000
What do you think of the decoration here?

410
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,840
I think your idea is better than mine.

411
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,000
That's great.

412
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,840
Thank you.

413
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,760
You're welcome.

414
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,680
Mr. Deng,

415
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,840
why do you want to see me?

416
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,520
Do you want to drink?

417
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,520
If you don't want to drink,

418
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,680
it has nothing to do with work.

419
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Then I'll leave.

420
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,360
Be serious.

421
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,080
I have business to do for you.

422
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,280
Don't lie to me.

423
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,840
I've thought about the house I bought for you.

424
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,760
I won't move in.

425
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,800
Do you want to rent it out?

426
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,480
Rent it out?

427
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,360
It's good.

428
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,160
How much?

429
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,440
Do you have any special requirements?

430
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,080
For example,

431
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,680
you can't live in a house with kids or pets.

432
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,440
No special requirements.

433
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,400
It doesn't matter if you can rent it out.

434
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,440
If you have time and like it,

435
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,640
you can live in it.

436
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,080
Stop it.

437
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Your wife and your grandma will kill each other.

438
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,840
I don't know what to do.

439
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,280
No.

440
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,600
Why are you staring at me?

441
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,840
Dad, are you eating in the club?

442
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,520
Yes.

443
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,880
I'm drinking tea alone.

444
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,800
What's wrong?

445
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,760
I have an appointment with President Yin.

446
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,640
Okay.

447
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,560
We have to treat them to a meal.

448
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,640
If it weren't for their help,

449
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,880
how could we have paid off A Min?

450
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,600
Go ahead.

451
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,480
I don't care.

452
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll go to the club with you.

453
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,320
I'll go there after I park the car.

454
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,040
You drink first.

455
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,880
Bye.

456
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,880
Okay, don't say anymore.

457
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,480
Your wife is here.

458
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,200
Your son killed him.

459
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,840
I'll go first.

460
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
So I always say

461
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,600
you're the most sensible.

462
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,400
Sorry.

463
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,480
Rent the house out.

464
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,680
Okay, don't worry.

465
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,360
Pay more.

466
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,960
Bye.

467
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,400
Chairman Zhu, thank you so much this time.

468
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm under you,

469
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:59,400
aligning all the Will's

470
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,720
Really?

471
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,200
I didn't know

472
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
We have a lot of goods.

473
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,600
We have a lot of goods. How much do you want?

474
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,680
Of course we have goods.

475
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
But the price may have to be discussed again.

476
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,320
Before, I gave you a 80% discount on the sales.

477
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
Don't you want to do a land price?

478
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,560
How can we?

479
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,920
We are business partners.

480
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,480
But now you earn more than ten yuan per bottle.

481
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,760
You sell well.

482
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,640
Five yuan per bottle of tea water.

483
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,560
It's not too much, right?

484
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,160
Cheers.

485
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,440
Hello, Mr. A.

486
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,080
Where are you?

487
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,360
Do you want to have dinner together?

488
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,120
Okay.

489
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
I'll send you the location. You can pick me up.

490
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,800
Okay.

491
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Where is your brother?

492
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,120
Is he at the company?

493
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,680
He should be here at this time. What's wrong?

494
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,800
Go to your company.

495
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,320
Aren't we going to have dinner?

496
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,160
Why go to the company?

497
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,200
There's no food at the company.

498
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,880
No.

499
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,760
I don't have an appetite recently.

500
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,600
And sometimes my stomach hurts.

501
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,920
You taught me too fast.

502
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,560
It doesn't work.

503
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,720
So I'm going to ask your brother for help.

504
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,000
You should know that

505
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,280
there is no difference between who teaches you.

506
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,480
The biggest problem is that you just finished learning.

507
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,960
So it's not easy to see the effect.

508
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,320
You are not a good teacher.

509
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,640
You should be more careful.

510
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm not a good teacher.

511
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,800
I'm not a good teacher.

512
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
I'm not a good teacher.

513
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,480
Actually, I think the effect is effective.

514
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
But it's gone.

515
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,600
Really? You don't have the medicine?

516
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,080
You should have said earlier.

517
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,000
We go back to the company now.

518
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,120
I'll get you a box, okay?

519
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,720
Okay.

520
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Can you go now?

521
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,880
Your mom called me.

522
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,640
She just finished flying.

523
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,760
She asked me to pick her up.

524
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,000
Do you remember?

525
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,880
What did you say?

526
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,600
I saw Natalie when I came here.

527
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,600
She's just a housewife.

528
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Do you want to be so long-term?

529
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,320
What?

530
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,640
Your mom is too troublesome

531
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,120
to move in.

532
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,880
So I have to help her to rent it out.

533
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,840
It's empty there.

534
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,120
Don't blame it on your mom.

535
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,480
You bought the house yourself.

536
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,160
If mom knows you bought a house to make a cow,

537
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
it will be more convenient.

538
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,120
I lost 3 million yuan for the building.

539
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,520
Your mom is getting old.

540
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,000
She scolds me every day.

541
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,640
I feel so bad.

542
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,040
Now I rent the house

543
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,200
and find a cow to play.

544
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,120
Can you make up for my loss?

545
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,080
How much can you make up for the rent?

546
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,560
What we just talked about

547
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,080
is the only way to make money.

548
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,080
Please don't be so stubborn.

549
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,480
Learn how to make money, dad.

550
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,480
This way.

551
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,440
Brother.

552
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,040
Ming.

553
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,560
I bought some porridge

554
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,200
for Wei Tong.

555
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,320
I also bought some

556
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,320
fried noodles with fried dough sticks, beef tongue and fried noodles with soy sauce.

557
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,200
By the way, Ming.

558
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,800
I feel uncomfortable

559
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,000
in my room recently.

560
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,520
Can you lend me a hand?

561
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:10,920
Yes.

562
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,840
I'm here.

563
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,360
Please help me.

564
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
I'll get you some medicine oil.

565
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,480
Do you still drink?

566
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,080
No.

567
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,800
I've listened to you since that day.

568
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,040
I don't drink.

569
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,720
But

570
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,640
where should I put the medicine oil

571
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,680
you gave me?

572
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,160
About three fingers above the belly button.

573
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,040
Then press it hard.

574
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,200
That's it.

575
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,040
But I don't know how hard I should press it.

576
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,720
Should I press it until it hurts?

577
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,280
Just press it until you feel a little bit sour.

578
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,720
Do you mind

579
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,760
showing me?

580
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,000
This position is probably

581
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,520
this place.

582
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,720
Do you feel sour?

583
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,680
And then...

584
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,040
Miss Luo, you're looking for the boss?

585
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,000
Yes.

586
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,160
He's in the kitchen.

587
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,080
Thank you.

588
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,280
Richo.

589
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,800
Are you looking for my boss?

590
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,640
No.

591
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,160
He said that when he was arranging the building,

592
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,320
he could use the things his dad had in the clinic.

593
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,600
I'm here to see what he has.

594
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,240
Don't bother him.

595
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,480
Those things are in the warehouse.

596
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,520
Okay. Thank you.

597
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,160
If you keep pressing it in this position,

598
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,920
you can see the skin and smell the body.

599
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,320
It will help you.

600
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,000
durian

601
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,880
You can do it for a long time by making whole box.

602
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,760
Great.

603
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,920
Girls don't usually have enough strength.

604
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,480
Press down

605
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,480
You two are really good to me.

606
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Actually, there's one thing I think I must tell you.

607
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
What is it?

608
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,480
I saw Henry and his father eating with the chairman of the pharmacy.

609
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
They were a team.

610
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,480
No wonder every pharmacy said they would withdraw the goods.

611
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
It turns out to be a collusion.

612
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,480
And I overheard that the biggest advantage of the pharmacy is that it can be 80% in the far-fetched.

613
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
But Henry is not satisfied.

614
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,480
After helping him, he suddenly asked for it.

615
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,480
It means that Shikeng has been giving those pharmacies discounts.

616
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,480
When they monopolize the market, they will start selling on the ground.

617
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
You guessed half right.

618
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,480
They still took 80% of the goods and didn't start selling on the ground.

619
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,480
But they need to pay 5% of the price to their father and son privately.

620
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Isn't that a return?

621
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
This is illegal.

622
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
I'll go to the police and arrest them.

623
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
The personnel is my father's hard work.

624
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
I won't let them mess up.

625
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
I will follow up on this matter.

626
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Thank you for telling me.

627
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
It's Rachel.

628
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
What is she doing here?

629
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
Rachel, why are you sitting here?

630
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
You are injured.

631
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Yes, I accidentally twisted it.

632
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Get in the car.

633
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
I'll give you a ride after I deliver the bags.

634
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
You left so quickly.

635
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
Is it not suitable for the building?

636
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
No, it's all suitable.

637
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,480
All of Ming's father's things are treasures.

638
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
I took them all.

639
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Yes.

640
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Ming's father used to run a clinic.

641
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,480
No wonder he did so well in massage.

642
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,480
Today, I had a stomachache for a whole day.

643
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Thank god Ming helped me massage.

644
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
I feel better now.

645
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,480
Ming is really good.

646
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
He is the boss.

647
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
He doesn't run a massage clinic.

648
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
I don't think about that.

649
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
I always think about how to help others.

650
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
That's great.

651
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
I think if I massage myself,

652
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
I won't feel better without Ming.

653
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Do you know that his strength

654
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
was very strong just now?

655
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
He was very strong.

656
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
Get in the car.

657
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
I'm going to buy something here.

658
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
We'll wait for you to buy something.

659
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,480
No need. I don't want to be helped by others.

660
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Thank you.

661
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Be careful.

662
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Auntie.

663
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Ming, do you have something important to tell me?

664
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Auntie, I don't want to talk anymore.

665
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
You are the accountant.

666
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,480
Did you find that the company's accounts are strange?

667
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
I don't understand what you mean.

668
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Someone told me that

669
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Uncle and his cousin

670
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
colluded with the people of the pharmacy.

671
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
They are hiding from the company

672
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
and are buying things in private.

673
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Who did you tell that to?

674
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,480
This is a very serious accusation.

675
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Did they even lie to you?

676
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Yes or no,

677
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,480
only you can find the answer.

678
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Ming, you've been away from the company for so long.

679
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
The company's secret is the internal finances.

680
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Auntie, you are right.

681
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
I am an outsider in the company.

682
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,480
But in private, my mother is still the shareholder.

683
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
If my cousin and uncle

684
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
do something that is not visible,

685
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
they are not only lying to the company,

686
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
but also my mother,

687
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
who is also your sister.

688
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
If my cousin and my sister-in-law

689
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
know that I am helping you,

690
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
I will be in trouble.

691
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Ming knows that there is a problem,

692
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
he doesn't care.

693
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
If things get worse,

694
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
and the police are alerted,

695
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
there will be no way to end it.

696
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
I don't think you want to do this.

697
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Okay, I'll go back and check.

698
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,480
Give me some time.

699
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
Okay.

700
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
You don't have to explain

701
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,480
the accounting to us.

702
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Just do what you usually do.

703
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Okay?

704
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
I know.

705
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
But I've been checking the accounts

706
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
several times and I can't get it right.

707
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,480
The shipping price is more than 80,000 yuan

708
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
from the 10-hand payment.

709
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Don't be nervous.

710
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
It's very likely that

711
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,480
there is a temporary discount on the goods.

712
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
You can find another account.

713
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Yes, aunt.

714
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
We are a family business.

715
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
If there is a discount on the account,

716
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
we can find another one to compensate.

717
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
The interest you gave me,

718
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,480
I can also take a turn to get it.

719
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
But this time, the difference is too big.

720
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
It's hard for me to pass this level

721
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
and it's hard for Shen Ji.

722
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Xia, you're here.

723
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
You can pay me back for these receipts.

724
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Sister-in-law,

725
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
I can also pay back

726
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
the famous bags I bought.

727
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,480
I can also say that I bought them for my clients.

728
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
But I really don't know

729
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
what business I should start with

730
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
these receipts for beauty and massage.

731
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,480
You don't know?

732
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Do you want me to teach you?

733
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
You're an accountant.

734
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Of course you have to be flexible.

735
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
You can figure it out yourself.

736
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
I don't want to help you.

737
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
You have so many accounts to deal with.

738
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
You can't even get a single account.

739
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
Even if I have three or six coins, I can't get it right.

740
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
If this continues, I'll be in trouble.

741
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Hey, you're challenging us.

742
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
That's not what I meant.

743
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Aunt, I'll take care of it.

744
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
You can leave now.

745
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Hey, wife, forget it.

746
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
She's my sister.

747
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,480
We didn't do anything wrong to her.

748
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
She didn't even think about it.

749
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Her husband left them

750
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
and left their mother and son.

751
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
If it weren't for my brother-in-law

752
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
who helped her get the house back,

753
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
they would have been sleeping on the street.

754
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
I'm sorry.

755
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
Mo Jiaxin, how many times have you said that

756
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
you don't care about the water?

757
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
Are you happy when you burn the house?

758
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
I'm talking to you.

759
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Can you answer me?

760
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
What's wrong with you?

761
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
You're here every day.

762
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
You're not like a human or a ghost.

763
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,480
Are you dumb?

764
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
Can you say something?

765
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Let me go.

766
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
I really won't be your mother.

767
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Go away.

768
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Go away.

769
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Go away.

770
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Go away.

771
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
Don't come back.

772
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480
Go away.

773
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Brother, did the doctor reply to you?

774
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,480
He said he would check, but didn't reply.

775
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
He said he didn't find it.

776
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,480
He can't be in a hurry.

777
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
He can't believe it.

778
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
He checked his own people.

779
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
He said he couldn't find it later.

780
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,480
After all, grandma is rare to give us information.

781
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
You seem to be nervous, but not a man.

782
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
Of course not.

783
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,480
What I'm most nervous about is my mother's shareholder rights.

784
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
You're still here so late.

785
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
I'm here to see A Min.

786
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
I'm sorry.

787
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
I'm here again.

788
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
I want you to help me press it.

789
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
And I want to praise your medicine oil.

790
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
I pressed it a few times.

791
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
I really feel much better.

792
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
You're so kind.

793
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
The most important thing is to keep the balance.

794
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
It's not enough to press it twice.

795
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
My brother is always very capable.

796
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
It's their father and son who have been blackmailing us.

797
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
By the way, did you find any evidence?

798
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
I'm looking for someone to check.

799
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Don't back down.

800
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Don't say family again.

801
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Remember, being kind to others is cruel to yourself.

802
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Okay, okay.

803
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
I'll call auntie now.

804
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Are you satisfied?

805
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Hello, auntie.

806
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Is it convenient to say a few words?

807
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Hello, auntie.

808
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,480
A Zu, auntie said that Jia Jun didn't wear shoes when he went out.

809
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
So he shouldn't have gone very far.

810
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
I can understand why he doesn't remember to bring his phone.

811
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Why didn't he even wear shoes?

812
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Why didn't he wear shoes?

813
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,480
You don't understand what the child thinks.

814
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
You'd better drive carefully.

815
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Pick up the phone.

816
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
What's wrong?

817
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
I told you to pick up the phone.

818
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Can't you hear me?

819
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
What are you doing?

820
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Jia Jun.

821
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Why did you pick it up?

822
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
What are you doing?

823
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
There are so many wives and children.

824
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
Who are you?

825
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
I'm telling you now.

826
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
He broke my ball.

827
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
I'll pay you 5,000 yuan.

828
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
5,000 yuan?

829
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
You're so good at playing ball.

830
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
You won't roll to the street.

831
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
A Zu, ignore him.

832
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Single ball.

833
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Come on.

834
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Come on.

835
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Come on.

836
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Calm down.

837
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
Is the court used for fighting?

838
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
It's used for playing ball.

839
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
Playing ball?

840
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Who are you?

841
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Uncle.

842
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,480
Look at you.

843
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
You're so good at playing ball.

844
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
You're so good at playing ball.

845
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Okay, let's have a match.

846
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,480
5 points.

847
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
I'll let you play ball.

848
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
Okay.

849
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Nice.

850
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
5 points.

851
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
Nice.

852
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
Jia Jun, it's your turn.

853
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
Jia Jun, catch the ball.

854
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Be careful.

855
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Jia Jun, be careful.

856
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
No.

857
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Hurry up. Don't let them get close.

858
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Jia Jun, come on.

859
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
Jia Jun, don't be afraid.

860
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
Give yourself some confidence.

861
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
No.

862
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
No.

863
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
I can't stand it.

864
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Hurry up.

865
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Hurry up.

866
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
Go.

867
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Put on your shoes first.

868
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
It's so serious.

869
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
Don't catch it again.

870
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
Otherwise, it will lead to a hot and toxic competition.

871
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
The situation will only get worse.

872
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
It doesn't matter.

873
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
I'm used to it.

874
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
By the way, why did you run out alone?

875
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,480
My mom kicked me out.

876
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Did you do something?

877
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
I was hungry and cooked noodles.

878
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
I boiled water.

879
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Then she got a bad temper.

880
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
She rarely makes a scene.

881
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Does she usually do that?

882
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
She always does that.

883
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
She's always emotional.

884
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
She'll tell you if you tell her.

885
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Jia Jun.

886
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Aunt.

887
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Come in and sit.

888
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Okay.

889
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Sit.

890
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Actually, my cousin doesn't want to talk.

891
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
But at least he wants to come back with me.

892
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
The most important thing is that he's fine.

893
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
Yes.

894
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
By the way, aunt.

895
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Why didn't you tell me about your cousin?

896
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,480
Jia Jun didn't go to school and didn't want to work.

897
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,480
He was locked in the room every day.

898
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
He was staring at the computer every day.

899
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
He became invisible.

900
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
What do you want me to tell you?

901
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
The thing you asked me.

902
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
I'll be honest with you.

903
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
The account is very problematic.

904
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
There are more than 80,000.

905
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
But I won't help you testify for them.

906
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
Let alone testify.

907
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,480
My second sister-in-law asked me to pay the personal income.

908
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
I can't refuse.

909
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
After all, I still owe the company money.

910
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,480
If I get them in trouble.

911
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,480
I can't even get the property if I have to pay off my loan once.

912
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,480
But my dad has already said that you don't have to pay off the debt.

913
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,480
They will decide when your dad leaves.

914
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Pay off the debt half of the salary every month.

915
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
There is no bonus at the end of the year.

916
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
We save money and live a simple life.

917
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,480
Since I'm leaving.

918
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
I can only turn the other way.

919
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
I can't lose this job.

920
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
Otherwise, how can we live?

921
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
I'm being chased by someone.

922
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
I'm being chased until I'm crazy.

923
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
When will you pay off the debt?

924
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
Where is your sister?

925
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Where did she go?

926
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Did you see that Xia?

927
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
She didn't answer the phone or text message.

928
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Did she quit?

929
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
Could she have fallen asleep?

930
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
I'll call her to wake her up.

931
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
Mr. Ling, you can't go in.

932
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Mr. Ling.

933
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
I shouldn't come.

934
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
I shouldn't come here to be a nuisance.

935
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
I said you were busy.

936
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
But Mr. Ling said he would come.

937
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
I'm not busy.

938
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
I'm here to ask for a leave for Xiaoyi.

939
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
She doesn't know what to say.

940
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
She even needs an expert to talk nonsense.

941
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,480
Xiaoyi is a little anxious.

942
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
She needs a good rest.

943
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
I'm her family.

944
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,480
I'm here to ask for a leave for her.

945
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
I don't think it's a problem.

946
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,480
A family should care about each other.

947
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,480
Instead of bullying her.

948
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,480
She has to work so hard.

949
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
Do you know how much pressure she has?

950
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Cousin.

951
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
Don't say that we treat her like we treat her.

952
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
We're not treating her like we treat her.

953
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
We're not treating her like we treat her.

954
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Cousin.

955
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Don't say that we treat her like we treat her.

956
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,480
We have enough salary for her.

957
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,480
Xiaoyi was deducted half of her salary every month.

958
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
She used it to pay off her debt.

959
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
She didn't get enough salary.

960
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,480
She owes the company money.

961
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Don't you need to pay it back?

962
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
You think the company is a charity?

963
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
My dad helped Xiaoyi pay off her debt.

964
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
He never asked her to pay it back.

965
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Even if it's necessary to pay it back.

966
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Shouldn't we coordinate a reasonable payment time?

967
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
What about you?

968
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
You keep pressuring her.

969
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
You keep forcing her to do those illegal things.

970
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,480
What did you say?

971
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
I'm afraid that the company can't tell the difference between business and work.

972
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Aunt, you have to pay it back.

973
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
Don't do it too much.

974
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
What do you mean by family business?

975
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Because we're her family.

976
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
We trusted Xia and let her do it.

977
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
But Shen Ji is her family.

978
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Now Xiaoyi has to explain to them.

979
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
You see, she's a relative.

980
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
She does what she wants.

981
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
She doesn't do things according to the rules.

982
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,480
She did so many things that she can't see.

983
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
And she has to wipe her ass.

984
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Don't accuse us for lack of evidence.

985
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,480
I heard that you've been close to the people in the pharmacy.

986
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
It's good to cooperate closely.

987
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,480
But you can't forget how much we sell a bottle.

988
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
I set the price.

989
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
The wholesale price is 50.

990
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,480
It's best to remember.

991
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,480
Don't be so fast.

992
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
A bottle is less than ten yuan.

993
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,480
It's normal to change the price when doing business.

994
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,480
But I don't know where the money in the middle goes.

995
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,480
I don't need you to pay for my business.

996
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,480
If you want to teach me to do business, you'll go to the mall.

997
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,480
I'm giving you face.

998
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
You're a family.

999
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
Close the door.

1000
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,480
If you have anything to say, say it.

1001
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
If you don't want to say it,

1002
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
Then call my mom.

1003
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
Open the account.

1004
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Let's see it together.

1005
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
I really don't care.

1006
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,480
Many people think that the seasonal sensitive nose and runny nose

1007
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,240
may be related to seasonal pollen and

1008
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,480
In fact, many problems with the airway and skin allergy

1009
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,480
may be related to long-term stay and mental stress.

1010
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Or too dependent on antibiotics

1011
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,480
And affect your body's normal immune system.
