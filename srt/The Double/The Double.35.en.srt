00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,870
Master, from now on,
I will be stationed at the northern border

187
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,400
and inherit your mantle,

188
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,320
defending our country and homeland.

189
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,940
One day,

190
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,460
I will personally lead an army
to regain the lost territory

191
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,010
and avenge you.

[Memorial Tablet of General Xiao]

193
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,340
Am I the only one who thinks

194
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,300
that his crying looks fake?

195
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,530
I feel so too.

196
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,370
Your father is dead.
Why aren't you crying?

197
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,820
Father told me

198
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,980
if he dies in battle,

199
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,890
I should see him off with a smile.

200
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,300
But you aren't smiling either.

201
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,180
Maybe he didn't die in battle.

202
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,250
Do you want to investigate it?

203
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,850
Will you let me investigate it?

204
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,460
There are a few more persons

205
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,610
who I want you to check for me.

206
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,180
Don't you want to investigate me first?

207
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,300
Give me your hand.

208

The other hand.

209

Someone, take her to the sheepfold.

That will be her home from now on.

235

This situation is really rare.

It is truly a blessing from Heaven.

If I don't want this child,

can I get pregnant again in the future?

if you will be this lucky again.

241

has been dealt with.

Do you plan

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,810
to keep this child?

247
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,460
Disgraceful servant.

248
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,620
You are in no position to talk
about the child in my belly.

249
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,050
Your Highness's belly will grow
day by day.

250
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,660
It can't be hidden forever.

251
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,090
If His Majesty or others discover this,

252
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,730
I'm afraid we can't explain it.

Your Highness, you love that man
with all your heart.

If this is discovered,

255
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,460
His Majesty will surely not ignore it.

256

If this is that man's child,

257
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,700
I'm afraid his career will be ruined.

I'm not in a hurry.

263

The child in my belly
is less than a month old.

264

is to take good care
of the child in my belly.

Nowadays, people are unpredictable.

Even if you prepared long and hard
for a plan,

Your Highness is like this now.

297
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,330
How can I still be angry?

298
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,700
This child of mine was hard-earned,

to sanction our marriage.

Your Highness, aren't you worried

303
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,570
that if you ask
for His Majesty's blessing,

304
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,620
others will think that you were having
a secret affair with me?

to do?

Sure enough, the shot had to be fired.

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,620

Why are you so careless?

339
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,220
The Great Zhao
has really tight security.

340
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,380
I had to peel off two layers of skin
to get in.

341
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,810
Then why didn't you use
the bell I gave you?

342
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,730
How could those soldiers

343
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,250
possibly recognize your bell?

344
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,940
Then you can just tell them

345
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,700
you are Duke Su of Great Yan.

346

Who dare stop you?

347
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,860
I'm visiting in secret.

348
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,090
In secret?

349
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,980
So you are secretly here to see me?

350
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,250
I'm here to see your brother.

351
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,090
Whatever, I don't care.

352
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,660
Move along, don't stay here.

353
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,530
I didn't expect the Great Zhao's guards
to be so skilled.

354
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,420
If it weren't for Jiuyue's bells,

355
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,900
I'm afraid I would've died.

00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,330
How humorous, Duke Su.

With your skills, if you didn't want
to get caught,

358
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,050
it would be hard
for my Great Zhao guards to capture you.

359
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,460
You did this deliberately.

360
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,770
The sooner I am hurt and caught,

361
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,660
the less friction will be created,

362
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,700

00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,250
Lord Cheng's man had already come to me.

369
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,380
When Lord Cheng would lead the uprising
from the North,

370
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,900
Your Majesty only need to restrain them
at the Great Zhao border,

371
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,570
controlling the Yan army.

372
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,700
Zhao Ye would be surrounded
and would surely collapse at a touch.

373
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,770
When Lord Cheng becomes the emperor,
he will surely treat Great Zhao well.

374
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,810
Your Majesty has just driven away
the rebel forces in your country.

375
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,490
I trust you must be in need
of Great Yan's support.

376
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,660
If Your Majesty refuses to cooperate

377
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,620
and even aids Zhao Ye
in his stubborn resistance,

378
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,380
when Lord Cheng becomes the emperor,

379
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,220
he will surely want to clear his debt
with you.

380
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,900
Are you threatening me?

381
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,730
I dare not do so.

382
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,810
Lord Cheng is far more powerful
than Zhao Ye.

383
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,940
I just don't want Your Majesty
to make the wrong choice

384
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,050
and ruin the foundation
you have just laid.

385
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,860
Regarding the emperor of Great Yan
and Lord Cheng,

386
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,460
my ministers

387
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,140
have carefully discussed
and analyzed it.

388
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,900
Those who think
that the emperor will win

389
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,900
are less than half of them.

390
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,180
Duke Su, I hope you can understand.

391
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,140
If I help you,

392
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,090
I'm not just risking
my life and fortune.

393
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,010
I am betting the Great Zhao's fate.

394
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,220
No matter who wins,

395
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,660
as long as the victor

396
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,420
is willing to maintain peace
with Great Zhao,

397
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,460
I will accept it.

398
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,380
Your Majesty is waiting
for my bid, right?

399
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,460
If Your Majesty feel
that Lord Cheng is sure to win,

400
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,460
I'm afraid you would have agreed

401
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,490
to form an alliance with him.

402
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,010
Am I wrong?

403
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,980
This an internal affair
of the Great Yan.

404
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,980
The Great Zhao is a small country
with no influence on the conflict.

405
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,490
If Lord Cheng wins,

406
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,530
the Great Zhao will naturally
prepare a gift

407
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,460
to congratulate Lord Cheng.

408
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,900
Sending it then and sending it now

409
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,250
are two different situations.

410
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,900
So what does Lord Cheng want from me?

411
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,860
Didn't Your Majesty just form
an alliance with Great Yan?

412
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,090
Zhao Ye naturally thinks
that you are on his side.

413
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Lord Cheng doesn't want much.

414
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,090
As long as you continue
to feed him this illusion,

415
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,860
when Lord Cheng raises his army,

416
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,570
I hope Your Majesty will give us
your support in times of need.

417
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,490
Yes, I didn't accept
Lord Cheng's proposition.

418
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,810
But I don't necessarily have
to agree with yours.

419
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,180
His Majesty said

420
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,090
as long as Your Majesty helps us,

421
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,570
you can set the conditions.

422
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,770
You are just the icing on the cake
to Lord Cheng.

423
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,420
Even if he wins,

424
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,330
he won't necessarily be grateful to you.

425
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,380
But to His Majesty, you are a help
during a time of need.

426
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,900
He will definitely repay you.

427
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
Even if the emperor of Great Yan wins,

428
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,250
how can I ensure

429
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,860
that he will fulfill his promise?

430
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,570
Have Your Majesty personally entered
our country

431
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,140
and met our emperor?

432
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,660
Can't the sincerity of His Majesty

433
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:04,940
obtain your trust in return?

434
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,490
It's true, I can't trust him.

435
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:07,900
However,

436
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:09,730
I believe in you.

437
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,330
Are you willing to accept my conditions?

438
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,620
Have you heard that the Eldest Princess
is pregnant?

439
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,460
Nonsense. The Eldest Princess
doesn't even have a consort.

440
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,660
How could she be pregnant?

441
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,180
Shut up. Trust me,

442
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,380
the Eldest Princess is about
to recruit a consort.

443
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,090
Then who do you think this future
prince consort is?

444
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,090
I heard

445
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,250
that Mr. Shen was seen going in and out
of the Princess's Residence.

446
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,090
Do you think it could be him?

447
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,700
Just wait and see.

448
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,860
They won't accept it

449
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,090
if a child is born out of thin air
without a father.

450
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,420
True.

451
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,620
[Champion Scholar]
Mother, mother, where is Yurong?

452
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,490
He went to Hanlin Academy
early this morning.

453
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,700
Why are you in such a hurry to see him?

454
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,220
I heard that the Eldest Princess
is pregnant.

455
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,860
Did he tell you that?

456
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,620
Who told you?

457
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,420
Everyone on the streets is saying it.

458
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,770
Really?

459
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,050
If it were true, Yurong would have
told us already.

460
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,860
Has Yurong ever taken the initiative

461
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,940
to tell us about matters
between him and the Eldest Princess?

462
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,180
No, I have to go to Hanlin Academy now

463
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,180
and ask him what happened.

464
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,900
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]

465
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,490
Your Majesty.

466
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,770
I heard from Eunuch Su you haven't
drunk your medicine, Your Majesty.

467
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,420
It's getting more and more bitter.
I had taken a bowl.

468
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,980
Leave this bowl for a while more.

469
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,490
Your Majesty, you have caught the cold.

470
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,940
This medicine is both to cure
and to condition your body.

471
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,980
It's best to take two bowls at once.

472
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,730
I asked them to reheat it.

473
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,460
Your Majesty, you'd better drink it.

474
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,140
Or else I would worry about you.

475
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,250
You.

476
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,460
You always know how to make me
take my medicine.

477
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,140
Your Majesty, I heard a rumor recently.

478
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,900
What is it?

479
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,050
I heard that the Eldest Princess Wanning
is pregnant.

480
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,980
The rumor has even spread
to the palace now.

481
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,180
Wanning is not married.

482
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,090
How could there be such rumors?

483
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,050
How could there be
such outrageous rumors?

484
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,460
Yes, this matter will affect
the reputation of the royal family.

485
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,380
Do the people spreading this rumor

486
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,900
intend to harm the royal family?

487
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,010
What do you think I should do?

488
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,700
Send an imperial physician
to check Wanning's pulse.

489
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,730
The rumor will naturally be broken.

490
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:31,900
Good idea.

491
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,090
However, if an imperial physician
goes alone,

492
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,420
with Wanning's temperament,
I'm afraid they would be kicked out.

493
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,010
I am willing to go
with the imperial physician

494
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,620
to visit Wanning.

495
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,980
Since this rumor came out,

496
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,140
she doesn't go out much anymore.

497
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,810
I haven't seen her for a while, too.

498
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,570
Alright, thank you
for your hard work then.

499
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,140
It's my duty.

500
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,330
Hey, the Eldest Princess

501
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,330
seems to be pregnant.

502
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:00,860
Whose is it?

503
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,420
I don't know either.
I heard it from others.

504
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,980
Is it true?

505
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,460
It's hard to tell.

506
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,810
I don't think this is true.

507
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,980
When there's smoke, there's fire.

508
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,770
Have you found all the books
I asked you to find?

509
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,770
We are looking for it.

510
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,050
Yurong.

511
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,620
Let's speak outside.

512
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:33,860
Come.

513
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,290
Mother, what do you want from me?

514
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,620
What happened to you
and the Eldest Princess?

515
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,330
Rumors are spreading everywhere outside.

516
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,660
Rumors say that the Eldest Princess
is pregnant.

517
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,090
Everywhere? What does that mean?

518
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,250
It's all over the streets and alleys.

519
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,570
Don't leave yet. Talk to me.

520
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,220
What happened to you
and the Eldest Princess?

521
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,860
Mother, can't you see it?

522
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,140
Since it is known to everyone,

523
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,700
there must be someone behind the scenes.

524
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,730
I'm afraid this is a conspiracy.

525
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,420
I'll find a way to solve it.

526
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,620
Mother, it's okay.
Don't cause more trouble for me.

527
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,090
Greetings, Consort Li.

528
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,420
Eldest Princess.

529
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,090
Why do you have time to come here today?

530
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,010
I've heard some rumors recently,

531
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,250
so I came to have a look.

532
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,010
What rumors?

533
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,730
Some say that the Eldest Princess
is pregnant.

534
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,050
Do you believe it, Consort Li?

535
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,620
I don't believe it, and neither
does His Majesty.

536
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,250
So, I brought an imperial physician
here today

537
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:51,940
to diagnose you.

538
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,380
Outrageous.

539
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,900
I can't let you do as you wish to me

540
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,490
just for some rumors.

541
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,860
It's exactly because it's a rumor,
we have to investigate it.

542
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,860
After all, there are rumors saying

543
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,050
that the one who first spread the word
was your designated physician,

544
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,090
Imperial Physician Zhang.

545
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,770
But no one knows where did he go.

546
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,700
The Imperial Medicine Institute
has to bear this responsibility.

547
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,250
As such, they sent
another imperial physician to you.

548
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,420
In my opinion,

549
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,530
whether you are sick or not,
it's good to have an inspection.

550
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,420
Don't the women in the palace

551
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,900
regularly ask for pulse readings
for peace of mind?

552
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,660
Although you are outside,

553
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,090
you should also take care
of your own body.

554
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,570
How dare that old man
spread rumors about me?

555
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,620
When I find him,
I'll tear his mouth apart.

556
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,940
The Imperial Medicine Institute
is also looking for him.

557
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,490
It's a pity that even his residence
has been emptied.

558
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,010
If he still can't be found,

559
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,940
they will naturally link him to you.

560
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,980
The old man must have absconded
with his family.

561
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,490
Your Highness, you must not
tolerate him.

562
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,770
I thought so too at first,

563
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,730
but I didn't expect
to hear another rumor.

564
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,570
They say Imperial Physician Zhang

565
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,460
might have found out some secret

566
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,330
and was…

567
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,810
Which shameless person said that?

568
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,530
Let them confront me.

569
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,700
I also want to catch the person
who spread the rumors.

570
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,700
Yet, on second thought,

571
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,330
if we arrest them, it would look like
the royal family is guilty.

572
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,660
After mulling over it,

573
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,220
I think it's better for us
to act openly and honestly

574
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,570
and put the rumors to rest.

575
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,620
Don't you think so? Wanning.

576
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:45,980
Imperial Physician Chu,
please read the Eldest Princess's pulse.

577
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,570
Yes, Your Highness.

578
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,860
Your Highness, kindly allow me.

579
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,460
Eldest Princess, what are you doing?

580
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,490
I am the Eldest Princess,
my body is as precious as gold.

581
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,730
How can I be forced
to prove my innocence

582
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,220
based on some rumors?

583
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,980
This is a humiliation to me.

584
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,530
If that's the case,

585
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,210
I will go back and report the truth
to His Majesty.

586
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,690
Eldest Princess, just wait for His Majesty
to deliver the edict in person.

587
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,650
Leave us alone.

588
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,210
I want to talk to Consort Li alone.

589
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,940
Consort Li.

590
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,460
You are so forgetful.

591
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,900
Have you forgotten about Consort Xian?

592
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,490
Before threatening others,

593
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,570
why don't you check
who is the person in your hands?

594
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,130
What do you mean?

595
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,170
How smart are you.

596
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,010
Do you need me to remind you?

597
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,900
Do you want to side with Xue Fangfei?

598
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,490
I don't want to take any side,

599
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,940
I will not stoop to either side.

600
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,260
Ever since Shuran became sick,

601
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,010
I am no longer as competitive as before.

602
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,090
It's you. You forced my hand.

603
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,300
I am a person

604
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,650
who hates being threatened the most.

605
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,860
Alright, that's it for today.

606
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,860
When I get back,
I will report the truth to His Majesty.

607
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,340
Take care, Eldest Princess.

608
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,170
When you are free, think about

609
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,650
how are you going
to explain to His Majesty

610
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,210
the origins of this child in your belly.

611
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,860
[Traveling and Resting]

612
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,740
Your Highness, Mr. Shen is here.

613
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,900
You are finally here.
Now come with me to see His Majesty.

614
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,460
See His Majesty?

615
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,780
That's the last thing we should do now.

616
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,980
Why?

617
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,820
Did you know
that Consort Li had just come by?

618
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,820
Do you know how she threatened me?

619
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,570
Consort Li.

620
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,860
By now, the emperor should know

621
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,650
that I'm pregnant.

622
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,650
If you don't become my prince consort,

623
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,690
how will I explain the child
in my belly?

624
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,260
Who is its father?

625
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,610
Consort Li.

626
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,010
Isn't she on Your Highness's side?

627
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,460
What do you care about Consort Li?
She is just a dog.

628
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,530
She will side
with whoever gives her a bone.

629
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,530
At this point, you…

630
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,980
What are you hesitating about?

631
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,690
What do you want?

632
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,130
Don't you think something is wrong,
Your Highness?

633
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,460
The things happening recently

634
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,380
seemed to be pushed forward
by somebody in the background.

635
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,570
What do you mean?

636
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,170
The news of Your Highness's pregnancy
was leaked immediately.

637
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,460
It spread from the streets

638
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,420
and even reached the imperial court.

639
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,530
Later, Consort Li brought
an imperial physician to your door

640
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,050
in the name of clearing up the rumors.

641
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,090
If no one was behind all this,

642
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,820
how could things develop so quickly?

643
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:11,860
Who did it?

644
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,420
Consort Li? Xue Fangfei?

645
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,490
Xiao Heng?

646
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,090
Are they in cahoots?

647
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,250
What are they trying to do?

648
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,380
Your Highness, please calm down first.

649
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,860
No matter who the opponent is,

650
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,610
we just need
to figure out their intentions

651
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,530
to be free of their control.

652
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,250
What do you think their intentions are?

653
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,820
I think they want to see

654
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,650
us admit to our relationship,

655
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,820
and use it to accuse you and me
of fornication.

656
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,210
Framing us of immorality.

657
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,130
Thus making a path for them
to investigate

658
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:41,980
the Xue family murder case.

659
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,250
The Xue family's case

660
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,820
is not so easy to be investigated.

661
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,940
Why should we care?

662
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,050
Xue family's case is negligible,
but what about Lord Cheng?

663
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,020
Lord Cheng will soon arrive
at the capital.

664
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,620
At this critical moment,

665
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,620
if something happens
to Your Highness right now,

666
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,700
Lord Cheng will be threatened.

667
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,220
Lord Cheng.

668
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,060
When Lord Cheng becomes the emperor,

669
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,500
no one will ask about

670
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,700
our relationship.

671
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,310
The two of us can have many,
many more children.

672
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,790
Shen Yurong!

673
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,830
Do you know

674
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,910
how difficult it is for me

675
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,470
to bear this child?

676
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,980
I'm telling you,
even if I sacrifice you and me,

677
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,990
I want to keep it!

678
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,830
If so, is Your Highness willing
to endure dishonor?

679
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,750
Do you have a way to save him?

680
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,830
Promise me.

681
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,990
I have a method.

682
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,100
But Wanning,

683
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,430
I don't wish for you to do this.

684
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,020
What kind of dishonor
do you want me to suffer?

685
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,100
The father of this child can only be

686
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,950
Li Jin.

687
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:57,740
♪It's slightly cold, I look up
and my gaze is like the warm sun♪

688
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,620
What did you say?

689
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,660
This is the only way to save the child.

690
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,220
This is your child, Shen Yurong.

691
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,140
I understand, but to keep this child,

692
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,060
we must make people believe
that there is a reasonable father.

693
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,990
Looking at the entire imperial court,

694
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,430
the only one with a matching status

695
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,470
and who be manipulated by Your Highness

696
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,870
is Grand Chancellor Li.

697
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,580
The Li family has two sons.

698
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,660
Li Lian became a monk.
Li Jin is unmarried.

699
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,350
He is the best candidate.

700
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,700
That's the only place

701
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,260
where you can safely raise the child.

702
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,350
For our child,

703
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,030
let's endure for a while.

704
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,950
When the child is born,

705
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,470
I'm sure Lord Cheng
would have taken the throne.

706
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,830
At that time, you can just find a reason
to divorce him.

707
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,140
We can still be together.

708
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,740
In this way, the ones
who want to destroy us

709
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,950
will not have a chance to do so.

710
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,540
Shen Yurong,

711
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,470
after saying all these,

712
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,790
you just don't want
to be my prince consort.

713
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,350
Right?

714
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,100
I am willing to die for you.
Any choice Your Highness makes,

715
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,140
I will be with you all the way.

716
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,220
Don't touch me.

717
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,950
Don't touch me!

718
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,790
You are forcing me to do this.

719
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,220
You know it.

720
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,540
You know everything.

721
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,510
Father, you are saying

722
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,260
that you want me to become
the Eldest Princess's prince consort?

723
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,580
Is there a problem?

724
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,350
Have you heard

725
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,060
the rumors about the Eldest Princess?

726
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,390
A little.

727
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,580
We, the Li family, are not some
low-ranking family.

728
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,940
How could a child
of unknown origin be allowed

729
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,830
to usurp the position of the firstborn
in the Li family?

730
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,950
I know this is unfair to you.

731
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,390
But this is also

732
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,220
an opportunity for you to make amends.

733
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,700
The one supporting the Eldest Princess
is Lord Cheng.

734
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,940
Father, have you ever thought about it?

735
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,220
If the child is born, all is well.

736
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,540
But if an accident happens to it

737
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,980
in the Li family,

738
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,660
I'm afraid all of us will be implicated.

739
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,540
Of course, I know the importance
of this matter.

740
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,500
But this is the will
of the Eldest Princess.

741
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,100
We, the Li family, have no chance
of refusing it.

742
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,220
Jin, if the Eldest Princess can marry
into our family,

743
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,260
we can form an alliance with Lord Cheng,

744
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,540
and we will gain more from it.

745
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,660
You are a smart person.

746
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,700
You must understand
the importance of this matter.

747
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,870
Lady, I just heard from a servant

748
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,470
that the Eldest Princess is going
to marry into the Li family.

749
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,470
The Li family?

750
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,390
Really?

751
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,540
How about I go to the market
and ask around?

752
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,390
Sure.

753
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,350
Good one, Shen Yurong.

754
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,030
I have underestimated your cunning.
