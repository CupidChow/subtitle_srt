I didn't know Princess Wanning
was having

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,120
such an exciting time here.

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,430
I should have come earlier.

21
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,840
Duke Su, His Majesty ordered me
to entertain the scholars.

What's it got to do with you?

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,470
If Your Highness
only take arrows without arrowheads,

then it's none of my business.

25

Unfortunately, Your Highness
wanted to get the arrowheads,

had no say in the matter.

There's more than one person
who's suspicious of your identity.

have put into this marriage?

366
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,340
We're safe and sound here

367
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,430
because they haven't come
to us to settle the score yet.

368
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,950
I don't think so.

369
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,190
Why are you staring at me?

370
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,510
No one can be certain
about relationships.

371
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,580
It's the young master of the Marquis

372
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,910
who raped our daughter.

373
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,030
Our daughter is the victim.

374
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,140
How could Ji Shuran not stand up for us

375
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,340
and let Jiang Ruoyao

376
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,190
disfigure our daughter's face?

377
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,750
I'm going to fight back.

378
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,580
[Loyalty and Generosity]
My dear, stop causing any trouble.

379
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,540
Even if we get away with it this time,

380
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,780
Yuanbai won't let Ruoyao

381
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,300
and Yu'e share a husband.

382
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,470
Shuran won't let it happen either.

383
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,950
That's for the future.

384
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,060
It's imperative

385
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,620
that we don't put Yu'e

386
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,580
and Jiang Ruoyao at odds.

387
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,140
As long as they have a common enemy,

388
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,990
it'll be easier.

389
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,100
You mean...

390
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,140
Jiang Li.

391
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,780
Madam Sun.

392
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,380
Go

393
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,060
and get someone to clean this place up.

394
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,780
And get her everything new.

395
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,540
Yes.

396
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,580
Have you had enough?

397
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,430
I took her with me as a loyal dog

398
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,140
who wouldn't take food from anyone

399
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,540
no matter what.

400
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,060
I didn't expect her to steal my man.

401
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,230
Mother,

402
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,430
how could I swallow this anger?

403
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,300
You don't think you're wrong enough?

404
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,860
What did I do wrong?

405
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,430
Even if you were mad at Jiang Yu'e
for seducing your man,

406
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,540
you shouldn't have slashed her face

407
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,470
in front of everyone.

408
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,910
Take her home and close the door.

409
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,140
You'll have a thousand ways
to torture her.

410
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,620
Now that Jiang Yu'e's disfigured,

411
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,580
your father is the head
of the family at home,

412
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,860
and a generous and
loving grand chancellor at work,

413
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,230
she has totally lost her face,

414
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,300
so if she cries herself to death
in front of your father,

415
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,540
we'll still have to save her.

416
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,780
You've vented your anger,

417
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,380
but you don't realise you've given her
a chance to get away.

418
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,340
She's a dead fish,

419
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,270
but a single inch of force

420
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,300
is enough to turn her over.

421
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,860
She seduced my fiance first.

422
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,190
Where's the evidence?

423
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,510
If she claimed
that Zhou Yanbang raped her,

424
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,430
what could you do?

425
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,860
So it's my fault

426
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,670
that things turned out this way?

427
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,430
Am I going to stand by

428
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,670
and watch her ruin my marriage?

429
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,270
There's no turning back

430
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,430
on your engagement to the Zhou family.

431
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,100
Your father will never allow you

432
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,540
to marry into the Zhou family.

433
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,100
If you insist on marrying,

434
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,710
the Zhou family won't dare
to take you in.

435
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,230
Whether you accept it or not,

436
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,820
this is the reality.

437
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,470
Retribution. It must be retribution.

438
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,620
If I hadn't listened to you

439
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,540
and set up Jiang Li and Ye Shijie,

440
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,030
I wouldn't have got this.

441
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,620
You think you're justified in
not doing your job properly?

442
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,670
Do you think Jiang Yu'e
could have seduced

443
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,780
Zhou Yanbang on her own?

444
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,990
You've been engaged
to Mr. Zhou for quite some time.

445
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,510
If she wanted to seduce him,

446
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,190
why didn't she do it earlier?

447
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,820
Are you saying

448
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,030
she's being used?

449
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,620
Who do you think is the happiest person

450
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,380
in this family now
that you and Jiang Yu'e

451
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,670
are in such a mess?

452
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,230
Jiang Li.

453
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,950
If the engagement is gone, so be it.

454
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,340
I'll find you a better match myself.

455
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,780
But this score

456
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,340
must be settled with the person

457
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,540
who really did this to you.

458
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,230
Yuanbai, you're here, too.

459
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,340
If you have anything to say,

460
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,140
say it now.

461
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:15,990
Yuanbai,

462
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,470
just... Just punish me.

463
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,540
Get up and speak. This is inappropriate.

464
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,140
It's my fault for ruining Ruoyao's marriage
to the Zhou family.

465
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,470
I failed to teach my daughter well.

466
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,820
I'm sorry,

467
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,710
I deserve to be punished.

468
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,380
You made too much of a mess yesterday.

469
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,030
That's the palace,

470
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,670
not your own backyard.

471
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,470
I understand why you're angry.

472
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,620
If this were to be pursued,

473
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,750
it would be a disaster
for both of our families.

474
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,780
They're really ridiculous.

475
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,030
But His Majesty has not said anything.

476
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,230
That's because they're lucky.

477
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,620
I have reached a private agreement with

478
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,100
Marquis of Ningyuan's wife.

479
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,540
After all, it's a disgrace
for either of us.

480
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,860
They're trying to cover it up, too.

481
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,990
The rumor can't be stopped,

482
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,710
but nothing more will happen.

483
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,820
All the officials

484
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,710
looked at me with scorn today.

485
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,950
Yuanxing, if Yu'e
was really interested in Mr. Zhou,

486
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,540
she should've said so earlier.

487
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,990
Why did she have to do

488
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,860
such a shameful thing?

489
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,100
It's my fault as a father
that I didn't teach my child well.

490
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,750
Please punish me, Mother.

491
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,140
And your good daughter

492
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,060
slashed her own cousin's face.

493
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,060
If this infamy gets out,

494
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,580
who'd dare to come to the door
to propose marriage?

495
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,990
Mother, it's really Ruoyao's fault.

496
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,510
But she's been in love
with Mr. Zhou since they were kids,

497
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,430
so it's understandable
that she lost her head on impulse.

498
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,230
If Yu'e hadn't made the mistake first,

499
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,140
Ruoyao wouldn't have acted like that.

500
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,780
Anyway, it's all Yu'e's fault.

501
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,580
I've brought Yu'e here today.

502
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,860
You can punish her

503
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,230
as you wish, Yuanbai.

504
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,230
Ruoyao and Yu'e usually get along well.

505
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,470
It's not like we've been close

506
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,060
to the Zhou family for a day or two.

507
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,910
Since Ruoyao hasn't married yet,

508
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,710
I can see that the children

509
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,030
get along well.

510
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,990
Why did Yu'e

511
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,060
suddenly make such a mistake?

512
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,620
If Ruoyao hadn't seen it
with her own eyes,

513
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
I wouldn't have believed it.

514
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,270
If she hadn't been set up,

515
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,300
she

516
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,190
wouldn't have dared to do it.

517
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,340
Set up?

518
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,380
Who set her up?

519
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,380
Yu'e, it's better
if you speak for yourself.

520
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,710
Uncle, Aunt Shuran,

521
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,910
I'm not good at drinking.

522
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,340
But on the day of the palace banquet,

523
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,470
Li kept pushing me to drink.

524
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,990
When I got dizzy and wanted to rest,

525
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,710
she helped me

526
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,710
and said she'd take me
to the tea room to rest.

527
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,270
As far as I can remember,
we walked for a long time.

528
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,060
Now that I think about it,

529
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,670
I'm afraid we were in that remote place.

530
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,380
When we got to the door of the tea room,

531
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,430
she left.

532
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,430
I was so dizzy and feeling sick,

533
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,670
I didn't think much of it.
I just wanted to rest,

534
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,340
so I went inside.

535
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,270
But Mr. Zhou was there,

536
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,380
drunk

537
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,140
and mistook me for Ruoyao.

538
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:11,950
Then...

539
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,510
Yu'e.

540
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,340
I was in a panic

541
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,510
and tried my best to struggle,

542
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,270
but I was too weak
under the influence of alcohol

543
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,030
to resist the man's strength.

544
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,230
Then, Ruoyao appeared.

545
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,950
If that's a remote place,

546
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,140
why would Ruoyao go there?

547
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,670
I...

548
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,430
I dare not speculate.

549
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,300
Yu'e.

550
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,190
Say it, Yu'e.

551
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,230
Just say it.

552
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,230
I heard someone say that

553
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,710
after Li helped me to the tea room,

554
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,670
she told Ruoyao

555
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,380
that she couldn't find me.

556
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,190
Ruoyao was worried about me,

557
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,620
so she came to the tea room in a hurry.

558
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,820
Then... Then...

559
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,300
How could this happen?

560
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,230
It's my fault.

561
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,470
It's all my fault.

562
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,300
If I'd known the limits of propriety,

563
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,860
I wouldn't have received

564
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,340
the drink from Li at the banquet,

565
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,990
and I wouldn't have made
such a terrible mistake.

566
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,470
Get Jiang Ruoyao and Jiang Li
here to explain the matter.

567
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,710
Let's get this straight
between the two families.

568
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,030
We'll find out whose fault it is.

569
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,820
That day's banquet was too dangerous.

570
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,860
Fortunately, you took precautions,

571
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,230
and the investigation went smoothly.

572
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,710
Unexpectedly smooth.

573
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,030
Miss, but that person is

574
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,140
Princess Wanning.

575
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,100
I'm afraid it's going to be
even harder from now on.

576
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,430
I thought

577
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,670
that the audience with His Majesty
would be a chance for me

578
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,030
to break through the veil

579
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,430
and make her come to me.

580
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,190
But I never expected it

581
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,300
to be Her Highness

582
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,860
who gave the order
and no one dared to disobey.

583
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,860
Miss, you don't sympathize
with Shen Yurong, do you?

584
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,910
Killing a wife is a mortal sin.

585
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
Sympathy?

586
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,190
He doesn't deserve it.

587
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,860
Miss, what are we
going to do from now on?

588
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,300
Second Lady,

589
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,430
Master Jiang has asked you
to go to Wanfeng Hall,

590
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,580
saying he has something to ask you.

591
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,470
Miss, them asking you
to go there at this time

592
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,990
is not a good sign.

593
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,100
The backbiter

594
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,190
has made a move.

595
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,830
Li,

596
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,990
what happened in the palace yesterday?

597
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:15,910
Father,

598
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,580
I was drunk yesterday.

599
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,030
May I know what you want to ask?

600
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,990
Stop pretending.

601
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,950
Explain what happened
between Jiang Yu'e and Zhao Yanbang.

602
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,100
You want to ask about it, Ruoyao?

603
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,700
Yesterday, I was a little drunk
from all the liquor

604
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,180
Yu'e made me drink.

605
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,990
So she helped me
to rest in a nearby room.

606
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,100
I only heard

607
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,540
about Mr. Zhou and Yu'e
when I woke up today.

608
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,830
Nonsense.

609
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,350
How could you not know?

610
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,030
If it wasn't for you,

611
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,910
how could Yu'e

612
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,180
get into Zhou Yanbang's room?

613
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,950
It was you who deliberately

614
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,580
lured Yu'e there.

615
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,790
That's right. I didn't know
Mr. Zhou was in there

616
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,470
until after I went in.

617
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,950
What a coincidence.

618
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,620
A few moments after Yu'e
helped me into my room to rest,

619
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,140
another man entered my room,

620
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,180
led by an eunuch.

621
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,540
Do you know who he is, Ruoyao?

622
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,430
How could I know?

623
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,580
It's Ye Shijie.

624
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,740
He was also drunk
and wanted to find a place to rest,

625
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,950
but somehow he was brought to my room.

626
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,540
Luckily, although we were drunk,

627
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,060
we both knew that it wasn't proper

628
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,870
for a man and a woman
to be in the same room.

629
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,430
So we went out separately.

630
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,700
By the way, I've heard
something interesting.

631
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,220
Ruoyao,

632
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,830
when you opened the door
to Mr. Zhou's room,

633
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,740
before seeing anyone,

634
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,350
you shouted,

635
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,390
"Li."

636
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,140
Why?

637
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,180
You're talking nonsense. I didn't.

638
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,990
The other scholars who
were with you that day

639
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,220
heard that.

640
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,830
Why are you suddenly denying it?

641
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,620
It's not uncommon to call the wrong name
in the heat of the moment.

642
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,100
Don't be so nervous.

643
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:57,870
Father,

644
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,830
after I entered the room,

645
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,350
Ye Shijie came in short after,

646
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,580
and we immediately went back
to our respective seats.

647
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,180
Ye Shijie can prove

648
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,870
that I didn't have time to send Yu'e

649
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,180
to Mr. Zhou's room.

650
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,470
Ye Shijie is your cousin.

651
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,910
Of course he sides with you.

652
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,140
Maybe you're all in cahoots.

653
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,580
I forgot about you.

654
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,140
You said I sent you

655
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,700
to Mr. Zhou's room.

656
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,220
But why didn't you call
for help when he was about

657
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,100
to do something to you?

658
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,060
There are so many people
walking around in the palace.

659
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,430
If you had called for help,

660
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,350
things might not have come to this.

661
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,510
That's because

662
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,580
if I made a noise

663
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,910
and someone found out,

664
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,470
it'll ruin Ruoyao's

665
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,700
and Mr. Zhou's reputation.

666
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,220
Ruoyao,

667
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,990
are you touched?

668
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,660
Yu'e'd rather ruin her own reputation

669
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,660
to protect yours and Mr. Zhou's.

670
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,220
You two are really loving sisters.

671
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,580
Li,

672
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,790
stop irritating your sister.

673
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,740
She's more upset

674
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,140
than anyone else after what happened.

675
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,580
I felt bad for her too,

676
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,390
but I never thought
I'd be the one to blame

677
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,540
for all this.

678
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,180
Can't I say something in my defense?

679
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,580
Stop quibbling.

680
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,510
You're the one who slandered us.

681
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,950
Maybe Ye Shijie
was already involved with you

682
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,350
during the Entry Exam,

683
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,540
so you used him as a shield.

684
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,100
If you don't trust Ye Shijie,

685
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,260
you can't disbelieve Duke Su, right?

686
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,950
What's he got to do with it?

687
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,790
Father.

688
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,700
Since Yu'e sent me to my room,

689
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,390
I didn't know where
I was going when I left,

690
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,620
and I ran into Duke Su on the way.

691
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,180
Duke Su sent me back to the front hall.

692
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,830
Father, I know you want to do justice

693
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,220
to Ruoyao.

694
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,620
But it's not a big deal to push me out,

695
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,540
but if people know
that we sisters do not get along

696
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,830
and can slander each other
without proof,

697
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,580
I wonder what kind
of evil intentions they will have.

698
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,350
Father, please consider.

699
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,100
Jiang Li, stop pretending!

700
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,660
Ruoyao.

701
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,950
Uncle, please be wise.
You can't just let it slide.

702
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,660
My life is so miserable.

703
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,580
Uncle, how am I going to live my life?

704
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,910
What will happen to my daughter?

705
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,660
Enough!

706
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,580
How can you fight over
such a family scandal?

707
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,510
If word gets out

708
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,220
that you sisters
are slandering each other,

709
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,990
it'll be a big joke.

710
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,060
Since it's come to this,

711
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,470
what's so important
about right and wrong?

712
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,830
Don't you think about

713
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,700
what will happen to Yu'e

714
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,910
now that she's been disfigured?

715
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,660
What should we do next
when Ruoyao's fiance

716
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,740
did something like this?

717
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:42,100
Mother, you're right. I did
not handle the situation well.

718
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,470
I'll discuss with Yuanxing and her wife

719
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,910
about how to resolve this.

720
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,790
You guys go out and talk,
don't bother me here.

721
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,700
Yes.

722
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,580
Li,

723
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,660
stay back.

724
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,030
What's going on between

725
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,060
Yu'e and Mr. Zhou?

726
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,580
Grandmother, you adore me the most

727
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,430
and I won't hide anything from you.

728
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,830
Last night, Zhou Yanbang
gave me a small note.

729
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,100
I ignored it, but fearing
that others would find out,

730
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,990
I kept it with me,

731
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,430
thinking I'd dispose of it
after the banquet.

732
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,100
It was only when I heard
about Yu'e and Mr. Zhou

733
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,350
that I realised the note on me

734
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,510
had disappeared.

735
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,390
What a shameless girl.

736
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:50,910
Get up.

737
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:54,870
Do you realise your mistake?

738
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,580
I should have hidden the note.

739
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,540
This has nothing to do with you.

740
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,220
I'm talking about your faults.

741
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,220
Grandmother.

742
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,350
Remember what I told you?

743
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,540
You told me to

744
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,140
take care of myself

745
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,580
and my sisters in the palace.

746
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,140
Don't keep it to myself
if anything happens.

747
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,700
Come back and tell you.

748
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,180
What did you do?

749
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,990
Why didn't you tell me about it?

750
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,100
You can only clarify things

751
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,620
after you've been

752
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,100
slandered badly.

753
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,540
Then you have to fight with the one

754
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,870
who slandered you.

755
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,830
We're family.

756
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,470
We share the same honor,
we share the same loss.

757
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,620
At the end of the day,
you'll have to swallow this grievance.

758
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,660
Grandmother.

759
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,220
Do you still not trust me?

760
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,100
I dare not.

761
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,740
No matter what happens in the future,

762
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,870
you can tell me.

763
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,910
I'm not the kind of person
who can't tell right from wrong.

764
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
But it can't go unpunished.

765
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:55,310
I'll punish you to copy
the sutra ten times.

766
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,180
As for Ruoyao and Yu'e,

767
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,540
they'll be punished
for copying Lessons Women 20 times.

768
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,350
I accept the punishment.

769
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,100
Father, why do you want me
to marry Jiang Yu'e?

770
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,310
Who is she? How is she worthy of me?

771
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,060
What?

772
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,100
You still want to

773
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,180
marry Jiang Ruoyao?

774
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,620
Father, I beg you.

775
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,740
I know I was wrong.

776
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,140
I'll apologize to Ruoyao.

777
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,390
She'll definitely forgive me.

778
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,990
Forgive you?

779
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,390
Father.

780
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,260
I can't believe you
made such a big mistake.

781
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,140
You're in deep trouble, and you
still haven't come to your senses!

782
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,100
Do you think you can
really marry Jiang Ruoyao?

783
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,350
Look carefully.

784
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,260
The Jiang family's letter of withdrawal
has been sent to our residence!

785
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,700
Although Jiang Ruoyao
is the daughter of the concubine's son,

786
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,990
things have come to this,

787
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,910
if no one wants to marry her

788
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,990
and she becomes confused
and kills herself,

789
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,910
His Majesty will be furious,

790
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,550
not to mention that Grand Chancellor Jiang
will not let us go,

791
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,660
and we won't be able
to keep all of our ancestors'

792
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,780
honor and titles.

793
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,030
Do you understand?

794
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,470
Father, but I...

795
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,300
Listen here.

796
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,870
How you treat Jiang Yu'e
is your business,

797
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,030
but she lost her virginity
because of you.

798
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:13,030
The Zhou family must give her a title.

799

[Qingning Palace]

800
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,030
The road was paved for you,

801
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,070
but you took a wrong turn

802
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,660
and let others take advantage of you.

803
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,830
You're right.

804
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,100
I'll teach Ruoyao better in the future.

805
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,660
As long as Jiang Li
is still in the Jiang family,

806
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,220
there will be ways to deal with her.

807
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,990
If I hadn't defended you
in front of His Majesty,

808
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,470
I'm afraid this wouldn't
have ended so easily.

809
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,300
Thank you for your hard work.

810
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,390
Any news lately?

811
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,660
I heard the imperial physician say
it'll be bad if it's a few years later.

812
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,620
Did Father tell you to ask me that?

813
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,950
No, it's just my own silly thought.

814
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,030
It wasn't a silly thought at all.

It's not like it's urgent.

Not like I was when I was young.

818
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,350
I've heard about the compassion
of the Buddha at Tianxiang Temple,

819
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,830
so I'm going to go
there for a period of time

821

If you're going to meditate,

I'd like to ask you for something.

It depends on what you think.
