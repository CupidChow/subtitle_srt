00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,540
You can line up here too.

363
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,670
Let them distribute.

364
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,470
There's plenty. So don't rush.

365
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,390
Someone has died of hunger!

366
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,390
Someone is dead. He died from hunger.

367
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,740
Come and look, someone died from hunger.

368
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,630
Come and take a look!

369
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,300
The relief congee
in the city is too watery.

370
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,470
If this continues,

371
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,870
we'll all starve to death.

372
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,580
He's right.

373
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,670
- Am I right?
- Make way, please.

374
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,740
- How is this edible?
- Please make way.

375
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,500
What happened?

376
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,150
Is this water or congee?

377
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,820
It's so watery
that it's not filling at all.

378
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,190
That's right. Someone already died.

379
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,390
Are you trying to starve us to death?

380
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,540
Also, did you give Dingzhou's grain

381
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,950
to the people outside the city?

382
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,630
No, don't say that.

383
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,150
Where's the grain?

384
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,630
Isn't Second Lady Jiang supposed
to be kind?

385
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,020
Why is she hiding?

386
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,340
Are our lives not important?

387
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,670
- Yes, that's right.
- That's right.

388
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,870
Everyone, calm down. It's not like that.

389
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,950
Calm down.

390
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,870
We came to Dingzhou

391
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,190
because we believed
in Second Lady Jiang.

392
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,500
But since we arrived,

393
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,910
we're still starving every day.

394
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,260
Now, someone has died.

395
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,540
We want to see Second Lady Jiang.

396
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,780
Call her out.

397
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,100
- Call her out.
- It's not like that.

398
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100
- Everyone, calm down.
- Calm down.

399
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,950
- Please calm down.
- It's not like that.

400
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,870
This is bad. Close the city gates.

401
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,470
- Everyone, calm down.
- Calm down.

402
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,300
Liu Xu, leave now.

403
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,820
Go quickly.

404
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,780
Everyone, listen to me.
Please calm down.

405
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,870
Jiang Jingrui!

406
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,780
Open the gate quickly.
He's still outside.

407
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,670
- There are too many refugees outside.
- Open the gate!

408
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,910
- We can't handle them if we open it.
- Open the gates.

409
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,190
It's not like that.

410
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,540
Everyone, calm down. You must calm down.

411
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,300
Listen to me.

412
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,740
Things aren't what you think.

413
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,630
Li,

414
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,230
come with me to the county yamen
to take shelter.

415
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,540
More and more refugees
are gathering outside.

416
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,150
They're demanding you come out.

417
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,020
I fear people inside the city
will cause trouble.

418
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,710
It seems we haven't caught

419
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,580
all the instigators yet.

420
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,740
They're eager to act.

421
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,500
Liu Xu and my cousin

422
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,950
are distributing porridge
at the gate today.

423
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,060
How are they doing?

424
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,430
I heard Jiang Jingrui is trapped
outside the city.

425
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,390
What?

426
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,430
Third Uncle,

427
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,870
take Magistrate Xue to the county yamen.
I need to go outside the city.

428
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,710
These people are clearly after you.

429
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,710
That's precisely the reason

430
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,340
I can't let my cousin suffer for me.

431
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,470
Why not have Tong take Magistrate Xue
to the county yamen?

432
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,300
I'll accompany you outside the city.

433
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,430
Third Uncle,
it will be a little dangerous.

434
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,950
When have I ever been afraid of danger?

435
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,470
Even if it's dangerous,

436
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,630
I'll go with you.

437
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,740
Everyone, calm down.

438
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,020
It's Second Lady Jiang!

439
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,470
It's Second Lady Jiang!

440
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,190
Second Lady Jiang finally came out.

441
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,710
[Dingzhou]
Second Lady Jiang. Second Lady Jiang.

442
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,340
Second Lady Jiang, please help us.

443
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,910
Help us poor people
who had to leave our homes.

444
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,540
Please help us.

445
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,020
Quiet down!

446
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,580
Get up!

447
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,020
- Get up!
- Dear all,

448
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,020
I know the famine
in Dingzhou is serious.

449
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,230
[Dingzhou]
The relief grain is on its way.

450
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,540
In two days at most,

451
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,430
the famine in Dingzhou will be resolved.

452
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,950
Are we supposed to wait
until we starve to death?

453
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,990
He's right.
We've waited so long already.

454
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,630
Since you've come to me,

455
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,950
it means you trust me.

456
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,470
Listen to what I have to say.

457
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,670
Even though there was a famine
in Dingzhou before,

458
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,670
the grain in the city was enough
to sustain us.

459
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,500
But now, look for yourselves.

460
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,950
There are so many more refugees inside
and outside the city.

461
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,630
Even if we empty the grain stores
of two Dingzhou cities,

462
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,780
it won't be enough.

463
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,950
Many of you are from Wei County.

464
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,820
The relief grain from the court arrived

465
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,470
[Dingzhou]
in Wei County months ago.

466
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,710
But Wei County became a place
with no grain.

467
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,260
Where did the grain go?

468
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,540
It must have been hoarded
by corrupt officials.

469
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,950
Think again,

470
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,780
who made you leave your homes
and come to Dingzhou?

471
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,150
We've investigated Wei County.

472
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,470
Even if you were deceived,

473
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,580
now you have no way out.

474
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,150
[Dingzhou]

475
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,820
The grain in Dingzhou can sustain us

476
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,300
until the relief grain arrives.

477
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,340
I won't leave the city alone.

478
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,190
I will stay here in Dingzhou
and face the famine with you.

479
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,190
Fellow villagers,

480
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,820
the grain will arrive
in two days at most.

481
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,740
We don't believe you.
If we don't get grain today,

482
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,470
we'll cause trouble.
We'll cause trouble!

483
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,740
- Yes, we'll cause trouble.
- Give us grain.

484
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,060
Do you see that?

485
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,780
These people are so hungry
that they're not thinking straight.

486
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,670
They can't hear what you're saying.

487
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,300
Why are you doing this again?

488
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,190
Open the gate.

489
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,500
Is Liu Xu coming?

490
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,190
Open the gate quickly.

491
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,150
Open the city gate now!

492
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,710
- Back off!
- Back off!

493
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,780
Back off!

494
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,670
Back off! If you cause more trouble,
I'll arrest all of you!

495
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,300
The soldiers are bullying the people.

496
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,060
We outnumber them.
We're not afraid of you!

497
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,100
We're not afraid of you!

498
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,430
We don't have to be scared of them!

499
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,910
Third Uncle,

500
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,470
arrest those two in front.

501
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,580
What are you doing?

502
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,390
Come with me!

503
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:49,990
Come with me!

504
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,390
He killed him! Someone is dead!

505
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,910
The soldier killed him!

506
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,500
This...

507
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,910
Catch Second Lady Jiang!

508
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,780
Second Lady Jiang
is a high official's daughter!

509
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,390
If we catch her,
we'll definitely get food!

510
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,740
Do you know the crime of harming
the Grand Chancellor's daughter?

511
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,670
The law can't punish everyone.

512
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,060
It's not like
you can kill us all, right?

513
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,580
Everyone,
go and get Second Lady Jiang now!

514
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,870
- Get her!
- What are you doing?

515
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,190
- Get her!
- Move back!

516
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,910
We'll have food if we get her!

517
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,470
- Back off!
- Get Second Lady Jiang!

518
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,260
Get Second Lady Jiang!

519
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,910
Back off!

520
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,390
Catch her!

521
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,150
Move back!

522
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,300
Grain is here!

523
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
Grain is here!

524
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,150
The grain has arrived!

525
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,820
The grain has arrived!

526
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,430
The grain has arrived!

527
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,390
- It's Ye Shijie.
- The grain is here.

528
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,060
The grain is here.

529
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,020
Unload the cart. Hurry up.

530
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,340
We're saved.

531
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,630
The grain has arrived.

532
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,990
We're saved.

533
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,580
Get up.

534
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,300
Get up.

535
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,870
Why are you grabbing me?

536
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,470
- I said, get up.
- Be gentle.

537
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,430
Try to run, huh?

538
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,990
No, I won't run.

539
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,190
Everyone, calm down.

540
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,870
Line up. Everyone will have some.

541
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,580
- Hold this.
- Don't worry. You'll have your food.

542
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,500
Don't drop it.

543
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,780
Thank you. Thank you very much.

544
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,740
Let's go check the front.

545
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,580
Li,

546
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,870
I came late.

547
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,190
You're not, Jia'er.

548
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,190
It's all thanks to you.

549
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,430
Or else it'll be difficult
to settle this.

550
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,670
Don't say that.

551
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,780
The Ye family owes you this.

552
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,870
You deserve it.

553
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,150
Ye,

554
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,910
thank you.

555
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,500
Not bad, Ye Shijie.

556
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,500
How did you get so much grain

557
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,710
in such a short time?

558
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,910
If I weren't confident,

559
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,190
I wouldn't have left so easily.

560
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,740
Shijie wrote to me

561
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,820
before returning.

562
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,870
He said you'd pass through Dingzhou.

563
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,740
But with the famine,

564
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,540
some people might use this chance

565
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,630
to cause trouble for you.

566
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,300
So we started preparing

567
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,710
from that moment.

568
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,430
[Arrange grain relief to help Dingzhou]
Li might be trapped in Dingzhou.

569
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,740
Shijie asked us
to think of ways to help her.

570
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,710
Master, we had some cash earlier.

571
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,230
But it's all spent
on raw materials and labor.

572
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,950
Mortgage Lizheng Hall

573
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,100
to borrow some money.

574
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,230
Don't forget my jewelry too.

575
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,500
Saving lives comes first.

576
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,300
Jia'er, do you have to go to Cangzhou
to gather the grain?

577
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,260
The prices there are much higher
than in Luyang.

578
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,670
I asked the security escort.

579
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,340
They've set up checkpoints

580
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,710
between Luyang and Dingzhou.

581
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,820
If the Ye family transports grain,

582
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,470
[Bingde Hall]
they will accuse us of smuggling

583
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,390
and confiscating the grain.

584
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,500
Even if we gather grain in Luyang,
we can't get it through.

585
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,910
Also, Shijie said

586
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,430
not to let anyone know
the Ye family is collecting grain.

587
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,780
My trip to Cangzhou
should be kept a secret too.

588
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,540
Understood.

589
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,230
Shijie,

590
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,990
how did you know all this in advance?

591
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,580
I received a secret letter.

592
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,710
[Grains from Cangzhou
can relieve Dingzhou's predicament.]

593
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,670
And you trusted it?

594
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,820
What if someone gives you
fake information?

595
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,100
If it were from anyone else,
I wouldn't trust it.

596
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:01,820
But...

597
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,860
[Duke Su]

598
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,540
The Ye family's luck sure is amazing.

599
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,670
There are checkpoints everywhere.

600
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,580
Yet, they managed to transport grain
from Cangzhou.

601
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,780
It's not luck.

602
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,950
It's part of His Lordship's plan.

603
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,340
That's impressive
to predict all of this.

604
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,820
The secret letters weren't just sent
to Ye Shijie,

605
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,340
but also to the Jiang family.

606
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,710
The secret plan was to ensure
the Ye family's grain entered

607
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,190
from Cangzhou.

608
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,710
Do you understand what this means?

609
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,190
Li Zhongnan has set up checkpoints
on the route

610
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,020
to Dingzhou.

611
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,910
It's to prevent any grain relief
from entering Dingzhou

612
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,740
and to keep Second Lady Jiang
trapped there.

613
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,740
However, only the Governor
of Cangzhou is on our side.

614
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,870
But will the Ye family really go
to such lengths

615
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,230
and pay a high price
to procure grain from Cangzhou?

616
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,500
We don't have a better option
at this moment.

617
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,020
It's better to assume they will
than to assume otherwise.

618
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,430
Send a fast horse to Cangzhou
with my message.

619
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,390
Ensure that the Ye family's relief grain

620
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,740
arrives in Dingzhou without problems.

621
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,740
But what do we do
about this secret message?

622
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,630
Do what?

623
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,540
We'll put up an act for Li Zhongnan

624
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,470
to make him think that I, Jiang Yuanbai,

625
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,060
am at a loss this time.

626
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,260
So His Lordship is playing
a diversion tactic.

627
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,540
Was our visit to Wei County
also part of the act?

628
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,430
They wanted to lure us out of Dingzhou.

629
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,260
But if we didn't fall into the trap
they set in Wei County,

630
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,540
they'll suspect

631
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,020
that His Lordship has come up
with a response strategy.

632
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,740
Then they'll shift
their focus on the Ye family.

633
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,230
Only the Ye family
can resolve this crisis.

634
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,910
If they were targeted,

635
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,150
the grain might not make it through.

636
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,100
Why didn't His Lordship
just go with you?

637
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,910
Why involve me in this act?

638
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,390
I wasn't even informed of this.

639
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,630
If we stayed,

640
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,870
they would surely be cautious

641
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,260
and wouldn't instigate their spies
in the city to cause trouble.

642
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,020
How did Dingzhou get into this crisis?

643
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,820
We need to get
that information from them.

644
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,470
What if the Ye family
doesn't make it in time?

645
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,630
Does His Lordship have a backup plan?

646
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,340
His Lordship believes Second Lady Jiang

647
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,100
can definitely wait
until the Ye family arrives.

648
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,190
Did His Lordship discuss

649
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,870
this plan with Second Lady Jiang before?

650
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,500
No.

651
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,740
But they

652
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,190
probably have a tacit understanding.

653
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,390
Lu Ji, you've become mischievous.

654
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,950
A man is known by the company he keeps.

655
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,870
Your Highness,
why do you want to see me?

656
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,870
Have you heard?

657
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,230
Jiang Li has brought Huaixiang's people
to the capital to file a complaint.

658
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,230
I've heard about it.

659
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,340
She also brought back someone.

660
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,190
Huaixiang's County Magistrate,

661
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,540
Xue Huaiyuan.

662
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,580
It seems you know about this already.

663
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,540
That's why you're not surprised.

664
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,470
I've only heard it mentioned
among the scholars.

665
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,060
How do you plan to deal with her?

666
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,820
Aren't you going to ask
why Xue Huaiyuan is alive?

667
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,390
Or if we managed

668
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,430
to keep our gold mine?

669
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,100
You're only concerned
about how I handle her?

670
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,230
She brought back a prisoner she freed.

671
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,540
Those from the Court of Judicial Review

672
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,390
are waiting for her at the city gate.

673
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,260
As soon as she enters the city gate,
she'll be thrown in prison.

674
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,870
Are you worried

675
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,430
because you're afraid she might suffer?

676
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,500
Do you have to treat me like this,
Your Highness?

677
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,950
I just feel
that every time you mention her,

678
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,060
it's like talking about Xue Fangfei.

679
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,470
Is it a misunderstanding
on my part or yours?

680
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,500
I killed Xue Fangfei

681
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,020
while Xue Huaiyuan was killed
by your people.

682
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,300
Now Xue Fangfei is buried
under the ground,

683
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,340
never to rise again.

684
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,100
But Xue Huaiyuan is returning
to the capital.

685
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,950
Don't you think
you should give me an explanation?

686
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,670
What did you say?

687
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,300
Once the Huaixiang case is turned over,

688
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,780
Your Highness's and King Cheng's

689
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,710
might be exposed.

690
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,910
Things have come to this.
Instead of considering the big picture,

691
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,500
you're bothering me with a dead person.

692
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,500
You dare to scold me.

693
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,820
I apologize.

694
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,020
I was impulsive
and offended Your Highness.

695
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,020
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

696
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:03,910
Don't think

697
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,300
that just because I teased you
for a moment,

698
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,260
you can control my affairs.

699
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,150
It's not your place
to tell me what to do.

700
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:12,950
Yes, Your Highness.

701
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,710
Jiang Li must return quickly.

702
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,100
I can't wait to meet her in person.

703
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,280
[I, Zhou Dezhao, report that Jiang Li
misled the people of Huaixiang]

704
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,380
[to obstruct justice
and helped Xue Huaiyuan escape]

705
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,630
Read the Court
of Judicial Review's memorial.

706
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,020
Is it similar to what Li Zhongnan wrote?

707
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,670
It's similar but more detailed.

708
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,740
It cites many criminal laws.

709
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,390
They want me
to convict Second Lady Jiang.

710
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,260
Li Zhongnan is even more ruthless.

711
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,390
Is he trying to use this chance
to convict Jiang Yuanbai too?

712
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,950
What do you think?

713
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:58,950
It's a bit difficult.

714
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,870
Even you find it challenging too, right?

715
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,190
[Imperial Secretariat and Chancellor]
I can refute his memorial easily.

716
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,300
After all, Jiang Li and Xue Huaiyuan
just reached the capital.

717
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,870
