00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,960
you can forget about leaving tonight.

190
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,120
Let's see if you've got what it takes

191
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,960
to keep me here.

192
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,320
Watch out!

193
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,840
With your martial arts skills,

194
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,150
you're better off
singing in the brothel.

195
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,530
You won't kill her,

196
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,890
so I'll help you.

197
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,930
Why?

198
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,650
Wu Lan.

199
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,340
You're just

200
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,810
as much of a good-looking loser
as your brother.

201
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,050
My brother.

202
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,860
You betrayed the organization and me.

203
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,650
Why would I keep him alive?

204
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,690
Find him in hell.

205
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,260
You're really heartless.

206
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,570
Surely King Cheng knows
what happens tonight.

207
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,890
You don't deserve
King Cheng's attention.

208
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,140
You drank so much before seeing me.

209
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,460
You don't deserve
to be treated seriously.

210
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,180
Five against one?

211
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,850
You're indeed King Cheng's subordinate.

212
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,050
You're sinister enough.

213
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,220
All that matters is I win.

214
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,660
Are we going to die here today?

215
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,770
Don't jinx it.

216
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,020
If I die with you,

217
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,660
at least I have a companion in hell.

218
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,460
Strike!

219
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,570
I knew you'd come.

220
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,500
Cut the nonsense.

221
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,900
I didn't come for you.

222
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:42,900
Trying to escape?

223
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,570
No way.

224
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,180
Get them.

225
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,700
Thank you, General Biao.

226
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,090
What general?

227
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,900
I've paid back my favor to Xiao Minghan.

228
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,050
Let's leave!

229
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,260
When Xiao Minghan's name is cleared,

230
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,050
remember to invite me for drinks.

231
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,130
It's a deal.

232
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,570
My Lord, he got away.

233
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,530
Take the rest back for interrogation.

234
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,260
Yes.

235
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,050
Governor,
our informant in the black market

236
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,330
reported that Lai Biao
revealed the source.

237
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,460
She's indeed
a daughter of the Jiang family.

238
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,980
She's quite capable.

239
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,330
She could even make Lai Biao speak.

240
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,180
Let them go there happily

241
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,020
and return with disappointment.

242

[Dafeng Pharmacy]

243
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,260
Do you still feel like vomiting?

244
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,570
I feel dizzy when I sit up.

245
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:41,330
Miss.

246
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,740
I'll make you a pot of strong tea

247
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,370
to cure your hangover.

248
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,700
I still have a lot to do today.

249
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,980
I don't have time
to drink your strong tea.

250
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,260
Li.

251
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,460
Li, are you feeling better?

252
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,370
Let me see.

253
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,460
I feel much better.

254
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,740
Don't force it.

255
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,220
You were so drunk last night.

256
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,890
You must feel uncomfortable today.

257
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,940
I had someone make you
stomach-warming red bean soup

258
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,330
and refreshing perilla drink.

259
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,670
Thank you, Jia'er.

260
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,430
Do you have something to ask me?

261
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,030
What did you and Third Uncle
do yesterday?

262
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,780
We went to the black market in Luyang

263
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,430
to investigate Tuoluo flower's buyer.

264
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,990
If things don't go wrong today,

265
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,300
the Soochow brocade case
will be resolved today.

266
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,910
Then,

267
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,580
what's this?

268
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,060
I can't get drunk!

269
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,340
I'm not drunk.

270
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,430
What's this?

271
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,340
What's this?

272
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,950
He's just...

273
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,430
a stranger.

274
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,780
Stranger?

275
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,610
Why did he tell me
that he's your savior?

276
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,610
He just likes to talk nonsense.

277
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,220
Jia'er, don't take him seriously.

278
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,500
Didn't you say he's a stranger?

279
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,570
Why did you seem
so familiar with each other?

280
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,130
I'll get ready

281
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,370
to find out Tuoluo flower's origin.

282
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,170
Wait.

283
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,020
Can I go with you?

284
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,410

285
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,090
bring me with you.

and hang herself again.

You have to stay in Ye's Residence

290

and hold the fort.

291
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,540
You haven't sobered up either.

292
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,260
How did you win yesterday?

293
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,980
I heard Lai Biao can drink a lot.

294
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,610
No one in Luyang
can drink more than him.

295
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,020
Don't bother.

296
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,460
He lost in the end anyway.

297
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,090
Look at how smug you look.

298
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,940
You look just like your mother
when she was little.

Let's talk about business.

300
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,220
Did Lai Biao eventually tell you

301
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,090
who the buyer was?

302
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,470
Luyang's only buyer.

303
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,670

Did they say when they'll come back?

Was there too much noise when
breaking into Golden Water Formation

317
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,230

Check carefully.

to prepare my carriage.

What... What do we do?

We also caught a suspect.

359
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,180
Bring them out!

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,090
I really came here to buy medicine.

361
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,570
I smelled blood
from the crack in the door

362
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,610
and climbed over the wall
to take a look.

363
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,260
Who would buy medicine
through the back door?

364
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,700
Do you think I'm stupid?

365
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,770
Sit down.

366
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,180
Calm down.

Otherwise, not only we can't save Shun,

but we'll also be involved.

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,850
Who's your accomplice?

370
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,220
I was just passing by.

371
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,850
Ask the bun seller
if you don't believe me.

372
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,980
I knocked on the door for a long time

373
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,220
and only went in
because no one opened the door.

for Dafeng Pharmacy's eight lives.

Our only lead,

397

398
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,980
Do you conclude cases so rashly?

399
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,500
Watch your words, Second Lady Jiang.

400
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,770
I'm an official
of Office of Weaving and Dyeing.

401
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
I came to Luyang

402
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,660
to investigate the death
caused by Soochow brocade.

403
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,500
We now found out

404
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,180
the Soochow brocade carried

405
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,500
Tuoluo flower, which is highly toxic.

406
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,940
I have no right to investigate

407
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,460
where it came from.

408
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,130
But the Soochow brocade...

I've done my job.

411
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,020
What you're saying are poisoning cases.

412
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,330
You should leave it
to the local governor.

for me again.

You've done a great job.

If it wasn't for you,

the Ye family

430
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,460

Isn't it just money?

Governor Tong, cut to the chase.

439
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,660
I thought about it for a long time.

440
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,940
We have a solution

441

for the Soochow brocade case.

442
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,260
What do you mean?

443
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,610
Someone high up
appreciates Ye Shijie's talent

444
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,770
and wants to be friends
with the Ye family.

445
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,460
It's a pity that he's so proud

446
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,050
that he can't tolerate
being inferior to others.

447
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,700
So the higher-ups
could only play some tricks

448

to make your nephew understand

00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,370
that it's easy to break
when you're too tough.

450

You're bullies.

451

That's a heavy statement.

453
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,460
that the Ye family has been
in business for generations.

454
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,460
But Ye Shijie has no foundation
in the capital's bureaucracy.

455
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,260
He's lucky

456
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,610
that someone favors him.

457
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,260
It's all right
if he doesn't appreciate it.

458
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,500
But the Ye family is too ignorant.

459
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,020

got involved with Second Lady Jiang

467
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,610

When the Ye family is desperate one day,

488
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,020
the price will go up.

that you won't give up until you fail.

let me think of another way.

on a young girl like you?

500
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,180
Besides, whatever amount of money

501
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,420

money is nothing to them.

00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,950
how good it was
when we founded Lizheng Hall

558
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:54,660
together.

559
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,580
But my brother
and his wife suddenly died,

560
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,740
so I worked alone.

561
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,430
I was young and reckless.

562
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,910
No one is willing to admit defeat.

563
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,390
I couldn't swallow my pride in the end.

564
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:09,990
Third Uncle.

565
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,390
It's not too late to go home.

566
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,780
It's more than ten years
of resentment and anger.

567
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,830
The misunderstanding is too deep.
I can't go back.

568
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,070
You can go back.

569
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:18,870
I can't.

570
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,550
You can.

571
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,780
This is a deposit from the broker.

572
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,580
There's more money
after the house is sold.

573
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,950
Help me pass it to Madam Lu.

574
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:32,950
No.

575
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,540
Pass it to her.

576
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,390
Pass it yourself.

577
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,510
And these...

578
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,070
These

579
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,350
are my savings from traveling

580
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,430
over the years.

581
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,350
There's not much left
after opening the escort agency.

582
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,660
But these rare trinkets

583
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,070
can fetch a good price.

584
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,350
After I sell them,

585
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,100
help me pass the money to the Ye family.

586
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,550
A song drifts over the trees

587
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,660
as one dances in the moonlight.

588
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,430
What does that mean?

589
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,290
Nothing.

590
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,420
I just came up with an idea.

591
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,770
Buns fresh out of the steamers!

592
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,730
Here's your buns. Please enjoy.

593
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,770
You said you'd buy me a meal.

594
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,170
Is that all?

595
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,980
Can't you pick somewhere better?

596
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,420
Don't underestimate these buns.

597
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,060
These are the best buns in Luyang.

598
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,250
The skin is white and fluffy
while the filling is tender.

599
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,900
Thousands of them are sold in a day.

600
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,170
What do you think?

601
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,860
Isn't it mouth-watering and fragrant?

602
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:57,950
It's all right.

603
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,350
Go ahead. What's the matter?

604
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,260
Thank you...

605
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,620
For that night.

606
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,870
Does that mean

607
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,350
you remember

608
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,990
what happened that night?

609
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,030
I... I only remember

610
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,100
giving back this red cape to you.

611
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,100
I borrowed you a red cape,

612
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,030
so you're buying me buns?

613
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,870
I'll also invite you to watch a play.

614
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,660
I don't watch plays.

615
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,740
[Cakes and pastries]
Come back.

616
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,550
Xiao Heng.

617
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,390
Someone was so mad at me
for watching a play in a teahouse

618
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,950
that they tried to make me drunk.

619
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,540
[Cakes and pastries]

620
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,100
Go on.

621
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,470
What play?

622
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,220
You've eaten the buns.

623
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,140
Shall we start the play?

624
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,740
Madam Ye, what's the meaning of this?

625
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,950
I'll be straightforward.

626
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,030
I admit that the Ye family
lost this time.

627
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,510
This is the maximum
that the Ye family can afford.

628
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,100
Please be magnanimous

629
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,690
and spare us.

630
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,940
But Madam Ye,

631
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,100
I remember warning you

632
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,610
to seal the deal as soon as possible.

633
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,130
This price

634
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,580
can't keep the Ye family safe.

635
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,500
This is the key
to the Ye family's vault.

636
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,430
The Ye family's heirloom.

637
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,350
The last things for us to survive

638
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,140
are in it.

639
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,260
I beg you

640
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,950
to do justice to the Ye family.

641
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,870
My Lord.

642
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,430
The house where the assassins
are trained has been seized.

643
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,830
But those assassins

644
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,140
don't know where Chu Lan is.

645
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,390
Should we use some methods?

646
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,260
No.

647
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,780
These people

648
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,220
don't know Chu Lan's whereabouts.

649
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,510
What should we do?

650
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,950
Wu Lan's dead, and Chu Lan's on the run.

651
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,700
All the leads went cold again.

652
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,100
Is the seized house rented or purchased?

653
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:23,870
It's rented.

654
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,350
They change venues every year.

655
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,070
It's not fixed.

656
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,350
Ask the landlord

657
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,740
who paid him the rent.

658
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,470
Yes.

659
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,140
My Lord.

660
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,660
What's this?

661
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Second Lady Jiang's servant girl

662
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
sent over a basket of buns.

663
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,260
She said her lady bought them for you.

664
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,620
Where's the imperial observer?

665
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,620
Urge them for Second Lady Jiang.

666
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,390
Yes.

667
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,430
My Lord, do you think
that governor will fall for it?

668
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,300
If we can't succeed in one go,

669
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,300
won't we be laughed at in the future?

670
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,350
That governor is greedy and lecherous.

671
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,220
He's also obsessed with opera

672
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,350
and often fools around
with his subordinates.

673
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,510
Second Lady Jiang
is going to hit where it hurts.

674
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,620
Wait and see.

675
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,030
It's tasty.

676
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,260
Ten percent of the Ye family's fortune

677
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,950
will be yours.

678
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,580
The observer received a tip-off

679
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,390
tributes from the Ye family of Luyang
to the imperial court

680
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,100
had been withheld.

681
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:22,950
Is that true?

682
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,260
I'm Ye Mingyu.

683
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,910
The tributes given by the Ye family
to the imperial court were not withheld,

684
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,780
but snatched away by Luyang's governor,

685
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,830
Tong Zhiyang.

686
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,950
He also put Shun,
who was guarding the tributes,

687
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,070
in prison.

688
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,740
It's a serious crime
to slander a governor.

689
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,390
Are you sure?

690
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,390
I swear on my life.

691
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,260
Lead the way.

692
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,700
The Ye family has a batch of tributes
for His Majesty,

693
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,580
but Luyang's governor, Tong Zhiyang,
took them.

694
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,780
I heard that the imperial court
recently had observers

695
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,220
patrolling near Luyang.

696
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,030

to the observer.

698
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,660
The observer has his duties.

699
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,030
It's not worth coming to Luyang

700
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,550
because of a tip-off.

701
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,580
Your plans won't work.

702
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,550
Nothing will happen

703
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,740
if I do it myself.

704
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,950
But if you help me,

705
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,030
it will turn out differently.

These are the Ye family's tributes.

709
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,780
Where's the governor?

710
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,950
What move is this?

No.

I received a tip-off

719
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,740
and came to investigate
Luyang Governor's tribute embezzlement.

720
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,470
Governor Tong,
please answer in your official robe.

721
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,740
Tong Zhiyang is a governor after all.

722
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,660
He can just explain to the observer,

723
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,830
return the things
and say it's a misunderstanding.

724
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,510
It's not that difficult to solve it.

725
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,300
It's not difficult to explain it,

726
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,430
but the head of the Ye family
must be the one

727
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,950
to say

728
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,390
that they asked the governor and yamen
to protect the tributes

729
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,030
instead of Tong Zhiyang
taking them for himself.

730
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,220
So if Tong Zhiyang wants to live,

731
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,140
he'll have to beg the Ye family.

732
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,550
Everything will be easy.

733
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,620
You stop while you're ahead.

734
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,950
You draw the line just right.

735
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,780
I learned it from you.

736
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,030
But once Tong Zhiyang's case
turns out to be a misunderstanding,

737
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,700
who do you think will be blamed

738
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,990
for letting the observer
come here for nothing?

739
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,550
If you want to eat these juicy buns

740
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,300
in the future,

741
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,100
I'll settle everything for you.

742
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,170
You didn't see Tong Zhiyang's face.

743
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,250
His face was livid.

744
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:58,500
I'm telling you.

745
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,810
I've never felt so good.

746
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,650
Yes, wealth is good.

747
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,380
But he didn't realize
wealth can kill him too.

748
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,020
Don't they want money?

749
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,330
We'll give them without hesitation.

750
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,940
Now that they've took
the fatal tributes,

751
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,500
they're going to kill themselves.

752
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,380
So the Ye family does business

753
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,770
by not taking money we don't deserve.

754
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,290
I'll have to trouble you
to deal with them next.

755
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,540
If Tong Zhiyang wants to clear his name

756
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,290
with the observer,

757
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,810
he'll have to help the Ye family
clarify that we were set up

758
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:31,900
for the Soochow brocade

759
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,460
and release Shun.

760
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,430
But if we spare them,

761
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,910
won't they cause trouble in the future?

762
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,260
He doesn't stand a chance.

763
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,140
If he has different ideas,

764
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,300
at least Li Zhongnan won't let him

765
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,100
stay as Luyang's governor.

766
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:47,260
Wonderful.

767
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,620
Won't we
be killing two birds with one stone?

768
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:54,430
Third Uncle.

769
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,550
You sold

770
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,940
your escort agency

771
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,220
for the Ye family.

772
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,300
Why don't you take this opportunity
to go home?

773
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,100
I'm as poor as a fiddle right now.

774
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,300
Am I supposed to go back
and let them laugh at me?

775
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:06,580
Guess

776
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,030
what Second Uncle said after I told him

777
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,180
about your help with my investigation.

778
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,390
He must have said I couldn't carry on
with the escort agency

779
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:14,830
and that I'd lost every penny.

780
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,180
Second Uncle didn't say that.

781
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,510
Second Uncle said,

782
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,940
"Li, your Third Uncle

783
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,510
may be unreliable,

784
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,650
but he knows
what's right and what's wrong."

785
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,610
He asked me to cooperate with you

786
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,100
and even secretly asked me

787
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,980
to give you
the money he hid in his pillow

788
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,210
if the Ye family

789
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,770
can't get through this.

790
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,210
He also asked me to give you a message.

791
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,420
He said the Ye family's broke

792
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,650
and ask you to get lost

793
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,470
and never come back.

794
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,510
Did he really say that?

795
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,830
Brothers are family
connected by blood after all.

796
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,610
They won't be enemies forever.

797
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,690
Go home.

798
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,250
If he really misses me that much,

799
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,770
I'll do them a favor

800
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,860
and go home to visit them.

801
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,210
[A family that accumulates good deeds
will benefit its descendants.]

802
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,130
Go and switch to
Mingxuan's favorite incense.

803
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:18,770
Yes.

804
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,380
- Wipe the table cleaner.
- Yes.

805
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,540
The plants will be here soon.

806
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,690
The writing materials.

807
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,980
Clean the writing materials.

808
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,730
Madam Li, they're not aligned.

809
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,210
No. A little lower.

810
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:32,980
Yes, Madam.

811
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,420
How many times have she said it?

812
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,770
Our home hasn't been this lively
in a long time.

813
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,580
You... Straighten this up.

814
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,250
Second Uncle's coming back today.

815
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,940
Third Uncle's coming home too.

816
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,210
Ye's Residence will only be more lively.

817
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,660
How nice.

818
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:49,220
I thought

819
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,350
ordinary days were boring.

820
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,140
After this incident, I realize...

821
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:53,870
Jia'er.

822
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,510
Where's the brazier?

823
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,260
Make a big fire.

824
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:58,260
Great.

825
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,260
I have to burn a fire.

826
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,550
Got it. Fire girl is coming.

827
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:03,910
Good girl.

828
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,100
Mingyu, hang the lanterns.

829
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,030
Is...

830
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,180
Isn't Li here doing nothing too?

831
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,620
Why won't you order her around?

832
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,220
Li's different.

833
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,870
She's the Ye family's savior.

834
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,300
How can I order her around?

835
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,390
Hurry.

836
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,580
Stop being so long-winded.

837
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:20,780
I'll do it.

838
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,550
Madam, Mr. Ye's back.

839
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,020
Darling!

840
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:45,940
Mingxuan!

841
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,780
I'm back.

842
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,990
Stop. Start over.

843
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,030
Where's the brazier? Bring it over.

844
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,060
Put it here. Here.

845
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,810
Let your father cross over it

846
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:55,500
and get rid of bad luck.

847
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,060
Why didn't you

848
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,250
bring it to me sooner?

849
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,860
I have to work up my emotions again.

850
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,020
So it's my fault?

851
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:02,380
What are you doing? Hurry back.

852
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:05,540
Come on.

853
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,620
Darling!

854
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,030
Mingxuan!

855
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:19,350
Darling.

856
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,100
I missed you so much.

857
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,070
I missed you more.

858
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:22,780
I missed you even more.

859
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,030
I missed you even more than you.

860
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,580
I missed you even more than you.

861
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,870
That... That's enough.
There are two more people here.

862
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,470
Mingyu,
you've done a great job this time.

863
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,550
Mingxuan, don't mention it.

864
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,740
Mingyu, you didn't grow much

865
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,870
after being out for so long.

866
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:46,700
You're old now.

867
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,740
Just beg for mercy
if you can't stand it.

868
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,350
You're overestimating yourself.

869
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:51,780
- Third Uncle.
- Mingxuan.

870
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,140
Li.

871
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:00,990
Second Uncle.

872
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,470
The Ye family owes you a favor.

873
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,220
I was suspicious of you before.

874
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,580
Now it seems

875
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,580
I've been cynical.

876
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,660
I'm sorry.

877
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,830
Second Uncle, I can't let you do that.

878
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,620
If Li's mother is still around,

879
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,350
she won't stand by and watch

880
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,030
if the Ye family is in trouble.

881
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,990
Though we settled the problem this time,

882
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,390
the Ye family has also

883
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,260
lost a lot of money and jewelry.

884
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:26,580
His Majesty favored Shijie

885
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,390
and gave him
an official position in the capital.

886
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,950
These jewelry can be considered as
tributes from the Ye family.

887
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,390
Don't worry about it.

888
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,220
I was young

889
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,700
and got tricked by others.

890
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,390
I broke Grandmother and Uncles' heart.

891
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,780
I'm still ashamed even now.

892
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,510
I'm grateful

893
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,070
that you're willing to give me a chance

894
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:50,580
to make it up to you.

895
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,550
We can't blame you
for what happened in the past.

896
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,180
You were so young.

897
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,870
As elders,
we should understand your situation.

898
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,470
Now that I think about it,

899
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:01,660
We let you hang around the Jiang family
at a young age.

900
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,780
Especially Ji Shuran. I...

901
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,990
I didn't mean to bring up
what upsets you.

902
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:12,300
I've spent time with Li these days.

903
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:13,990
I only think she's gentle and cute.

904
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:16,390
She doesn't seem like someone
who would kill her mother and brother.

905
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,950
Ji Shuran must have set her up.

906
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:18,660
Jia'er.

907
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,430
It's all right, Aunt.

908
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,910
Whatever happened
is already in the past.

909
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,220
What matters most is the present.

910
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:28,700
The top priority

911
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,620
is for Li to meet Mother.

912
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,550
Yes, Li should meet Grandmother.

913
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:33,870
Now?

914
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,740
Can Grandmother take it?

915
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,950
I can't take it

916
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,030
if you tell me so late.

917
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,030
- Grandmother.
- Mother.

918
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,870
Grandmother, what are you doing here?

919
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:48,700
Good girl.

920
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,100
Let me look at you.

921
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:53,030
Grandmother.

922
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:02,030
I'm so happy that you can visit me

923
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,470
when I'm still around.

924
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:10,660
Grandmother,
don't you blame me for what I did?

925
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:16,350
You're the Ye family's granddaughter,
Jiang Li.

926
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:27,510
Li, don't worry.
The Ye family forgives you.

927
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:31,910
It's not that no one loves
Second Lady Jiang.

928
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,700
Other than your mother, Ye Zhenzhen,

929
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:41,550
you have so many loved ones
who miss you.

930
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:44,390
You're not alone.

931
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,660
And you.

932
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,300
Have you had enough outside?

933
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,470
Since you're back,

934
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,660
help your brother out

935
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,430
just like how you did this time.

936
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:04,550
You can overcome any difficulties
when you work together.

937
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:05,830
Mother.

938
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:11,780
Son, come back if you're tired.

939
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:15,740
I'm always at home waiting for you.

940
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,070
Mom, this...

941
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:23,870
This is Mingxuan's fault.

942
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,510
He refused to lend me money.

943
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:26,990
If he had lent me money,

944
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,870
I would have come back
after settling my affairs.

945
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:30,580
Mingyu.

946
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,510
Don't think that I'm scared to beat you

947
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:32,430
because Mother's here.

948
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,070
I think you need a beating.

949
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,350
You haven't come back for years.

950
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,030
Have you gone mad when you're out there?

951
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:37,780
Stand still.

952
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:38,870
You...

953
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,180
- You can't get me.
- Stand there.

954
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:40,780
You can't get me.

955
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:41,510
How dare you run?

956
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:42,990
Mother, save me.

957
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:43,990
Stop.

958
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:45,350
- Mingxuan.
- How dare you run?

959
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,700
- Mother, don't protect him.
- Mother.

960
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:52,300
If Father and Zhao are still around,

961
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,830
will they also forgive me

962
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,390
for trusting the wrong person?

963
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,070
It's a pity that the people
who can forgive me

964
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:08,830
are gone.

965
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:17,700
Li, stop crying. You're home.

966
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,990
I'm home.
