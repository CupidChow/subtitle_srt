Didn't they kill everyone?

You're right.

Who will do the work if we kill them?
Calm down.

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,710
I'll let you off.

But didn't the rumor say

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,920
that you had an accident
on your way back to your hometown?

85
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,720
How could you...

86
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,160
It's a long story.

87
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,600
I have a new identity now.

88

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,040
Jiang Li?

90
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,950
From now on, don't call me

91
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,190
by my old name in front of outsiders.

92
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,310
Let yourselves out,
and I'll tell you in detail.

93
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,040
It's heavily guarded here.

94
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,360
It's not that easy to escape.

95
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,160
He's right.

96
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,480
Xue Li, just go.

97
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,870
Even if we escape,

98
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,040
Feng Yutang

99
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,000
won't let us go.

100
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,310
- Yes, hurry up.
- I'm not leaving.

101
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,310
Go.

102
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,160
I'm not leaving.

103
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,720
Don't worry.

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,000
It's time to bring Feng Yutang
down a peg or two.

105
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,720
Now that I've come in,

106
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,720
I must take you out.

107
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,720
Let's go over there and see.

108
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,870
Let's see if anyone is lazy.

109
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,600
All right.

110
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
Don't be frightened! He is one of us.

111
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,390
Somebody is coming.

112
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,240
Are you going to knock me to death?

113
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,890
Behave yourself and work hard!

114
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,820
My brother told you

115
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,740
to be more productive.

116
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,330
What's going on with you today?

117
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,770
Work hard.

118
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,740
Wait for me.

119
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,020
Are you skipping dinner?

120
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:15,890
Do you want to starve me to death?

121
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,970
No.

122
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,330
Where are they?

123
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,180
I watched them come in.

124
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,380
Xue...

125
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,450
Li.

126
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,380
We have thought about it.

127
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,210
You come and save us with courage.

128
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,410
Why don't we dare to go out?

129
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,090
But

130
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,650
He Jun and Peng Xiao are also here.

131
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,650
Are He Jun and Peng Xiao still alive?

132
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,620
Er and I will call on them.

133
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,020
Be careful.

134
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,980
Don't give the game away.

135
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,170
Don't worry.

136
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:35,930
- Let's go.
- Go.

137
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,620
Keep up.

138
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,020
Hurry up.

139
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,810
This way.

140
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,530
All right, go.

141
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,570
After dinner,

142
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,810
another shift will take over.

143
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,340
Here you go.

144
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,380
Let's take this opportunity

145
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,890
to get Peng Xiao and He Jun.

146
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,740
All right, that's all.

147
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:04,740
Da.

148
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,290
Go.

149
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,290
He Jun and Peng Xiao are over there.

150
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,050
Hurry up.

151
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:09,860
Let's go.

152
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,690
Yours.

153
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,980
No time to explain.

154
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,460
Let's go.

155
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:18,980
Go.

156
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,410
Your shoulders are shaking.

157
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,050
You're mistaken.

158
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,140
As someone who was dragged
into the game by you,

159
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,810
I need to remind you.

160
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,340
This operation is too risky.

161
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,860
With your intelligence,

162
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,100
you can wait until I destroy them

163
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
and get a free ride.

164
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,260
Why not?

165
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,340
By the time
you gather sufficient evidence

166
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,810
and send troops to seize the gold mine,

167
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,570
Magistrate Xue has been beheaded.

168
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,100
Come.

169
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,570
Oh, no!

170
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,290
They don't know
that the inspectors are approaching.

171
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,410
We have to go back.

172
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,340
Follow me.

173
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,460
Quick, hide!

174
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:29,740
Come.

175
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:42,620
Er.

176
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,620
Be quiet.

177
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,500
Calm down.

178
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,620
If the worst comes to the worst,
we'll fight.

179
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,690
You're right.

180
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,690
There are four of us and two of them.

181
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,410
I feel like sleeping when I'm full.

182
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,260
All you do is eat and sleep.

183
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,860
Help! Something happened.

184
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,810
Help!

185
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,860
Something's up. Help!

186
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,570
Help! Something's up.

187
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,740
Step back.

188
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,410
Over there! Catch them.

189
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
My Lord, please go first.

190
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,460
Come back alive.

191
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,140
Yes.

192
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,170
Let's go.

193
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:38,620
Go.

194
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,650
You can't even guard a person.

195
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,260
You let him run away.

196
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,340
What's the use
of keeping a dead loss like you?

197
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,810
Magistrate, don't worry.

198
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,770
We have been searching
the whole city for Ye Mingyu.

199
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,810
He will not be able
to escape from Huaixiang.

200
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,380
Rest assured.

201
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,020
Rest assured?

202
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,650
Have you ever reassured me?

203
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,260
Magistrate, please calm down.

204
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,220
When we were searching,

205
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,340
we found that there was a spy

206
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,020
in yamen.

207
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,650
Xue Huaiyuan took you in back then.

208
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,860
To return the favor,
you are willing to die.

209
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,020
I didn't expect
that there would be someone

210
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,860
as kind and righteous as you in yamen.

211
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,690
And look at you.

212
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,410
A pack of dogs.

213
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,290
Maybe one day

214
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,890
you will sell me for money.

215
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,460
There's just one thing

216
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,050
I can't figure out.

217
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,860
I took you in
after Xue Huaiyuan fell from power.

218
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,570
I am your benefactor, too.

219
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,570
Why did you betray me?

220
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,770
Crook!

221
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,260
You didn't deserve
to be compared with Magistrate Xue.

222
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,890
I thought you were dumb.

223
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,050
Since you are not dumb,

224
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,980
tell me

225
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,810
if Jiang Li is Xue Fangfei.

226
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,020
Where is she?

227
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,500
What did you say?

228
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,140
If you don't tell me, I'll be angry.

229
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,690
Fine.

230
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,570
I'll tell you.

231
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,570
She told me that day that...

232
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,170
Go to hell, you crook!

233
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,170
Bring Guai here.

234
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,050
It hasn't eaten meat for days.

235
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,620
She is just enough for a good feed.

236
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,690
This hag

237
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,260
has only uttered a few words
in her life.

238
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,650
This time,

239
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,020
let her scream.

240
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,180
My Lord.

241
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,130
Get in the carriage. I'll deal with it.

242
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,370
Lu Ji is still behind us.
Go and pick him up.

243
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:14,770
All right.

244
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,700
Come.

245
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:18,850
Get in.

246
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,290
Follow me.

247
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:24,980
All right.

248

Report!

249
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,370
Report.

250
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,530
Magistrate,
there's a report from the mine.

251
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,850
The miners were rescued by someone.

252
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,530
So their goal is the gold mine.

253
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,260
Is there any letter from above?

254
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,850
Not yet.

- No?

257
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,570
- No?
- Please spare me, Magistrate.

258
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,570
- Always no!
- Please spare me, Magistrate.

259
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,530
- Why none?
- Please spare me, Magistrate.

260
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,500
Get out!

261
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,220
Magistrate, there is a pigeon post

262
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,530
from the capital.

263
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,330
Since I have someone to support me
even if the sky falls,

264
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,460
I don't have anything to worry about.

265
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,370
If you dare to challenge me
on my home ground,

266
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,260
I will make sure
you never come out alive.

267
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,420
There's an ambush.
Get out of the carriage.

268
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:15,770

269
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,050

with bandages.

It's nothing.

302
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,900
I'll mend it?

What? Is there any problem?

304

in Feng Yutang's hands.

00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,050
Feng Yutang!

379
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,370
Be a man.

380
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,740
How could you threaten people
with a demented old man?

381
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,660
Xue.

382
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,610
It seems we got the wrong person.

383
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:13,290
Your daughter wouldn't leave you
in the lurch, surely?

384
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,610
My carriage is parked in the front yard.

385
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,020
Then?

386
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,940
Duke Su, fill my carriage with gold.

387
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,940
I will go quietly.

388
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:26,940
Li.

389
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,290
But if I feel threatened

390
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,700
on the way,

391
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,180
my hand

392
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,570
may not be in control.

393
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:37,810
Feng Yutang.

394
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,370
You must be out of your tiny mind.

395
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,810
The case of the gold mine is a big one.

396
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,740
You want to grab someone and run away.

397
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,420
And demand money with menaces?

398
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,180
My opinion doesn't matter.

399
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,850
Duke Su's opinion matters.

400
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,650
But hurry up.

401
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,220
We're running out of time.

402
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,500
Jiang Li.

403
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,330
Li.

404
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,540
Li.

405
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,260
Li.

406
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,850
Li.

407
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,820
I promise you.

408
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,260
Lu Ji.

409
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,060
Load up the carriage.

410
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,410
Li.

411
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,650
Done.

412
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:34,980
Make way.

413
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,820
Li.

414
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,170
Li.

415
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,940
Mr. Xue, you are honored.

416
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,370
Li.

417
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,100
Do you believe me?

418
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,470
I do.

419
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,100
Go.

420
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,030
Killing...

421
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,030
Kill...

422
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,470
Not good.

423
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,230
Father.

424
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,300
Killing is not good.

425
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,620
Father.

426
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,020
Get up!

427
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,170
Well done.

428
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,650
Thanks for the compliment, My Lord.

429
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,580
You double-crossed me.

430
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,810
Aren't you nasty?

431
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,500
Take back what you said.

432
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:40,420
I'm not as good at winning hearts
as you are.

433
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,460
I pity people
who have sacrificed their lives for you.

434
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,260
They come to a sticky end.

435
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,570
Dumb Madam.

436
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,420
What happened to Dumb Madam?

437
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:58,020
Go ask the dog at the door.

438
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,700
It's on a full stomach.

439
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,380
Duke Su.

440
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,690
Can you give him the antidote?

441
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,540
Dying like this

442
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,500
is a merciful end for him.

443
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,820
He won't die.

444
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,250
It's a big case.

445
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,530
Dead men tell no tales.

446
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,460
The people from the Ministry of Justice
will be here tomorrow.

447
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,300
I don't believe you dare to kill me.

448
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,340
Hellcat, I know it's you.

449
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,050
When your father,
Xue Huaiyuan, dies tomorrow,

450
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,050
I will be the first
to send you to hell together.

451
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,420
Third Uncle.

452
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,690
Your knife.

453
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,090
Come on.

454
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,090
A tribute

455
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,050
to Magistrate Xue and Xue Zhao.

456
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,570
You can't beat me.

457
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,460
Just wait until your father is beheaded.

458
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,690
A tribute to Dumb Madam.

459
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,090
You cow!

460
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,210
I am going to kill you.

461
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,940
A tribute
to all the officials you persecuted.

462
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,090
Nutcase.

463
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,860
A tribute
to all the people in Huaixiang.

464
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:36,940
Please.

465
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,530
Lady Xue, please forgive me.

466
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,170
Go to hell!

467
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,650
Lady Xue, please forgive me.

468
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,090
A tribute

469
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,060
to Qiongzhi.

470
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,500
Staunch the blood.

471
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:07,860
Keep him alive.

472
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,060
[Huaixiang District Office]

473
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:26,940
Let them go.

474
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,460
You will not catch them.

475
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,300
Fear not.

476
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,620
Don't be afraid. It's me.

477
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,900
It's me.

478
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,580
Dangerous.

479
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,460
It's not.

480
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,420
- It's dangerous.
- It's not.

481
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,500
Father, there is no one but me.

482
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,140
Li.

483
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,660
I'm here.

484
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,100
Li.

485
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,460
Father, I'm here.

486
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,260
Li.

487
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,830
I'm here.

488
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,700
Li?

489
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,580
Li.

490
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,260
Li.

491
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,420
Li.

492
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,180
It's dangerous.

493
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,660
- Father.
- Li.

494
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,860
- Li.
- Father.

495
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,940
- Li.
- Father, come to your senses.

496
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:13,780
Father.

497
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,300
Li.

498
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,660
Li, don't cry.

499
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,620
Li, don't cry.

500
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,510
Li.

501
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,940
Don't cry.

502
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,390
Li.

503
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,100
Sorry, father.

504
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,390
Don't cry.

505
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,990
I'm sorry.

506
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,660
Don't cry.

507
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,420
I'm late.

508
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:48,940
Don't.

509
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,940
I will save you.

510
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,770
I will overturn the verdict.

511
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,020
Li.

512
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,860
Those who harm us...

513
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:57,660
Don't cry.

514
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,250
Will not get away with it.

515
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,610
Every one of them.

516
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,540
All right?

517
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,580
Don't cry.

518
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,810
It's all right.

519
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,810
It's all right.

520
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,210
Li.

521
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,980
Duke Su.

522
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,420
Why are you here?

523
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,210
I'm waiting for you.

524
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,650
What's wrong? Did something happen?

525
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,940
Nothing.

526
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,500
Relax.

527
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,070
I don't want

528
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,550
to get anyone into trouble anymore.

529
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,470
Go look for

530
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,430
witnesses who can help Xue Huaiyuan
overturn the verdict.

531
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,350
I'll let you know when the word is out.

532
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,470
All right.

533
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,580
Cowards!

534
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,950
They had no hesitation

535
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,620
in receiving benefits
from Magistrate Xue.

536
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,470
I will go.

537
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,580
If they don't come,
I will make them come by force.

538
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,260
Pack it in.

539
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,580
You are not them.

540
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,220
You can't understand their difficulties.

541
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,140
Understand them?

542
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,620
Have they understood
Magistrate Xue's situation?

543
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,140
Are we going to sit by and watch

544
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,740
Magistrate Xue...

545
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,470
What's wrong?

546
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,260
What was really going on?

547
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,100
We don't know

548
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,950
anything about Magistrate Xue.

549
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,740
We are just ordinary people.

550
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,870
We do everything
asked by local authorities.

551
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,870
You don't know?

552
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,870
Without Magistrate Xue's support,

553
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,140
how could Ping'an

554
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,300
be alive and healthy now?

555
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,350
Isn't this enough

556
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,830
for you to speak up

557
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,620
for the magistrate?

558
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:05,950
During the Spring Festival,

559
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,780
I wanted
to visit Magistrate Xue in the prison.

560
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,260
I wanted to give him some dumplings.

561
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,510
But in the blink of an eye,

562
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,220
they took Ping'an away.

563
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,390
Look.

564
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,510
Look how they hit Ping'an.

565
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,740
I only have Ping'an.

566
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,990
Feng Yutang is dead.

567
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,580
You don't have to be afraid.

568
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,430
Everybody minds their own business.

569
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,780
I beg of you.

570
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,990
Let us two live a peaceful life.

571
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,510
I'm sorry for Magistrate Xue.

572
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,830
I'm sorry for Magistrate Xue.

573
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,140
I can't do it.

574
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,300
I can't do it.

575
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,140
Coward!

576
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,260
Now I know.

577
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,990
What did your mother say?

578
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,870
You ungrateful brat!

579
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,430
Enough already!

580
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,430
I wanted to redress the injustices
for Magistrate Xue.

581
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,350
I submitted a petition

582
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,030
when I learned
that Magistrate Xue was convicted.

583
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,070
But the new county magistrate

584
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,740
beat the hell out of my mother.

585
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,550
Feng Yutang is dead.

586
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,700
Why are you still afraid of him?

587
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,870
We are just ordinary people.

588
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,260
We only want to live.

589
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,990
I can only repay

590
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,430
Magistrate Xue's kindness

591
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,350
in my next life.

592
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,030
Zhang, if you don't go,

593
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,740
no one will come forward.

594
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,510
When they confiscated Xue's Residence,

595
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:38,990
I went there.

596
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,390
How did it end?

597
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,100
I was struck blind in one eye by them.

598
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,620
I don't want to lose another eye.

599
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,660
We went to

600
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,260
several of the villagers' homes.

601
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,140
Zhang, Dai Yun, and Mo Wenxuan.

602
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,990
They...

603
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,390
Got it.

604
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,510
Go back first.

605
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:00,700
Thank you.

606
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,660
How about we go ask someone else?

607
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:04,350
He's right.

608
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,550
Magistrate Xue is kind-hearted.

609
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,260
God will take care of him.

610
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,990
Sure, one good turn deserves another.

611
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,660
Aunt Chunfang.

612
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,030
It's me.

613
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,870
I'm Fangfei,
whom you have known since I was a kid.

614
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,350
Li.

615
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,510
It's you.

616
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,070
You are still alive.

617
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,430
Aunt.

618
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,070
My father will be beheaded tomorrow.

619
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,580
I would like you
to speak out in his defense.

620
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:06,620
Close the door.

621
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,220
Aunt.

622
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,620
Aunt.

623
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,180
Aunt.

624
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:18,870
Please.

625
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:20,950
I beg of you.

626
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:25,910
Please.

627
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,260
I beg of you.

628
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,070
Li.

629
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:28,870
Please.

630
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,870
Good girl.

631
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,780
Stand up. Don't kneel.

632
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:36,550
Your hand...

633
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,510
They did this.

634
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:41,910
Did they do this to you?

635
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:45,700
Come back!

636
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,390
Uncle Liu's leg...

637
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:07,660
Li, think of us as cowards.

638
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:08,990
Just think of us

639
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,660
as dead.

640
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,030
Do good deeds

641
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,180
really lead to good karma?
