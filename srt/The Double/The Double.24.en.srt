[The Double]

16
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,020
[Episode 24]

17
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,830
I've heard that Mr. Shen's wife

18
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,000
was the most talented woman
in Huaixiang.

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,910
I was curious and checked her out.

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,830
Sure enough,

21
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,080
Mrs. Shen was uniquely beautiful.

22
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,080
She was a rare beauty.

23
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,910
So I was shocked

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,750
when I saw Second Lady Jiang

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,910
because she looked
exactly like Xue Fangfei.

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,390
Your Majesty,

27
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,990
have you ever heard

28
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,990
of two people who are not related

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,870
but look exactly alike?

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,110
If there's a coincidence
that three members of a family

31
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,830
were killed at the same time,

32
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,240
it's not much of a coincidence
that two people look the same.

33
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,360
I just feel sorry for Second Lady Jiang,

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,150
who lived in Zhennyu Hall for ten years,

35
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,430
and was about to return
to Jiang's Residence,

36
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,430
but was brutally murdered by someone.

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,710
I'm afraid even Second Lady Jiang's father,
the Secretariat Director,

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,960
has been in the dark.

39
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,550
Your Highness,

40
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,920
what do you mean by saying that?

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,550
Please make it clear.

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,590
How could a woman
who had spent ten years

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,360
in Zhennyu Hall
since she was eight years old

44
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,830
without being taught

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,640
outperform the noble descendants
of the capital

46
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,240
and take the first place
in the Entry Exam?

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,520
There are so many
miserable people in the world.

48
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,320
Why did Second Lady Jiang try to

49
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,360
save Xue Huaiyuan at all costs?

50
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,150
The only explanation

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,390
for all this

52
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,760
is that you're not Jiang Li,

53
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,710
you're Xue Fangfei.

54
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,830
That's an offense
of deceiving His Majesty.

55
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,830
Yes.

56
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,110
It's an offense
of deceiving His Majesty.

57
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,150
It's a serious offense.

58
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,240
Yes, how dare she deceive His Majesty?

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Your Highness,

60
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,800
if I'm the Xue Fangfei you say I am,

61
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,670
how could the people of Huaixiang
who followed me to the capital

62
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,760
not know?

63
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,760
Xue Fangfei grew up in Huaixiang,

64
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,800
so they'd recognise her.

65
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,520
Your Highness
can send someone to find out

66
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,990
if I'm Xue Fangfei or Jiang Li.

67
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,920
Those who went to the capital
with you to present a complaint

68
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,670
must have conspired with you in advance.

69
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,080
If you don't mind me torturing them,

70
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,040
I'll give it a try.

71
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,760
Those who dared to enter the capital
to present a complaint

72
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,040
are those who disregard life and death.

73
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,040
Do Your Highness

74
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,670
want them to suffer again?

75
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,240
Look at this, everyone.

76
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,640
She's still protecting
the people of Huaixiang.

77
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,640
Your Majesty,

78
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,390
the people of Huaixiang and I

79
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,240
have gone to great lengths

80
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,790
to save a good official from injustice.

81
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,680
I don't know how my looks

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,120
have offended Eldest Princess.

83
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,230
She is so pushy

84
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,230
to use a dead man

85
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,760
to get rid of me.

86
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,680
Second Lady Jiang, you're really good

87
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,760
at making counter-charge.

88
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,320
But I'm not interested
in your life and death.

89
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,200
I just feel bad
for Secretariat Director,

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,320
Official Ye,

91
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
[Prosperous Era]
and those who were fooled

92
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,200
by you.

93
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,910
Especially His Majesty.

94
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,030
It's touching to see such compassion

95
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,320
towards a good official.

96
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,910
It's a pity that in the end,

97
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,230
he's just being used.

98
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,760
Xue Huaiyuan's case
has just been cleared up.

99
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,080
Everything I said is true.

100
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,710
I wonder
how Eldest Princess got the idea

101
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,390
that the official was being used

102
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
or

103
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,830
where she heard

104
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,590
such a ridiculous claim
that I was Xue Fangfei.

105
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,760
Easy.

106
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,830
I'll let you meet
your old acquaintance in a minute.

107
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,150
Secretary of Judicial Review,

108
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,710
summon my witness.

109
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,000
Summon the witness.

110
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

111
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,590
Who is this?

112
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,350
This is Shouzhen,
the head of Zhennyu Hall,

113
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,470
where Second Lady Jiang
had been staying for 10 years.

114
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,320
Although Shouzhen's adultery
was severely punished by His Majesty,

115
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,440
Second Lady Jiang's deception

116
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,710
is still a big deal.

117
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,030
That's why I

118
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,350
got Shouzhen out of jail.

119
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,230
And I found out something interesting
when I got her out.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,830
I wonder who's behind this,

121
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,910
keeping Shouzhen

122
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,390
a thousand miles away in Huicheng.

123
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,910
I've made

124
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,520
a lot of effort to find her.

125
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,710
But there's no rush.

126
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,830
We can look into it later.

127
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,830
Identifying the person
is the most important thing now.

128
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,270
Shouzhen,

129
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,960
look carefully,

130
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,590
is this person Jiang Li?

131
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,680
Your Majesty,

132
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,910
she is not Jiang Li.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
Look carefully.

134
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,150
If you talk nonsense,

135
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,830
I'll cut out your tongue.

136
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,710
I watched Jiang Li grow up

137
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,150
from the age of eight to eighteen.

138
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,000
I'd recognise her
even if she turned into ashes.

139
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,080
She

140
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,760
is not Jiang Li.

141
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,910
[Prosperous Era]

142
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,230
If it's true what you say,

143
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,960
where's Jiang Li?

144
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,230
We'll have to ask Madam Xue about it.

145
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,320
Mistress,

146
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,200
you say I'm not Jiang Li.

147
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,000
So where's the real Jiang Li?

148
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,440
She was killed

149
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,880
by you.

150
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,120
Okay.

151
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,150
If you say

152
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,710
I killed the real Jiang Li,

153
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,080
how did I kill her?

154
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,230
And where is her body?

155
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,270
You killed her.

156
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,710
You'd already disposed of her body.

157
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,640
Of course I don't know.

158
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,230
When Mrs. Liu went to Zhennyu Hall,

159
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,390
I was the one who met her.

160
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,560
Why didn't you expose me?

161
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,590
I was confused

162
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
because you offered

163
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,440
to help clear my name when you became

164
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,080
Second Lady Jiang

165
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,880
so I helped you to cover up the lie.

166
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,000
So this is why

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,790
you came to slander my identity?

168
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,710
What?

169
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,790
I slander you?

170
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,960
You're really good
at making counter-charge.

171
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,790
Your Majesty,

172
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,320
[Prosperous Era]

173
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,390
This head of Zhennyu Hall
is morally unsound

174
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,830
and committed adultery,

175
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,120
so such a person's words
are not to be trusted.

176
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,440
Now she must have been bribed by someone

177
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,880
to exonerate her

178
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,030
by slandering me.

179
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,710
I beg Your Majesty to look into this.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,760
That's not the case.

181
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,390
I'm telling the truth.

182
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,320
You're not...

183
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,790
Firstly,

184
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,080
you can't tell me how I killed Jiang Li.

185
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,320
Secondly,

186
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,510
you can't tell
where the real Jiang Li is now.

187
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,350
On what grounds
can you slander my identity?

188
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,110
Moreover,

189
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,280
Zhennyu Hall is very strict.

190
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,230
How can a living person
be replaced just like that?

191
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,230
Besides,

192
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,510
my maid, Tong,

193
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,590
grew up with me.

194
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,040
Are you saying she was replaced, too?

195
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,510
That's because you're in cahoots!

196
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,160
My father knew Tong's loyalty

197
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,560
to me.

198
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,320
She gave up her future
in the Jiang family

199
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,280
and followed me
to Zhennyu Hall to suffer.

200
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,200
If I'm an impostor,

201
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,710
how can she let me go?

202
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,590
Shouzhen, let me remind you.

203
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,680
No matter who ordered you to slander me,

204
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,960
you must remember

205
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,320
that whether you succeed or not,

206
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,710
you will not end up well.

207
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,870
You speak up in front
of His Majesty today.

208
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,200
If you make it,

209
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,230
you're just a pawn.

210
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,590
If you don't,

211
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,630
you're still a pawn.

212
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,750
You'll be gotten rid of.

213
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,040
So the only way to turn back

214
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,990
is to get your head on straight

215
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,040
and distinguish right
from wrong earlier.

216
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,160
Madam Xue, you're so eloquent.

217
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,800
You're making a lie
sound like the truth.

218
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,830
Looks like Eldest Princess

219
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,870
won't believe the truth I say today.

220
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,830
In fact,
besides the head of Zhennyu Hall,

221
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,830
there are other people who can prove

222
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,710
that I am the real Jiang Li.

223
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,560
Who?

224
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,110
Why don't we ask them
to come and find out?

225
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,830
My men have sent word

226
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,960
that the head of Zhennyu Hall,
who was imprisoned in Huicheng,

227
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,400
has been brought out.

228
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,710
Looks like someone
is up to no good today.

229
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,440
Thank you for notifying me, Duke Su.

230
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,920
Have you thought about what to do?

231
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,320
I don't have anyone to use.

232
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Can you help me find someone?

233
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,960
Who's it?

234
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,560
A maiden from Zhennyu Hall.

235
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,680
Tell me her name.

236
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,040
I'll ask Lu Ji to look for her.

237
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,990
And pass on a message to her for me.

238
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,230
Greetings, Your Majesty.

239
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,400
It's you.

240
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,990
Tell them

241
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,590
that she's not Jiang Li.

242
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,230
You have no choice
but to do it this time.

243
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,110
She asked me to pass on
a message to you.

244
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,200
What's it?

245
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,400
She said

246
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,800
bribery is the worst tactic of all.

247
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,230
So she won't promise you anything,

248
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,680
but

249
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,400
it's your only chance
to redeem yourself.

250
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,200
For what you did in the past.

251
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,220
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,470
I apologize for everything I did.

253
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,680
I'm sorry,

254
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,630
Second Lady Jiang.

255
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,830
What nonsense are you talking about?

256
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

257
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,440
She is not Jiang Li!

258
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,350
She is Jiang Li.

259
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,990
She is Jiang Li!

260
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,160
- Nonsense!
- She is.

261
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,440
She is not Jiang Li.

262
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,830
She is not Jiang Li at all!

263
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,870
She is Jiang Li!

264
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,510
- She is Jiang Li!
- What's wrong with you?

265
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,320
Second Lady Jiang.
Second Lady Jiang, I'm sorry.

266
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,400
I apologize for what I did.

267
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,830
- Don't talk nonsense!
- Second Lady Jiang.

268
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,040
Second Lady Jiang, please forgive me.

269
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,750
Take the two maidens out of here.

270
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,700
She is Jiang Li!

271
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,630
She is not Jiang Li!

272
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,590
- She is Jiang Li!
- Second Lady Jiang, please forgive me!

273
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,160
You can't lie to His Majesty!

274
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,800
[Prosperous Era]
You can't!

275
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,710
She is not Jiang Li!

276
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,040
You've got a real knack

277
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,800
for getting these people
to tell lies for you.

278
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,870
Very good. Mr. Shen,

279
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,440
after so many years
living with your wife,

280
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,160
you wouldn't tell lies, would you?

281
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,110
Is this the Mrs. Shen

282
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,830
you've always had in mind?

283
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,320
Wanning,

284
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,750
stop messing around.

285
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,750
Is she

286
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,710
your wife?

287
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,260
[Prosperous Era]

288
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,040
No.

289
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,350
Shen Yurong, what did you say?

290
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,560
How could she not be Xue Fangfei?

291
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,420
You're lying.

292
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,560
She's obviously Xue Fangfei!

293
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,340
Your Highness,

294
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,060
my wife is dead.

295
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,130
Even if there was someone

296
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,700
who looked exactly like her,

297
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,460
it wouldn't be her.

298
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,100
[Prosperous Era]
Shen Yurong, are you blind?

299
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,890
You can't even recognise your own wife?

300
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,770
Your Highness, please mind your words.

301
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,700
Don't be disrespectful
in front of His Majesty.

302
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,980
It's impossible
that I don't recognise my own wife.

303
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,100
Then let's open the coffin

304
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,180
and examine the bones.

305
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,340
My late wife died in the mountains

306
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,420
and I couldn't find her bones,

307
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,250
so I had to build an empty tomb for her.

308
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,220
Your Highness,

309
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,580
what can you examine?

310
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,770
Who says I want
to examine Xue Fangfei's bones?

311
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,460
Xue Fangfei is standing right here

312
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,340
and the real Jiang Li
was killed by her long ago.

313
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,420
Her body was buried
on Qingcheng Mountain.

314
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,850
Have you forgotten

315
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,340
that Li didn't go to school

316
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,820
as she's been living in Zhennyu Hall
since she was little?

317
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,820
[Men end up in hills and graveyards.]
The strokes are strong,

318
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,850
straight and neat.

319
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,370
Since ancient times,
people's defense of a criminal

320
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,370
is like the people's offense
against the government.

321
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,300
She doesn't know what she's doing!

322
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,820
There are so many
miserable people in the world.

323
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,580
Why did Second Lady Jiang

324
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,650
try to save Xue Huaiyuan at all costs?

325
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,700
Grand Chancellor Jiang,

326
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,010
Your real daughter, Jiang Li,

327
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,060
was buried on Qingcheng Mountain.

328
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,490
I've found her tomb.

329
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,460
If you open the coffin
and let the coroner examine the bones,

330
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,890
you'll know who your real daughter is.

331
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,220
Father,

332
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,100
seems like Her Highness

333
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,130
won't let me go today.

334
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,820
Guards,

335
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,770
go to Qingcheng Mountain

336
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,370
and bring back the bones immediately.

337
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,060
Since Her Highness has made it so clear,

338
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,220
I need to give my father an explanation.

339
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,820
Because we're father and daughter,

340
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,370
I have caused

341
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,980
you trouble,

342
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,770
and the Jiang family is in turmoil,

343
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,490
I'm sorry.

344
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,980
Don't make it sound so grandiose.

345
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,220
I'm trying to rectify
the Jiang family's bloodline.

346
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,460
Your Highness, thank you

347
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,420
for thinking

348
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,530
of the Jiang family at this point.

349
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,770
If that's the case,

350
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,770
summon the coroner.

351
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,060
No need.

352
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,700
Your Highness, I've never
had much interaction with you.

353
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,370
I'm flattered that you show such concern

354
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,610
for my family.

355
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,460
I'm just not old enough to be confused.

356
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,010
Of course I can recognise
my own daughter.

357
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,820
Don't you want to know

358
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,850
who your own daughter is?

359
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,100
It's an offense
of deceiving His Majesty.

360
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,650
Your Highness,

361
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,370
I know my daughter's offended
a lot of people

362
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,060
trying to overturn
a good official's case.

363
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,130
But my daughter tried her best

364
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,610
to overcome all the difficulties,

365
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,300
so I can't be left behind.

366
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,820
If I can't even recognise my own family,

367
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,610
I'll be ashamed

368
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,940
to face the ancestors
of the Jiang family in the afterlife.

369
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,010
Your Majesty's time should not be spent
on the family affairs of the Jiangs.

370
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,340
Now that the Xue Huaiyuan
corruption case is over,

371
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,220
I'll take my daughter home.

372
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,300
[Prosperous Era]

373
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,130
Grand Chancellor Jiang,

374
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,850
I must examine

375
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,530
the bones today.

376
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,610
Enough!

377
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,730
Your Majesty,

378
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,530
you're the emperor.

379
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,220
How can you allow
these people to deceive you?

380
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,380
How can you uphold your authority?

381
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,090
Wanning,

382
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,050
I've already put up with you a lot.

383
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,010
If you keep this up,

384
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,460
you'll be acting treacherously.

385
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,700
[Prosperous Era]

386
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,490
Today's good mood
of vindicating a good official

387
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,660
has been ruined by you.

388
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,290
You have no regard
for the rules of the palace,

389
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,900
and you behave recklessly
in Imperial Court today.

390
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,900
You're so wrong!

391
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,220
Guards!

392
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,140
Take Eldest Princess back
to her residence!

393
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,900
Let go.

394
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,250
Let go of me.

395
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,290
Let go.

396
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,490
Let go!

397
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,980
I'm Eldest Princess of Great Yan.

398
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,290
How dare you touch me!

399
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,220
Take her away!

400
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,010
Zhao Ye,

401
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,220
how dare you confine me?

402
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,220
This is the end
of today's court session.

403
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,730
Eldest Princess, if you don't comply,

404
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,460
you're disobeying my decree!

405
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,490
Your Highness.

406
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,380
Xue Fangfei!

407
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,770
Don't do that.

408
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,010
Xiao Heng,

409
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,180
how dare you!

410
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,380
From today onward,

411
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,140
Without my order,

412
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,860
Eldest Princess is not allowed
to leave her residence!

413
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,900
Today's court session has ended.

414
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,050
- Let go.
- Dismiss.

415
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,220
Xue Fangfei, just you wait!

416
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,570
Father,

417
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,900
I have a favour to ask.

418
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,330
Go ahead.

419
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,220
The former subordinates
of Magistrate Xue

420
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,570
and the people of Huaixiang
who came to the capital with me

421
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,250
are in Ye Shijie's residence.

422
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,330
Since I brought them here,

423
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,730
I should finish what I started.

424
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,860
I want to treat them well
before I send them away.

425
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,620
I have to go to Ye's Residence now.

426
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,570
After such a mess,

427
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,250
you'll have to clean it up.

428
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,980
Come back when you're done.

429
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,810
I think it's time we have a little talk.

430
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,140
Yes,

431
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,490
Father.

432
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,570
Remember,

433
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,380
you're a daughter from the Jiang family.

434
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,330
Little Leopard Cat?

435
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,250
You're quite interesting.

436
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,180
Everyone in the capital is praising you

437
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,090
for solving the wrongs

438
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,490
and redressing the injustice.

439
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,220
What are you doing here

440
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,140
if you're not out there being praised?

441
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,250
What's the matter?

442
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,250
I want to ask you a favour.

443
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,490
What's it?

444
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,570
There's a grave on Qingcheng Mountain

445
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,530
and I want you

446
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,570
to dig up the bones

447
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,530
and rebury them for me.

448
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,290
Who's buried in there?

449
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,420
Why don't you go yourself?

450
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,620
Duke Su,

451
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,860
are you interrogating me?

452
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,380
You could say that.

453
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,940
Fine.

454
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,530
Consider I didn't say anything.

455
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,180
Wait.

456
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,330
I can dig the grave for you,

457
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,860
but it's a long way
to Qingcheng Mountain.

458
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:18,860
It's boring.

459
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,330
I don't want to go alone.

460
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,770
What do you mean?

461
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,180
Come with me.

462
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,700
Why did you bring me here?

463
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,860
I guess you want
to come here to say goodbye.

464
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,570
I just want to forget about this place.

465
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,380
If you want to forget this place,

466
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,860
then why do you want to move it?

467
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,860
You know why, and you're asking me.

468
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,730
Isn't Xue Fangfei buried here?

469
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,460
Xue Fangfei is an unclean woman

470
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,860
in the eyes of the world.

471
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,810
She already lived a miserable life.

472
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,940
Now that Eldest Princess
is thinking of digging the grave,

473
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,660
I must move her bones.

474
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,090
I don't want anyone to disturb her.

475
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,050
What about you?

476
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,490
I don't want to disturb her, too.

477
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,380
She was clean.

478
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,330
She was a good person.

479
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,570
She thought she was in love
with a good man.

480
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,940
She just wanted
to live a good life with him.

481
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,660
And for that,

482
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,730
she gave everything away,

483
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,730
including herself,

484
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,050
and her family.

485
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,250
But in the end,

486
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,660
she's lying alone in this cold place.

487
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,050
What else?

488
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,770
She was a woman of noble status.

489
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,380
She was a good woman.

490
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,810
She didn't kill her mother
or her brother.

491
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,380
She just wanted to go home.

492
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,380
And for that,

493
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,980
she waited for ten years
at Qingcheng Mountain.

494
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,010
Ten years.

495
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,220
But in the end,

496
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,330
she's lying in this place too.

497
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,700
I failed to protect her.

498
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,900
You've done a great job.

499
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,810
She won't blame you.

500
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,460
You vindicated the Xue family,

501
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,940
forced Jiang Yuanbai
to recognise his daughter

502
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,660
and redressed the injustice
of the people of Huaixiang.

503
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,490
As a pawn,

504
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,530
I'm very impressed with you.

505
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,140
Is there anything else
you want to tell her?

506
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,380
I've said it all.

507
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,250
Then I'll have someone

508
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,770
replace her body.

509
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,090
Duke Su,

510
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,860
thank you

511
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,620
for helping me protect Li.

512
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,620
So, Li,

513
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,010
from today onward,

514
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,420

This?

533
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,700
Second Lady Jiang.

534
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,570
Mr. Shen.

535
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,330
Second Lady Jiang, you look

536
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,330
good today.

537
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,380
It's because I've figured something out.

538
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,460
I'd like to hear about it.

539
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,810
Your late wife

540
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,620
saved my life once from death.

541
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,700
I used to wonder

542
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,700
why a person
who couldn't protect herself

543
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,700
would drag me back from hell.

544
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,810
I used to think
it was because of hatred,

545
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,660
hatred of the world,

546
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,180
hatred of her husband,

547
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,570
and that she was resentful.

548
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,420
Now I understand.

549
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,980
The world is vast,

550
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,860
the country is prosperous,

551
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,330
and the people are numerous.

552
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,490
She saved me

553
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,010

Thank you, Your Highness.

I have a secret letter here.

585
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,250
Please give it to Imperial Diviner.

Mr. Shen,

588
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,980
you've been kneeling all night.

589
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,730
Now it's your turn.

590
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,810
Shen Yurong,

591
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,420
do you take me for a fool?

592
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,180
Your Highness is a noble lady.

593
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,900
If Xue Fangfei's affair
is exposed in Imperial Court today,

594
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,810
I don't care if I die,

595
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,810
but if my mother, younger sister
and Your Highness get dragged into this,

596
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,700
and your reputation is damaged,

597
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,050
I will be sinful.

598
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,290
So

599
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,090
she can only be Jiang Li.

She must die now.

603
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,810
It's easy to kill her.

604
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,490
Your Highness don't have
to get your hands dirty.

605
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,090
Just like today's incident,

606
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,980
I warned Your Highness not to intervene,

607
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,010
but Your Highness didn't believe me

608
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,730
and acted rashly

609
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,180
to your own detriment.

610
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,620
Then what should I do?

611
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,250
Jiang Li has many enemies.

612
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,090
Your Highness can

613
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,860
use someone to kill her.

614
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,490
Can you bring yourself to kill her?

615
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,490
For you,

616
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,900
I can kill anyone.

617
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,900
It's heartbreaking the way you talk.

618
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,090
It's a pity I can't
adore you these days.

619
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,660
My Lord,

620
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,500
His Majesty said we
should investigate to the end.

621
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,850
How can we let Li Zhongnan go?

622
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,020
Leave an escape gap
for the surrounded enemy

623
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,810
and don't push
the desperate enemy too hard.

624
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,130
What does it mean?

625
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,290
Lu Ji,

626
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:08,980
explain it.

627
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,260
Even Wanning,
who's never been punished before,

628
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,220
was punished by His Majesty.

629
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,460
If we pick on Li Zhongnan at this time,

630
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,810
it may cause trouble.

631
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,500
When the sword is sheathed,

632
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,660
it will kill.

633
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,770
After eliminating Li Zhongnan's men,

634
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,180
Wei Qian, Zhang Kun and the others,

635
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,260
Li Zhongnan won't be able
to make a move again for a while.

636
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,260
That's the end of the Huaixiang case.

637
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,660
I guess

638
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,290
Wanning still has cards in her hand.

639
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,370
What should we do next?

640

641
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:53,660
tell me.

642
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,420

645
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,700
so that you won't get punished.

647
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,420

648

You shall receive your punishment.

The Lord is asking what to do.

654
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,020
Watch what's going to happen
means do nothing.

you can tolerate it,

672

but I can't.

673

The time for achieving glory is coming.

674
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,530
When we take over the Zhongyuan,

675
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,340
we'll enjoy whatever opera

676

we want,

677
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,650
and get any woman we want.

I thought she had some ability,

683

but she's such a disappointment.

684

lesser wages and rations every year.

688
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,420
At this rate,

689
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,460
we'll have a hard time.

my brother in the palace
will definitely give us wages and rations.

You're not to blame for what happened
to Her Highness, are you?

Let's not bother him.

He knows what to do.

720
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,300
I used to wonder

721
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,250
why a person who
couldn't protect herself

722
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,610
would drag me back from hell.

723
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,940
I used to think
it was because of hatred,

00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,690
hatred of the world,

in the Jiang family is finally over.

You can finally rest assured, can't you?

730
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,690
Who do you think Li looks like?

731

00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,820
The blood of the Jiang family
runs in Second Lady's veins,

737
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,650
of course she has inherited
her ancestor's character.

738
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,340
We've misjudged her for so many years,

739
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,780
we owe her so much.

740
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,860
Second Lady's so sensible.
She won't mind.

741
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,300
You can't say that.

742
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,940
She's big-hearted,

743
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,730
but she's still young.

744
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,530
She was away all these years

745
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,250
and she didn't miss
the warmth of the family?

746
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,210
When she comes back,
I'm going to give her a treat.

747
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,090
Tell those in the kitchen

748
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,500
to prepare a feast for Second Lady
to welcome her return.

749
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,380
Yes.

750
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,170
Madam Ji,

751
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,690
I've heard that Old Madam

752
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,090
has no intention of blaming Jiang Li

753
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,340
and is preparing a feast
to welcome her return.

754
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,610
Now that Jiang Li is gaining fame,

755
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,050
she's bringing honor
to the Jiang family.

756
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,250
Of course Old Madam
would like to flatter her.

757
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,340
It's hard to wait for something
to happen to Jiang Li

758
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,130
and she was in Court
of Judicial Review's prison.

759
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,250
Why did you help to get her out?

760
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,650
When the nest has tumbled,
all its eggs will be destroyed.

761
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,020
She's smart.

762
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,690
She knows that she's tied

763
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,380
to the Jiang family at the moment.

764
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,170
Even I had to save her.

765
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,650
Then we won't be able
to deal with her anymore.

766
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,130
Jindai, sit down.

767
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,860
I was willing to help her,

768
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,650
and now Master Jiang and Old Madam

769
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,050
are willing to host a feast
for her, too, aren't they?

770
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,860
Does Jiang Li appreciate

771
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,130
the Jiang family's kindness
in her heart?

772
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,300
Let them flatter her all they want.

773
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,570
They won't know the pain
until they're trampled on.

774
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,020
As for us,

775
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,170
we just need to remind

776
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,820
Old Madam at the right time

777
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,340
to let her know who Jiang Li
regards as her family.

778
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,340
That's it.

779
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,940
You're really wise.

780
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,820
I've heard that Magistrate Xue

781
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,860
and the people of Huaixiang
are all settled in the Ye family.

782
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,420
Yes.

783
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,730
I've heard that the Ye family is so rich

784
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,650
that they're planning
a celebration banquet

785
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,170
for Jiang Li
and the people of Huaixiang.

786
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:07,780
Very good.

787
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,050
Try to find out the date.

788
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,780
The feast arranged by Old Madam

789
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:16,300
shall be held on the same day
as their celebration banquet.

790
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,250
Let's see if Jiang Li is willing
to leave the people of Huaixiang behind

791
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,690
or if she wants to leave Master Jiang
and Old Madam out in the cold.

792
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,570
I got it.

793
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,940
[Ye's Residence]

794
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,770
Thank you, sir.

795
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,060
How is Magistrate Xue's condition?

796
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,820
Magistrate Xue's flesh wounds

797
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,090
will heal in time,

798
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,340
but his delusional disorder
is not going to go away.

799
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,980
What is delusional disorder?

800
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,210
This disorder
makes someone feel restless,

801
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,250
feeling that his soul has left his body,

802
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,690
having nightmares,

803
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,730
forgetting family,

804
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,730
forgetting past events

805
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,610
and forgetting oneself.

806
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,420
In my opinion, it's because
Magistrate Xue lost his children

807
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,950
and was tortured

808
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,030
in a wrongful case,

809
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,950
so his heart aches
and his mind gets lost.

810
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,620
It's an illness
that builds up over time.

811
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,660
How can it be cured?

812
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,350
The pain in heart is like
a thousand feet of ice,

813
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,140
it can't be melted in a day.

814
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,790
It's said that the experts
are in the people.

815
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,290
If the imperial physician
can't cure him,

816
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,060
it doesn't mean
that the folk physicians can't either.

817
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,900
No matter how much money
I have to spend,

818
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,060
I'll cure Magistrate Xue.

819
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,020
This is a favour I owe the Xue family.

820
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,210
You shouldn't repay it for me.

821
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:20,250
You've helped me so much along the way.

822
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,900
Jiang Li, remember this.

823
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,940
The Ye family
will be your backing from now on.

824
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,860
Me,

825
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,290
too.

826
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,090
I remember.

827
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,090
How is she now?

828
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,420
Last time, you

829
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,860
told me not to waste manpower
on useless things.

830
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,220
So I don't know what Second Lady Jiang

831
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,420
is doing now.

832
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,540
30 lashes.

833
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,030
She's having a celebration banquet
at Ye's Residence

834
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,820
to thank

835
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,900
the people of Huaixiang who came
with her to present the complaint.

836
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,870
To thank them?

837
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:04,740
At Ye's Residence?

838
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:05,740
Yes.

839
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,470
That's the handsome,

840
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,180
young and talented Ye Shijie
who's from Ye's Residence.

841
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,460
Go get her for me.

842
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,290
That's not good.

843
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,820
I'm afraid Second Lady Jiang

844
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,460
is already dining at the banquet.

845
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,420
If you can't get her here,

846
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,540
go and get your 30 lashes.

847
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,380
I...

848
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,650
I'll just use the bowl. Bowls for men,

849
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,650
- Here.
- cups for women.

850
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,170
Guys, come on. Try this.

851
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,420
A toast to Magistrate Xue's
redress of injustice.

852
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,540
Come on, let's drink.

853
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,260
One, two, three, bottoms up!

854
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,660
Come on, bottoms up!

855
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,990
What are your plans for the future?

856
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,470
I'm going back to Huaixiang for a while.

857
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,350
If a new magistrate comes,

858
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,820
I'll serve under him

859
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,060
and continue to work for Huaixiang.

860
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,700
That's right. We don't want
anything more than

861
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,900
to live peacefully in our hometown

862
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,540
and return to our old jobs.

863
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,420
Second Lady Jiang, like your Uncle Liu,

864
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,470
I just want to live a good life.

865
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,260
I'm going back, too, Li.

866
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,460
Why are you leaving, too?

867
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,950
Your mother's greatest regret in life

868
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,140
was that as a woman,

869
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,790
she couldn't wander the world

870
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,990
like a man.

871
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,470
I'm relieved

872
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,510
that you're doing well.

873
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,170
Shijie will take care of you
in the capital,

874
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,540
so I'll go and explore
and take a nice look at the world

875
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,020
for your mother.

876
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,390
But don't worry.

877
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,660
I'm always your Third Uncle

878
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,430
and Ye's Residence is always your home.

879
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,310
And I'll always be there for you.

880
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,140
Second Lady Jiang, and me.

881
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,310
Second Lady Jiang,
don't forget about me.

882
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:52,950
Lady Jiang, if you ask us,

883
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,580
we'll do whatever you want.

884
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,220
Yes, you have us.

885
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,430
Yes, and me.

886
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,700
I'm deeply grateful

887
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,470
for your kindness.

888
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,060
I'd like to thank you

889
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,910
for risking your lives to overturn
Magistrate Xue's conviction.

890
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,430
People unfated will part ways, but those
fated to meet will eventually meet.

891
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,990
I'd like to propose
a farewell toast to you all.

892
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:22,140
May we meet again in the future.

893
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,140
Sure. May we meet again.

894
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,140
See you again.

895
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,030
See you again.

896
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,390
Come on.

897
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,910
Quick, sit down.

898
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,220
Come on, fill my bowl up. Come on.

899
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,700
- Come on.
- Sit down.

900
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,430
- Come on.
- Here's to you.

901
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:42,740
- Come on.
- Let's drink.

902
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,350
Second Lady Jiang, let's drink.

903
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:46,350
Young Master, dig in.

904
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,510
Someone from the Jiang family
is asking to see Second Lady Jiang.

905
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,350
I'll go out and take a look.

906
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,100
Come on. Let's drink. Come on.

907
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:58,660
- Come on.
- Quick.

908
00:45:58,870 --> 00:45:59,700
- Here's to you.
- Okay.

909
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,950
Second Lady, are you having dinner?

910
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,260
Have you forgotten about the family?

911
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,950
Madam Ji is hosting a feast
for you at home.

912
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,830
She's waiting to welcome your return.

913
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:09,540
When did anyone tell me that?

914
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,140
I told Bai Xue this afternoon.

915
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,140
Didn't Bai Xue inform you?

916
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,260
You know I'm not at home all day today.

917
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,220
Did you ask a girl to look for me

918
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:18,870
all over town to deliver a message?

919
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,830
I had no choice, didn't I?

920
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,060
Who told you to stay out all day?

921
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:25,430
There's a feast at home,

922
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,180
but you didn't tell me earlier
so I could help out.

923
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,030
It's already late

924
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,060
and you're only looking for me now.

925
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,740
Could it be
that Mother doesn't treat me as family

926
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:35,870
or

927
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:38,350
that she knew I was bidding farewell
to the people of Huaixiang

928
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,910
and arranged for it
to have taken place on this day?

929
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,740
Second Lady, Madam Ji will get upset

930
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,790
if you misinterpret her good intentions.

931
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,510
She's been working very hard

932
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,950
to prepare the feast
to welcome your return.

933
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,870
The banquet inside has already begun.

934
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,260
Mother's slow to inform me.

935
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,180
If I leave now,

936
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,950
people will say the Jiangs
don't know manners

937
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,350
and ruin my father's reputation.

938
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,830
If that's the case,

939
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,470
I'll go back and inform Madam Ji

940
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,910
that we'll hold a feast
to welcome your return next time.

941
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,620
Thank you, Madam Sun.
