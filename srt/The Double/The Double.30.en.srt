for the Music Bureau.

Please review this too.

197
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,790
Thank you.

198
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
The alliance with Great Yan is
of great significance.

199
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,270
I'll need both of you
to take on more responsibilities.

200
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,460
Please inform me promptly of any issues.

201
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,460
All right.

202
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,740
Ms. Xiao, do you have something to say?

203
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,700
It's nothing urgent.

204
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,340
It's just that Second Lady Jiang

205
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,910
has been absent from rehearsals
for two days.

206
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,790
She said she's not well

207
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,220
and might need a few more days of rest.

208
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,190
Resting is understandable.

209
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,550
But she's unfamiliar
with the new repertoire.

210
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,340
If we wait for her to recover,

211
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,910
she might hold back
the Music Bureau's performance.

212
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,550
If her health can't handle it,

213
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,790
it's better for her to get proper rest.

214

Thank you, Ye.

218

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,300
Ye,

221
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,700
I remember you mentioned before

222
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,730
that His Majesty wanted to hear me play

223
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,060
"Spring Fading

224
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,130
Yes, that's correct.

225
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,180
But why did Mr. Shen place me
in the Music Bureau?

226
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,300
He said he hoped you would inspire

227
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,980
the Music Bureau to work harder.

228
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,180
But following Mr. Shen's instructions,

229
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,580
Ms. Xiao gave me new sheet music.

230
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,850
Instead of highlighting my strengths,

231
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,420
it exposed my weaknesses.

It's my fault
for being too busy recently

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,370

I'll go and see Mr. Shen shortly.

235
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,730
I really don't want to stay
in the Music Bureau.

at ease, Official Shen.

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,370
There's something

242
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,340
I shouldn't trouble Your Majesty with.

243
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,420
But it concerns Jiang Li,
the daughter of the Secretariat Director.

244
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,220
I dare not make decisions on my own.

245
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,420
Go on.

246
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,850
Your Majesty wants Second Lady Jiang
to represent Great Yan

247
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,940
and showcase her musical skills.

248
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,820
However, this alliance is different
from the Entry Exam.

249
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,340
The performance affects more
than just the individual.

250
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,850
She has not been practicing
for several months since the exam

251
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,610
and has gone through many incidents,

252
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,060
making her qin skills rusty.

253
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,730
I initially thought of arranging for her

254
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,730
to practice and recover
at the Music Bureau.

255
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,650
But then she fell ill unexpectedly.

Forcing her

257
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,820
might not only be detrimental
to the alliance

258
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,730
but also make the Secretariat Director feel
that my arrangements are inadequate.

After hearing about my cousin's illness,
I went to visit her.

263

Ms. Xiao gave Jiang Li a music piece
that the musicians know well.

264

But it's her first time playing it.

265
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,770
Jiang Li pushed herself
to practice day and night

266
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,060
to avoid dragging the Music Bureau,
which led to her falling ill.

267

Despite that,

268
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,130
she continued
to practice even while sick,

269

even if she doesn't practice new pieces

273
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,370

275
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,370

she had during the Entry Exam

277
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,180

278
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,100

While her condition may not be
as good as during the exams,

281

to the exam pieces,

00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,290
this is also an opportunity

366
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,730
to appear in front of His Majesty.

367
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,090
Why would I want to decline it?

368
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,290
You must go.

369
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,940
Otherwise, your parents will find out

370
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,810
about the lady you...

371
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:47,860
So are you going or not?

372
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,700
Are you threatening me?

373
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,570
Not just a threat.

374
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,730
There's also a temptation.

375
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,570
I heard you've been searching
for this Yunjin handkerchief.

376
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,420
Today, I brought you a top-notch one.

377
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,620
Take a look.

378
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,090
Will it catch the eye
of your sweetheart?

379
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,090
Let me take a look.

380
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,050
This Yunjin handkerchief is from Luyang.

381
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,010
It's hard to find in the capital.

382
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,020
How did you get it?

383
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,570
My maternal grandmother's family
is from Luyang.

384
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,010
Then

385
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,250
I'll reluctantly cooperate

386
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,050
with you for now.

387
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,140
Please replace me with someone else
for Second Lady Jiang.

388
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,090
We've discussed
a marriage proposal before.

389
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,570
If we perform together,

390
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,050
it will inevitably draw criticism.

391
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,220
If you have a clear conscience,

392
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,180
why bother about idle talk?

393
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,050
Even if I have a clear conscience,

394
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,900
rumors can still be dangerous.

395
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,420
It's a tribute to Great Zhao.

396
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,770
I hope you can set
aside personal emotions

397
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,010
and prioritize the bigger picture.

398
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,290
Mr. Shen, please.

399
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,090
Mr. Shen...

400
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,530
We don't have much time left.

401
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,730
Let's go inside and rehearse.

405
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,730
they're not even rehearsing.

406
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,090
What are they doing inside?

407
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,810
I'll try to decline as you suggested.

408
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,740
But it's not working.

409
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,420
Put another act for me.

410
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,260
What? Again?

411
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,500
Does your sweetheart like
that handkerchief?

412
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,500
I have even better ones.

413
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,290
I'll bring them tomorrow.
You can let her choose.

414
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,660
Just this once, no more next time.

415
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,290
All right.

416
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,180

Jiang Li,

420
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,850
are you doing this on purpose?

421
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,900
From the beginning,

422
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,180
is this all your scheme?

423
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,290
Scheme?

424
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,940
What scheme could I have?

425
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,610
It was Mr. Shen who asked me to come.

426
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,130
How would I know he wanted me
to work with you?

427
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,530
You don't know?

428
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,290
Stop pretending already.

429
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,260
I made it clear to you earlier.

430
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,220
We're not suitable.

431
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,090
Now that you're getting close like this,

432
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,940
anyone who doesn't know would think
we're getting back together.

433
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,900
How can I get married
in the future, huh?

434
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,980
Do you think
you're the only one who minds?

435
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,900
There's nothing we can do now.

436
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,460
I don't have anything
to say to you anymore.

437
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,730
Me neither.

438
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,220
Mr. Shen, I apologize for that.

439
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,370
Go home first.

441
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,050
I said, go.

Second Lady Jiang,

443
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,460
what happened here?

444
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,740
Weren't you two rehearsing
just fine earlier?

445
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,660
Did you do this on purpose, Mr. Shen?

446
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,180
On purpose?

447
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,250
I overheard the conversation
between you and Zhao Qi

448
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,290
this afternoon.

449
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,330
It seemed like
you deliberately brought someone

450
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,860
who had a previous engagement with me

451
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,700
to stir up trouble and make me pull out.

452
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,290
Second Lady Jiang, you're mistaken.

453
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,660
Zhao Qi is a highly educated person
among the scholars.

454
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,500
If I didn't do this,

455
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,900
how could I match up
to your deliberate suggestion

456
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,130
to have Official Ye propose ideas
in front of the emperor?

457
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,260
Mr. Shen, you should choose
your words carefully.

458
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,220
You were the one who tried to get rid
of me in front of the emperor first.

459
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,940
You were the one who was absent
because of illness first.

460
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,090
I don't know
how did I ever offend you, Mr. Shen.

461
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,700
You've been suspicious

462
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,420
and targeting me all along.

463
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,180
Helping with the alliance

464
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,700
is for the benefit of Great Yan

465
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,500
and adds glory to the Jiang family.

466
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,900
So, I won't give up.

467
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,370
If you continue
to make things difficult for me,

468
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,900
it will reflect poorly on Great Yan.

469
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,850
Tomorrow,

470
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,050

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,420

Congratulations, Mr. Du.

00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,140
If the emperor is pleased,

480
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,420
it will be beneficial for your career.

481
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,420
It looks good on the surface,

482
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,380
but

483
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,250
why did you decline Mr. Shen?

484
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,980
I'm telling you this
because you're my friend.

485
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,330
What seems good on the surface

486
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,460
often hides underlying tensions.

487
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:40,810
How so?

488
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,290
Let me put it this way.

489
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,810
Jiang Li is really evil.

490
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,140
She eats people.

491
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,620
What? She eats people?

492
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,290
It was just a metaphor.

493
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,090
I just want to let you know

494
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,570
that sometimes things appear
to be a blessing,

495
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,290
but it's actually a bottomless abyss
beneath their feet.

496
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,860
What should I do then?

497
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,620
Jiang Li is coming to rehearse
with me tonight.

498
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,530
Mr. Zhao,

499
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,980
could you advise me?

500
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,530
Mr. Shen is kind and understanding.

501
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,660
He changed his decision for me.

502
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,380
If you have any difficulties,

503
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,940
and with many scholars in Hanlin,

504
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,490
there is bound to be someone
who has no difficulties, right?

505
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,770
I understand it now.

Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

507
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,290
Go

508
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,770
and ask Jiang Li
for the pearl necklace she promised.

509
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,380

521

my trousers.

Mr. Shen,

530

I'll go back first to freshen up
and change my clothes.

531
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,250
Then I'll see the physician.

532
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,490
I might not be able

533
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,530

541

- he is...
- It doesn't matter.

548
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,900
I know no one wants to perform with me.

549
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,860
I'm all soaked but end up with nothing.

550
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,490
Mr. Shen, I must look foolish.

551
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:41,810
Jiang Li,

552
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,460
everything I said earlier was true.

553
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,490
I had no intention
of playing tricks on you.

554
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,250
He really isn't feeling well today.

555
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,860
I'm not blaming you.

556
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,860
I'm blaming myself.

557
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,770
For so many years,

558
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,530
I've carried the stigma
of matricide and fratricide.

559
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,570
I was questioned by Eldest Princess
about my identity,

560
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,980
with my mother gone mad,
and my father's absence,

561
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,730
it's no wonder you avoided me
before this.

562
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,730
At this assembly,

563
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,620
I just wanted
to make a name for myself.

564
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,090
I didn't expect

565
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,050
that all of you

566
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,490
already see me as a jinx.

567
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,050
Take shelter here first.

568
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,010
Leave when the rain stops.

569
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,180
Put this on for now.
You can leave when the rain lets up.

570
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,660
This is "Shuo Yuan" by Liu Xiang
from the Han dynasty.

571
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:42,980
Exactly.

572
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,620
My dear, you should include "Shuo Yuan".

573
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,250
My father used to say

574
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,700
he was very interested in "Shuo Yuan".

575
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,250
But most of it has been lost now.

576
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,420
He said if someone could collect
and recompile it,

577
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,220
it would be a great merit.

579
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,290
I remember it has twenty volumes.

580
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,530
But most of it is lost.

581
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,250
I didn't expect you to collect so much.

582
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,940
It took quite an effort

583
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,980
to gather these fragments.

584
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,940
I plan to compile them into a book.

585
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,730
This way, this classic

586
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,730
can be passed down through generations

587
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,220
and benefit future generations.

588
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,570
Mr. Shen, you're really amazing.

589
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,700
Second Lady Jiang, you're too kind.

590
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,810
But you, on the other hand,

591
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,460
can recognize "Shuo Yuan"

592
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,420
with just these fragments.

593
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,860
That's quite surprising.

594
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,620
Mr. Shen, you're different
from what I imagined.

595
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,900
How so?

596
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,250
I thought

597
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,700
those favored by the emperor
would be skilled in social interactions.

598
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,220
I didn't expect you
to rely on your knowledge.

599
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,770
You truly have remarkable qualities.

600
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,700
I'm just following the principles
from the text.

601
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:56,010
A loyal minister should follow
the six righteous paths.

602
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,250
Being humble and diligent,
progressing daily in virtue,

603
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,490
promoting the worthy tirelessly,
and upholding the law.

604
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,810
The text says there are six righteous
and six unrighteous paths.

605
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,980
Following the righteous brings honor,
while the other brings disgrace.

606
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,050
A virtuous minister follows
the righteous paths and avoids the other,

607
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,290
thus ensuring stability
and people are well-governed.

608
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,730
Mr. Shen,

609
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,530
if a person acts righteously
but also commits wrongs,

610
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,860
is this person still righteous?

611
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,860
All things follow the laws
of heaven and earth.

612
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,530
If one goes against their conscience,

613
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,860
no matter how many good deeds they do,

614
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,330
they will face divine retribution.

615
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,380
I believe

616
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,860
you're a person who acts uprightly.

617
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,090
Second Lady Jiang, the rain has stopped.

618
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,010
I'll take my leave.

619
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,420
Thank you

620
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,980
for not minding talking with me.

621
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,530
I'll take my leave now.

622
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,810
I'll wash and return your clothes.

626
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,860
did you have to face
to end up like this?

627
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,620

628
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,860
why are you here?

Your clothes

630
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,620
look terrible.

631
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,460
Come with me.

00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,790
Why don't you have women's clothes
at your place?

635
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,540
You've asked about my background.

636
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,100
Don't you know why?

637
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,740
They say you don't like women.

638
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,580
But why?

639
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,620
Women are wonderful.

640
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,060
They're caring

641
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,580
and considerate.

642
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,310
What about you?

643
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,580
You're not getting any younger.

644
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,220
You're the one who's getting older.

645
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,310

You're the one
who truly fits that description.

Thank you for the compliment.

651
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,870
But there's something I need
to remind you of.

652
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,870
Getting close to Shen Yurong
is a risky move.

653
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,140
I have to do it.

654
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,910
I want to face him

655
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,390
just like he faced Xue Fangfei
in her grave.

656
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,980
I need to find his weakness

657
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,980
to clear Xue Fangfei's name.

658
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,170
What weakness?

659
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,210
I haven't found it yet.

660
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,140
Over time,

661
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,470
he will eventually slip.

662
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,540
Have you considered the consequences?

663
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,830
Xiao Heng,

664
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,950
you can be more frank.

665
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,140
The retaliation from Eldest Princess
could cost me my life.

666
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,030
And my all-or-nothing gamble

667
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,830
might also be a path
to my own destruction.

668
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,510
Admitting it

669
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,060
means you're afraid.

670
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,060
Having fear is a good thing.

671
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,790

don't get yourself caught up in them.

No.

702
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,500
I will avenge you.

703
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,250
You may take revenge
on this corrupt official.

704
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:20,020
But there will be others to oppress us.

705
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,460
Unless you become an official,

706
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,210
or else not only will you fail
to take revenge,

707
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:35,130
but you'll also bring trouble
to our family.

708
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,570
Don't worry.

709
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,130
I will study hard

710
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,860
and become a top scholar.

711
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,610
Then I'll be a good official

712
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,340
and eradicate all corrupt ones
who oppress the people.

713
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,910

your promise to your father
on his deathbed

715
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,140

to get to where you are now?

Does my opinion matter?

725
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,660
The point is the princess believes
she's Xue Fangfei.

726
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,740
Think about your grand ambitions.

727
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,540
Think about how our family's good life

Mother, you don't need to remind me.

732
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,570
I know the path

733
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,420
I need to take better than anyone.

734
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,570
My Lord,

735
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,940
you won't believe it.

736
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,020
But being poisoned

737
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,690
felt quite fascinating.

738
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,820
I saw beautiful women around me.

739
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,090
I just hugged them all.

740
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:55,900
Then I...

741
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,820
Then let Jiuyue catch another snake
to bite you again.

742
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,650
No, no.

743
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,380
I was just joking.

744
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,020
Is she drunk?

745
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,340
How much did she drink?

746
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,540
It's wine mixed with scorpion venom.

747
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,220
Too strong.

748
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,020
Perfect.

749
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,740
Keep her confined at the residence

750
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,580
until the Great Zhao delegation arrives.

751
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,650
Wen Ji,

752
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,090
take her to her room.

753
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,060
Lu Ji,

754
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,380
come with me to the wine shop.

755
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,250
Yes, My Lord.

756
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,940
Isn't Lu Ji holding on to her?

757
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,500
Let Lu Ji take her inside.

758
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,060
Now that you're no longer poisoned,

759
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,570
you can continue watching over her.

760
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,020
I...

761
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,900
You...

762
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,690
No, stop.

763
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,980
Let me out!

764
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,020
Someone!

765
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,300
Someone!

766
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,380
Am I not someone?

767
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,690
Wait there.

768
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,500
Before the Great Zhao delegation arrives,

769
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,460
you're not going anywhere.

770
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,300
You wouldn't dare.

771
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,530
I have never been locked up
since I was a child.

772
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,980
You better let me go now.

773
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,730
Or else...

774
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,690
Or else...

775
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,530
Or else what?

776
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:37,900
Wen Ji,

777
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,340
what are you trying to do?

778
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,610
I've already prepared myself.

779
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,250
Don't think you can poison me again.

780
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,420
Anyway,

781
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,860
you're not stepping out
of the Duke's Residence today.

782
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,900
Wen Ji, how dare you!

783
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,380
Just stay put.

784
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,300
Don't even think about leaving.

785
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,300
I need to go to the Ye's Residence.

786
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,130
Didn't Xiao Heng ask me

787
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,610
to treat Magistrate Xue?

788
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,210
I need to treat him. I have to go now.

789
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,250
Do you think I'll fall for that?

790
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,900
You better get it straight.

791
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,900
Xiao Heng even went spider hunting

792
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,650
with me to convince me

793
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,380
to treat Magistrate Xue.

794
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,340
And you should know

795
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,980
what Jiang Li means to him, right?

796
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,500
If Magistrate Xue isn't treated in time,

797
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,610
it'll be all your fault.

798
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,820
And

799
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,980
it won't be
a few military punishments anymore.

800
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,460
[Jinsi Hall]

801
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,250
Who are you?

802
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,340
I'm here to treat Magistrate Xue.

803
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:54,980
You can't come in.

804
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,500
You're trespassing.

805
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,020
I can report you to the authorities.

806
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,250
Official Ye,

807
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,820
we're here on Duke Su's orders

808
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,020
to treat Magistrate Xue.

809
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,730
Second Lady Jiang knows about this.

810
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,300
You work for Duke Su.

811
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,650
You know him, right?

812
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,300
Can I go in now?

813
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,130
No, you cannot.

814
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,210
Jiang Li didn't tell me about this.

815
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,780
Let me inform her first.

816
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,300
No need for you two to worry.

817
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,420
I get it.

818
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,210
He doesn't like Xiao Heng, right?

819
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,340
Watch your words.

820
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,570
Can you be more subtle?

821
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,900
His Lordship

822
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,530
just doesn't want to deal with him.

823
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,300
Excuse me,

824
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:28,900
please watch your words.

825
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,050
Stop beating around the bush.

826
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Are you letting me in or not?

827
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,020
No.

828
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,300
You're not, huh?

829
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,420
Ye Shijie, don't provoke her.

830
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:37,690
She will...

831
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:46,980
Keep an eye on him.

832
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
I'm going in to do the treatment.

833
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,050
Stop right there!

834
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,170
It's wise

835
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,090
to listen.

836
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,130
You...

837
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,300
You...

838
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,210
Don't touch him!

839
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,050
You're welcome.

840
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,210
His illness

841
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,420
isn't easy to treat.

842
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,570
Wait.

843
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,420
Where did this quack come from?

844
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,940
Who gives you the permission
to touch Magistrate Xue?

845
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,530
Where am I?

846
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,860
I'm the only one
who can treat his illness.

847
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,860
But it can't be cured in one day.

848
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:42,130
If the poison...

849
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,300
I mean if medicine is too strong,

850
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:47,900
it could be fatal.

851
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,170
So I will come once a day.

852
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:51,820
If you have questions,

853
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,650
you can just ask Jiang Li.

854
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:55,210
Wen Ji,

855
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,380
take him outside.

856
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,820
The poison for the next treatment
is highly toxic.

857
00:43:59,250 --> 00:43:59,940
So you better stay away.

858
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:00,780
I'm not leaving.

859
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,690
Do you think
you don't look pathetic enough?

860
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,460
Give me the antidote!

861
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,210
I can walk myself out!

862
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,460
Can you give me the antidote first?

863
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,420
What's the rush?

864
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,500
She'll give it to you
after the treatment.

865
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:42,900
Wen Ji!

866
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:45,980
Give me the antidote!

867
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,250
Find Xiao Heng.

868
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:24,900
Why didn't you catch it?

869
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,170
Don't just stand there!

870
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:41,940
Find His Lordship!

871
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,130
The antidote.

872
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:47,980
Open your mouth!

873
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,130
His Lordship is at the wine shop.

874
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,500
Just surrender now.

875
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,650
You're no match for me.

876
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,980
Do you think you can last
until Xiao Heng gets here?

877
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:34,940
Him?

878
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,900
He's no match for me...

879
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,940
We can only take a chance.

880
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,650
What are you planning to do?

881
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:59,210
This thing seems to be effective.

882
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,780
But why do I feel

883
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,380
