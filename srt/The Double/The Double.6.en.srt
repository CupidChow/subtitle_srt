[Episode 6]

17
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,070
Yao.

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,230
Oh, my dear Yao.

19
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,590
My dear,

20
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,040
what's wrong with Yao?

21
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,920
Take a look at these rashes.

22
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,280
She has rashes all over.

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,510
Did any of you have sandalwood
with you just now?

24
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,760
You see, Third Lady

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,760
can't get into contact with sandalwood.

26
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,870
Everyone in the Jiang's Residence
knows this.

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,560
Naturally,
they wouldn't have it on them.

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,470
Could it be someone

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,470
among the guests might have carried it?

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,590
Speak up if you have something to say.

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,960
Third Young Lady

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,310
started to develop rashes
after wearing the earrings given

33
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,240
by Second Young Lady.

34
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,430
Could it be that there's something
in the earrings...

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,520
Take off the earrings and check them.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,310
Yes.

37
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,240
Second Young Lady,

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,310
why did you do this?

39
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,520
I know you're not content

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,080
and not fond of Third Lady.

41
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,360
But such an act is simply too much.

42
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,470
I don't dislike Ruoyao at all,

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,080
nor did I add any fragrance.

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,310
All the evidence points to you.

45
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,750
What else is there to deny?

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,960
Li,

47
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,310
explain yourself.

48
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,750
Father,

49
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,870
can you give me

50
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,750
some time alone with Ruoyao?

51
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,590
What are you up to?

52
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,560
I experienced similar symptoms

53
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,630
when I was at Zhennv Hall.

54
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,590
I know a way

55
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,150
to make Ruoyao feel better.

56
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,310
What kind of method

57
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,870
that your father and I
shouldn't know about?

58
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,030
Mother,

59
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,960
please trust me.

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,120
With you and Father here,

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,120
what are you afraid of?

62
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,080
They're all gone.

63
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,150
Just say what you want.

64
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,360
Why did you do this to me?

65
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,560
Ruoyao,

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,240
I didn't mean
to steal your limelight today.

67
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,830
As your older sister,

68
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,270
I only want to extend my congratulations

69
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,430
like any other sister would do.

70
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,480
But

71
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,600
someone deliberately stops me
from attending your ceremony.

72
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,870
Stop feigning your innocence.

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,000
Tell me.

74
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,600
Why did you use sandalwood to harm me?

75
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,870
You clearly knew
you're allergic to sandalwood.

76
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,240
Yet, you endured this pain out of a ploy

77
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,720
to vent your anger
because of the ceremony.

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,360
It must have been really hard on you.

79
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,430
Then we have nothing to discuss further.

80
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,870
Let Father come in

81
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,310
so he can see your vicious true colors.

82
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,560
I asked them to leave

83
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,160
to preserve your dignity.

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,750
Do you think the ploy

85
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,000
of harming yourself

86
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,480
would make them punish me?

87
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,190
What do you mean?

88
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,310
If you're certain that I'm behind this,

89
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,160
how about I make a deduction

90
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,310
of what will happen next?

91
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,040
First of all,

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,040
I'll ask my maid,

93
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,800
Xiangqiao, to testify for me.

94
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,390
After I bought these earrings,

95
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
the earrings have been
in her safekeeping.

96
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,560
I've never touched them since.

97
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,040
I know

98
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,390
Xiangqiao works for you and your mother.

99
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,680
So she'll go to great lengths
to frame me.

100
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,950
It was Second Lady
who put the fragrance in there.

101
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
I saw it myself.

102
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,950
Nonsense!
You're making slanderous accusations.

103
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,830
Xiangqiao,

104
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,510
you must have lost your conscience

105
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,430
to make up such a baseless accusation.

106
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,510
No, I'm not!

107
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,190
If I'm lying,

108
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,800
heaven shall strike me with lightning!

109
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,040
Then

110
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,360
Mother will take the opportunity
to aggravate the situation.

111
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,480
Li,

112
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,000
you could've come to me directly
if you're not happy.

113
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,480
Ruoyao is your younger sister.

114
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,120
How could you not consider
your family ties?

115
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,240
Isn't this the truth?

116
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,190
Of course not.

117
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,310
Because the earrings containing
the fragrance

118
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,120
are imitations.

119
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,000
What?

120
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,950
A few days ago,
I spent 20 liang of silver

121
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,070
on these earrings at the Jixiang Store.

122
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,430
Earrings of this quality and price

123
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,720
are rarely seen in the entire store.

124
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,510
Moreover, the craftsmanship
of these earrings is rough.

125
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,070
Forget about 20 liang.

126
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
They're not even worth one liang.

127
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,950
Our grandmother is knowledgeable
about these things.

128
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,160
She would notice at a glance.

129
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,920
Products from Jixiang Store

130
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,510
cannot possibly be of this quality.

131
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,830
So here comes the question.

132
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,720
Who swapped the earrings

133
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,870
that I originally intended to give you?

134
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,190
You don't have to frame Xiangqiao.

135
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
She's not that bold.

136
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,160
Well, a person's boldness
can be nurtured,

137
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,750
During this time,

138
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,560
I've always given Xiangqiao good things.

139
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,680
Good things

140
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,360
naturally breed courage.

141
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,120
She thought I would be kicked out
sooner or later.

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,360
This expensive pair of earrings

143
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,950
will eventually end up
in Mother's hands.

144
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,120
It's better to keep them herself.

145
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,920
Do you really think
people are that foolish?

146
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,600
Who would believe your story?

147
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,720
Well,

148
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,190
I have witness.

149
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,800
I wasn't sure

150
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,040
if Xiangqiao would switch them out.

151
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,360
So I had Tong follow her.

152
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,950
She indeed went to see

153
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,240
that craftsman who specializes
in counterfeits.

154
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,950
Everything will fall into place
after Father's probing.

155
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,920
So what?

156
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,800
How can we prove

157
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,000
that a greedy maid

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,360
was the one who put the fragrance?

159
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,680
Of course with physical evidence.

160
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,800
The fragrance is in Xiangqiao's room.

161
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,950
If you don't believe it,

162
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,750
I'll ask Father to investigate.

163
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,800
How is that possible?

164
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,480
It's not that Xiangqiao is incompetent.

165
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,270
It's just that many people
in this world are not content

166
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,560
with what they have but envy others
who have more.

167
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,560
Yunshuang has long been jealous of her.

168
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:36,870
This is from Madam Ji.

169
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,000
All right.

170
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,920
This is my last warning.

171
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,360
Don't ruin Madam's plan.

172
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,310
If you still remember
that I brought you to work here,

173
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,000
don't stir any trouble.

174
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,070
So what if you were the one
who brought me into this household?

175
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,190
Why must you always mention it?

176
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,720
Everyone relies on their own abilities.

177
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,190
You can't blame others
if you're not doing well.

178
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,630
If this scheme to frame me succeeds,

179
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,240
it will be Xiangqiao's credit.

180
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,120
If it fails,

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,040
do you think Yunshuang
won't use this opportunity

182
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:22,920
to get rid of Xiangqiao?

183
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,160
So you've been instigating the two maids

184
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,240
from the beginning.

185
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,920
I'm just protecting myself.

186
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,310
If I'm not careful,

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,510
won't it be adding

188
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,360
"deceiving mother, harming sister"
to the crimes

189
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,720
of matricide and fratricide
against myself?

190
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
It's been so long.

191
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,270
What is Li doing?

192
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,030
Let them talk a bit longer.

193
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,320
Both of them are grown now.

194
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,030
What can happen?

195
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,320
Since you've figured
everything out so clearly,

196
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,030
why did you tell me alone?

197
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,750
Why didn't you say it

198
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,550
in front of everyone earlier?

199
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,200
I don't want to be your enemy.

200
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,390
But don't think about driving me away.

201
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,240
I returned to reclaim what's mine.

202
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,360
If you keep getting in my way,

203
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,510
I won't let it go.

204
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,080
That's all I have to say.

205
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,550
As for whether you want to pin the blame

206
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,550
on me,

207
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
that's up to you.

208
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,080
Li grew up in Zhennv Hall.

209
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,790
We don't know her temperament well.

210
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,750
Her intentions may be good.

211
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,960
But she might not handle it properly.

212
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,750
I can't help but worry

213
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,870
even when we're out here.

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,720
Father,

215
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,270
Ruoyao is much better now.

216
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,720
Yao,

217
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,670
how are you feeling now?

218
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,200
Much better.

219
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,720
Thanks to Li.

220
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,510
We misunderstood Li
regarding the earrings.

221
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,440
Yao,

222
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,150
tell me.

223
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,480
What's the misunderstanding?

224
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,550
I'm feeling a bit tired now.

225
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,550
I want to sleep for a while.

226
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,360
If it was a misunderstanding,

227
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,840
then it's good that it's resolved.

228
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,750
My dear,

229
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,550
don't worry too much.

230
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,030
Yao,

231
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,200
get some rest.

232
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,670
Everyone can go back now.

233
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,360
Mother,

234
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,910
give me the antidote.

235
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,270
What did she say to you?

236
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,670
Mother,

237
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,200
your idea of making me
break out in a rash

238
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,080
wasn't good at all.

239
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,270
The maids you sent over

240
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,120
are more of a trouble than a help.

241
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,600
The matter was resolved just like that?

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,630
Yes.

243
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,670
I heard it was all a misunderstanding.

244
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,080
Bring Li here.

245
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,200
Yes.

246
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,630
Greetings, Grandmother.

247
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,390
I made pear soup

248
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,030
and thought of you.

249
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,080
Thank you, Grandmother.

250
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:23,960
Come.

251
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,600
Sit here and enjoy it.

252
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,870
I heard Ruoyao was sick today.

253
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Her mother summoned you for questioning.

254
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,000
What happened?

255
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,150
It was nothing serious.

256
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,750
Ruoyao wasn't feeling well, that's all.

257
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,440
Some people are spreading rumors
that you harbored ill intentions.

258
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,840
The gift you sent turned out
to be poisonous.

259
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,960
I'm not blind, you know.

260
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,080
You can tell me the truth.

261
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,630
It was my maids

262
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,720
who made a mistake.

263
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,080
She mixed up the gift
I wanted to give Ruoyao.

264
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,360
Mother will punish them.

265
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,670
You're truly sensible girls.

266
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
It's heartbreaking
to see you suffer such grievance.

267
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,630
After drinking the pear soup today,

268
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,870
I no longer feel wronged.

269
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,270
I know those two maids in your court

270
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,360
were chosen by your mother.

271
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,150
Madam Zhang,

272
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,150
please accompany Li to Fangfei Garden.

273
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,030
Yes.

274
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,750
Grandmother...

275
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,240
I made up my mind.

276
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,360
So just follow my decision.

277
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,270
That woman is not home.

278
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,480
This place is ours now.

279
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,600
We can do

280
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,000
whatever we want.

281
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,600
Hello, Zhang and Wang.

282
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,600
Oh, Li and Zhao.

283
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,670
Why are you here?

284
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,150
We're here to catch you.

285
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,600
Get them!

286
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,120
What are you doing?

287
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,550
Why are you taking us away?

288
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,550
Don't touch me.

289
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,270
You're hurting me.

290
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,910
Let go! Let go!

291
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,870
- Oh, stop it!
- Let go.

292
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,790
Drag these two troublemakers out

293
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,270
and punish them with the family rules.

294
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,030
Madam Zhang,

295
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,840
could there be a mistake?

296
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,320
Madam Zhang,

297
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,320
we're innocent.

298
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,840
That's right.

299
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,840
Take them away.

300
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,080
Madam Zhang.

301
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:32,960
Madam Zhang!

302
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
- Zhang. Wang.
- Li. Zhao.

303
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,790
- We're innocent.
- We're innocent.

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,030
Xiangqiao, this is all your fault.

305
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,030
How is it my fault?

306
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,670
- Go!
- I'm not going.

307
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,870
- No, I'm not leaving!
- I don't want to go!

308
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,720
No, I don't want to go!

309
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,080
I'm innocent!

310
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,150
Second Lady, we're innocent!

311
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,480
I don't want to leave.

312
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,550
Second Lady, we're innocent!

313
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,840
We're innocent!

314
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,750
Second Lady, you must be in shock.

315
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,000
Old Madam has instructed

316
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,030
to send you new maids tomorrow.

317
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,510
You can keep the ones that suit you.

318
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
I'm grateful to Grandmother

319
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
and thank you too, Madam Zhang,
for coming.

320
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Would you like to come in for some tea?

321
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,120
I still need to report back.

322
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,790
Second Lady, please rest well.

323
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,840
All right.

324
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,030
Jiang Li!

325
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,600
You won this fight beautifully.

326
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,270
Grandmother never gets involved

327
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,200
in household affairs.

328
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,870
This time, she stepped in

329
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,080
and took care of everything
just for you.

330
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
What did you do?

331
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,120
It's because Grandmother
has a kind heart.

332
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,870
Grandmother is very perceptive,
you know?

333
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,550
Even if she saw through
Eldest Aunt's schemes,

334
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,030
she wouldn't say anything.

335
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,910
This time, Madam Zhang came over

336
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,600
and took care of everything for you.

337
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,870
You can rest easy now

338
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,960
and won't be harmed

339
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,630
by those clumsy tricks anymore.

340
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,630
I must thank you,

341
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,270
my good cousin.

342
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,080
It's Jingrui,

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,550
or just Rui is fine.

344
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,200
After all, it's hard to refuse a favor.

345
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,320
And I really like

346
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
the little turtle you gave me.

347
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:10,910
By the way,

348
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,080
I heard your chrysanthemum tea
is especially good.

349
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,080
Let me try some.

350
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,840
Come on.

351
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,480
Old Madam,

352
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,910
we've dealt with those two maids.

353
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,240
Tomorrow, help pick someone reliable

354
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,030
to send over.

355
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,440
Yes.

356
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,630
She's been managing the household
for so many years.

357
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,960
Why can't she let it go?

358
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,630
Li came back with nothing

359
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,960
and suffered so much in the mountains.

360
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,030
What harm is there
in being generous with her?

361
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,750
Yuanbai has his heart set on her.

362
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,360
We're all women.

363
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,360
And I can't say

364
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,480
that Yuanbai is wrong.

365
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,270
The Madam is a smart person.

366
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm sure she'll behave in the future.

367
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,550
Let's hope your words come true.

368
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,510
Why did Old Madam suddenly ask
about this?

369
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,960
I'm not too sure either.

370
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,910
I heard

371
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,000
Old Madam summon Second Lady over

372
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,840
and sell her maids from her courtyard.

373
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,870
It's said to send new maids for her.

374
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,480
She's trying to keep me in check.

375
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,750
But the Old Madam

376
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,960
didn't pursue this matter.

377
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,120
This means

378
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,270
she doesn't to have a fallout with you.

379
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,390
It was clearly Ruoyao's
coming-of-age ceremony.

380
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,080
Yet, that girl stole the limelight.

381
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,200
I even had to adorn her hair

382
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,240
in front of everyone.

383
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,840
Since it's come to this,

384
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,120
I must fulfill my duties

385
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,120
as a mother now.

386
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,670
What do you have in mind, Madam?

387
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,630
Now that she has entered adulthood,

388
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,510
I must plan

389
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,030
her marriage properly

390
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,670
to avoid

391
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,870
being accused of ill-treatment.

392
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,920
My Lady, my name is Bai Xue.

393
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,680
This is her birth record.

394
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,750
Young Lady, please review it.

395
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,110
If you're satisfied with her,

396
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,240
you can keep her around.

397
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,750
Thank you, Madam Zhang.

398
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,540
[Bai Xue, born on the 18th day of the fifth month in the 42nd year of Zhangping, from Zaohua Village in Huaixiang, has sold herself to the Jiang's Residence due to poor harvest]

399
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,720
My Lady,

400
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,200
I'm healthy and strong.

401
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,680
I can clean the courtyard.

402
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,200
Your birth records stated

403
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,310
that you're from Zaohua Village.

404
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,350
I know a girl

405
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,350
who's also from Zaohua Village.

406
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,110
What's her name?

407
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,310
I may know her.

408
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,550
Haitang.

409
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,680
She's over 20 years old.

410
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,350
She has two younger brothers.

411
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,550
I've never heard of her before.

412
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,160
But my parents have been living
in Zaohua Village for a long time.

413
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,350
I can write home

414
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,830
and them to ask around.

415
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,720
Thank you.

416
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,070
Li,

417
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,110
why are you searching
for a girl named Haitang?

418
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,310
Haitang was my maid.

419
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,350
After that incident,

420
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,640
I never saw her again.

421
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,750
Her disappearance is fishy.

422
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,000
Perhaps she knows something.

423
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,720
I'm not sure

424
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,030
if she was also harmed.

425
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,310
If I can find her,

426
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,200
it might reveal the truth
of what happened.

427
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,680
My dear.

428
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,200
My dear,

429
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,640
you're back.

430
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,440
Are you all right?

431
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,830
Does it hurt?

432
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,480
I'm fine.

433
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,200
Next time, let the servants handle

434
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,920
the needlework.

435
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,640
I've always sewn

436
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,590
all of your clothing myself
over the years.

437
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,270
Everything in this house

438
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,440
is handled with these hands.

439
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,960
My dear, it must be hard on you.

440
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,880
It's something I learned after marriage.

441
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,270
My parents never taught me these things.

442
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,200
They only let me focus
on practicing music.

443
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,640
That's right.

444
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,640
When we first met,

445
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,510
you played a song

446
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,590
at your father's banquet,

447
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,920
a memory I cherish.

448
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,440
But now, these hands

449
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,270
have worn out from the house's affairs.

450
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,240
My little hardships

451
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,830
are nothing compared to yours.

452
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,440
You must be tired.

453
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,590
Here, have some tea.

454
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,480
All right.

455
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,880
I've been unable
to manage Li's affairs properly.

456
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,790
I feel ashamed of my role as a mother.

457
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,830
It's not entirely your fault.

458
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,000
Although Li has been
in the mountains for years,

459
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,640
she's gentle and sensible.

460
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,110
I want to find a good husband for her.

461
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,030
I heard the Ministry of Personnel's
Secretary's son

462
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,000
is still not married.

463
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,350
He has a good appearance and character.

464
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,530
His family background
is not as prestigious.

465
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,770
Mr. Zhao's rank is below yours.

466
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,330
But he is loyal and steady,

467
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,130
which is rare in official circles.

468
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,740
Zhao Qi is also dignified
and knowledgeable.

469
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,980
I'm sure he would treat Li well.

470
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,330
Li was raised in Zhennv Hall

471
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,170
without formal education

472
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,130
and a questionable reputation
in the past.

473
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,810
With the current emperor's promotion
of female education,

474
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,540
it's natural

475
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,780
to want a well-educated daughter-in-law.

476
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,850
Li is lacking in this aspect.

477
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,370
If someone marries her

478
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,020
just to gain favor with you

479
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,410
but mistreats her,

480
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,090
won't that be my fault?

481
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,220
So after much consideration,

482
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,570
I sought the Zhao family

483
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,260
and asked for their opinion.

484
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,940
They willingly agreed.

485
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,780
Besides, Li has your support.

486
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,130
She won't suffer after she marries.

487
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,460
You're right.

488
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,460
But we should also consider
Li's feelings.

489
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,330
Why are you staring at me, Father?

490
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,650
I think you're now an adult

491
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,570
and it's time to discuss your marriage.

492
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,330
I've only just returned.

493
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,810
You're already trying to send me away?

494
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,940
Don't be ridiculous.

495
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,330
We've just reunited

496
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,170
and now we're talking about separating.

497
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,020
I feel upset.

498
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,460
I'm not forcing you to marry now.

499
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,300
We can meet him first.

500
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,370
If it's a good match,

501
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,850
then we can discuss marriage later.

502
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,740
Your mother has worked hard
on this for you.

503
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,570
You can't let her down.

504
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,220
All right.

505
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,300
I'll do as you say.

506
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:02,850
Li,

507
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,220
why did Ji Shuran

508
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,060
suddenly introduce
a marriage prospect to you?

509
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,890
I'm sure Shuran wants to get rid of me

510
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,460
so she's eager to marry me off quickly.

511
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,610
Who is Zhao Qi?

512
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,810
I did ask around.

513
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,890
He's a talented scholar.

514
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Three years ago,
he performed exceptionally well

515
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,460
during the imperial examination,

516
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,510
earning a personal audience
and rewards from the emperor.

517
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,650
However, he refused official positions.

518
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,570
Why would Ji Shuran

519
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,410
give me such a good match with me?

520
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,020
Maybe if the match is not good enough,

521
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,300
Master wouldn't agree so easily.

522
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,780
There must be something fishy.

523
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,260
How about you talk to Master

524
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,220
and reject him?

525
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,940
It won't be a good idea.

526
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,330
He's already said

527
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,700
it was Ji Shuran's wish

528
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,370
and we can't disappoint her.

529
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,500
If I insist,

530
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,500
I will be ungrateful.

531
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:01,700
Li,

532
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,300
what if you talk to Old Madam?

533
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,850
So what it's a bit rush

534
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,220
to find a good husband
for a stepdaughter?

535
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,890
Ji Shuran is not wrong in this matter.

536
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,570
Then...

537
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,570
It's not a huge problem.

538
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,370
Grandmother can't blame her entirely.

539
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,300
This matter

540
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,260
is up to us.

541
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,370
Mr. Jiang,

542
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,980
this is my son, Zhao Qi.

543
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,460
Greetings, Mr. Jiang.

544
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,260
Greetings, Mrs. Jiang.

545
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,060
[Zhao Qi]
Not bad, quite dignified.

546
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,940
Second Lady Jiang looks lovely.

547
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,410
Greetings, Mrs. Zhao.

548
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,740
Here are some tokens of courtesy.

549
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,780
Have a seat.

550
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,260
Serve the tea.

551
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,130
Our courtyards

552
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,290
have several pleasant views.

553
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,570
Mr. Zhao,
since it's your first time here,

554
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,460
how about we let Li show you around?

555
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,610
That'd be great.

556
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,090
Second Lady Jiang, after you.

557
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,180
Finding a good husband for Jiang Li

558
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,260
is the best solution
for dealing with her.

559
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,290
Mr. Zhao made some trouble
a few years ago

560
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,180
and sought help from my father
to get out of it.

561
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,090
This gave my father
a lifelong hold over him.

562
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,020
I hate Jiang Li.

563
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,850
Without us getting involved,

564
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,460
she'll be living

565
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,290
under the Zhao family's thumb forever
after marrying.

566
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:42,900
[Liuyu Pavilion]

567
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,610
Second Lady Jiang,

568
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,260
I've prepared a gift

569
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,700
for our first meeting.

570
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,530
It's cosmetic.

571
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,610
Yes.

572
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,020
This is made

573
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,290
from purple jasmine,

574
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,530
giving it a hint of cold purple.

575
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
It's delicate yet elegant.

576
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,220
It's not suitable for ordinary women.

577
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,090
But just right for you.

578
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,180
Mr. Zhao, you're being thoughtful.

579
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,090
But I did not prepare anything for you.

580
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,810
It's all right.

581
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,660
We'll stop the pleasantries here.

582
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,090
Living in Zhennv Hall for ten years

583
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,220
and able to return in a grand fashion.

584
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,660
I'm sure you're a smart person.

585
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,940
Shall we be frank?

586
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,700
Mr. Zhao, you're straightforward.

587
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,530
I don't like beating
around the bush either.

588
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,220
Great.

589
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,570
I'll drop my act now.

590
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,850
Listen.

591
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,180
My parents

592
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,500
hope for a prosperous family line.

593
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,180
So

594
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,090
after we're married,

595
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,020
our top priority
is to grow the family tree.

596
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,090
Mr. Zhao, you sure are frank.

597
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,220
But you're excited about this too early.

598
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,940
Well, you see.

599
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,570
I'll skip the romance part

600
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,460
so you don't have to pretend

601
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,050
to accept and reject my proposal.

602
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,050
You still have to marry me

603
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,050
after going back and forth like this.

604
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,610
Right?

605
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,420
So you never thought I'd reject you.

606
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,700
You dare refuse a marriage proposal?

607
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,570
Can't I?

608
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,220
What a joke.

609
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:09,940
Besides me,

610
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
who else can you aim
to marry to climb the ladder?

611
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,090
Since ancient times,

612
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,180
marriages have always been about status.

613
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,940
Speaking for which,

614
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,290
I'm a legitimate daughter
of a prestigious family,

615
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,740
and your father's rank isn't that high.

616
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,020
Can I even climb higher by marrying you?

617
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,090
Do I need to aim for you?

618
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,740
Do you really think

619
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,700
your status as a legitimate daughter

620
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,940
allows you

621
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,090
to pick any man in this world?

622
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,420
You probably don't know

623
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,500
how the other elites

624
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,460
in the city view you.

625
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,090
Then please enlighten me.

626
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,180
Then I shall reluctantly

627
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,570
explain it to you.

628
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,330
In noble family marriage unions,

629
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,130
the most important thing is reputation.

630
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,610
Then appearance and talent come after.

631
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,850
A lady's virtue is important.

632
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,980
How's yours?

633
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,460
Your clothing styles

634
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
are common and intolerable.

635
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,090
As for your appearance,

636
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,810
quite unique.

637
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,740
You're not properly cared for
and show signs of weariness.

638
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,740
As for your talent,

639
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,130
you've stayed in the mountains
for ten years

640
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,020
without proper education.

641
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,770
So

642
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,740
how many characters can you even read?

643
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,370
As for reputation,

644
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,420
everyone knows
about the matricide and fratricide.

645
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,570
If you were from an ordinary family,

646
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,260
you'd marry just anyone.

647
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,570
But now,

648
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,900
being the legitimate daughter
of the Jiang family,

649
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,290
you could choose

650
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,740
among some lower-class prospects

651
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,020
or settle for a lesser status.

652
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,850
Even if you were willing,

653
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,810
your family wouldn't want
to be disgraced.

654
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,180
In the capital,

655
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,700
[Liuyu Pavilion]
those above Rank Five

656
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,260
won't accept you.

657
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,700
While those below Rank Five

658
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,370
are not in your family's favor.

659
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,610
That's why

660
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,180
our Zhao family agreed
to this arrangement today.

661
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,500
This is due to your devout praying.

662
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,370
Does that mean
you're the only prospect for me?

663
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,420
Do you have any other choice?

664
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,810
Considering your nobility,

665
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,130
why would you want
to marry someone like me?

666
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,770
Grow the family tree.

667
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,020
I guess you're not young anymore.

668
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,180
You see, men don't age
as gracefully as women.

669
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,260
I can see the lines around your eyes.

670
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,220
Really?

671
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:27,940
Wait.

672
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,740
Just tell me what you want to say.

673
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,610
In the capital, a fine man like you

674
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,090
who is still unmarried at such an age

675
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,610
and solely focused
on pleasing your parents

676
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,460
can only mean one thing.

677
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:43,850
What could it be?

678
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,370
You have a lover but can't marry her.

679
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,090
I never expected you can be so witty.

680
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,940
Have a grape.

681
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,420
Why?

682
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,290
Does she not meet the standards
of your Zhao family?

683
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,020
Who is this lady from your neighborhood?

684
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:01,980
You...

685
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,090
What are you talking about?

686
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,660
Others may not understand, but I do.

687
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:09,980
When you were young,

688
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,900
you saw how beautiful the lady
from the neighborhood was.

689
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,900
So you secretly have affairs with her

690
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,570
and play a role
as a husband for nothing.

691
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,940
You clearly like her
but couldn't bring her home

692
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,130
for fear of being scolded
by your parents.

693
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,980
So you overlook your marriage.

694
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,660
But you were still young,

695
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,370
so you have ample excuses
to drag your marriage.

696
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,660
Now

697
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,740
that you're older,

698
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,900
how can your parents tolerate
this anymore?

699
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,260
You

700
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,500
can't delay it

701
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,180
and are afraid
of exposing your secret affair.

702
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,460
So you must quickly find

703
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,290
a suitable match
from a respectable family.

704
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,330
However,

705
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,980
those suitable matches look down on you

706
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,900
because you're old.

707
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,810
You can't aim for those
with high standards

708
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,090
and your parents won't accept
those with low standards.

709
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,740
So you set your eyes on me,

710
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,260
a notorious legitimate daughter
from a renowned family.

711
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,090
So you're begging me to be noble,

712
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,330
self-sacrificing, and heroic,

713
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,420
rescuing you from dire situations.

714
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Baseless statements,

715
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,180
speaking nonsense,

716
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,700
fabricating out of thin air,

717
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,460
and misleading.

718
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,220
Mr. Zhao, you indeed
have exceptional abilities,

719
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,130
are well-versed in literature,

720
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,290
and possess remarkable talent.

721
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:17,900
You...

722
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,810
Don't you point at me.

723
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,260
Zhao Qi,

724
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,850
[Liuyu Pavilion]
let me be clear.

725
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,370
I will not marry you.

726
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,810
First, I'm discerning

727
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,460
and won't tolerate any deception.

728
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,900
Second,
I have other matters to attend to.

729
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,940
I can't marry anyone.

730
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,770
You go

731
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,980
and reject this marriage proposal.

732
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,900
Or else, when I'm in a bad mood,

733
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,180
I'll bring my family
to visit your secret lover

734
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,220
and send them to your Zhao family.

735
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,610
At this moment,

736
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,660
are you threatening me now?

737
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,330
It's not a threat.

738
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,330
Just ending our engagement.

739
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,500
Now, it's a threat.

740
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,900
Zhao Qi,

741
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
listen to me clearly.

742
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,770
You can toy

743
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,290
with a lady without support

744
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,290
and use a lady from a noble family
to continue your family line.

745
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,770
I've never heard of such logic.

746
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,180
Today, I'll let your behavior slide.

747
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,770
But if I ever find out

748
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,660
you treat other ladies like this.

749
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,330
I'll expose everything

750
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,260
and your Zhao family
will lose face in the capital.

751
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,020
What are you waiting for?

752
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,740
If we keep this conversation on,

753
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,770
it'll get more disgraceful.

754
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,180
I've always taken care of myself.

755
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,530
These two have been away
for quite a while.

756
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,420
They must be getting along well.

757
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,900
Mr. Zhao doesn't seem
to be interested in me.

758
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,500
What... What?

759
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,130
Yes, Mother.

760
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,530
Let's discuss
this marriage matter again.

761
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,220
Li, you're so clever.

762
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,850
How did you know he had a lover?

763
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,850
I had a friend

764
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,130
who went through this kind of ordeal.

765
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,740
Ever since we have Ping'an,

766
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,420
[Inner Tranquility]

767
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,770
He hasn't touched me since.

768
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,980
He spends his time outside drinking

769
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,370
and having fun with his lover.

770
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,050
[Dai Yun]

771
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:35,940
Madam Xue,

772
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,980
I'm sorry that you have
to hear about this.

773
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,570
What's your plan after this?

774
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,900
Now that I have Ping'an,

775
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,500
his family has a descendant,

776
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,570
his parents no longer care

777
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,020
even if he's leading a dissolute life.

778
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,740
This is how my life
is going to be after this.

779
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,980
As for you,

780
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,180
you must keep this in mind.

781
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,290
People who target women

782
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,220
for the sake
of continuing the family line

783
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,610
are shameless.

784
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,300
Women face bad consequences for mistakes

785
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,570
while men often get away
with a carefree attitude.

786
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,980
His family even go great lengths
to cover it up.

787
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,340
It makes me speechless.

788
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,980
But Ji Shuran seems determined

789
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,420
to kick you from the family.

790
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,460
Besides, marriage decisions
are dictated by parents

791
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,210
and matchmakers.

792
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,340
Today, you managed
to get rid of Mr. Zhao.

793
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,530
There will be other prospects coming
after this.

794
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,940
What should we do then?

795
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,690
To stay in the Jiang's Residence,

796
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,460
I need to find another way.

797
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,300
What way?

798
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,420
Walk out of here.

799
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,660
[Yang's Residence]

800
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,170
What's the meaning of this?

801
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,210
Yang Song is suspected of colluding
with merchants to sell official salt.

802
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,730
We were ordered to arrest him.

803
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,900
But only female members
are in the house.

804
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,860
Even as secret guards,

805
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,250
you cannot barge in like this.

806
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,340
Mrs. Yang,

807
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,210
since there are women in the house,

808
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,500
we won't search further.

809
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,820
Please ask him to come out.

810
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,610
Duke Su,

811
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,460
there must be a mistake.

812
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,820
My husband would never commit

813
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,980
such a crime.

814
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,610
He has been honest
and upright all his life.

815
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,420
He never accepted any bribes.

816
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,500
But he has certainly given out a lot

817
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,050
from this household.

818
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,170
How could such a person break the law?

819
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,170
Madam, please sit.

820
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,780
Please have a seat.

821
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,090
I believe you are unaware
of this matter.

822
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,210
I have investigated
many cases like this.

823
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,250
Even when the Ministry of Justice
has given the verdict,

824
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,980
the families are left crying,
while the guilty walk free,

825
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,610
unaware

826
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,820
that their actions

827
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,250
have offended the Emperor.

828
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,690
When the Emperor is enraged,

829
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,730
His Majesty doesn't spare the family.

830
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,940
Do you know

831
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,300
where these people ended up?

832
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,460
They're enslaved

833
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,060
and confined
at the Office of Instruction.

834
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,250
Until death, they have no idea
who put them there.

835
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,340
Put the wives aside.

836
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,610
Even the pitiful children become slaves

837
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,570
with no future at all.

838
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,420
Where is Yang Song?

839
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,940
Confession letter.

840
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,730
We've been tricked.

841
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,540
Your Majesty,

842
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,770
[Prosperous Era]
the bureau has corrupted officials.

843
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,540
I have failed in my duty.

844
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,610
I'm willing to take responsibility
for my negligence.

845
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,130
But before that,

846
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:02,610
[Kong Zhaofeng]

847
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,820
I ask

848
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,690
for a chance to rectify the situation.

849
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,250
I will punish those involved
in the Bureau of Salt and Iron.

850
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,900
I'm truly grateful to Duke Su

851
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,060
for uncovering corruption
in the Bureau of Salt and Iron.

852
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,250
You don't need to praise me, Mr. Kong.

853
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,090
I put in so much effort.

854
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,380
Yet, I only managed to catch
this small corrupt official.

855
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,770
Such is my incompetence.

856
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,770
So

857
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,540
let me take the blame.

858
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,340
Duke Su deserves credit
for the case of the illegal salt trade.

859
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,860
As for the Bureau of Salt and Iron,

860
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,940
corruption has been prevalent
and deep-rooted.

861
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,770
It cannot be accomplished overnight.

862
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,170
But take this as a warning, Mr. Kong.

863
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,020
Be extremely cautious from now on.

864
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,060
I won't disappoint Your Majesty's trust.

865
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,770
You're dismissed.

866
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,060
Mr. Shen.

867
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:41,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

868
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,340
How is the progress
on the examination reform?

869
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,460
Your Majesty,

870
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,060
I have started to abolish

871
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,290
the -submission of writing samples
and public recommendations.

872
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,820
Now, rankings will be determined solely
by the examination papers.

873
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,860
The new anonymous grading system

874
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,900
has also been implemented
in the recent provincial examinations.

875
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,820
For next year's Imperial Examination,

876
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,980
all examination halls will implement
the new system.

877
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,020
Other than that,

878
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,990
post stations have been set up
in several counties

879
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,740
near the capital

880
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,540
to provide travel vouchers and subsidies

881
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,580
for underprivileged students

882
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,990
heading to the capital for exams.

883
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,430
After implementing this policy,

884
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,100
it has raised the public spirit.

885
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,510
The number of candidates
is increasing daily.

886
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,510
Your Majesty,

887
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,310
it's commendable to give
underprivileged students opportunities.

888
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,790
However, adding new rules
and rejecting pre-submitted work

889
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,580
will increase the burden on examiners.

890
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,430
I have heard during the recent exams,

891
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,910
there were several cases
of misjudgments,

892
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,580
leading candidates to protest
at the government office.

893
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,790
The capital's post stations

894
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,740
also experienced chaos and overcrowding.

895
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,030
The imperial exams are held
once every three years.

896
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,910
Relying on a single exam
to determine success

897
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,140
can lead to talented individuals
being overlooked

898
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,140
and mediocre ones being selected.

899
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,100
If the chief examiner could understand

900
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,580
some genuinely talented candidates

901
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,260
through pre-submitted work,

902
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,660
they would be better informed.

903
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,950
Hastily abolishing this system

904
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,100
could compromise fairness.

905
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,220
Better informed, huh?

906
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,870
Is it better informed
about the candidates' talents

907
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,220
or the candidates' family backgrounds?

908
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,700
Your Majesty,

909
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,260
I believe

910
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,030
that since pre-submitted work

911
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,510
can lead to collusion
between candidates and examiners,

912
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,030
abolishing it is the right move.

913
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,540
As for Mr. Li's concerns,

914
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,180
the issue lies not in the new system
but in academic administration.

915
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:13,510
Appointing competent officials
to enhance academic administration

916
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,790
to support the new exams is the way
to address the fundamental problems.

917
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,740
A new system will inevitably

918
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,390
have some shortcomings at first.

919
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,950
We can address them one by one.

920
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,660
If we hesitate

921
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,310
and cling to old practices,

922
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,990
then reforms throughout history

923
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,390
would never have succeeded.

924
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,430
Mr. Shen,

925
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,870
you can proceed without hesitation.

926
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

927
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,580
Speaking of the imperial exams,

928
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,140
let's discuss the central six academies.

929
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,540
The annual exams
of the Imperial Academy's six subjects

930
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,700
have produced talents like Zhao Qi,

931
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,030
who is not interested
in becoming an official.

932
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,510
The School of Integrity

933
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,100
initially established
to promote female education,

934
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,540
has been overlooked in recent years.

935
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,470
I want you to oversee

936
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,700
this year's exams for both schools.

937
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,790
I want you to keep an eye

938
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,790
on those with genuine talent

939
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,180
and high aspirations for me.

940
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,580
I shall obey, Your Majesty.

941
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:14,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

942
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,700
[Benefit All Beings]

943
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,030
Trinkets for sale!

944
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,220
Master,

945
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,220
we should have that fox Kong sit

946
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,350
on our interrogation bench for a while.

947
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,950
He has been in charge of the bureau
for so many years

948
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,430
because of his clean reputation.

949
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,830
Now, he is still untouchable.

950
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,910
Are we going to watch him guard
while secretly stealing

951
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,510
and let Yang take the fall?

952
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,910
Yang was just a pawn.

953
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,950
Have a taste of our fine wine!

954
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,580
This is the finest tea

955
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,140
of the year.

956
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,990
Mr. Kong, have a cup.

957
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,510
Tea can be refilled once spilled.

958
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,790
But if someone gets a hold
of your weaknesses,

959
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,140
it will be hard to break free.

960
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,740
I was careless.

961
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,870
But don't worry.

962
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,990
I've cleaned up
the Bureau of Salt and Iron thoroughly.

963
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,060
Xiao Heng won't find anything.

964
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,100
I hope so.

965
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,350
- Father.
- Father.

966
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,950
Do you know why I asked you here?

967
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,870
The money from the bureau
has been cut off

968
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,100
[Li Jing]
and that side needs money.

969
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,700
We need to fill this gap.

970
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,830
Where should we start?

971
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,910
- The Ye family.
- The Ye.

972
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,790
The Ye and the Jiang family

973
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,830
are in-laws.

974
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,790
Since Jiang Yuanbai remarried

975
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,740
and Ye Zhenzhen's daughter, Jiang Li,

976
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,470
was sent to the Zhennv Hall,

977
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,540
the Ye and the Jiang families

978
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,790
have not been in contact since.

979
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,220
[Li Lian]
The Ye family may be wealthy.

980
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,060
But they lack prestige.

981
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,740
Two years ago,
the Ye family used various means

982
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,260
to get their son, Ye Shijie,

983
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,740
into the Imperial Academy

984
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,220
to study with us.

985
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,620
If we control him,

986
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,740
won't we control the entire Ye family?

987
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,350
If you've thought of this,

988
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,950
why didn't you take action?

989
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,540
Ye Shijie is arrogant.

990
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,060
We haven't found
the right opportunity yet.

991
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,990
I'll pave the way for you.

992
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,180
- Yes, Father.
- Yes, Father.

993
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,220
Why aren't you drinking, Shen?

994
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,700
A toast to you, Your Highness.

995
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,580
Even your posture while holding
the wine glass looks graceful.

996
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,540
No need for your toast.

997
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,870
Today's banquet is for you.

998
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,540
I heard His Majesty has appointed you

999
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,830
to oversee the examinations
at both schools.

1000
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,510
You're truly a talented individual.

1001
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

1002
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,620
These are the schools
where talented individuals enter.

1003
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,660
I'll carefully consider His Majesty's
intentions and work hard.

1004
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,220
If it were just a routine examination,
it wouldn't be interesting.

1005
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,470
How about a joint competition,

1006
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,830
where the young gentlemen
from the Imperial Academy team up

1007
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,470
with the ladies
from the School of Integrity?

1008
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,990
That would be so interesting.

1009
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,140
I'm looking forward to it.

1010
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,260
No, that's not feasible.

1011
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,580
After all, this is the Entry Exam

1012
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,830
and should be taken seriously.

1013
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,830
Why can't we try something innovative?

1014
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,790
If we follow Your Highness's suggestion,

1015
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,870
it may lead
to students forming factions,

1016
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,430
which could harm the integrity
of our officials in the future.

1017
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,620
Those with true talent

1018
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:03,870
but poor social skills

1019
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,510
or family background

1020
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,510
might be overlooked.

1021
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:10,700
This would not be beneficial
for our government's integrity.

1022
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,140
You really are a clean young official
without flaws.

1023
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,510
But I don't like it

1024
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,180
when you talk to me so seriously.

1025
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,740
It makes me uncomfortable.

1026
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,220
On your knees.

1027
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:29,470
Your Highness.

1028
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,140
