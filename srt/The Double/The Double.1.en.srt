00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,900
Are suffering

573
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,690
- Mother.
- while the wicked

574
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,090
go unpunished.

575
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,420
Mother...

576
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,610
Mistress,

577
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,060
does this mean Jiang Li
won't be able to work?

578
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,540
She's still in bed at this hour.

579
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,020
It was only a few strokes,

580
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,690
that liar.

581
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,650
I'm going to fight them.

582
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,380
I'll make them pay for Mother's death.

583
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,250
What are you doing?

584
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,170
Do you want to avenge your mother?

585
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,020
Then listen to me.

586
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,130
Fate is unjust.

587
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:31,690
I must seek justice

588
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,020
for us.

589
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,020
How dare you sleep
when there's work to be done?

590
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,090
Quit pretending.

591
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,460
Get up.

592
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,290
Jiang Li.

593
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:10,690
Who are you?

594
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,020
I

595
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,570
am your benefactor.

596
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,690
Nonsense.

597
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,460
What's your relationship with Jiang Li?

598
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,020
Shouldn't you be worried

599
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,570
about the dead girl?

600
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,610
I see.

601
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,820
You killed an official's daughter.

602
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,460
I'm going to report you.

603
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,730
Did you forget?

604
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,540
You and your girls beat her to death.

605
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,460
Do you have witnesses?

606
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,170
Everyone here can testify

607
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,860
that you

608
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,020
broke into Zhennv Hall

609
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,730
and killed her.

610
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,250
Your testimonials are nothing

611
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,770
compared to hers.

612
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,540
See for yourself.

613
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,570
Look.

614
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,610
The dead can't lie.

615
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,540
Her body is covered in wounds,

616
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,020
not to mention the scars she
had accumulated over the years.

617
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,610
When the autopsy comes out,

618
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,060
will you be able to explain yourself?

619
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:02,820
Hands off.

620
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,650
Once the Jiang family sees her body,

621
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,940
you and your people will have
a lot of penance to do.

622
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,860
Let go of me.

623
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,170
Daughter of the Chief of Secretary
dies in Zhennv Hall.

624
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,860
Do you think you'll get away with it?

625
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,540
I have the perfect solution.

626
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,090
What's the solution?

627
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,290
From now on,

628
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,170
I

629
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,730
will be Jiang Li.
