Your Highness.

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,110
This letter is sent to you
by the Secretariat Director.

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,640
Return the letter to him as is.

20
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,750
Tell him that since he touched
my elder sister,

21
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,440
don't expect me to forgive him.

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,720
was about Mrs. Jiang.

24

You are so beautiful!

It's me, Shuran.

Don't you recognize me?

Let me put it on your head.

41

Grand Chancellor Jiang,

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,710
what's the meaning of this?

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,670
Giving out a carrot

44
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,960
and you think the stick you used
to hit others

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,040
will be forgotten?

46
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,390
This new house is much better
than the ancestral temple.

47
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,320
Here, there are flowers and plants
which she likes,

48
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,200
and maids who serve her patiently.

49
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,960
In the future, this will surely
be the place

50
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,240
where she spends her later years
without any worries.

51
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,240
You are so fierce, lady.

52
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,830
Li is also here today.

53
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,520
She hopes to talk with Your Highness
face to face.

54
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,800
Li.

55
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,960
Consort Li, please enjoy the tea.

56
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,520
Are you threatening me
with Shuran today?

57
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,350
No, Your Highness.

58
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,760
This is a gesture of goodwill.

59
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,470
After all, my mother's past actions

60
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,910
are clearly known by Your Highness.

61
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,960
Now, my mother can enjoy her life

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,880
all thanks to Your Highness.

63
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,680
Then what do you want from me?

64
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,390
I heard that Jiang Li and Shen Yurong
were sanctioned to marry

65
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,000
because of Your Highness's idea.

66
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,640
You yourself said
that you are both in love.

67
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,680
I might as well do a good deed.

68
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,350
Seeing that Your Highness is willing
to worry about my marriage,

69
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,030
I am naturally grateful for it.

70
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,590
I am just worried

71
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,320
that Your Highness
will end up like my mother,

72
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,320
being treated as a pawn
by Eldest Princess.

73
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,080
What are you saying?

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,830
When Jiang Ruoyao
knocked Zhou Yanbang unconscious,

75
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,520
I testified for Ruoyao.

76
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,710
Since then,

77
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,960
Ruoyao would not listen
to Mother's manipulation.

78
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,230
Mother thought that I urged Ruoyao on.

79
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,710
As such, she wanted to kill me.

80
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,590
This fact

81
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,440
was keenly discovered by Eldest Princess.

82
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,960
Ever since I returned to the capital
to submit an imperial complaint,

83
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,230
Eldest Princess wanted me dead.

84
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,230
My mother's intention to murder me
ultimately gave Eldest Princess

85
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,320
an opportunity
to let somebody else do the dirty work.

86
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,230
To survive,

87
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,350
I could only retaliate
with all my strength.

88
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,270
That's how things end up this way today.

89
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,910
And amidst all these, you still seem
to be innocent.

90
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,000
It doesn't matter
if I am innocent or not.

91
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,910
What matters is Eldest Princess
is targeting Your Highness.

92
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,710
As far as I know,

93
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,590
the marriage between Shen Yurong and I

94
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,390
wasn't Your Highness's idea.

95
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,910
Your Highness was coerced as well.

96
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,590
You…

97
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,000
What do you know?

98
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,320
I know that Your Highness
is the same as me in the past,

99
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,960
under threat by Eldest Princess.

100
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,080
With her character,

101
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,000
if the root cause of the problem
is not addressed,

102
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,390
she will use coercion
over and over again.

103
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,230
Your Highness, you can consider it.

104
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,030
If Your Highness is willing
to work with me,

105
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,030
I can help solve
Your Highness's problem.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,640
My mother can also
live peacefully in this small estate.

107
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,080

Your Highness.

111
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,790
My daughter didn't offend Your Highness,
did she?

112
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,520
I finally know

113
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,590
why those who want to murder Jiang Li

114
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,230
all stumbled in the end.

115
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,790
Grand Chancellor Jiang,

116
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,830
your daughter is really not simple.

117
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,790
Thank you, Your Highness.

118
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,960
Shuran.

119
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,560
Grand Chancellor Jiang,

120
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,150
to me, Shuran is
the most important person in this world.

121
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,000
As sisters, we supported each other
along the way

122
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,230
until today.

123
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,270
Seeing that you have reconciled
with Shuran,

124
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,030
the grudges between me and
the Jiang family are now wiped clean.

125
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,960
However, you driving Shuran mad

126
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,470
is something I can't forgive.

127
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,760
Although my sister was wrong
in the first place,

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,910
Jiang Li must pay the price.

129
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,030
The matter of the sanctioned marriage
is decided.

130
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,470
On account of your kindness
to Shuran,

131
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,120
I will not implicate the Jiang family.

132
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,270
I hope Grand Chancellor Jiang
will understand

133
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,470
the principle of abandoning a rook
to save the emperor.

134
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,230
As a parent, one should
protect their child,

135
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,390
and would never abandon their child

136
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,390
to protect themselves.

137
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,000
You don't know what's good for you.

[Princess Wanning's Residence]

139
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,200
Your Highness,

140
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,230
Jiang Yuanbai took Ji Shuran

141
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,590
to a new house.

142
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,110
However, Consort Li did not waver.

143
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,960
Your Highness is very clever.

144
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,080
If they beg Consort Li now,

145
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,110
they are only humiliating themselves.

146
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,040
Consort Li is an unstable pawn
after all.

147
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,080
The longer we delay this,
the worse it gets.

148
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,350
We shouldn't wait any longer.

149
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,230
Do you want me to request an order
from His Majesty?

150
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,560
Why do I feel as if

151
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,800
you are in a hurry to get married?

152
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,350
Naturally, I want to fulfill Your

154
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,560
Did Xue Fangfei teach you
how to play the Baoqin?

155
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,320
She can't teach me.

156
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,800
She plays it so well.

157
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,990
Both of you played a song the last time.

158
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,500
Why don't you two play another

159
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,900

160

161
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,990
Why should we?

162
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,230
Wouldn't this allow Consort Li
to take advantage of the situation

163
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,260
and suggest sanctioning your marriage
to His Majesty?

164
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
There are many ways to do that.

165
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,260
I want to see

166
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,020

169
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,620

170

out of guilt?

171

If Your Highness wishes to see it,

172
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,900
I'll perform it.

173
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,020
Lady Jiuyue gave it to me herself.

174
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,620
I didn't open it in any way.

Why did you suddenly come
to the imperial study to see me?

178
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,260
Is something wrong?

179
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,590
I heard that Your Majesty has been
reviewing memorials for the whole day.

180

That's why I specially brought
you some desserts.

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,190
Have you settled on any gifts?

184
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,540
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for always remembering.

185
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,540
I don't want any congratulatory gifts.

186
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,190
I just kept thinking about the time
when the Great Zhao emissaries came.

187
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,230
I caught a cold that day
and was unable to attend the banquet.

188
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,990
I heard that Second Lady Jiang
and Mr. Shen

189
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,950
performed like a match made in heaven.

190
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,110
It's a pity that I have no chance
to see it again.

191
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,830
What's so difficult about this?

192
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,540
Eunuch Su.

193
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,740
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]
I'm here, Your Majesty.

194
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,230
Relay my command.

195
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,830
On Consort Li's birthday,

196
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,430
invite Second Lady Jiang
and Mr. Shen to attend the banquet.

197
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

198
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,660
I also want to invite someone else.

199
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,620
Wanning was confined to her residence
during that time as well

200
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,780
and missed out on the performance.

201
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,900
Why not ask her to join us?

202
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,070
Great.

203
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,110
I wanted to do the same.

204
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,350
- Li!
- Li!

205
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,350
- Li.
- Li.

206
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,110
- Are you alright?
- Are you alright?

207
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,710
I'm fine.

208
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,740
Just stop pretending in front of us.

209
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,900
Consort Li is going

210
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,020
to grant Shen Yurong your hand in marriage,

211
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,140
we all know that.

212
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,860
Why did you suddenly retract
your testimony?

213
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,260
Stupid, if it weren't for
some unspeakable secret,

214
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,230
would Li retract her statement?

215
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,990
The situation is a little tricky now.

216
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,070
I'm thinking of a way out of this.

217
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,590
Ye Shijie is here too.

218
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,540
He is chatting with my uncle.

219
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,260
What are they talking about?

220
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,470
Of course, it's about your marriage.

221
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,350
Li!

222
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,230
My Lord, aren't I awesome?

223
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,190
I have found someone
who was hidden so well.

224
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,230
My Lord,

225
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,780
something is happening
to the Jiang family.

226
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,230
Consort Li invited Jiang Li
and Shen Yurong

227
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,260
to her birthday banquet.

228
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm afraid she wants
to sanction their marriage on-site.

229
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,990
Which day is it?

230
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,260
In two more days.

231
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,860
Just now, the spy even said

232
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,830
Grand Chancellor Jiang
invited Ye Shijie over.

233
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,620
What is he doing there at this time?

234
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,430
What? He invited Ye Shijie?

235
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,070
Yes.

236
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,500
Don't worry, Uncle Jiang.

237
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,660
I will definitely provide
my full assistance in this matter.

238
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:54,620
Good.

239
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,620
I'll take my leave first, then.

240
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,830
Great, Li is here too.

241
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,350
Li,

242
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,350
we were talking about you.

243
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,900
What is it about me?

244
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,230
Shijie, tell her.

245
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,950
Shen Yurong's request for marriage.

246
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,070
We all know about it.

247
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,380
I know you must be reluctant
to marry him,

248
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,620
so I will go and see His Majesty

249
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,740
and tell him that our two families
had us engaged when we were in the womb.

250
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,190
His Majesty takes
civil traditions seriously.

251
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,830
His Majesty will certainly take back
the order to sanction this marriage.

252
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,660
That is to deceive His Majesty.

253
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,830
The Ye family has agreed to
support this statement.

254
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,190
We are not afraid.

255
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,780
Uncle Jiang has also accepted it.

256
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,110
I trust Shijie.

257
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,660
This is the best way at the moment.

258
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,590
No.

259
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,260
You don't have to worry about this.

260
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,470
This is just to help solve
your urgent predicament.

261
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,350
If you don't want to marry me
in the future,

262
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,830
we can break off the engagement.

263
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,430
Marriage is very important.

264
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,540
What's more, my reputation
has already been damaged.

265
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,860
I don't want to trouble you.

266
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,350
What if I say that I am willing
to be implicated by you?

267
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,140
But I am not willing.

268
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,350
We are pressed for time
and have no time to plan.

269
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,990
The news just came from the palace,

270
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,110
on Consort Li's birthday,

271
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,500
you and Shen Yurong are invited
to the palace in celebration.

272
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,830
But no one else from the Jiang family
is invited.

273
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,470
I think she wants to sanction
the marriage between you two

274
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,620
right before His Majesty.

275
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,780
That's why I asked Shijie to come over.

276
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,830
You can mull over it.

277
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:51,900
I'm available anytime…

278
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,710
Second Lady Jiang.

279
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,830
Our Lord is waiting for you
at the entrance.

280
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,950
Duke Su is here. Why didn't he come in?

281
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,860
It's about Second Lady Jiang.

282
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,870
Second Lady Jiang,
please come to the entrance.

283
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,230
What's the meaning of this?

284
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,710
Father, excuse me for a moment.

285
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,470
Where are we going?

286
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,710
To the palace.

287
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,470
Why are we going to the palace?

288
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,430
I'll ask His Majesty to sanction me
to marry you.

289
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,670
Duke Su,

290
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,260
look at the situation now.

291
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,540
Please stop joking.

292
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,060
What's this?

293
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,390
Confession of the palace maid
involved in Consort Xian's case.

294

[Servant Zhang Manniang's Confession]

295
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,580
Did you find the suspect so quickly?

296
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,340
My men

297
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,870
aren't like the useless people
under Wanning.

298
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,230
Where is the maid now?

299
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,990
I hid her.

300
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
I had some of my people
disguise themselves as palace maids.

301
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,540
No one is aware of my actions yet.

302
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,430
So,

303
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,190
we are going into the palace
to meet Consort Li now.

304
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,230
You are the one who is going
to see Consort Li.

305
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,060
I'm going to meet His Majesty.

306
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,710
What matter do you have
with His Majesty?

307
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,430
To ask him to grant me a marriage.

308
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,190
Is the palace a place where you can
visit at will?

309
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,060
Who brought you in?

310
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,630
That does not matter.

311
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,150
Your Highness should be
worried about this instead.

[Servant Zhang Manniang's Confession]

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,380
[I put witch poison in Consort Xian's meal,
causing Her Highness to go mad.]

314
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,910
Where did this come from?

315
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,300
I said it before,

316
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,740
I can help solve your problem,
Your Highness.

317
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,020
Can Your Highness trust me now?

318
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,630
I have truly underestimated you
time and again.

319
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,470
Who is behind you?

320
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,910
That's not what Your Highness
should be concerned about now.

321
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,820
What do you want?

322
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,540
I am different from Wanning.

323
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,990
I won't threaten Your Highness
with this.

324
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,820
I am just begging Your Highness
to stop being Wanning's puppet

325
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,020
and stop interfering in the matter
of the sanctioned marriage.

326
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,670
In return, I will return this maid
to Your Highness.

327
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,780
Even if I don't mention it,

328
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,780
do you think Wanning will just give up?

329
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,300
The matter between you and Mr. Shen

330
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,470
is a hot topic now.

331
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,670
Even without my influence,

332
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,870
Wanning will also go with the flow

333
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,870
and facilitate this matter.

334
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,100
I've been planning this for a long time.

335
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,340
I'm just one step away now.

336
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,060
I need a favor from Your Highness

337
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,900
on your birthday.

338
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:13,980
What is it?

339
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,020
Xiao Heng, you went too far!

340
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,980

[Govern the people, serve Heaven]
When Shen Yurong asked for marriage,

342

why didn't Your Majesty refuse him?

343
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,370
Isn't it just a sanctioned marriage?

344

that I am fond of Second Lady Jiang,

where does this put me?

347
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,330
The affair between the two of them
is well-known in the court.

348

to be humiliated.

00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,460
You look relaxed.

362
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,050
Did you reach an agreement?

363
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,050
Consort Li agreed to help me.

364
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,460
Help you with what?

365
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,130
I won't tell you yet.

366
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,020
Even if you held Consort Li down,

367
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,500
what if on Consort Li's birthday,

368
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,770
Eldest Princess personally asks
to sanction your marriage,

369
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,820
how would you reject it?

370
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,740
Even if the marriage is sanctioned,

371
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,260
it takes at least a month
to prepare for the wedding banquet.

372
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,370
During that month,

373
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,770
I would make them

374
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,090
break off the engagement by themselves.

375
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,420
That's not a good way.

376
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,810
It's just in name.

377
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,900
Not even in name.

378
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,900
Tell me, is it true that you won't
be able to serve me in the future?

379
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,700
I will continue to accompany
Your Highness.

380
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,570
I feel particularly uneasy today.

381
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,870
I don't feel comfortable
seeing you either.

382
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,740
In that case, I shall excuse myself.

383
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,230
Your Highness, Duke Su wants to see you.

384
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,740
What a rare visitor.

385
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,390
Didn't you say

386
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,950
that he personally went to pick up Xue Fangfei
at the prison?

387
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,300
Yes.

388
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,820
Make yourself scarce.

389
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,020
Duke Su wouldn't be here for no reason.

390
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,670
Why did you come here today?

391
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,990
If Shen Yurong cannot become
a princess consort,

392
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,060
won't it be a pity, Your Highness?

393
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,190
If I want something,

394
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,230
I can retrieve it at any time.

395
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,190
Your Highness's generosity
is unparalleled by others.

396
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,150
I've always been jealous.

397
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,150
Naturally, I won't give away
the person I'm fond of.

398
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,910
Do you mean…

399
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,500
What does it take to cancel
Jiang Li's sanctioned marriage?

400
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,630
Duke Su is truly sentimental.

401
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,910
But I sacrificed a lot for Jiang Li.

402
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,820
How can you compensate for my loss?

403
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,950
What's your loss? I will pay you back.

404
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,670
I want a lot of things.

405
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,390
You can't afford them.

406
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,470
Is this enough?

407
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,910
[Virtuous and loving]

408
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,150
What a coincidence.

409
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,670
Second Lady Jiang is also invited
to the banquet.

410
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,470
All thanks to Consort Li's generosity.

411
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,670
Second Lady Jiang is really lucky.

412
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,340
I'm a little envious.

413
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,230
His Majesty has arrived.

414
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,540
Consort Li has arrived.

415
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,820
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

416
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,910
At ease, my subjects.

417
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

418
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,260
Today is Consort Li's birthday.

419
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,710
She doesn't want an extravagant banquet.

420
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,630
So I invited all of you here.

421
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,990
Consort Li has been whispering
in my ears,

422
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,300
thinking about the performance
by Official Shen and Second Lady Jiang.

423
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,820
Could the both of you

424
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,150
recreate that wonder today?

425
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,870
I am extremely honored.

426
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,540
I am willing to play for Her Highness.

427
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,910
Good.

428
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,670
I have also invited Wanning here today.

429
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,580
She had a dispute in court,

430
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,470
and I had her confined
to think about her mistakes.

431
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,780
Today, I invited her here

432
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,430
in hopes that everyone

433
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,740
can get along amicably.

434
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,670
Of course, Your Majesty.

435
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,710
Naturally, I won't mind their rudeness.

436
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,390
That's good.

437
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,150
Let's enjoy the meal first,

438
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,710
and the music later.

439
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:28,020
[Purity]

440
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,580
Mr. Shen, Second Lady Jiang,

441
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,950
please wait here.

442
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,500
When you look at me,

443
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,670
other than disgust,

444
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,740
there's a hint of mingled love and hate
in your eyes.

445
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,230
I didn't know

446
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,190
that you were so unaware of yourself.

447
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,820
Awareness about myself?

448
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,430
What kind of awareness should I have
about myself?

449
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,500
Do you know

450
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,580
that if you insist on clashing
with Eldest Princess,

451
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,470
it will not end well for you?

452
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,580
Why do you still want to marry me?

453
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,500
Do you want to use me again

454
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,300
to please Eldest Princess?

455
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,910
You still don't believe me.

456
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,740
I once trusted you.

457
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,990
What happened then?

458
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,620
[Purity]

459
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,540
Is your trust reserved

460
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,670
for a man of Xiao Heng's standing?

461
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,390
If I had the same background as him,

462
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,670
I wouldn't have to do this.

463
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,990
Will you believe me

464
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,740
if I say I can also trade
the Longwu Army for you?

465
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,670
Is this enough?

466
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,870
Is this the fish talisman
of the Longwu Army?

467
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,630
Since you know it,
I need not explain further.

468
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,950
If you give me this thing,

469
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,870
the world is about to change hands.

470
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,150
I don't care who rules the world.

471
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,990
I only want her.

472
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,430
It turns out you didn't know.

473
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,230
Now I have told you,
you can feel at ease.

474
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,910
[Purity]

475
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,950
From tomorrow,

476
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,060
no one will mention
the sanctioned marriage.

477
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,950
Even if His Majesty brings it up again,

478
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,060
I will refuse it.

479
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,020
After all,

480
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,340
that's the fish talisman
of the Longwu Army.

481
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,300
I'm curious

482
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,630
if His Majesty knew that Xiao Heng
handed over the Longwu Army

483
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,390
for a woman,

484
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,390
would his possessions be confiscated
or will his family be exterminated?

485
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,710
Your Majesty.

486
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,540
Mr. Shen and Second Lady Jiang
are ready.

487
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,540
Begin.

488
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,540
if His Majesty knew that Xiao Heng
handed over the Longwu Army

489
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,100
for a woman,

490
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:01,190
would his possessions be confiscated
or will his family be exterminated?

491
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,290
You really know how to fool around.

492
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,130
Although I am not an expert in music,

493
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,570
I've heard a lot of good things.

494
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,660
Second Lady Jiang,

495
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,220
do I think Consort Li and I

496
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,290
don't deserve to hear your music?

497
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,020
Forget it,

498
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,130
previously, Second Lady Jiang
and Mr. Shen rehearsed daily,

499
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,660
so the performance
must've been excellent.

500
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,260
Today, it was my sudden wish

501
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,900
for these two to perform.

502
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,260
Nevertheless,

503
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,370
today, we can consider my regret

504
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,130
of missing the banquet resolved.

505
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,370
Come.

506
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,660
Let's drink.

507
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,180
Eldest Princess Wanning rarely
visits the palace.

508
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,180
This Nu'erhong wine is
specially prepared for you.

509
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,660
Try and see if it's to your liking.

510
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,660
Mr. Shen,

511
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,260
you have seen Second Lady Jiang

512
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,610
won the competition in
the School of Integrity.

513
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,370
Do you think

514
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,290
her performance today
is the same as before?

515
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,940
From my understanding
of Second Lady Jiang,

516
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,700
she can play much better than this.

517
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,940
Maybe Second Lady Jiang's mind

518
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,090
is not here.

519
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,700
Really?

520
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,330
Then who is Second Lady Jiang
thinking about?

521
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,460
Are they more important than His Majesty
and Her Highness?

522
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,020
Your Majesty, Your Highness Consort Li,

523
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,050
Your Highness,

524
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,570
please forgive me.

525
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,260
I was indeed distracted today.

526
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,260
It's true that I am thinking
of someone in my heart.

527
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,770
Then let's hear it.

528
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,460
I am thinking

529
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,570
about him who was rescued
from Huaixiang,

530
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,020
Xue Zhao, son of Magistrate Xue.

531
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,290
I heard he was found.

532
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,940
Come to think of it, this was told to me
by Eldest Princess.

533
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,770
Eldest Princess has always said
that I am Xue Fangfei.

534
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,370
She said that Xue Fangfei was not dead.

535
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,610
That gave me an idea.

536
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,530
I thought, could Magistrate Xue's son

537
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,700
have survived too?

538
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,570
So, I asked Duke Su to help find him.

539
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,290
Before coming today, Duke Su told me

540
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,530
that he found the person.

541
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:57,900
I think,

542
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,260
when Xue Zhao wakes up, we can ask him.

543
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,940
Then, we can help Bachelor Shen

544
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,900
to find the person who murdered
his father-in-law and brother-in-law.

545
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,220
Great.

546
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,850
In this case, let Duke Su handle it.

547
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,980
If this is useful to the case later,

548
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,570
you will be awarded credit
for your contribution.

549
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,090
Thank you, Your Majesty.

550
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,330
But it's a fact
that I got distracted today.

551
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,530
I am willing to perform another tune

552
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,420
with Mr. Shen, Huaixiang Ditty.

553
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,610
A repertoire that has not been rehearsed

554
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,330
should not be offered to Your Majesty.

555
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,980
Mr. Shen should be very familiar with
Huaixiang Ditty.

556
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,420
If you have forgotten about it
because of leaving home for too long,

557
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,610
why don't you play it by ear?

558
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,420
That sounds good.

559
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,700
A local ditty

560
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,850
should be more interesting than
a grand and serious song.

561
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,570
Get started then.

562
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,610
Yes.

563
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,050
Huaixiang Ditty.

564
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,530
Madam, you are homesick.

565
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,090
I'm reminded of the time when I met you.

566
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,020
Do you still remember?

567
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,500
How can I forget it?

568
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
Did you give Longwu Army

569
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,730
to Eldest Princess for my sake?

570
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,610
You knew it already.

571
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,300
So this is the method you spoke of?

572
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,210
Yes.

573
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,170
It worked, right?

574
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,300
No one mentioned the marriage today.

575
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,090
Don't you know how important
the fish talisman is?

576
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,500
How can you give it away so easily?

577
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,980
Didn't I say I have a solution?

578
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,090
You are talking about the thing
you asked from Jiuyue?

579
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,730
You knew about it.

580
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,940
Then why did you give away
the fish talisman?

581
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,570
I was just guessing.

582
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,090
But I still don't know for sure

583
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,570
what exactly is it that you want.

584
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,340
We have to find a way to retrieve
the fish talisman quickly.

585
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,900
I've never seen you this panicked.

586
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,530
This is not my business,
it's your business.

587
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,170
So, you mean

588
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,020
I am very important to you.

589
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:45,860
Xiao Heng!

590
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,460
Alright.

591
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:50,940
Actually,

592
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,900
handing over the fish talisman
is just a part of our plan.

593
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:54,900
Our?

594
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,860
Who?

595
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,650
His Majesty and I.

596
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,250
What is it?

597
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,340
The mastermind behind Wanning
is Lord Cheng.

598
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,940
Lord Cheng has always been
eyeing the throne.

599
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,650
As long as he stands,

600
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,300
His Majesty will never sleep peacefully.

601
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,090
In the past eight years, Lord Cheng
enjoyed military success in the North,

602
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,020
winning the hearts of the people.

603
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,900
Today, at the Northern border,
many children do not know His Majesty,

604
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,820
but only a few do not know Lord Cheng.

605
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,090
Lord Cheng is establishing his prestige
this way.

606
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,050
Gradually establishing a good image
of a brave and caring leader.

607
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,690
He can then legitimately recruit troops.

608
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,460
Lord Cheng? Is he not afraid
of overshadowing the emperor?

609
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,250
Maybe that's his intention.

610
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,050
And if His Majesty suppresses Lord Cheng
for this reason,

611
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,020
His Majesty would be seen as
an envious leader

612
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,340
unjustly punishing a decorated subject.

613
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,610
If that happens,

614
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,420
Lord Cheng has a reason to declare
an uprising in the North.

615
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,020
In the past eight years, Lord Cheng
has been recruiting troops in the North.

616
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,980
Wanning has been garnering support
in the court and gathering money.

617
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,250
In the imperial court, there is also
Li Zhongnan's faction

618
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,570
which serves the two of them.

619
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,090
Corruption, corruption, and lawlessness.

620
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,380
These people are like a thorn
in His Majesty's throat.

621
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,530
He can neither pluck it out
nor swallow it.

622
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,570
Left to their own devices,

623
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,780
sooner or later, the forces in the North
will shake the nation.

624
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,730
Every official will be afraid of them.

625
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,380
If Lord Cheng launches a coup then,

626
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,460
the local army

627
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,730
will turn their spears against the court
for the sake of their family and lives.

628
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,420
His Majesty and I

629
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,980
were unable to find an opening
all this while.

630
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,300
Until you appeared.

631
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,650
Me?

632
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,730
Am I that important?

633
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,460
All this while,

634
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,570
most of the things you wanted to do
aligned with my goals.

635
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,020
Protect the Ye family
from being annexed by the Li family.

636
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,020
Destroy the private gold mines
in Huaixiang.

637
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,020
Even Xue Huaiyuan's case

638
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,300
gave His Majesty a reason
to weaken Li Zhongnan.

639
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,020
Originally, because of Shen Yurong,

640
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,780
you have driven Wanning mad.

641
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,340
I just didn't expect Wanning
to have Xue Zhao

642
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,980
and sanctioned marriage
as cards in her hand.

643
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,900
So I also played a game of chess
with His Majesty.

644
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,420
Are you crazy?

645
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,690
How dare you hand the Longwu Army's
fish talisman to Eldest Princess?

646
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,340
The Huaixiang private gold mine is gone.

647
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,020
Li Zhongnan's salt and iron business
in the south

648
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,530
has also mostly been taken out by us.

649
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,170
Li Zhongnan is gradually losing power.

650
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,420
It will be difficult for him
to find new ways

651
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,780
to make money for Lord Cheng.

652
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,020
How long does Your Majesty think
Lord Cheng is willing to wait?

653
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,940
If he doesn't rebel,

654
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,210
he will only keep asking for food
from the court, draining the treasury.

655
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,300
If Your Majesty refuses him,

656
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,820
he will have a reason to rebel.

657
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,900
When that time comes,
the Northern border will be devastated.

658
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,340
People will be displaced.

659
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,860
And the treasury of Great Yan

660
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,650
will be exhausted in this battle.

661
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:40,980
So?

662
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,500
Next month, during the ancestor worship,
Lord Cheng will return to the capital.

663
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,340
This is his moment,
but also our opportunity

664
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:47,780
Spell it out.

665
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,210
Hand over the Longwu Army,
and entice him to rebel.

666
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,690
Instead of allowing him
to grow his army in the North,

667
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,730
it's better to make him
attack the palace.

668
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,530
If the Longwu Army is in our hands,

669
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,130
he will be careful.

670
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,210
Once we hand over the Longwu Army,

671
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,780
it would be like exposing our vitals
before his eyes.

672
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,650
He will surely grab this opportunity.

673
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,980
Setting up a bait.

674
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,300
For your revenge, for a woman,

675
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,900
you are willing to treat me as a pawn?

676
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,420
Your Majesty, if I only wanted revenge

677
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,250
and cared not for the people
of the nation,

678
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,210
why should I endure until now?

679
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,340
What's the catch?

680
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,860
Do you still have any cards
after handing over the Longwu Army?

681
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,380
What about my safety?

682
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,380
Great Zhao.

683
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,250
Great Zhao is my trump card.

684
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,690
If you can think of it,

685
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,460
wouldn't Eldest Princess reach
the same conclusion?

686
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,420
Wouldn't she realize

687
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,570
that handing over the Longwu Army
is just a lure?

688
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,780
That's why I have to pretend

689
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,420
like I am carried away by love.

690
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,690
This is the only way

691
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,730
to make Wanning accept the Longwu Army
without doubts.

692
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,460
Honestly,

693
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,090
are you carried away?

694
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,730
I am wide awake.

695
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,050
Lord Cheng's position
has been established.

696
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,780
No matter what we plan,

697
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,130
a fatal blow has the potential
to injure both parties.

698
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,690
Your Majesty has trusted me
for eight years.

699
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,780
Please trust me for this one last time.

700
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,020
I will use the lowest price

701
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,380
in exchange for the greatest victory.

702
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,500
What should I do?

703
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,380
Act a play.

704
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,500
How should I act?

705
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,420
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]

706
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,020
Xiao Heng, you went too far!

707
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,820
I went too far?

708
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,420
When Shen Yurong asked for marriage,

709
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,420
why didn't Your Majesty refuse him?

710
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,610
Isn't it just a sanctioned marriage?

711
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,820
Why are you so anxious?

712
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,860
Your Majesty knows clearly
that I am fond of Second Lady Jiang,

713
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,090
Where does this put me?

714
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,780
The affair between the two of them
is well known in the court.

715
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,340
I don't want the two families
to be humiliated.

716
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,610
This is the best solution!

717
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,090
Has Your Majesty made up your mind?

718
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,820
Xiao Heng,
I advise you to drop this matter.

719
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,380
Please, excuse me!

720
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,900
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]

721
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:51,900
Good take.

722
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,730
Anything you break will be deducted
from your salary.

723
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,250
I see.

724
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,380
You could have forged a fish talisman
and given it to Wanning.

725
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,610
Why risk it with the real deal?

726
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,820
Don't underestimate Wanning.

727
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,420
With her keen eye,

728
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,250
she can tell whether
the fish talisman is real or not.

729
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,690
Not only will we fail to lure Lord Cheng
out of his den,

730
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,130
but we might alert them of our plan.

731
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,500
Will the Great Zhao really
send reinforcements?

732
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,900
This is the second thing
that I want to tell you.

733
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,170
I will head to the Great Zhao
for a few days.

734
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,090
When are you setting off?

735
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,730
In a few days.

736
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,250
Before you go,

737
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,940
I'll make a play for you.

738
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,170
Send some people to keep an eye
on Eldest Princess's Residence.

739
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,050
I have told you my secret.

740
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,210
How about you?

741
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,210
Before you,

742
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,730
I no longer have anything to hide.

743
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,690
I already knew

744
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,860
that you liked me.

745
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,340
But do you know

746
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,900
that I like you?

747
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,860
Shen.

748
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,980
You keep saying
that you hate Xue Fangfei,

749
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,050
why is the situation I see at the
imperial banquet

750
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,170
completely different?

751
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,860
You misunderstand, Your Highness.

752
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,900
I was wondering if the fish talisman
might be a scam.

753
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,300
After all, Xiao Heng is full of tricks.

754
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,420
Handing over the fish talisman now

755
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,820
is very fishy.

756
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,860
This is the difference between you
and Xiao Heng.

757
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,420
You can kill Xue Fangfei
just to stay alive,

758
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,980
but Xiao Heng can die for Xue Fangfei.

759
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,300
Your love is far behind his.

760
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,380
Now you're still talking to me
about the fish talisman?

761
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:03,380
Do you still want
to get married with her?

762
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,420
Or are you angry with me

763
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,980
because the fish talisman
ruined your plan?

764
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,050
I abide by your decision, Your Highness.

765
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:14,530
I dare not.

766
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,690
Do you dare not,

767
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,500
or will not?

768
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,300
Tell me.

769
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,650
How sincere am I,

770
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,570
can't Your Highness deduce it?

771
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,730
Shen Yurong,

772
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,650
why are you unwilling to give up on her?

773
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,100
I don't understand what's so good
about her.

774
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:38,070
At that time, she wanted to draw her bow
and kill you at the palace banquet.

775
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,030
Now she is plotting to ruin your life.

776
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,910
You are so shameless,

777
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,620
unable to forget her.

778
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,140
From the day I killed her,

779
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,210
aren't I already a shameless person?

780
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,730
Your Highness forced me
to become such a person,

781
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,650
have you regretted it now?

782
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,290
Why don't you dare
to answer my question?

783
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,380
Have you been lying to me?

784
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,860
I never thought
of deceiving Your Highness.

785
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,130
It's just that even I myself

786
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,210
can't tell which words
that are coming out of my mouth

787
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,100
are true,

788
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,460
and which are false.

789
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,860
I'm tired.

790
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,900
Your Highness must be tired as well.

791
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,460
I'll come back another day.

792
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,060
Shen Yurong, try if you dare.

793
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,100
Believe it or not, I will send
the entire Shen family

794
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,330
to the guillotine!

795
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,900
If it pleases Your Highness,

796
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,330
let it be done.
