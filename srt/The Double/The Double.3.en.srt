Tong.

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,070
Why are you here?

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,760
The person who sent me here

21
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,680
told me that Duke Su asked me
to take care of you here.

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,200
How are you feeling, Miss?

23
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,040
Did Duke Su
make things difficult for you?

24
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,310
I'm fine. Everything is well.

25
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,470
Miss, when I arrived just now,

26
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,840
I heard someone outside saying

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,630
that the Jiang family is going
to have a second wife.

28
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,470
Does it mean that we can go home?

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,150
Tong.

30
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,280
There's something I have to tell you.

31
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,910
I still can't do anything

32
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,190
against those who killed Jiang Li.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,680
I wonder if Li would have

34
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,310
a grudge against me if she knew.

35
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,630
She wouldn't.

36
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,120
Those who killed Lady Jiang

37
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,120
were those in the Jiang family
who turned their back on her.

38
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,400
Returning to Jiang's Residence
is like going into a tiger's den.

39
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,080
If others find out
that I replaced Jiang Li to come here,

40
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,870
both of us will get killed.

42
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,750
You've suffered enough
at Zhennv Hall for so many years.

43
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,910
Now, you have the chance

44
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,630
not to go with me.

45
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,400
The world is big.
You can choose your own path.

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,870
You don't have to risk your life
to go back with me.

If Mrs. Ye

50
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,590
didn't take me in to work
as Lady Jiang's maid,

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,310
I would've been sold to the brothel.

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,680
I swore that I would protect
Lady Jiang with my life.

53
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,080
But I couldn't keep my promise.

54
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,560
If I don't do anything,

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,240
I'll be ashamed to face her
in the afterlife.

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,750
As long as we can clear
Lady Jiang's name,

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,630
you'll be my master from now on.

58
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,680
I will serve you forever.

59
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,150
I'll do anything for you.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,680
Okay.

63
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,120
Are you really going
to take that girl back?

64
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,910
It wasn't easy to send her away.

65
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,280
If you take her back, it'll be...

66
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,710
You don't know anything.

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,710
Although His Majesty
didn't say it outright,

68
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,840
for my husband,

69
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,870
it was a decree.

70
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,960
We have to take Jiang Li in.

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,590
[Madam Sun]
It's bad enough that she'll be back.

72
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,600
But what was Duke Su thinking?

73
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,870
Why did he ask us to welcome her
with the Duke's Residence procession?

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,560
It'll give her more power.

75
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,390
These clothes are made
with high-quality fabric.

76
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,480
When you go and
escort Jiang Li tomorrow,

77
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,560
bring these to her.

78
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,720
It's already unfair enough for us,

79
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,240
why do we have to give her
such high-quality clothes?

80
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,750
She'll become arrogant.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,830
Then it won't be easy
to keep her control.

82
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,070
With the carriages of the Jiang family

83
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,720
and the Duke's Residence procession,

84
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,600
she'll live in a bubble of pride.

85
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,070
We need to make the bubble bigger

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,600
until it pops.

87
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,360
There's something
that I'm concerned about.

88
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,720
It may just be a coincidence
that Duke Su is involved in this.

89
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,600
But Mrs. Liu is not a fool.

90
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,270
It's not a coincidence

91
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,310
that the incident at Zhennv Hall

92
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,120
can make its way into the Imperial Court

93
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,160
through the Secretary of Finance.

94
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,390
The only one who knows

95
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,000
about Mrs. Liu and
Ye Zhenzhen's relationship

and use that to make this happen
is Jiang Li.

All these years,

98

Madam Jiang has never forgotten
about that girl.

99
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,830
She keeps thinking
and talking about her.

100
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,830
If she's actually that intelligent,

101
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,630
with Madam Jiang doting on her,

102
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,510
it'll be

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,070
hard for us.

104
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,240
I'll pay attention to that.

You are Jiang Li?

Perhaps you can't recognise me

111
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,750
because it has been so many years.

112
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,310
That's not true.

113
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,070
I just haven't seen you in a long time.

114
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,920
Besides, I heard that the Mistress
of Zhennv Hall was taken away.

115
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,630
I'm worried that my eyes
are bleary with age.

116
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,720
So, I have to look more carefully.

117
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,040
This.

118
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,270
This is the hairpin
that my mother left behind for me.

119
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,240
Look at it carefully, Madam Sun.

120
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,800
Looks like Madam Sun
is not just blearing with age,

121
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,120
but she also has a poor memory.

122
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,040
If mother and father don't want me back,

123
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,480
forget it.

124
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,560
Lady Jiang, please wait.

125
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,190
I've spoken out of line.

126
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,390
I should slap my mouth.

127
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,430
It's just because

128
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,190
I haven't seen you in a long time.

129
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,040
Please forgive me, Lady Jiang.

130
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,270
Madam Ji

131
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,630
missed you so much

132
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,600
because you had been away
at Zhennv Hall for so long.

133
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,630
So, she kept urging Duke Su

134
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,190
to send you home.

135
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,240
Finally, not long ago,

136
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,390
Duke Su agreed.

137
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,680
And Madam Ji immediately
asked someone to clean your room

138
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,870
and sent me

139
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,720
to escort you home personally.

140
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,750
If Madam Ji see

141
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,720
how beautiful you've become,

142
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,920
she'll be

143
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,920
so merry.

144
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,270
I'm really grateful to my mother.

145
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,390
I missed her a lot

146
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,000
the whole time I was at Zhennv Hall too.

147
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,870
I always felt regretful

148
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,160
that I couldn't stay by her side
to take care of her.

149
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,750
But now, it's great.

150
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,830
I'm finally going home.

151
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,600
I'll be filial to her

152
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,310
just like how much she loves me.

153
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,040
That's great.

154
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,630
Bring it forward.

155
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,870
Look.

156
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,560
Madam Ji

157
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,870
specially asked me

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,560
to buy these new clothes for you.

159
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,070
She doesn't want you to feel
uncomfortable in your old clothes.

160
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:02,830
Look.

161
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,630
They are made from high-quality fabric.

162
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,630
I think

163
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,310
you should change into them right now

164
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,310
so that you can look magnificent

165
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,360
to match your status.

166
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,070
Thank you, Madam Sun.

167
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,430
Tong.

168
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,950
Here you go.

169
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,750
Lady Jiang, after you.

170
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,790
As you said,

171
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,960
Madam Jiang dotes on Jiang Li the most.

172
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,440
So, Ji Shuran knows very well

173
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,030
that Madam Jiang
is the only one we can rely on.

174
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sure she won't let us

175
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,480
build a good relationship
with Madam Jiang.

176
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,600
Tong.

177
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,510
Do you know what taboos Madam Jiang has?

178
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,000
I remember that Master Jiang

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,030
once married a woman from the brothel.

180
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,120
That woman was haughty.

181
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,600
She loved luxurious dresses

182
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,790
and brocade was her favourite.

183
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,790
That kind of fabric is
as expensive as gold.

184

for this senior statesman

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,290
Don't make your uncle and aunt
wait for you.

367
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,290
Li, they are your uncles and aunts.

368
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,180
Uncle Jiang.

369
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:55,740
Aunt Lu.

370
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,050
He's your second uncle, Jiang Yuanping.

371
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,090
He's tall

372
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,460
and looks kind.

373
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,260
[Jiang Yuanping]
Yuanbai's brother. The first wife's son.

374
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,660
[The Lu Family]
Lu is the daughter of Chengwu Official.

375
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,900
Jiang Yuanping is famous
for doting on his wife.

376
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,660
Back then, Madam Lu caught a cold
during her postnatal care.

377
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,570
Now, she has a persisting headache.

378
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,020
He feels really guilty about it.

379
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,980
It's good that you are back.

380
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,850
I don't know what you like.

381
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,020
Please take
this jade bead rosary as a gift.

382
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,330
Thank you, Aunt Lu.

383
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:32,850
Aunt Lu,

384
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,810
has your headache gotten better?

385
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,610
My headache is not that severe anymore.

386
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,700
Uncle Jiang has brought
many physicians to treat me.

387
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,130
Now, I'm feeling better.

388
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,740
How kind of you to worry about me.

389
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,980
Li has always been very sensible.

390
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,900
I always held her when she was young.

391
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,940
And she was a good baby.

392
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,500
Now, she's already a young lady.

393
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,610
Uncle Jiang, Aunt Yang.

394
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,980
I've prepared
a pair of pearl earrings for you.

395
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,740
Jiang Yuanxing. The third wife's son.

396
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,770
He has big eyes.

397
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,020
The son of the third wife.

398
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,660
[Jiang Yuanxing]
He's not valued by the Jiang family.

399
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,900
He loves fishing.

400
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,610
[The Yang Family]
Yang is the daughter of Xuande Official.

401
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,090
If it wasn't because
she was getting old,

402
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,420
she wouldn't marry Jiang Yuanxing
who works as a proofreader.

403
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,260
Do you like them?

404
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,420
Thank you, Aunt Yang.

405
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,530
Uncle Jiang, do you still go fishing?

406
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,420
When I went out to chop some wood,

407
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,130
I saw many lively fish
in the river of Qingcheng Mountain.

408
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,850
The view was amazing too.

409
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,180
I haven't gone fishing in a long time.

410
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,330
Li is such a lovely child.

411
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,530
You are right.

412
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,050
She still thinks about us
despite being away for so many years.

413
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Brother, since all of us are here today,

414
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,420
let's have a reunion dinner tonight.

415
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,030
We can invite Madam Jiang too.

416
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,100
Okay.

417
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,070
Li has just returned.

418
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,790
I'm sure she's tired from her journey.

419
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,860
We can have dinner tomorrow.

420
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,230
Please be understanding

421
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,140
and let Li get some rest first.

422
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,030
You are right.

423
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,550
Am I right, Li?

424
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,990
As you wish, Mother.

425
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,470
Li has grown up a lot.

426
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,030
You've become more sensible now.

427
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,380
You are so considerate.

428
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,550
Li.

429
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,750
Let your mother take you
to the backyard to take some rest.

430
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,270
Okay.

431
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,030
Let's go.

432
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,820
How difficult can it be

433
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,550
to have a reunion dinner?

434
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,990
Take a good rest, Li.

435
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,420
If you need anything,
you can always come to me.

436
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,990
Li.

437
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,470
What's wrong?

438
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,950
I haven't been back in a long time.

439
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,580
Our residence has changed drastically.

440
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,230
I don't remember my way.

441
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,900
We've renovated
the front yard and the backyard.

442
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,710
Come. Let me show you around.

443
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,860
Do you still remember this place?

444
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,990
It has changed.

445
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:47,950
Father.

446
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,140
Look.

447
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,950
I remember

448
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,230
that I cried in fear
on that decorative rock.

449
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,620
I want my mother!

450
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,030
Mother!

451
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,180
Li.

452
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,660
Don't be afraid.

453
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,820
I'm here to save you.

454
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,340
After that,

455
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,180
you said something

456
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,950
that gave me the courage
to jump down from there.

457
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,860
What did I say?

458
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,230
I forgot.

459
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,310
You said this.

460
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,510
Don't worry.

461
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,790
I will never let you get hurt.

462
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,750
I never thought that you would remember
so many things

463
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,420
from your childhood.

464
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,100
I remember

465
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,950
that we used to love

466
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,900
sitting there and
watch the moon together.

467
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,710
My grandmother loved sitting over there
while watching a performance.

468
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,420
Yes.

469
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,420
Come to think of it, how's Grandmother?

470
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,750
She doted on me the most.

471
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,310
I'm unfilial.

472
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,420
I haven't been

473
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,710
taking care of you and Grandmother.

474
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,620
Your grandmother
has always doted on you.

475
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,750
She won't blame you.

476
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,180
It was my fault for making a mistake.

477
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,420
If you didn't send me to Zhennv Hall,

478
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,950
I wouldn't have realised my wrongdoings.

479
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,310
Let bygones be bygones.

480
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,340
You have grown up now.

481
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,070
We need to look at the future.

482
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,180
Is Grandmother still mad at me?

483
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,510
Madam Jiang is a kind lady.

484
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,550
She won't blame you.

485
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,380
If you want to pay her a visit,
you can just be frank with me.

486
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,950
You didn't have to torture yourself
by talking about the past.

487
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,380
You made my heart bleed

488
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,310
when I heard those words from you.

489
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,620
At first, I wanted to let you rest
because I worried

490
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,100
that you would be tired
from your journey.

491
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,030
Since you can't wait to see Madam Jiang,

492
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,990
I'll go with you.

493
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,180
Mother, Li has returned.

494
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,950
[Madam Jiang]

495
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,580
Jiang Li has returned.

496
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,510
Madam Jiang was very kind to Jiang Li.

497
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,950
Jiang Li would get cold easily.

498
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,860
And she would be down
with a fever and cough during winter.

499
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,710
When Madam Jiang found out,

500
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,990
she would personally
cook pear soup for Jiang Li.

501
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,100
Greetings, Grandmother.

502
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,070
Let me take a good look at you.

503
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,100
Is she really Li?

504
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,950
Yes, Mother.

505
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,620
My child.

506
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,310
You've had it hard.

507
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,990
I've gotten older and less mobile now.

508
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,820
I could only send you some gifts

509
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,860
during the festivals.

510
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,580
But you only had Tong with you.

511
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,310
And she was still a child.

512
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,030
I wondered if she had taken good care

513
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,550
of those things I sent you.

514
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,820
If Madam Jiang really cared
about Jiang Li,

515
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,900
had she received

516
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,180
anything from Madam Jiang
in the past ten years?

517
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,990
We can't be sure.

518
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,100
Maybe she sent them.

519
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,510
But they were taken by others.

520
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,710
I've been living well

521
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,100
thanks to your care.

522
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,180
I regretted not being able

523
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,660
to see you and take care of you

524
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,070
by your side.

525
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,660
Since you are home now,

526
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,820
let's not talk about it anymore.

527
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,070
If you need anything after this

528
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,030
or if you want to eat anything,

529
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,660
you can come to me.

530
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,950
Thank you, Grandmother.

531
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,820
Madam Zhang.

532
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,070
Go and cook some pear soup for Li.

533
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,950
She loved it when she was young.

534
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,470
Yes, Madam Jiang.

535
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,340
Li.

536
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,340
Come.

537
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,030
Here.

538
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,710
Sit down.

539
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,620
Put this on.

540
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,470
No, Grandmother.

541
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,510
This is too valuable.

542
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,070
Take it.

543
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,750
- Here.
- Grandmother.

544
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,710
I'll pay you back

545
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,180
for what I've owed you for 10 years.

546
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,340
Thank you, Grandmother.

547
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,070
You have cute hands

548
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,140
and a beautiful face.

549
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,070
She didn't look like this in the past.

550
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,900
She looks so different now.

551
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,900
Young Master.

552
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,820
Grandmother, I want to play.

553
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Bingji.

554
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,780
He is...

555
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,300
You are the bad girl

556
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,100
[Jiang Bingji]
who tried to kill my mother and brother.

557
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,210
I'll hit you! You are a bad girl!

558
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,020
Bingji.

559
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,780
- You are a bad girl!
- Bingji.

560
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,450
Bingji.

561
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,130
Shut up.

562
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,650
This...

563
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,580
Bingji.

564
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,610
Why did you take Bingji here?

565
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,980
He woke up from his nap

566
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,780
and wanted to find his mother.

567
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,890
I couldn't stop him.

568
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,210
When have you

569
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,930
given birth to such a cute young boy?

570
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,850
You are so beautiful, Sister.

571
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,170
Mother.

572
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,210
I'm not your brother.

573
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
You are a murderer.

574
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,500
You killed my brother.

575
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,890
- Bingji, nonsense.
- Nonsense.

576
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,340
I don't want
the beautiful sister to be here.

577
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,410
Grandmother, I don't want her here!

578
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,130
Get up.

579
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,500
- I don't want her here.
- Get up.

580
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,060
Grandmother, I don't want her here!

581
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,820
Grandmother, I don't want
the beautiful sister to be here.

582
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,370
Bingji.

583
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,410
Get up.

584
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,300
He's such a young kid.

585
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,260
He wouldn't say this unless
someone taught him what to say.

586
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,930
You are right to lecture me.

587
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,100
I've been busy

588
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,130
with Li's return

589
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,850
that I've overlooked Bingji's education.

590
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,820
It was my fault.

591
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,130
Maybe Young Master

592
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,300
heard the servants

593
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,650
gossiping about it.

594
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:30,540
Madam Jiang.

595
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,610
Please punish me.

596
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,780
Bingji is still young.

597
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,060
We just have to teach him
better after this.

598
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,740
Today is Li's return.

599
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,930
Let's not punish the servants.

600
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,930
Jiang Li is back.

601
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,500
She came back in a grand manner.

602
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,170
But the family is in a mess.

603
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,580
This is unacceptable.

604
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,610
I might sound harsh.

605
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,450
But I wasn't blaming the child.

606
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,780
I just wanted to remind you

607
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,930
that no matter
it's the adults or the young,

608
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,580
you need to educate the young carefully
they that they won't develop bad habits.

609
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,020
That's the whole point

610
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,610
of this family reunion
that you are showing me.

611
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,260
You are right.

612
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,370
Forget it. That's enough for today.

613
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,780
Okay. We'll let you rest now.

614
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,820
Madam Sun,
take Li back to her room to rest.

615
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,020
Yes, My Lord.

616
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,450
This is your courtyard,
Second Lady Jiang.

617
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,300
[Fangfei Garden]

618
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,610
Fangfei Garden.

619
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,710
This is fate.

620
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,750
This is the courtyard
that you stayed at.

621
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,980
You still remember it, right?

622
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,540
Although

623
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,340
it looks a little bit shabby now.

624
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,170
We didn't dare to do anything to it

625
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,850
because you weren't back.

626
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,580
It'll look nice once it's cleaned up.

627
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,210
Your return is too sudden.

628
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,340
Too many things to do in a short time.

629
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,930
The servants don't have enough time

630
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,410
to clean the place too.

631
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,450
I think

632
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,100
we'll have to trouble you

633
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,980
to clean up the place yourself.

634
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,170
Isn't that

635
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,300
your preference too, Lady Li?

636
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,300
Here. Take a look.

637
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,580
What do you think? Do you like it?

638
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,850
If you don't,

639
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,170
I have to tell Madam Ji at once

640
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,580
so that she can switch you
to a bigger courtyard.

641
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,610
Thank you, Madam Sun.

642
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,410
Although the yard is run-down and messy,

643
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,410
it'll be nice once it's all cleaned up.

644
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,420
I'll get going, then.

645
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,130
Okay.

646
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:16,810
Lady Li.

647
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,690
We have just arrived

648
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,170
and this is the courtyard they gave us.

649
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,130
You can report this to His Lord

650
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,460
to punish Madam Sun
for her dereliction of duty.

651
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,210
If we don't like it,
we can move to another courtyard.

652
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,100
If we report her but
don't want to move to another courtyard,

653
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
isn't that unreasonable?

654
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,770
If we move to another courtyard,

655
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,500
it'll be set in stone

656
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,100
that we are picky.

657
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,580
No wonder.

658
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,300
Ji Shuran must have

659
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,180
asked someone to take Bingji there too.

660
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,140
No wonder

661
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,390
she would be so kind
to let you meet Madam Jiang.

662
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,100
So, it was just a part of her plan.

663
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,580
Madam Jiang is sincere toward Jiang Li.

664
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,740
But she didn't stand up
for Lady Li just now.

665
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,430
This courtyard is just a power display.

666
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,350
More will be coming.

667
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,510
I always fell sick when I was young.

668
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,030
Mrs. Jiang and Jiang Li
were the ones who took care of me.

669
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,950
They refused to let me do anything

670
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,780
until I recovered.

671
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,070
Jiang Li and Mrs. Jiang
were great people.

672
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,030
But after Mrs. Jiang passed away,

673
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,390
Jiang Li was tortured by them.

674
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,070
The Jiang family
can never repay Jiang Li

675
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,950
for what was done to her.

676
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,830
Tong.

677
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:16,260
I'll take back everything
that belongs to Jiang Li.

678
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,780
[Simple but Elegant]

679
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,430
Madam Ji.

680
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,660
I've sent Jiang Li to Fangfei Garden.

681
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,140
Anything that seems out of place?

682
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,950
Ever since the Duke's Residence

683
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,180
took her back,

684
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,830
she started plotting against us.

685
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,100
She lied, acted pitiful and
pretended to be a good girl.

686
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,990
If you didn't plan it out beforehand,

687
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,990
we would've lost this round.

688
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,780
She's someone intelligent.

689
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,660
When Madam Jiang asked her
if she had received her gifts,

690
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,350
she didn't reveal the truth.

691
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,910
She's good at bidding her time.

692
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,430
What's wrong?

693
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,510
Madam Ji.

694
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,730
Don't you think that Jiang Li

695
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,470
is too different
from how she was 10 years ago?

696
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,300
Are you talking about her temperament

697
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,220
or her looks?

698
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,660
Jiang Li was very young when she left.

699
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,180
She looks somewhat similar
to young Jiang Li.

700
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,300
But her temperament

701
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,830
has totally changed.

702
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,220
Be careful with your words.

703
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,100
[Simple but Elegant]

704
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,430
Don't say that

705
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,140
in front of my husband and Madam Jiang.

706
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,180
If others hear this,

707
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,030
they'll think that I'm not willing

708
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,910
to accept the daughter of the first wife
of the Jiang family.

709
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,700
Since she dares return,

710
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,780
it means that she has come back
fully prepared.

711
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,550
If she's the real Jiang Li,

712
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,220
I'll show her
who's the mistress of the house.

713
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,140
If she's a fake Jiang Li,

714
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,300
she'll expose herself eventually

715
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,390
under my watch.

716
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,390
Then, we'll find out what motive is

717
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,870
when the time comes.

718
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,740
Send two maidservants to her tomorrow.

719
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,220
Remember

720
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,870
to serve her well.

721
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,700
Second Lady Jiang.

722
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,870
Madam Sun.

723
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,180
[Yunshuang, Xiangqiao]
They are Xiangqiao and Yunshuang.

724
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Lady Li.

725
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,140
Xiangqiao is...

726
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,260
- What do I say about you?
- Smart and nimble.

727
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,140
She's smart and nimble.

728
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,990
Obedient and sensible.

729
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,740
Obedient and sensible.

730
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,950
Good.

731
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,470
Yunshuang is...

732
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,620
Introduce yourself. Hurry up.

733
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,300
I'm diligent.

734
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,510
Diligent.

735
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,350
Robust.

736
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,390
Robust. Good.

737
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,740
Lady Li, you are so beautiful.

738
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,620
Yes. She's beautiful.

739
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,950
Both of them

740
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,870
used to serve Madam Ji.

741
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,780
But since

742
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,220
you only have a maidservant with you,

743
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,700
It's too inappropriate.

744
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,870
So, she asked me

745
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,910
to send them here to serve you.

746
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,830
Please relay my thanks to Mother.

747
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,220
Second Lady Jiang, look.

748
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,350
These are the new clothes,

749
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,260
new jewellery

750
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,620
and the monthly allowance

751
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,100
that Madam Ji has prepared for you.

752
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,070
Please keep them well.

753
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,700
How kind my Mother is.

754
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,700
Put them at the back.

755
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,870
Xiangqiao, Yunshuang.

756
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,350
Serve Second Lady Jiang well.

757
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,910
With all your heart.

758
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,830
I'll get going now.

759
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,260
Okay.

760
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,870
Xiangqiao.

761
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,350
Go and wash the cups.

762
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,430
Okay.

763
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,990
How frightening! What should I do?

764
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,580
I broke them.

765
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,180
How could you break them?

766
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,740
My hands are calloused and rough.

767
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,780
I can only do some menial work.

768
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,300
I still need some time

769
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,870
to get used to skilled work like this.

770
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,030
Although your hands
are calloused and rough,

771
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,620
this is not skilled work.

772
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,510
But you can't even do it.

773
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,220
If I say that this is menial work,

774
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,870
then it's menial work.

775
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,510
Menial work.

776
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,700
Tong.

777
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,660
Xiangqiao's hands are calloused
and can only do menial work.

778
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,070
You'll take over this kind
of skilled work after this.

779
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,100
Then you'll sweep the floor from now on.

780
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,350
The cups are shattered.

781
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,740
I need to go to the storehouse
to replace them.

782
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,990
How could she be like that?

783
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,300
She was bullying us on purpose.

784
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,260
More like this
will happen in the future.

785
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,620
Yunshuang.

786
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,140
Go and get some fertilizer.

787
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,260
They don't have it.

788
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,990
You haven't even asked.

789
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,950
How do you know they don't have it?

790
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,350
It's not something
that's readily available.

791
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,740
No one is a foreseer.

792
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,990
They won't know
that we'll need some fertilizer today.

793
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,510
We need to ask someone to come here

794
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,390
and list out what we need, right?

795
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,180
Then, they'll send someone
to purchase what we need.

796
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,740
Go and do that, then.

797
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,390
Now?

798
00:41:59,070 --> 00:41:59,620
I can't do that.

799
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,100
The housekeeper
is definitely not in right now.

800
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,580
If I just go there like this,

801
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,030
I'll get hit 50 times.

802
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,660
I won't go.

803
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,180
How do you know she's not there
if you don't go there and ask.

804
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,700
Forget it.

805
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,300
Tong, go and find
the housekeeper yourself.

806
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,430
Okay.

807
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,430
My stomach is in pain.

808
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,470
I need to use the toilet.

809
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,830
This is so sweet. Give it a taste.

810
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,260
Is it sweet?

811
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,430
So sweet.

812
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,950
I want to see

813
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,660
if you can keep sitting there
and do nothing.

814
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,870
Why can't we?

815
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,740
Second Lady Jiang says

816
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,300
that we can take a rest

817
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,780
whenever we are tired.

818
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:53,870
Are you tired?

819
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,950
I'm exhausted.

820
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:55,870
What about you?

821
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,620
Same.

822
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,740
Here. Eat this.

823
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,030
Don't worry.

824
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,620
I won't wash or touch the curtains

825
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,510
in these two buckets.

826
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,830
I'm going to show the Jiang family

827
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,350
how lazy their maidservants are.

828
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:11,620
I'll do it.

829
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,740
Lady Li, you can't do this.

830
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,950
I've worked the whole day.

831
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,910
But I'm not complaining
about being tired.

832
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,580
She didn't throw a tantrum?

833
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:28,740
How obedient.

834
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,910
I also think that it's strange.

835
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,470
I even asked

836
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:35,140
those two maids to bully her more.

837
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,260
I never thought that Second Lady Jiang

838
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,620
would be able to take it.

839
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,350
Madam Ji,

840
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,300
should we bully her even more?

841
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:44,910
No.

842
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,140
Just ask someone
to continue watching her.

843
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,700
Inform me at once if she makes a move.

844
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,550
Ruoyao's coming-of-age ceremony
is just around the corner.

845
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,350
I don't want to spend
so much energy on her.

846
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,350
If she keeps her head down,

847
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,950
I can let her live under the same roof.

848
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,260
But if she doesn't...

849
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,180
[Gazebo]

850
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,390
Miss.

851
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,660
Look at them.
They don't act like maids at all.

852
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,180
Miss, you are Second Lady Jiang now.

853
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,700
You can punish them.

854
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,070
Are you done?

855
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,180
Another thing.

856
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,620
They are the ones

857
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,740
who caused trouble every time.

858
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,510
But I'm the one who had
to clean up their mess.

859
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,140
Are you mad?

860
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,470
Of course I am.

861
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,950
They haven't been here long.

862
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,300
But they are already bullying us.

863
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,990
What should we do after this?

864
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,550
We are new here.

865
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,550
If I order the maids around

866
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,070
and punish them severely,

867
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,740
what will Old Madam Jiang
and Jiang Yuanbai think of me

868
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,030
if they find out?

869
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:58,390
Are you saying that...

870
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,350
Think about it.

871
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,030
These two maids worked diligently
for the family before this.

872
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,990
If they were punished
after working for Fangfei Garden,

873
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,470
it would make me seem like a bully.

874
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,180
Once I'm labelled as a bully,

875
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:15,510
the guilt that Jiang Yuanbai feels

876
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,780
toward Li for letting her suffer
10 years on the mountain

877
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,660
will be erased by Li Shuran easily.

878
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,830
But we can't keep backing down, right?

879
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,870
I'm enduring it because
I don't want to expose myself.

880
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,660
But you are an honest person.

881
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,910
So, it confuses them.

882
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,950
Miss,

883
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:36,740
have you

884
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,300
come up with a solution against them?

885
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,180
After cooperating with me
for the past two days,

886
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,780
I've already figured them out.

887
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,070
We've given them plenty of chances.

888
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,510
- Here. Give me a hand.
- Be careful.

889
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:52,660
Let's go.

890
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,100
Be careful.

891
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,180
Where should I put it?

892
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:56,660
Over here.

893
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,390
Okay.

894
00:45:59,070 --> 00:45:59,580
Be careful of the steps.

895
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,180
Be careful.

896
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:01,620
Here.

897
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,300
Put it in front.

898
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:06,390
Put it here.

899
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:08,830
Put it over there.

900
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:09,660
Okay. I'll go there.

901
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,350
Take this.

902
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,030
Be careful.

903
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:12,990
What are you doing?

904
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:14,550
My Lord.

905
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,070
These are arranged by Madam Ji.

906
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,180
Third Lady's

907
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,740
coming-of-age ceremony
is just around the corner.

908
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:23,700
We have to put one here.

909
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,300
Madam Ji.

910
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,260
On my way here,

911
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,180
I can see that the residence
is being decorated.

912
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,030
You have worked hard.

913
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,350
That's just my duty.

914
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,140
This is the guest list
for the coming-of-age ceremony.

915
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,220
Please take a look at it.

916
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,550
I'll leave it to you
to make the decision.

917
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,260
What's wrong?

918
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,350
This is a major ceremony for Ruoyao.

919
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,950
We have to invite
the Marquis of Ningyuan.

920
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:10,700
I'm not worried

921
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,580
about the Marquis of Ningyuan
feeling offended.

922
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,510
After all, Li is our child.

923
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,220
She'll meet the public sooner or later.

924
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,030
I'm just afraid
that she'll feel ill at ease.

925
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,350
She was engaged to Zhou Yanbang
from the Marquis's Residence.

926
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,140
But due to the mistake she made,

927
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,430
we discussed with the marquis
to switch her out with Ruoyao.

928
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,700
If Li sees Ruoyao and Yanbang together,

929
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,700
I'm afraid that she'll feel upset.

930
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,100
Moreover,

931
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:35,660
we are a prestigious family.

932
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,140
There'll be many officials

933
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,260
attending Ruoyao's
coming-of-age ceremony.

934
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,140
If Li is there

935
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,870
and the incident with Madam Jiang
that day repeats itself,

936
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,550
it'll be bad for her.

937
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,430
You are right.

938
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,950
If she can't handle
the situation properly,

939
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,700
she'll be ridiculed.

940
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,780
We don't have to let Li attend
the coming-of-age ceremony.

941
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,100
Let her get used to living
in the capital city first.

942
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,990
Then, we'll find a chance
to introduce her to the public.

943
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:10,990
Your wish is my command.

944
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,510
You've worked hard lately.

945
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:15,070
Let me give you a massage.

946
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,500
[Jiang's Residence]

947
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,030
Xiangqiao.

948
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:45,660
Come.

949
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:53,620
Only Xiangqiao has been summoned.

950
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:57,700
Go.

951
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:58,700
It's fine.

952
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,220
Xiangqiao.

953
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:01,950
Have a seat.

954
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:07,390
Tong.

955
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:10,870
Pour some tea for her.

956
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:15,870
Lady Li.

957
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,260
You are too kind.

958
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,260
You just have to give me your order.

959
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,300
I have

960
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,510
lectured Tong about it.

961
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,260
She grew up at Zhennv Hall with me
since she was young.

962
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,510
So, she doesn't know the rules

963
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,220
and she doesn't know
the ways of the world.

964
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,300
She's a straightforward person.

965
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,660
Please forgive her.

966
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,470
There's nothing to forgive.

967
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,350
We just want to serve you well.

968
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,070
We lived at Zhennv Hall for many years.

969
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,300
And we've just returned.

970
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,740
There are many rules that we don't know.

971
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,700
I hope that you can give us
some guidance after this.

972
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:53,390
This...

973
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:57,950
Lady Li.

974
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,510
This is what Mother gave me
when I just came back.

975
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,140
I have nowhere to wear it.

976
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,430
Do you like it?

977
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,180
Well...

978
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,330
If you like it,

979
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,690
you can take it.

980
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,900
Thank you, Lady Li.

981
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,610
I have something to ask you.

982
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:23,900
Lady Li.

983
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,940
What is it?

984
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,940
I saw many servants

985
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,210
moving around some potted plants.

986
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,860
The residence is bustling with life.

987
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,170
Are we going to have
some important guests over?

988
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
Third Lady's coming-of-age ceremony
is just around the corner.

989
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,460
Everyone is getting
the residence ready for it.

990
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:40,980
I see.

991
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,170
Give me more tea.

992
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,420
Here.

993
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,130
I haven't been able
to visit my grandmother.

994
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,580
I'm afraid that she'll get upset.

995
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,250
But I'm a bit bored staying here.

996
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,610
My yard looks nice

997
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,690
but it's a little bit empty.

998
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,100
Can you help me

999
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,290
get some potted plants to decorate it?

1000
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,650
Although I can't help
with my sister's ceremony,

1001
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,290
I want to make
my living quarters look livelier.

1002
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,690
Lady Li.

1003
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,170
Well...

1004
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,770
I...

1005
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,770
I know the rules of the residence.

1006
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,540
If you can help me with this,

1007
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,260
other than this hairpin,

1008
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,780
more will be coming.

1009
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,380
Just leave it to me.

1010
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,660
Traitor.

1011
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,990
Shameless woman.

1012
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:39,550
Thank you, Lady Li.

1013
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,300
Lady Li.

1014
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,030
You are too generous.

1015
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,100
The more they get from me, the better.

1016
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,870
The coming-of-age ceremony

1017
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,700
is just around the corner.
But we are not informed about it.

1018
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,550
Looks like I'm not invited.

1019
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,950
Ji Shuran has a great plan instead.

1020
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,660
She doesn't want me
to get close to the Jiang family.

1021
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,100
And she doesn't want
the public to see me.

1022
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,550
If I let her hide me in the dark,

1023
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,470
it'll be pointless for me to return
to the Jiang family.

1024
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,700
And I'll always be the Second Lady Jiang
that's surrounded by hateful rumors.

1025
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,660
So, I have to attend
this coming-of-age ceremony.

1026
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,100
I want to let everyone
in the capital city knows

1027
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,300
that Jiang Li is the daughter
of the first wife of the Jiang family/
