as the chief strategist.

184
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,420
Tell me, what do you want?

185
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,820
When your troops enter the city,

186
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,370
please hand me the fish talisman.

187
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,180
I want

188
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,340
to kill Xiao Heng myself.

189
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,850
So you hate him too.

190
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,530
To the bone.

191
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,890
Scum!

192
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,980
Go ahead and curse me.

193
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,890
You have every right to do so.

194
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,010
After today,
please don't scold me anymore.

195
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,610
I will clean myself thoroughly.

196
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,820
Please don't despise me.

197
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,100
I will return everything to you.

198
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,890
Get some sleep.

199
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,700
Your Majesty, Lord Cheng, Consort Li,

200
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,610
and gentlemen.

201
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,940
The Music Bureau has composed

202
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,580
a new marching tune
to welcome Lord Cheng's return.

203
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,890
We invite Your Majesty and Lord Cheng
to appreciate it.

204
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,730
[Prosperous Era]

205
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,130
I didn't expect Your Majesty
to compose a new piece for me.

206
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,130
You've dedicated yourself to Great Yan
for so many years.

207
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,490
Your loyalty and bravery are exemplary
in the court.

208
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,130
I often tell the officials
to emulate you,

209
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,980
not only for your achievements,

210
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,610
but also for your loyalty to the court

211
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,100
and the people.

212
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,180
Only then can the people prosper.

213
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,250
Your Majesty, you are too kind.

214
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,820
A loyal heart is devoted
to a wise ruler.

215
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,060
As long as Your Majesty
remains benevolent,

216
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,580
blessing the people,

217
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,820
we will serve Your Majesty
wholeheartedly.

218
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,580
We shall work together.

219
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,180
May my benevolent heart last

220
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,300
and may you remain loyal and righteous.

221
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,940
[Hening Gate]

222
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,850
[Imperial Guard Office]

223
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,460
Tonight, you all will stay with me
outside the hall.

224
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,580
Don't let your guard down.

225
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,490
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

226
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,370
Xu Zhi?

227
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,250
Commander of the Imperial Guards,
Zhang Wei,

228
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,220
has been secretly trafficking weapons
to the north,

229
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,980
and plotting rebellion. Arrest him!

230
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,620
I had planned to keep you alive
for a few more days.

231
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,660
But I didn't expect you to be so eager

232
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,770
to die.

233
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:22,810
Take him.

234
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,290
You...

235
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,290
Xu Zhi,

236
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,220
Xu Zhi, I have long known

237
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,860
you were a spy placed
by General Xiao Senior.

238
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,700
The reason I didn't remove you earlier

239
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,050
was to make you believe

240
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,700
your plan was succeeding.

241
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,420
Zhang Wei,

242
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,660
do you realize this is treason?

243
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,090
You are just being short-sighted.

244
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,140
Once Lord Cheng ascends the throne,

245
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,090
I will be credited

246
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,090
as a main contributor
to his new dynasty.

247
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:56,770
Take him away.

248
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,900
You. Zhang Wei, you...

249
00:17:59,290 --> 00:17:59,730
Move it.

250
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,980
Everyone listen up!

251
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,460
As soon as Lord Cheng gives the signal,

252
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,490
attack immediately.

253
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,490
All of you better stay alert!

254
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,660
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

255
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,100
[Li's Residence]

256
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,530
You put on quite a show.

257
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,860
She's really dead.

258
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,090
Are you crazy?

259
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,620
The Eldest Princess realized
she was drugged.

260
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,380
She misunderstood my intentions

261
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,660
and killed herself in despair.

262
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,090
I couldn't stop or explain in time.

263
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,730
What am I supposed to do now?

264
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,050
Proceed with the original plan.

265
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,810
We can't jeopardize
Lord Cheng's great undertaking.

266
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,420
After it is done,
I will personally confess to him.

267
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,090
Let's go

268
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,530
to the palace.

269
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,900
Your Highness!

270
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,050
Your Highness!

271
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,900
Your Highness!

272
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,250
Do you have anything to say?

273
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,620
There's no way for you to turn back now.

274
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,900
Then wait for me to return.

275
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,050
Guard her well.

276
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,010
Yes.

277
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,250
Who dares hurt her?

278
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,330
General Xiao Senior.

279
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,050
Go and rescue Xiao Heng.

280
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,180
Shen Yurong took the fish talisman.

281
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,290
Tonight, the Longwu Army intends
to kill Xiao Heng.

282
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,330
I still have to save you first.

283
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,770
Move back! Unless you want
to get splattered with blood!

284
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,980
General Xiao Senior.

285
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:02,700
Young Master!

286
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,220
We meet again.

287
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,530
Lai Biao?

288
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,660
Biao, he's here.

289
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,250
Why are you alone?

290
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,860
Where is Xiao?

291
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,620
Duke Su went to Great Zhao

292
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,530
and left a message for you.

293
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,290
What?

294
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,730
Duke Su said the time has come.

295
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,700
You're just in time.

296
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,860
General, you should admit
you're getting old.

297
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,290
Leave the rest to us.

298
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,490
Take her with you.

299
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,620
All right.
I'll leave it to you young people.

300
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,530
All right.

301
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:47,940
Attack!

302
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,940
Attack!

303
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,730
They've already started.

304
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,050
Quickly, bring the emperor out.

305
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,050
I'll cover the rear.

306
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:14,620
Your Majesty.

307
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,010
I've had a bit too much to drink
and need to go to the restroom.

308
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,090
Your Majesty, where are you going?

309
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,570
Don't tell me you won't come back here.

310
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,140
The performance is reaching its climax.

311
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,620
Why wouldn't I come back?

312
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,460
How about I go with you
after the song finishes?

313
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,420
Lord Cheng, I'm still here.

314
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,290
How could His Majesty not come back?

315
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,220
Come, Lord Cheng.

316
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,860
Let me toast to you.

317
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,290
Your Majesty.

318
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,460
Your Majesty.

319
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,810
There are people who will receive you
at the west palace gate.

320
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:28,900
Lu Ji will escort you.

321
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,220
You're not coming with me?

322
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,810
Lord Cheng is still inside.
I'll cover the rear.

323
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,700
Tomorrow, I want to see you alive.

324
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,050
I shall follow your orders.

325
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,180
Your Highness!

326
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,330
Your Highness!

327
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,660
Your Highness!

328
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,900
Your Highness!

329
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,570
The Eldest Princess has been killed.

330
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,180
- The Eldest Princess?
- What?

331
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,380
Who did this?

332
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,620
- Why did that person kill her?
- That's right.

333
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,860
What is going on?

334
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,900
Emperor Zhao Ye killed her.

335
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,770
The Eldest Princess was killed
by the emperor!

336
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,010
Why would the emperor kill
the Eldest Princess?

337
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,570
That's right.

338
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,140
How could the emperor be behind this?

339
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,010
His Majesty said,
your merits overshadow him,

340
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,860
and he couldn't let you leave
the capital alive.

341
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,050
He had his secret guards capture

342
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,250
the Eldest Princess as a hostage.

343
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,620
The Eldest Princess died from resisting.

344
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,250
I fought desperately

345
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:31,570
to bring her here to seek justice.

346
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,250
No!

347
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,010
Wanning...

348
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,860
Emperor Zhao Ye harmed his own kin,

349
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,330
disregarding benevolence
and righteousness,

350
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,380
violating the natural order.

351
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,050
[Prosperous Era]

352
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:54,050
I ask everyone here to witness this.

353
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,490
It is Zhao Ye who cannot tolerate me.

354
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,140
For years, I have led the soldiers
in bloody battles,

355
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,900
asking for no reward,
only to protect the land.

356
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,980
But in return, I get Zhao Ye's suspicion

357
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,460
and siege.

358
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,010
Today,

359
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,050
he brutally killed my sister.

360
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,860
Nonsense!

361
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,810
How could a country's
Eldest Princess die accidentally,

362
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,090
and you fabricate such lies?

363
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,730
The Court of Judicial Review
should investigate to find out the truth.

364
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,380
She is right.

365
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,980
Yes, we should find out the truth
before making any conclusions.

366
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,380
You knew long ago

367
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,730
that Zhao Ye wanted
to kill the Eldest Princess, didn't you?

368
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,730
You are an accomplice.

Seize this vile person.

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,900
Zhao Sheng, are you rebelling?

373
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,220
Let go of me!

374
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,330
Let go!

377
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,700
Today,

378
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,010
I will act on behalf of Heaven
to seek justice

379

and the fallen soldiers

380

381

If anyone has any objections, speak now.

382
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,940
If you remain silent now
but dissent later,

383
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,980
I will have you executed without mercy!

384
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,770
You claim to act on behalf of heaven.

385
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,700
But in reality, you are coveting power

386
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,330
and plotting rebellion right here.

387
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,380

Kid,

404
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,050
your weapon is quite delicate.

405
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,570
It suffices.

406
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,810
Such treachery.

407
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,660
After all, my father had experienced

408
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,810
your treachery firsthand.

409
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,730
I dare not

410
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,180
to be careless.

411
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,810
This is the sword your father once used.

412
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,980
It is a fine sword.

413
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,770
He and I once fought together,
side by side, against our enemies.

414
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,460
He taught me martial arts
with this sword

415
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,490
and saved me on the battlefield with it.

416
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,010
Speaking of him, I miss him dearly.

417
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,810
If you truly miss him,

418
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,330
why don't you tell me

419
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,490
how you framed my father
eight years ago?

420
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,420
My father never guarded against you
and trusted you completely.

421
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,810
Yet, you plotted against him
and betrayed him.

422
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,010
I saw him as a brother

423
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,730
and respected him as my master.

424
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,700
If he did not stand in my way back then,

425
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,980
I would be sitting on the throne

Do you have a bow and arrow?

550

Bow and arrow?

Xiao Heng!

554
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,090
I've been looking for you.

555
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,900
You are actually bold enough
to come here.

556
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:13,500
Release the arrows!

557
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,380
After him!

558
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,170
Longwu Army, kill Xiao Heng!

559
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,530
- Attack!
- Attack!

560
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,730
Back away!

561

Xiao Heng, I didn't want to kill you.

But Li has feelings for you.

564
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,420
Because of you,
she doesn't want to look at me.

565
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,020
Even if I gave her my heart,

566
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,340
she wouldn't want it.

567

When you buried her
on Qingcheng Mountain,

568
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,650
didn't you think this day would come?

00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,610
Shut up!

570
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,210
Mr. Shen,

571
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,900
how afraid are you to face the past?

572
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,900
Xiao Heng, you're at death's door.

573
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,170
Yet, you are still so arrogant!

574
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,900
Li said you were shallow.

575
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,610
I can see that's true.

576
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,300
You have no right to call her that!

577
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,860
You're at the end of the road.

578
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,860
After today, you'll never see her again.

579
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,610
Xiao Heng, no one can save you now.

580
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:18,940
It does not matter.
