What's wrong, Mr. Qin?

188
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,600
Staying here for the past few days,

189
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,550
your accounts are showing no income.

190
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,670
Are your businesses about to collapse?

191
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,150
No...

192
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,030
I can catch every single one
of your private salt traffickers.

193
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,750
After hitting them,

194
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,270
someone will get scared
and tell the truth.

195
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,670
However, I don't want
to waste that effort.

196
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,120
Mr. Qin,

197
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,550
if you're willing
to save me the trouble,

198
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,600
I promise you

199
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:50,960
I'll return

200
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,030
your money.

201
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,030
I'll set you free too. How about it?

202
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,550
It seems you're not willing
to help me with this.

203
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,790
Then forget it.

204
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,030
I won't bother asking anymore.

205
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
You can just wait

206
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,360
for your last meal.

207
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,360
Wenji,

208
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,320
lock his shackles.

209
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,360
It's troublesome to open them.

210
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,510
Wait.

211
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,150
The money from the salt trafficking,

212
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,910
I split it fifty-fifty with Yang Song

213
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,270
from the Bureau of Salt and Iron.

214
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,390
Are you really going to let him go?

215
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,120
What if he's lying?

216
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,960
If he's lying, he wouldn't dare
implicate the Bureau of Salt and Iron.

217
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,840
The secret guard reports.

218
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,080
Yang Song has gone to the local office

219
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,840
of the Bureau of Salt and Iron

220
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
and is on his way back.

221
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,960
Keep a close watch.

222
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,510
As soon as he returns,
arrest him immediately.

223
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,390
Yes.

224
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,390
Tomorrow, I'll take a day off

225
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,030
to listen to Taohong's opera.

226
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,630
My Lord,

227
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,240
Taohong's troupe
won't be performing tomorrow.

228
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,320
Why?

229
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,200
It's the coming-of-age ceremony
of the third lady of the Jiang family.

230
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,080
Ji Yanlin invited
Taohong's troupe to perform.

231
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,670
I didn't tell you earlier

232
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,550
because you've been with Mr. Qin.

233
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,550
Is Shen Yurong on the guest list?

234
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,120
That will be
more interesting than the opera.

235
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,660
[Jiang's Residence]

236
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,600
Master Jiang.

237
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,320
Tell her

238
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,390
to hurry up and get dressed.

239
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
If she can make it, fine.

240
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,720
If not, she shouldn't come out.

241
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,480
All right.

242
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,390
Madam Li.

243
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,270
Isn't this Taohong,
the famous actress from the capital?

244
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,080
Yes.

245
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,000
Her performances are very hard to get.

246
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,630
[Taohong]
We're in for a treat today.

247
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,360
Master Sun.

248
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,080
Master Liu.

249
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,630
Please.

250
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,840
Mr. Jiang,
it is an honor to be here today

251
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,120
to celebrate
the third lady's coming-of-age ceremony.

252
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,960
Thank you.

253
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,440
Mr. Jiang.

254
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Mrs. Jiang.

255
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,390
[Marquis of Ningyuan]
We're late.

256
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
You personally present this gift.

257
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,960
My daughter will surely be delighted.

258
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,550
I already have
a marriage agreement with Ruoyao.

259
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,080
Today is her coming-of-age ceremony.

260
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,720
[Marquis of Ningyuan's wife]
I must bring a gift.

261
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,270
Please.

262
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,030
Madam Ji, is today...

263
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,510
So many of you are here.

264
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,510
Mr. Jiang.

265
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,390
Mrs. Jiang.

266
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,360
Wait.

267
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,840
Where is the Second Lady?

268
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,720
I brought her a gift.

269
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,360
Mrs. Liu,

270
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,360
I will accept it on Li's behalf.

271
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,270
No need.

272
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,600
I want to give it to her personally.

273
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,320
She has suffered in the past

274
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,440
and is still a bit scared.

275
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,550
I'm worried today's event
might overwhelm her,

276
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,790
so I let her rest.

277
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,150
Second Lady Jiang hasn't been back
in the capital for a long time.

278
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,080
She must have forgotten
the rules she learned.

279
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,120
She was difficult
to discipline as a child.

280
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,870
Mrs. Jiang must have had a hard time.

281
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,910
Indeed.

282
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,240
Someone was teaching her initially,

283
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,360
but later,

284
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,150
she was abandoned
in Zhennv Hall for more than ten years.

285
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,030
Forget about etiquette,

286
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,360
it's a miracle she's alive and back.

287
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,870
Right?

288
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,550
She should be punished
for forgetting the rules,

289
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,240
but what about those who forgot her?

290
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,720
What about them?

291
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,550
No parent

292
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,150
wants to see their child suffer.

293
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
When I lost my child,

294
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,440
I was heartbroken too.

295
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,000
I let my husband handle it,

296
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,000
and when I realized it,

297
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,270
my heart ached terribly.

298
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,150
Mrs. Liu, rest assured.

299
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,630
Now that Li is back,

300
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,510
I will certainly make it up to her.

301
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,680
You're

302
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,750
too kind-hearted.

303
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,030
Mrs. Liu.

304
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,880
Jiang Li's suffering in Zhennv Hall

305
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,240
wasn't anyone's intention.

306
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,480
However, don't forget

307
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,480
why she ended up there.

308
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,590
If it weren't for...

309
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,440
Today is Yao's coming-of-age ceremony,

310
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,310
let's not bring up the past.

311
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,640
Mrs. Liu.

312
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,310
Mrs. Liu, this way.

313
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,880
Mrs. Liu.

314
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Everyone's here.

315
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,200
Madam Wang.

316
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,790
Mrs. Liu, we've been waiting for you.

317
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,160
Tong.

318
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,070
Tong!

319
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,160
Oh no.

320
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,510
Tong.

321
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,030
Tong.

322
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,880
Tong.

323
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,310
Wake up!

324
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,070
Miss, I dreamt that someone
was pinching my face.

325
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,030
Wake up.

326
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,030
Miss, why are you up so early?

327
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
It's not early,

328
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,790
we overslept.

329
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,590
Overslept?

330
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,510
The coming-of-age ceremony
has already started.

331
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,440
We couldn't have
both overslept together.

332
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,440
Someone must have tampered with us.

333
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,720
Miss,

334
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,550
didn't we already
avoid everything yesterday?

335
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,070
I was careless.

336
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,240
The beauty soup was just a diversion.

337
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,440
Never mind that now.

338
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,200
Quick.

339
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,790
Get dressed.

340
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:10,830
Yes.

341
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,640
Yuanbai.

342
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,270
Congratulations.

343
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,270
Father-in-law.

344
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,830
This is a gift from Concubine Li.

345
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,750
[Ji Yanlin]
It's a reward from the Emperor.

346
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,110
I couldn't refuse,

347
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,480
so I brought it here.

348
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,550
You know,

349
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,310
although she became a concubine,

350
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,400
she's still the youngest in our family

351
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
and very close to us.

352
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,310
Concubine Li is also concerned

353
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,550
about Ruoyao's coming-of-age ceremony.

354
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,270
Father-in-law, you and Concubine Li
are very thoughtful.

355
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,240
Her gift is too precious.

356
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,590
We cannot accept it.

357
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,240
We're all family.

358
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,720
Shuran.

359
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,240
Take it.

360
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,750
- Take it.
- Yes, father.

361
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,240
I am getting old.

362
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,720
The family's honor
and disgrace are shared.

363
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,720
You've met Shuran's cousin, right?

364
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,480
Think about it,

365
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,920
and maybe mention it to the Emperor.

366
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,110
Father,

367
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,830
why do you bring this up again?

368
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,680
Appointing people based on kinship

369
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,830
doesn't sound good.

370
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,000
The Emperor follows the law and justice.

371
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,000
It's not something my husband
can decide with a few words.

372
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,110
I understand.

373
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,640
Today is
Ruoyao's coming-of-age ceremony,

374
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,590
not a good time to discuss this.

375
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,030
We can talk about it another day.

376
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,830
Fine.

377
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,790
As you say, Yuanbai.

378
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,310
I'll go in first then.

379
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,750
Master Ji, please.

380
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,400
Mr. Jiang.

381
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,160
Mrs. Jiang.

382
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,590
Mr. Shen, that's so nice of you.

383
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,350
I was saying

384
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,350
Mr. Shen should visit often

385
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,720
to guide Ruoyao.

386
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,750
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

387
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,680
As expected of the Prime Minister,

388
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,240
his residence
is much more grand than ours.

389
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,640
Don't be fooled
by their plain appearances.

390
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,880
I hear that everyone present

391
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,070
has a rank of at least the third grade.

392
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,000
If you fancy someone,
let your brother know.

393
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,070
Mother.

394
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,160
None of them are young.

395
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,680
Old ones are affectionate.

396
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:48,830
Give it to me.

397
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,030
This is outrageous!

398
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,480
They even sent people to guard us.

399
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,240
I'm going to cause a scene.

400
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,000
If you cause a scene now,
the whole city will laugh at us.

401
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,920
If Jiang's family's reputation
is ruined, you'll be affected too.

402
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,400
This Ji Shuran is truly ruthless.

403
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,510
What should we do now?

404
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,070
I hope the big gift I sent yesterday

405
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,480
wasn't in vain.

406
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,110
Jiang Yuanbai is so cunning.

407
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,640
Even if he married you,

408
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,830
he remains indifferent

409
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,270
to the Ji family's matters.

410
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,200
You are also so incompetent.

411
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,030
You married into the Jiang family

412
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,400
but don't know
how to scheme for your family.

413
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,880
Was he the one you wanted me
to marry back then?

414
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,640
Now you see

415
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,680
someone else rising smoothly

416
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,270
and you want to exploit them.

417
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,160
Don't speak so harshly.

418
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,030
Remember,

419
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,750
you're part of the Ji family,

420
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,070
so you must always think
for our family's benefit.

421
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,920
- Duke Su.
- Duke Su.

422
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,830
Why is he here?

423
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,270
Why is Duke Su here?

424
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,030
It's not a friendly visit.

425
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,640
He comes with a blade.

426
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,640
Something big must be happening.

427
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,790
Duke Su, are you here
on official business?

428
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,400
You're joking, Mr. Jiang.

429
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,920
There's no official business today.

430
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,110
Master Ji has a lot of influence,

431
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,270
even Xiao Taohong canceled
my reserved performance to come here.

432
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,750
I had to follow her here

433
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
to join the excitement.

434
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,510
Mr. Jiang, you don't mind, do you?

435
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
In that case,

436
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,640
Duke Su, please.

437
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,350
Where is Second Lady Jiang?

438
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,960
Duke Su.

439
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,030
Li is feeling unwell today

440
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,240
and resting in her room.

441
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,350
Mr. Jiang.

442
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,960
I gave half my ceremonial gifts
to Second Lady Jiang.

443
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,680
Out of courtesy,

444
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,240
she should come out today to thank me.

445
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,510
Indeed, it is disrespectful.

446
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,960
In that case,

447
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,960
I'll send someone to ask her again.

448
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Duke Su.

449
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,160
Please.

450
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,880
Investigate.

451
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,750
Yes.

452
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,400
Ruoyao reaches her coming-of-age,

453
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,640
and many worthy scholars
offer their praise.

454
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,790
The azure bird flies not alone,

455
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,680
for she has found someone
to hold her hand.

456
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,480
Third Lady Jiang and Mr. Zhou
make a wonderful couple.

457
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,640
Today is
Ruoyao's coming-of-age ceremony.

458
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,790
Thank you all for coming.

459
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,880
Where have you been?

460
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,480
I had a stomach ache.

461
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,680
Where's my father?

462
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,680
We have beauties in the Jiang residence,

463
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,920
as unique as they are graceful.

464
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,880
Like a lotus emerging from clear water,

465
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,920
naturally adorned.

466
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,830
Her hands are delicate,

467
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,310
her skin as smooth as cream.

468
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,240
We found her.

469
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,480
There are two people guarding the door.

470
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,510
She probably can't come out.

471
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,160
I knew she was not one to avoid crowds.

472
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,310
Apparently, she is locked up.

473
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,880
Do you want me to go?

474
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,720
No need.

475
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,440
The Jiang family
is full of mixed characters

476
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,070
but she insists on returning.

477
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,030
Now we can see

478
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,880
how much she wants to show herself.

479
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,440
The auspicious time has come.

480
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,240
The coming-of-age ceremony begins.

481
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,590
My dear.

482
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,790
Honoree, be in position.

483
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,240
A talented man and a beautiful woman,

484
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,070
what a perfect match!

485
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,880
A talented scholar

486
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,680
and a beautiful lady.

487
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,070
A match made in heaven,

488
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,270
a pair destined on earth.

489
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,030
Next, Mrs. Jiang will dress the honoree

490
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,240
and place the ceremonial hairpin.

491
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,790
On this auspicious month and day,

492
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,550
you begin
to wear your first adult attire.

493
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,200
Leave behind your childish pursuits,

494
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,270
and follow the path of virtue.

495
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,830
May you enjoy long life
and good fortune,

496
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,960
and receive abundant blessings.

497
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
The ceremony is complete.

498
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,350
Thank you.

499
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,440
Wonderful!

500
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,160
Nice!

501
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,400
Marquis of Ningyuan's wife
is truly fortunate

502
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,790
to have gained

503
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,110
such a talented
and graceful daughter-in-law.

504
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,480
It's my fortune.

505
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,160
It is my good fortune to be connected

506
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,000
to Ruoyao through marriage.

507
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,550
Fireworks!

508
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,350
Um...

509
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,240
- Where are the fireworks?
- Where?

510
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,750
What happened?

511
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,830
Where are the fireworks?

512
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,070
- There's none.
- No fireworks.

513
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,640
Did they save the money for fireworks?

514
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,350
Where are the fireworks?

515
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,480
The fire... Fireworks...

516
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,510
My Lord!

517
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,750
The fireworks...

518
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,960
They...

519
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,680
They misfired.

520
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,960
Misfired?

521
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,070
Misfired?

522
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,480
You, quickly go solve this!

523
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,350
Such beautiful flowers!

524
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,110
Isn't this beautiful?

525
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,270
Who is that? So elegant and refined.

526
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,830
Isn't she

527
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,590
Second Lady Jiang
who just returned from Zhennv Hall?

528
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,640
Oh, so she's the one

529
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,680
who killed her mother and brother.

530
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,160
So is this Second Lady Jiang?

531
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,720
Yes, it's her.

532
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,550
Mother.

533
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,000
A ghost!

534
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,110
Mother.

535
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
It's Xue Fangfei.

536
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,640
It's her.

537
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,270
Mother, it's her!

538
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,590
Mother.

539
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,920
She's back to claim her life.

540
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,350
Shut up!

541
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,510
Ruoyao.

542
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,510
Here's a small gift

543
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,200
to congratulate you
on your coming-of-age ceremony.

544
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,440
Li, you finally made it.

545
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,030
Why are you so late?

546
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,200
I'm not yet familiar
with the house's layout,

547
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,350
so I was delayed a bit.

548
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,310
Fortunately,

549
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,400
I made it in time for Ruoyao's ceremony.

550
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,640
Allow me to introduce her,

551
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,030
this is my second daughter
who has just returned.

552
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,160
She's Jiang Li.

553
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,830
Mr. Jiang has acknowledged
this daughter.

554
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,240
Let's not mention
the allegations of murder anymore.

555
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,750
Mother.

556
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,440
Mother, isn't that Fangfei,
my sister-in-law?

557
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,550
How can there be

558
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,400
someone so identical in the world?

559
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,440
Indeed, she truly embodies the grace
of the Prime Minister's family.

560
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,310
Despite being away for many years,

561
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,310
her every move

562
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,880
is still elegant and dignified.

563
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,880
Mr. Jiang is truly fortunate.

564
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,270
Mrs. Liu, you flatter us.

565
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,880
No parent

566
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
is without concern for their children.

567
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,030
I know

568
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,000
that my father
has been very worried about me,

569
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
which is why he brought me back.

570
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,400
Seeing Second Lady Jiang today

571
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,590
fills my heart with sorrow.

572
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,030
During all these years
when you were away,

573
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,070
I never saw you
have a coming-of-age ceremony.

574
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,310
Who dressed your hair back then?

575
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,030
In the humble conditions
of Qingcheng Mountain,

576
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,440
I never had a coming-of-age ceremony.

577
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,830
So, Mrs. Jiang didn't attend

578
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,920
Li's ceremony back then?

579
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,590
Not even once in ten years?

580
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,880
How pitiful!

581
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,240
Being the Prime Minister's daughter,

582
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,440
she didn't even have a proper ceremony.

583
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,270
This is inexcusable.

584
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,160
Mrs. Jiang shouldn't have done that.

585
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,750
Mother has been busy
with household matters.

586
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,830
If she had overworked herself for me,

587
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,640
I would have felt guilty.

588
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,790
Today is not too late.

589
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,240
You're not yet twenty.

590
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:50,790
Here.

591
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,720
A hairpin

592
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,510
is the symbol of this ceremony.

593
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,510
According to the sayings,

594
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,920
a hairpin symbolizes adulthood.

595
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,200
Today,

596
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,880
I'll give it to you.

597
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,440
Let it be a token

598
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,920
to make up for the ceremony you missed.

599
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,200
Come.

600
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,000
I'll put it on your hair.

601
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,320
Mrs. Liu, thank you for your kindness,

602
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,800
but with my mother present,

603
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,960
I cannot accept your gift.

604
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,710
Oh, how silly of me.

605
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,550
Mrs. Jiang is still alive.

606
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,840
Come, Mrs. Jiang.

607
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,230
You should be the one

608
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
giving her the hairpin.

609
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,320
Li.

610
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,590
I will adorn your hair.

611
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,360
Thank you, mother.

612
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,480
I beg you to take this

613
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,840
to my father.

614
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,670
Tell him

615
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,590
I am here suffering greatly,
filled with resentment.

616
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,480
However, I am not wrong,

617
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,880
I have never been wrong.

618
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,190
I hate him.

619
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
I hate every single person
in the Jiang family.

620
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,550
Even in the afterlife,

621
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,630
I will curse every one of them
to meet a grim end.

622
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,230
- Jiang Li!
- Jiang Li!

623
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,360
Mr. Jiang, you are truly blessed.

624
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,230
Your eldest daughter carries herself
with extraordinary grace!

625
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,000
Mr. Jiang,

626
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,480
your daughter is so remarkable she
makes one forget the mundane world!

627
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,550
Mr. Jiang,

628
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,110
it is a great fortune

629
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,670
to meet your eldest daughter today!

630
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,920
Such elegance

631
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,480
is rarely seen!

632
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,190
Azure robes frame her body,

633
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,190
green gauze highlights her snowy skin.

634
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,320
She is naturally charming and graceful!

635
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,190
Jiang Li! Jiang Li!

636
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,880
- Third Lady!
- My Lady!

640
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,440
- Ruoyao, are you all right?
- Third Lady!

641
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,670
- What's wrong?
- Ruoyao!

642
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,400
What's going on?

643
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,150
Get someone to check on her.

644
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,280
My Lady, are you all right?

645
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,030
Ruoyao!

646
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,030
Third Lady, wake up!

647
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,550
- Ruoyao!
- Third Lady, are you all right?

648
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,880
- My Lady!
- Ruoyao!

649
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,880
Li, did you see that?

650
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,510
This is my gift to you
for your coming-of-age ceremony.

Aunt Liu, thank you so much for today.

667
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,960
No need for thanks between us.

668
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,360
If you need anything in the future,
just let me know.

669
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,400
All right.

670
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,920
I will leave now.

671
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,360
How did you let the Liu family
corner you like this?

672
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
Father, why did you ask me?

673
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,800
I should ask you,

674
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,280
when will our grievances
with the Liu family ever end?

675
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,400
At my daughter's coming-of-age ceremony,

676
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,030
I was forced to bless Jiang Li instead.

677
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,320
All right.

678
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,190
It's just a coming-of-age ceremony.

679
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,280
I noticed Duke Su

680
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,630
kept looking at Jiang Li.

681
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,920
Do you know when she got involved

682
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,840
with the Duke's household?

683
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,150
Father, have you forgotten

684
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,110
Duke Su's half-ceremonial gift?

685
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,030
This Jiang Li must not be kept around.

687
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,150
Second Lady Jiang.

688
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,190
We meet again.

689
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,280
You may have forgotten,

690
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,480
but last time we met at your doorstep.

691
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,670
You...

692
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,070
I didn't expect you to be Jiang Li.

693
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,760
You have grown even more beautiful

694
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,440
since our engagement when we were young.

695
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,510
Mr. Zhou.

696
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,630
Oh.

697
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,670
Here's a small gift from me.

698
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,190
I want to give it to you

699
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,480
to make up for the lost time.

700
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,230
Mr. Zhou.

701
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,880
The engagement has already been changed
to my third sister.

702
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,630
I should not accept your gift.

703
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,800
Please give it to the rightful person.

704
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,110
Mr. Zhou.

705
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,400
Please.

706
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,670
Why does Jiang Li

707
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,000
look so much like Xue Fangfei?

708
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,280
Yurong,

709
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,590
has she returned from the dead?

710
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,280
Shut up.

711
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,480
During today's ceremony,

712
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,480
the Jiang family clearly confirmed

713
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,550
that she is their daughter.

714
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,880
So, she's the Prime Minister's daughter.

715
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,110
The resemblance is just a coincidence.

716
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,190
Be careful with your words,

717
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,510
or you'll get in trouble.

718
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,880

Second Lady Jiang.

723
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,000
What are you looking at?

724
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,360
I thought I would miss this drama,

725
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,630
but I didn't expect you

726
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,590
to handle it so well,

727
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,630
forcing everyone into a corner.

728
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,710
As for your cousin,

729
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,710
he's a master of misdirection.

730
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,400
You're done for.

731
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,110
It hurts so much!

732
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,440
Why did you hit me?

733
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,480
It hurts!

00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,630
It was you!

736
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,920
Don't go!

737
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,280
How could you hit me and leave?

738
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,230
- You can't escape.
- Come down!

739
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,960
- Let go of me, come down!
- How dare you hit me!

740
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,800
Let go!

741
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,480
Don't leave!

742
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,000
Why did you come to the Jiang family?

743
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,880
Duke Su, I don't understand
what you are asking.

744
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,630
I thought the Jiang family had a proper

745
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,920
and warm household.

746
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,030
You covet their warmth so much

747
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,030
that you even schemed

748
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:53,880
against me to return.

749
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,440
However, now I see

750
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,320
your position in the Jiang family
isn't so great after all.

751
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,280
The Jiang family is my home.

752
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,920
Of course, I want to come back.

753
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,630
Duke Su,
you are meddling a bit too much.

754
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,360
If I hadn't meddled,

755
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,360
could you have returned?

756
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,480
Tell me,

757
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,480
how will you repay me?

758
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,280
Duke Su, thank you
for bringing me back to the capital.

759
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,480
However,

760
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,110
I also helped you resolve
the Qingcheng Mountain case.

761
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,960
I think I repaid you.

762
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,760
We are even now.

763
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,070
In the future,
I won't hold you accountable

764
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,000
for wronging me.

765
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,960
Let's not pursue

766
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,550
any further grievances.

767
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,510
Now you reminded me.

768
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:45,920
No one

769
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,110
has ever called me brainless before.

770
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,670
Jiang Li.

771
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:54,070
How will we settle that score?

772
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,840
Then scold me back.

773
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,840
If you don't,

774
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,190
let's consider the matter closed.

775
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,000
I'll leave now.

776
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,630
Xue Fangfei!

777
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,030
Second Lady, something happened.

778
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,150
