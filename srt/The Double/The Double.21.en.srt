00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,390
I don't want you to die.

187
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,360
Magistrate Xue was framed.

188
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,480
Please judge fairly.

189
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
I see.

190
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,270
I will arrest every single person
who comes here today.

191
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,200
Arrest them!

192
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:42,870
Wait!

193
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,550
Arrest us too!

194
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,790
Yes, arrest us too.

195
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,870
- Arrest all of us!
- Dai Yun.

196
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,200
I'm sorry.

197
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,390
I was too cowardly yesterday.

198
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,320
Mother, why aren't we saving Uncle Xue?

199
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,910
We're not powerful.

200
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,630
But Uncle Xue helped you deal
with those bad men

201
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,320
and bought candied haws for me.

202
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,870
If you're not going, I'll go.

203
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,910
Wait.

204
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,080
Ping'an, what if they take you away

205
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,840
when you go and save Uncle Xue?

206
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,840
I'm not scared.

207
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,150
Mother, don't be scared too.

208
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,080
I live in Unit Fifteen

209
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,910
of Qingshi Lane. My name is Dai Yun.

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,870
I can also testify

211
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,790
Magistrate Xue didn't commit corruption.

212
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,320
It was Feng Yutang

213
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,750
who withheld food
and mistreated the people.

214
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,670
You all

215
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,600
won't listen, right?

216
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,480
Today, I'll arrest those
who come one by one.

217
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,120
If you come in pairs,
I'll arrest you the same!

218
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,120
Don't forget me!

219
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Mother, come.

220
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,480
I am Mo Wenxuan,
living in Unit Three of Qingshi Lane.

221
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,390
The corruption charge
against Magistrate Xue is unjust.

222
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm willing to write a petition
and seek justice for him.

223
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,600
Seek justice for him!

224
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,360
- Yes, seek justice for Magistrate Xue!
- Seek justice for Magistrate Xue!

225
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:18,960
- Seek justice for Magistrate Xue!
- Seek justice for Magistrate Xue!

226
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
You all won't listen, right?

227
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,550
Sir, we have lived in Huaixiang
for generations.

228
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,080
Sir, we want to seek justice
for Magistrate Xue.

229
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,750
Please allow Second Lady Jiang to pass!

230
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,390
- Allow Second Lady Jiang to pass!
- Allow Second Lady Jiang to pass!

231
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,150
Second Lady Jiang,

232
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,960
don't say I didn't warn you!

233
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,870
If you can't overturn the case,

234
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,390
the Court of Judicial Review will reject it
after all three offices review it

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,480
and you will also face death!

236
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,550
Let's go!

237
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,840
- Let her pass!
- Let her pass!

238
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,140
- Let her pass!
- Let her pass!

239
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,030
I really don't know what to say.

240
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,750
You don't need to say anything.

241
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,720
You've already done too much.

242
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,270
We can't just watch you send yourself

243
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,870
to the Court of Judicial Review.

244
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,150
You are a noble and dignified person.

245
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,390
We want you to remain clean,

246
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,630
innocent, safe and sound.

247
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,550
Clean, innocent,

248
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,790
safe, and sound.

249
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,200
My Lady, rest assured.

250
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,750
We will do anything

251
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,750
to overturn Magistrate Xue's case.

252
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,080
Reverse Magistrate Xue's verdict!

253
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,120
- Reverse Magistrate Xue's verdict!
- Reverse Magistrate Xue's verdict!

254
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:58,150
- Reverse Magistrate Xue's verdict!
- Reverse Magistrate Xue's verdict!

255
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,960
My Lord,

256
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,080
aren't you going to see her off?

257
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,870
Since her task is done,

258
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,870
there's no need for me to go.

259
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,960
I have something to say.

260
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Second Lady Jiang,

261
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,150
she is awesome.

262
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,320
Do you want
to have a taste of 11 beatings?

263
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,790
I'm afraid it's not going
to be this easy.

264
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,360
Some people

265
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,480
won't let her easily take

266
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,960
the villagers back to the capital.

267
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,840
Should we escort her all the way?

268
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,360
This is beyond

269
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
what we can solve alone.

270
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,840
There are things
that we can't solve alone?

271
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,480
Lu Ji, prepare paper and ink for me.

272
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,600
I need to write two secret letters.

273
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,080
Yes, My Lord.

274
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,940
[Ye's Residence]

275
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,440
The details of the Huaixiang incident
are complex and lengthy.

276
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,080
Father must have heard and worried
about it for a long time.

277
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,960
Please present this letter to my father

278
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,200
and tell him Third Uncle is with me,
keeping me safe.

279
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,750
[Jiang Li]
Please do not worry.

280
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,960
Young Master, a secret letter
from Huaixiang.

281
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,270
Just leave it there for now.

282
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,030
Yes, Young Master.

283
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,510
Twenty-three villagers
from Huaixiang voluntarily stood up

284
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,720
for former Magistrate Xue Huaiyuan.

285
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,720
Their resolve is firm and remarkable.

286
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,550
I couldn't bear to see it
and took the initiative to get involved.

287
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,480
Everything is currently fine.
Father, please don't worry.

288
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,320
Outrageous!

289
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,840
Since ancient times, when commoners tried
to overturn the corrupt official's verdict,

290
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,840
it's like accusing the authorities
and challenging those in power.

291
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,200
How many times has this ended
in a futile and bloody affair?

292
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,510
She has no idea
how serious the situation is.

293
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,360
Grand Chancellor Jiang,

294
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,270
I was worried when I heard the news
in the capital.

295
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,240
But fortunately, Third Uncle has been
with Li along the way.

296
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,670
Third Uncle wrote to me,

297
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,480
praising her bravery and wisdom.

298
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,150
The people of Huaixiang
are all cheering for her

299
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,240
and the Jiang family.

300
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,320
Official Ye,

301
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,320
you're still young

302
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,080
and perhaps unaware
of the gravity of this situation.

303
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,750
Every cheer for the Jiang family

304
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,360
from the people

305
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,480
is like a slap
to the Minister of Justice.

306
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,360
It's like putting my husband
into trouble.

307
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,320
Li's actions are sure worrisome.

308
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,080
She didn't even inform

309
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
her parents beforehand.

310
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,670
My dear,

311
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,870
you're worrying for nothing.

312
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,960
This isn't the first time
she has acted recklessly.

313
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,550
She acts without regard to her parents.

314
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,150
She even dares to obstruct the officials
from the Minister of Justice

315
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,510
and has the nerve
to break out a prisoner.

316
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,870
Just wait and see.

317
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,870
Scheming individuals in the capital

318
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,790
could easily frame the Jiang family

319
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,510
for treason.

320
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,600
We should send a letter to Li now.

321
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,630
It's already too late.
Her letter has arrived.

322
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,080
News of her actions has spread
over the court.

323
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,790
I'm afraid the emperor will inquire
about it soon.

324
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,750
Do you have a plan to deal with this?

325
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,480
Madam Sun!

326
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,200
Yes.

327
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,240
Send someone
to bring Jiang Li back immediately.

328
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,030
Grand Chancellor Jiang,

329
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,960
Jiang Li is leading the people
to seek justice.

330
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,270
If you bring her back by force,

331
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,550
it will be hard
to explain it to the people.

332
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm heading south
for the disaster relief work.

333
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,600
If you trust me,

334
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,320
please allow me

335
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,870
to reason and persuade her.

336
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,200
I believe I can persuade her to return.

337
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,600
Shijie, this is a serious matter.

338
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
You are peers and also siblings.

339
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,550
You must advise Jiang Li not
to act rashly anymore.

340
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,030
Your words worry me, my dear.

341
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,440
Can he be able to persuade Li to return?

342
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,150
Will the Jiang family be in danger?

343
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,320
We can only wait and see.

344
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,080
I hope this girl

345
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,960
doesn't return
to the capital anytime soon.

346
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,440
If she does return,

347
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,320
something big is going to happen.

348
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,600
Ye!

349
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,630
Why are you ignoring me?

350
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,790
I'm thinking about Jiang Li.

351
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,750
Ye, take me with you.

352
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,600
If we work together,
we can overcome anything.

353
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,790
Ye,

354
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,360
take this for the road.

355
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:57,910
If you're bored,

356
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,480
go back to your turtle.

357
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,750
I'm going for relief work,
an official duty.

358
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,080
Don't cause trouble.

359
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,640
Ye, taking me won't hurt.

360
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,030
I can also give you a hand.

361
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,830
No.

362
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,350
Come on, take me with you.

363
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,510
If you don't bring me,
I'm not letting you leave.

364
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,640
I don't have time to fool around.
Get off my back now.

365
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,240
No.

366
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,240
You're not getting down?

367
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,830
No, I'm not.

368
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,790
Fine.

369
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:21,960
What are you doing?

370
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,830
Are you playing games with me?

371
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,000
I just miss my sister a lot.

372
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,640
How could you be so heartless?

373
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,310
Can you really stand

374
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,440
to see me cry every day?

375
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,440
Fine! Since you're so heartless,
don't blame me for being the same.

376
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,550
Everyone, come and see!

377
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,830
Ye Shijie

378
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,790
is an ungrateful and heartless man.

379
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,590
He turns his back on me

380
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,680
and is ungrateful!

381
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,960
Jiang Jingrui, are you sick?

382
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,830
Ye, you finally realize I'm sick?

383
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,400
My illness has seeped deep
into my bones.

384
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,960
It's incurable.

385
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,640
If you don't take me with you,

386
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,160
you will never see me again.

387
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,640
That would be wonderful.

388
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,510
Ye Shijie, you're so cruel!

389
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,920
You're so heartless, Ye Shijie.

390
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,950
You're heartless!

391
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,710
Yes, you!

392
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,710
Ye Shijie!

393
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,230
Pack up and get in the carriage.

394
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,230
I'll go and pack right now!

395
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,030
Let's go.

396
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,710
Wait! Aren't you going to wait for me?

397
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,860
Ye Shijie!

398
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,140
Your Majesty, this drought spans

399
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,510
several counties,

400
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,380
affecting tens of thousands of people.

401
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,710
But rest assured.

402
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,060
The surrounding counties

403
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,300
have enough grain in their reserves.

404
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,470
The only issue is the lack of manpower
to transport the grain.

405
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,670
I am urgently arranging for more people

406
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,270
to ensure the disaster
does not lead to famine.

407
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,100
[Prosperous Era]
Official Li, I trust your capabilities.

408
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,190
Two years ago, you managed
the southwest floods effectively,

409
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,060
saving many lives

410
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,030
and easing much suffering.

411
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,820
You are indeed a pillar of the nation.

412
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,780
I entrust my people to you once again.

413
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,670
I will do my best, Your Majesty.

414
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,300
Official Jiang,

415
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,030
do you have anything to say to me?

416
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,060
I am deeply worried.

417
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,670
My daughter freed a prisoner
in Huaixiang.

418
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,060
Her behavior is truly reckless.

419
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,470
I have failed in educating my daughter
and I deserve to be punished.

420
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,540
Official Li.

421
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

422
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,430
What is the punishment
for freeing prisoners?

423
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,230
Your Majesty,

424
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,750
according to the law,
the punishment is death

425
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,030
by beheading.

426
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,190
Official Jiang, I have reviewed
the memorials reproaching you.

427
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,510
They contain plenty of harsh

428
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,910
and unforgiving words,

429
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,380
directly accusing you
of unpardonable crimes.

430
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,540
They are too severe
for me to bear reading.

431
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,340
I am extremely concerned.

432
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,170
Secretariat Director,

433
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,810
Jiang, you're an official entrusted
to me by the late Emperor.

434
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,570
I cannot bring myself to punish you
without understanding the situation.

435
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,940
I have decided to meet your daughter

436
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,570
before making a decision.

437
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

438
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,660
[Prosperous Era]

439
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,780
[Princess Wanning's Residence]

440
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,940
Do you know your mistake?

441
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,890
Do you know your mistake?
Do you know what you did wrong?

442
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,940
I'll beat you to death.

443
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,820
Her Highness entrusted you
with the matters of Huaixiang

444
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,230
because she valued you.

445
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,100
But look at what you've done.

446
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,340
Do you think you have lived up
to the trust of me and Her Highness?

447
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,780
Do you know your mistake? Do you?

448
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,380
Get up! Get up!

449
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,190
I'll beat you to death!
I'll beat you to death!

450
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,780
[Seeking Tranquility and Purity]
Grand Chancellor, stop beating him.

451
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,950
This child is pitiful.

452
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,540
Your Highness,
I also have faults in this matter.

453
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,820
Please punish me as well.

454
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,190
Grand Chancellor, come in quickly.

455
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,820
Yes, Your Highness.

456
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,230
Kneel here and reflect on your actions.

457
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,540
Your Highness,

458
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,740
I'll leave his life in your hands.

459
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,130
You may decide how to deal with him.

460
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,500
Someone, quickly dress him up

461
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,540
and take him away.

462
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,170
Thank you, Your Highness.

463
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,230
Thank you, Your Highness.

464
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,270
Meixiang,

465
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,750
serve the tea.

466
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:36,780
Yes, Your Highness.

467
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,340
Grand Chancellor, please take a seat.

468
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,300
I dare not.

469
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,860
I said, sit.

470
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,300
Let me pour it.

471
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:54,950
I don't deserve it.

472
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,710
Grand Chancellor, this tribute tea is
of high quality.

473
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,340
It's fragrant, Your Highness.

474
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,340
Try it.

475
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,950
It's overflowing, Your Highness.

476
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,860
The gold mine in Huaixiang is gone.

477
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,540
If you were in King Chen's hands,
you would have been dead by now.

478
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,540
If it weren't

479
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,580
for your years of loyal service to me,

480
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,060
I wouldn't even consider protecting you.

481
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,670
But now, you've left me with this mess.

482
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,860
Grand Chancellor,
what am I supposed to do now?

483
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,340
Your Highness,

484
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,990
Jiang Li may still be alive.

485
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,270
But she has committed a serious crime
by freeing a prisoner.

486
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,710
I see this as an opportunity
to bring down the Jiang family.

487
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,710
It's like cutting off one
of the emperor's arms.

488
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,380
What if we can't bring them down?

489
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,470
If the truth
about the gold mine comes out

490
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,270
when Jiang Li returns to the capital,

491
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,380
I won't be able to protect you.

492
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,030
Then what do you...

493
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,030
Meixiang, the tea is already cold.

494
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,950
No, it's not.

495
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,340
It has not turned cold.

496
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,230
But His Majesty brought this matter up

497
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,580
in court today.

498
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,750
It might not be wise
to take further action.

499
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,380
Grand Chancellor, you must drink
the tribute tea while it's hot.

500
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,470
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

501
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,540
I will personally take action this time.

502
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,430
Jiang Li will never return

503
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,950
and I will make sure
the Jiang family suffers after that.

504
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:31,950
I guarantee it.

505
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,540
Oh, don't drink it.

506
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,060
Please don't disappoint me again.

507
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,340
Has Shen Yurong come
to see me these days?

508
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Your Highness, he hasn't.

509
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,470
He can still maintain his composure.

510
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,340
Let's see how long
it'll take for him to come.

511
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,190
Second Lady Jiang

512
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,780
is truly astonishing.

513
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,580
She's actually bringing
an unfamiliar county magistrate

514
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,300
to submit a complaint to the palace.

515
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,780
That's right. I wonder...

516
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,470
Mr. Shen.

517
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,140
Prepare the carriage.

518
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:27,950
Yes, sir.

519
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,860
Wait.

520
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,820
No need.

521
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,220
Here, enjoy.

522
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

523
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,300
Thank you very much.

524
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:48,820
Mister,

525
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,990
thank you for letting us rest here.

526
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,030
You see,

527
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,060
there are so many of us here.

528
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,620
We don't ask for any luxurious food.

529
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,030
As long as it can fill our stomachs,

530
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,380
we'll take everything you have.

531
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,470
I'll pay double if needed.

532
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,430
It's not that I refuse
to sell you anything.

533
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,030
But we also don't have enough to eat.

534
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,580
I don't know when the famine will end.

535
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,340
If I give you everything now,

536
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,430
where will I go for food later?

537
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,750
Please, I'm begging you.

538
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,620
Please help us find a solution.

539
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,620
Then I'll try and ask the villagers.

540
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,990
Have some water.

541
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:23,990
Li.

542
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,710
Let's get off the carriage...

543
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,300
All right.

544
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,140
It's all right.

545
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,060
It's all right now.

546
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,470
What's...

547
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,270
It's all right now.

548
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,030
There, there.

549
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:45,510
A cat with spots jumped over Nanshan.

550
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:55,580
Following the North Star,
she returned home to the border.

551
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,580
Don't you think

552
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,620
you're being overly kind
to Magistrate Xue?

553
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,990
Even if it's to repay a favor,

554
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,750
you don't have to be this protective.

555
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,470
When we get to the capital,

556
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,990
it might cause trouble

557
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,820
if the Jiang family sees this.

558
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,430
Third Uncle, you should know

559
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,510
my father abandoned me
at Zhennyu Hall for ten years,

560
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,470
completely neglecting me.

561
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,470
Magistrate Xue's daughter died trying
to save me.

562
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,270
That's why I consider him
my real father.

563
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,860
I know you're someone
who repays kindness.

564
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,140
But there's something

565
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,300
I need your advice on.

566
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,270
What is it?

567
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,340
Ever since we entered Dingzhou,

568
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,380
every household along the way
has been facing food shortages.

569
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,910
I asked the village chief.

570
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,990
He said the famine gets worse
as we travel forward.

571
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,710
Didn't the court provide relief
for the disaster?

572
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,380
They did.

573
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,820
But it's only enough for each person
to have a bowl of watery porridge daily.

574
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,100
Is there another route we can take?

575
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,190
We could detour through Liuzhou.

576
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,060
But the capital is toward the north.

577
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,750
If we take a detour toward the west,

578
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,950
it will add at least a month
to our journey.

579
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,860
They are eager for us
to take a longer route,

580
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,030
so they can carry out
their plans in secret.

581
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,190
We'll stick to Dingzhou
to avoid more trouble.

582
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,910
We are traveling in a large group,
so provisioning will be difficult.

583
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,820
We'll split up.

584
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,190
All of you are trusted
by me and my father.

585
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,540
Today, I ask you all to remember this.

586
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,990
My identity now is Second Lady Jiang.

587
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,670
If we get to the capital
and you address me by the wrong name,

588
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,060
not only will we fail to save my father,

589
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,990
but it will also endanger our lives.

590
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,780
All right.

591
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,670
We'll remember that.

592
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,430
Please inform the rest from Huaixiang

593
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,750
about my identity.

594
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,380
Gu Da, you and the others skilled
in martial arts.

595
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,780
Please take good care of everyone

596
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,820
and ensure their safety.

597
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,670
Please rest assured.
Take care of yourself too.

598
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,270
We'll meet again
after we leave Dingzhou.

599
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,580
Safe journey.

600
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,910
Take care.

601
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:42,860
Be careful.

602
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,140
- Let's prepare to head out.
- Be careful.

603
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,100
Come, slowly.

604
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,270
[Nanmen]

605
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,620
[Dingzhou]
Everyone, line up. No need to rush.

606
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,710
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

607
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,470
Next.

608
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,990
Everyone will get some.
Please don't push.

609
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,190
Here you go.

610
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,030
It's still hot.

611
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,950
Thank you.

612
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,820
Once you get your food, move forward.

613
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,950
- Here's yours, mister.
- Thank you.

614
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:01,990
Thank you.

615
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

616
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:04,820
Thank you.

617
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,430
Here you go.

618
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,300
Thank you. Thank you.

619
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,470
Those at the back, please line up.

620
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,540
Hey, what are you doing?

621
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,620
It's mine!

622
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,670
Don't grab it.

623
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,510
Third Uncle,

624
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,470
let's go and buy

625
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,910
some food for the journey ahead.

626
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,270
The cost is not a problem.

627
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,750
No matter what,

628
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,140
we must leave
this place tomorrow morning.

629
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,910
All right.

630
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,270
Those at the back. Keep up.

631
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,990
Li!

632
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,430
Liu Xu?

633
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:38,950
Liu Xu,

634
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,540
what are you doing in Dingzhou
at a time like this?

635
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,910
My father was ordered

636
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,910
to escort relief supplies
from the court to Dingzhou.

637
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,030
So I followed along.

638
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,190
I thought our mission would be over

639
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,270
once the provision was delivered.

640
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,470
But Dingzhou's famine is so severe.

641
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,430
The city's grain houses are empty

642
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,860
and many disaster victims gather
outside the city.

643
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,950
The local officials in Dingzhou
are overwhelmed

644
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,510
and don't have enough people
to distribute the food.

645
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,750
So my father decided to stay

646
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,190
and help distribute the food.

647
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,540
Is the situation really bad?

648
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,910
Yes, it's quite serious.

649
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,100
Earlier, they said a batch
of supplies was on the way.

650
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,100
But it hasn't arrived yet.

651
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,780
Without food,

652
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,620
there might be unrest.

653
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,430
You have to be careful in what you do.

654
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,860
After all, people would do anything

655
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,060
to survive.

656
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,510
I expected this
when I saw the disaster victims

657
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,030
on the way here,

658
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,470
so I evacuated those from Huaixiang
and took a detour.

659
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,060
It's just a few of us now.

660
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,710
We'll leave early tomorrow morning.

661
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,540
I thought we could catch up

662
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,950
when I met you this time.

663
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,540
But you're leaving again.

664
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,060
You don't know

665
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,270
how bored I was in the capital.

666
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,710
I thought Ye Shijie and Jiang Jingrui
were in the capital.

667
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,430
Don't even mention Jiang Jingrui to me.

668
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,270
All he does is upset me.

669
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,510
I feel like giving him
a piece of my mind

670
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,030
every time I see him.

671
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,540
Ye Shijie is a bookworm.

672
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,100
He's always busy with official matters.

673
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,780
I rarely see him too.

674
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,750
He just started his position
at the ministry.

675
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,300
Maybe he's not a bookworm.

676
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,430
He's just not interested in me.

677
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,140
Are you moving on?

678
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,860
I only like people who like me back.

679
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,380
As for those
who are not interested in me,

680
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,860
I won't waste my time on them.

681
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,060
Open the door.
We want to see Second Lady Jiang.

682
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,470
- Open up!
- Second Lady Jiang.

683
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,540
Master, what do we do now?

684
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,100
How did they know Li was staying here?

685
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,750
I have no idea.

686
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,620
Could the lady
who found this place for us

687
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,230
leak it out?

688
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,300
Either that
or the villagers leak it out.

689
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,990
Impossible.

690
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,670
Master,

691
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,540
why don't I ask Second Lady Jiang here

692
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,470
to calm them down?

693
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,030
No, Li can't show up right now.

694
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,060
I'll handle this.

695
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,060
Open the door.

696
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,470
Second Lady Jiang.

697
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,470
Someone's coming. Someone's coming.

698
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,860
Everyone, let's go
and see Second Lady Jiang.

699
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,030
What a crowd.

700
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,380
Are you trying to rob us?

701
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,230
No.

702
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,270
We dare not, mister.

703
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,230
We just want

704
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,710
to see Second Lady Jiang.

705
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,860
Who told you she's here?

706
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,510
I... I heard from someone.

707
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,710
From who?

708
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,030
I really heard it

709
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,100
from the beggars.

710
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,820
They said Second Lady Jiang is brave

711
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,620
and willing to help Magistrate Huaixiang
seek justice.

712
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,100
So she can definitely help us.

713
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,820
All of us agree to come and see her.

714
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,270
We want to ask Second Lady Jiang

715
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,780
to help us get some food.

716
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,230
- That's right.
- Please help us, Second Lady Jiang.

717
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,780
- Second Lady Jiang!
- Second Lady Jiang!

718
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,620
Shut up!

719
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,510
You're being misled, get it?

720
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,380
Leave.

721
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,540
We don't have food either.

722
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,710
Second Lady Jiang!

723
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,510
Mister, please have mercy on us

724
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,750
and give us some food.

725
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,140
My child is only a year old.

726
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,470
I don't have to eat.

727
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,860
But please save my child.

728
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,300
Please, I can go without food.

729
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,670
Please help my child.

730
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,820
Please, I beg you.

731
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,340
Please help my child.

732
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,140
Give us some food.

733
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,860
Please,

734
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,910
Go and get some mantou.

735
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,620
Yes, Master.

736
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,470
Mister, please help the children.

737
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,270
Get up now.

738
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,750
Mister, please.

739
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,380
Please, I beg you.

740
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,270
Please, mister.

741
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,270
We don't have much food either.

742
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,100
We can only share some
with the children.

743
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,030
Those with able-bodied adults

744
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,860
should leave on their own.

745
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,430
Otherwise,

746
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,030
don't blame me for being rude.

747
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,670
- Thank you, Second Lady Jiang.
- Thank you, Second Lady Jiang.

748
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you, mister.

749
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,910
Li, what are you doing?

750
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,030
Third Uncle, did you give
the disaster victim food?

751
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,340
I gave the children some mantou

752
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,060
and chased away the rest.

753
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,580
You shouldn't have given them food.

754
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,470
I know we're running out of food.

755
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,670
I did leave some for us.

756
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,470
Besides,

757
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,190
I can eat less during the journey.

758
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,670
That was not what I meant.

759
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,470
No matter how much food we have left,

760
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,100
you shouldn't have given it to others.

761
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,620
The moment we give them food,

762
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,270
we won't be able
to control the crowd later.

763
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,380
The disaster victims have been hungry
for a long time.

764
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,380
Once they react, regroup, and come back,

765
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,190
we won't be able to leave.

766
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,820
Don't worry, I'm here.

767
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,910
Anyone causing trouble
won't get away with it.

768
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,100
But what if
it's the whole city's victims?

769
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,910
How will you handle it alone?

770
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:39,860
I...

771
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,230
Before the news spreads,

772
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,780
we must leave now.

773
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,030
I'll have Liu Xu arrange for us
to leave the city.

774
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,100
If the people asking for food today come

775
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,140
from Huaixiang,

776
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,910
will you still be this indifferent?

777
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,620
Third Uncle, what do you mean?

778
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,190
I thought you were kind-hearted.

779
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,380
You took the risk to save
the Huaixiang's people out of gratitude.

780
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,300
But now, it seems different.

781
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,990
Your attitude changes depending

782
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,190
on the people.

783
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,870
It's about priorities.

784
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,990
The priority now is to hurry back
to the capital.

785
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,060
We can't let those

786
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,870
who depart early wait in vain.

787
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,140
Never mind. You've always been decisive.

788
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,540
I'll just do what you say.

789
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,260
Tong.

790
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,060
Time to go.

791
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,740
Let them pass.

792
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,620
Li,

793
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,700
be careful
after you're outside the city.

794
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,030
If there's an emergency,
write to me immediately.

795
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,580
Take care. I'll see you when you return.

796
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,470
You should go now.

797
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,830
Third Uncle, let's go.

798
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,260
All right.

799
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,460
[Dingzhou]

800
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,700
Is that Second Lady Jiang's carriage?

801
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,510
- Yes, it is.
- It's Second Lady Jiang's carriage.

802
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,430
Second Lady Jiang!

803
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,620
Second Lady Jiang.

804
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,220
Oh, no.

805
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,430
Second Lady Jiang.

806
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,100
We're in trouble.

807
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,350
Second Lady Jiang.

808
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,180
It's Second Lady Jiang's carriage!

809
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,430
It's Second Lady Jiang's carriage!

810
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,910
What do you want?

811
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,620
What do you want?

812
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,510
Get up!

813
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,510
Listen to me.

814
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,310
There's no Second Lady Jiang here.

815
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,510
I don't even know
who's Second Lady Jiang.

816
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,620
You're lying!
Second Lady Jiang is inside.

817
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,260
Yes, there must be food in the carriage!

818
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,540
Everyone, go and get it!
There's food inside.

819
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:51,740
Back off!

820
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,540
Tong.

821
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,220
What are you trying to do?

822
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,580
Second Lady Jiang!

823
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,990
- There's food inside!
- Get out of the way!

824
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,260
If you get on the carriage,
I'll won't be nice anymore!

825
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,220
It's going to topple!

826
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,660
Get off!

827
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,350
Third Uncle, are you all right?

828
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,740
It's Second Lady Jiang! It's her!

829
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,030
Get out of the way!

830
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,220
I dare you to get close again!

831
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,740
Everyone, don't believe him.

832
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,060
We can't let ourselves die from hunger.

833
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,470
There must be food in the carriage.

834
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,990
Let's go and get it.

835
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,660
Go and take it!

836
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,060
It's better than starving to death.

837
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,180
What are you waiting for? Go!

838
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,100
We're giving out food!

839
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,390
Everyone, look! We're giving out food!

840
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,430
Where?

841
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,660
Hot, fresh buns!

842
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,870
Steamed buns!

843
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,060
Come quickly!

844
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,030
They're filled with meat.

845
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,830
- Where?
- Steamed buns.

846
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,260
Come and see.

847
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,830
What now?

848
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,990
Hot, fresh buns!

849
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,870
These have fillings!

850
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,740
Really?

851
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:57,830
It really is steamed buns.

852
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,830
They're delicious!

853
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,910
Come and get some before they're gone.

854
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,950
- Steamed buns!
- There are really buns!

855
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,510
Steamed buns!

856
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,310
Give it to me!

857
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,990
They'll run out if you're late.
Come quickly!

858
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,060
- They're giving out food!
- I want steamed buns!

859
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
I want steamed buns!

860
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,510
There's enough for everyone.

861
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:12,950
I want one.

862
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:13,700
Don't snatch.

863
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,580
All right, here you go.

864
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,310
Third Uncle, are you all right?

865
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,390
Shijie.

866
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,830
Jiang Li, go now.

867
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,100
We'll cover you.

868
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,660
Thank you.

869
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,350
It's nothing.

870
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,430
Be careful on your way back.

871
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,740
Mine! It's my steamed bun!

872
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,790
Give it to me!

873
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,620
- No, stop!
- You old fool!

874
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,140
You two.

875
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,620
Stop it.

876
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,540
Go away!

877
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,140
Be careful.

878
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,510
- Stop it.
- Why did Magistrate Xue come down?

879
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,140
Stop it!

880
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:35,700
Magistrate Xue.

881
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,350
Stop it.

882
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,660
- Be careful.
- No.

883
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,390
Don't run.

884
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,580
Don't run.

885
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,140
Go away!

886
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,260
- I want steamed buns.
- Be careful.

887
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,390
No, don't.

888
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,180
- Magistrate Xue!
- Don't!

889
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,660
We have to leave now.

890
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,580
- No.
- Don't go there.

891
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,620
You can't go there.

892
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,580
Let's go.

893
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,220
- Stop.
- Come on.

894
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:51,790
- Let's go.
- Get in the carriage.

895
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:52,870
Let's go.

896
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,030
No.

897
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,870
Don't leave.

898
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,580
Don't leave.

899
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,510
Are there any more?

900
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,100
- Give it to me!
- It's mine!

901
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,350
- It's mine.
- Give it to me!

902
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,510
It's mine!

903
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,510
Father,

904
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
aren't you tired from reading
all these petitions?

905
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,470
Do you want to take some rest?

906
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,510
Do you know the relationship

907
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,580
between people and officials?

908
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,060
People are the foundation of officials.

909
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,100
That's what the texts say.

910
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,310
Then what do you it is?

911
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,660
The people are like

912
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,140
what you are to me.

913
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,140
I like what the people like.

914
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,510
I hate what the people hate.

915
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,140
This is what it means
to be a parent to the people.

916
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,990
As an official,

917
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,430
all the people are my children.

918
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,350
Stop it!

919
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,830
- It's mine.
- Take more.

920
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,030
No!

921
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,830
We're out of buns.

922
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,060
We're out of buns.

923
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,430
It's too late, Jiang Li.

924
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,910
We almost finished give out the food.
You must leave now.

925
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,910
Or else you won't be able to leave.

926
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,870
That's right.

927
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,220
No.

928
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,790
Then we'll stay.

929
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,060
You're not leaving?

930
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,870
But...

931
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,180
Return to the city.

932
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,220
- Don't take mine!
- Give it to me!

933
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,870
Don't take it! It's mine!

934
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,260
Father,
even when you're not clear-minded,

935
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,830
you still care about the people.

936
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,990
How could they harm someone like you?

937
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,910
I won't let them get away with this.

938
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,550
Li,

939
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,700
I shouldn't have given the people food.

940
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,030
I almost put you in danger.

941
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,140
It's not your fault.

942
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,030
Today's events were too deliberate.

943
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,350
If they were really the people,

944
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,650
how did they know
our whereabouts so clearly?

945
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,170
Someone must have instigated them.

946
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,540
They don't want me to leave Dingzhou.

947
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
I found out

948
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,780
there are many small paths leading out
of Dingzhou.

949
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,300
We can go through the forest.

950
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,740
I don't plan to leave.

951
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,100
What are you thinking?

952
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,950
Third Uncle, you were right.

953
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,300
They're all people.

954
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,780
Why differentiate
between Huaixiang and Dingzhou?

955
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,660
My lady,

956
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,390
Official Ye and the others are here.

957
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,220
We're lucky to have you today.

958
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,140
What are you two doing in Dingzhou?

959
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,830
Li Zhongnan is here for disaster relief,

960
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,180
and the Emperor ordered me to assist.

961
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:47,830
Li,

962
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,220
Grand Chancellor Jiang received
your letter and was furious.

963
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,620
He was going to drag you back.

964
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,180
But when he heard
you were passing through Dingzhou,

965
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,350
he let me come to check on you.

966
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,910
After Father knew,

967
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,910
he must be furious, right?

968
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,910
Well, it's good to let First Uncle know.

969
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,390
With so many disaster victims
and so many mouths to feed,

970
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,100
if you don't ask for his help,
how will you solve it?

971
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,980
Right?

972
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,500
How can you solve it?

973
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,220
Li Zhongnan is in charge
of disaster relief,

974
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,380
and the food is in his hands.

975
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,060
Even if Father wanted to help,

976
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,460
he couldn't bypass Li Zhongnan.

977
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,540
Otherwise, he'd be accused

978
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,100
of hindering the relief efforts.

979
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,420
If that's the case,
you still need to leave.

980
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,660
It's too late to leave.

981
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,900
My whereabouts have been exposed.

982
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,380
With the disaster in Dingzhou unresolved

983
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,380
and the people
outside the city not dispersing,

984
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,730
I can't leave

985
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,810
with Magistrate Xue.

986
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,060
Li, Luyang isn't far from here.

987
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,290
Let me go back to the Ye family
and think of a solution.

988
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,650
The Ye family
just suffered a major setback

989
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,420
and hasn't recovered.

990
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,020
Besides, gathering food

991
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,020
and transporting it here
in such a short time

992
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,170
is nearly impossible.

993
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,810
The Ye family has been in business

994
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,810
for decades.

995
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,500
So they can handle this.

996
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,330
Don't worry. I'll head back now.

997
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,250
Be careful.

998
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,100
- I'm heading off now.
- Thank you.

999
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,940
If the Ye family can't help,

1000
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,460
it would be a dead end.

1001
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,290
Even if it's a dead end,
we need to know why.

1002
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,900
We already know someone is behind this.

1003
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,650
So we need to find out

1004
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,420
who is the one behind this.

1005
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,020
With Second Lady Jiang in Dingzhou,

1006
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,290
all the disaster victims
are heading here.

1007
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,610
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]
Dingzhou's situation is critical now.

1008
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,100
Official Li,

1009
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,900
do you have any solutions?

1010
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,860
The drought has affected a wide area,

1011
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,810
spanning several cities.

1012
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,500
Right now, the disaster victims
are concentrated in Dingzhou.

1013
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,020
The relief plan I made before

1014
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,170
is no longer applicable
and needs revision.

1015
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,330
After court,

1016
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,420
I will discuss
with Grand Chancellor Jiang

1017
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,420
and quickly report a solution to you,
Your Majesty.

1018
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,460
Hurry up.

1019
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,980
Every day of delay
means more suffering for the people.

1020
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,770
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1021
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,380
Chancellor Li.

1022
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,420
Chancellor Li.

1023
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,290
What are you doing?

1024
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,250
We've both been doing this job
for most of our lives.

1025
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,540
A food distribution plan

1026
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,210
is already in place.

1027
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,330
It just needs to be adjusted
to fit the current situation.

1028
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,980
Does it really need to take that long?

1029
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,330
I'm not as anxious as you are.

1030
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,290
After all, it's your second daughter

1031
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,130
causing the trouble.

1032
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,940
That's not fair.

1033
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,330
The relief efforts in Dingzhou
are your responsibility.

1034
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,540
If people starve to death,

1035
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,060
aren't you afraid
of the Emperor's wrath?

1036
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:35,210
Of course, I am.

1037
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,020
I used to be.

1038
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,650
But now that Second Lady Jiang is here,

1039
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,250
she brought the disaster.

1040
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,420
If the Emperor wants to punish someone,

1041
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,730
he'll start with your Jiang family.

1042
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,940
What does it have to do with me?

1043
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,540
So you don't care if people starve?

1044
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,130
That's not true.

1045
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,290
There's actually a batch
of grain in Yunxiang,

1046
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:58,580
not far from Dingzhou.

1047
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,170
But the mountain roads are treacherous.

1048
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,460
It's not easy

1049
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,610
to transport the grain from there.

1050
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,130
Just be frank.

1051
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,460
If Second Lady Jiang wants to return

1052
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,770
to the capital alone,

1053
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:10,860
it'll be simple.

1054
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,940
But if she wants
to take someone else back,

1055
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,730
don't blame me for the complications.

1056
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,500
With so many people on the road,

1057
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,610
transporting the grain
will be difficult.

1058
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,130
Are you saying

1059
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,210
that unless she stops bringing the people
to submit a petition to the Emperor,

1060
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,730
you won't solve the issues caused
by famine?

1061
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,210
I never said that.

1062
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,210
It's up to Grand Chancellor Jiang
to decide.

1063
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,610
But the longer this drags on,

1064
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,060
the more disaster victims
will gather in Dingzhou,

1065
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,170
and the danger will increase.

1066
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,070
I suggest you go back

1067
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,830
and persuade your daughter.

1068
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,580
It's said Second Lady Jiang
wasn't afraid.

1069
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,260
She stood up and said,

1070
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,180
[Virtue and Growth]
justice are evident and should prevail.

1071
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,140
Is there no place for justice?

1072
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,260
If Huaixiang's grievances can't be heard

1073
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,470
[Seeking Tranquility and Purity]
and Luyang can't help.

1074
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,660
Then follow me.

1075
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,260
Even if the path ahead
is filled with danger,

1076
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,260
I will take you to the capital

1077
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,910
to seek justice!

1078
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:21,870
Well said!

1079
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:23,950
Your Highness, you...

1080
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,910
Well said.

1081
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:31,830
Reward him.

1082
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,140
Yes, reward.

1083
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,510
Chancellor Li.

1084
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:39,950
Yes, Your Highness.

1085
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,870
You've mastered

1086
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,870
the art of using rumors.

1087
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,870
You sure know how to exploit

1088
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:48,350
the common folk's love for drama.

1089
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,660
Thank you for your praise.

1090

the name of Second Lady Jiang

to spread her cause?

This time, I let her use it
to her heart's content.

1094
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,070
To defeat her,

1095
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,780
first let her run rampant.
