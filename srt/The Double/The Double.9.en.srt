Go out and help me bet

373
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,650
on Jiang Li to win.

374
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,610
Outrageous!

375
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,500
She's becoming more
and more disobedient.

376
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,780
She even dares to make such a bet.

377
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,650
The power in the capital is complex.

378
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,170
How could she understand it all at once?

379
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,370
If it weren't
for Old Madam's insistence,

380
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,980
Li would have stayed home another year.

381
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,060
But she is already attending
the School of Integrity.

382
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,170
There will be more troubles
in the future.

383
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,570
It's my fault.

384
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,220
I really didn't expect this.

385
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,780
Mr dear, forget it.

386
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,220
Don't be too harsh on Li later.

387
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,700
Young people are always impulsive.

388
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,300
So it's inevitable.

389
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,980
If she admit her mistake,

390
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,850
we can guide her slowly
when she comes home.

391
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,700
If she had admitted her mistake,

392
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,860
she wouldn't have been sent
to Zhennyu Hall.

393
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,910
I want to see

394
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,540
if she has truly repented

395
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,230
in these ten years!

396
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,060
My dear.

397
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,230
My dear.

398
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,780
My dear,

399
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
calm down.

400
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,060
He's coming.

401
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,650
My Lady. My Lady.

402
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,650
Don't help me up.

403
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,850
Master, she has been kneeling
all day and all night.

404
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,850
Please talk her out of this.

405
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:37,650
Father.

406
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,220
What are you doing?

407
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,570
I made a mistake

408
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,090
and should accept punishment.

409
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,260
Why do you still do it

410
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,740
when you know it's wrong?

411
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,570
Because as the daughter
of the Chief Secretary,

412
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,090
I shouldn't embarrass Father.

413
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,500
My dignity is not something
that's easily lost.

414
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,130
What about your own dignity?

415
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,610
You made a bet,

416
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,220
and it's with the Li family.

417
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,980
If you lose,

418
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,090
you'll become a joke!

419
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,700
Father,

420
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,060
all I want is to study quietly.

421
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,810
But the exam format
at the School of Integrity changed.

422
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,780
If I don't form a team to take the exam,

423
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,170
I won't even have the qualification
to participate.

424
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,570
I've just entered
the School of Integrity

425
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,890
and have no friends.

426
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,890
My sisters have their own group.

427
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,300
I finally found someone to form a team.

428
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,100
But the Li brothers are trying
to snatch him away.

429
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,300
Their attitude is terrible,

430
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,100
and their words are contemptuous.

431
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,580
They said...

432
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,950
They said...

433
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,580
What did they say?

434
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,750
I can't stay at the School of Integrity.

435
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,910
They asked me to kneel and apologize.

436
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,340
This is too much!

437
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,860
You don't need to worry.

438
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,140
I'll handle it for you.

439
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,540
Father,

440
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,910
Chancellor Li can't do anything
to you in court.

441
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,780
So he's using me to provoke you.

442
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,510
If I withdraw,

443
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,340
what about Father's reputation?

444
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,430
Don't worry about these things.

445
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,620
I'll talk to Li Zhongnan tomorrow

446
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,300
and cancel this bet.

447
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,750
The bet has already spread
in the capital.

448
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,780
If you resolve it for me,
you'll be criticized.

449
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,580
I don't want Father to be humiliated
in front of Chancellor Li.

450
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,140
Father,

451
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,300
I've grown up.

452
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,060
You've protected me for many years.

453
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,030
Let me take this risk now.

454
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,340
I accept this bet,

455
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,710
risking my life

456
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,540
and the honor of being a daughter
of the Jiang family.

457
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,300
Father,

458
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,580
please help me.

459
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,060
Li,

460
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,230
I'm giving this qin to you.

461
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,340
Since Father has spoken,

462
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,100
I'll help you.

463
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,910
If there's anything else
you need help with,

464
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,990
feel free to let me know.

465
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,670
The qin you've used
can definitely help me win.

466
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,430
You can have this music sheet too.

467
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,380
It's too bad I don't play the qin.

468
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,780
So there's nothing much
I can do to help you.

469
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,910
I'm already grateful

470
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,340
that you have such kind thoughts.

471
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,910
Time is running out.

472
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,060
Li,

473
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,860
you need to prepare quickly.

474
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,860
Madam,

475
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,470
we've sent all the good things to her.

476
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,860
Are we really going to help her?

477
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,780
Yes.

478
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,300
Why not?

479
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,270
She wants to soar high.

480
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,620
So we'll let her crash and burn.

481
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,820
Those hypocrites are just pretending
to be helpful.

482
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,030
I thought Uncle would scold you harshly.

483
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,470
But in the end, he supported you.

484
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
Everyone feels the need
to vent sometimes.

485
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,300
Father is also human.

486
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,270
I'm really curious.

487
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,820
What are you good at?

488
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,430
Do you also play the qin?

489
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,430
I learned a bit at Zhennyu Hall.

490
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,330
Your sister can't even
afford decent jewelry,

491
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,980
and you're spending money
to repair her qin?

492
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,370
I'll make sure

493
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,700
to get her proper jewelry in the future.

494
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,850
Mother, don't worry.

495
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,410
But if this qin isn't repaired soon,
her skills will worsen.

496
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,610
It'll be too late then.

497
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,170
I knew it.

498
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,940
You don't care about me and your sister.

499
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,890
We might as well be dead.

500
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,090
Mother, what are you doing?

501
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,460
Why are you being unreasonable?

502
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,740
Leave me alone!

503
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,170
You called that learned a bit?

504
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,260
You clearly play very well.

505
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,500
- My Lady.
- What's wrong?

506
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,090
My Lady.

507
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,500
Is your wrist hurt?

508
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,500
Let's go and see the physician.

509
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,220
I'll bring him here then.

510
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,260
No need.

511
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,460
I'll go see the doctor myself.

512
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,460
You can't go alone.

513
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:35,850
I'll accompany you.

514
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:36,940
My Lady.

515
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,170
It's all right.

516
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:40,940
Let's go.

517
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,650
It's just a minor injury on your finger.

518
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,850
So it's serious.

519
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,020
Speak concisely.

520
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,220
She's the young lady
of the Prime Minister.

521
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,980
[Divine Techniques Sect Hua]
It'll be your fault if she's not cured.

522
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,780
But she has an old injury on her wrist.

523
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,020
Old injury?

524
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:06,940
Yes.

525
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,020
The old injury wasn't treated properly,

526
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,330
and now there's a new one.

527
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,650
It's a bit troublesome.

528
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,850
But don't worry too much.

529
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,610
With acupuncture daily for a few days

530
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,500
and the medicine I prescribed,

531
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,500
along with proper rest

532
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,460
and no strenuous activity,

533
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,700
playing the qin and riding horses

534
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,570
won't be a problem after that.

535
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,650
Mister, how long will it take
to fully recover?

536
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,060
At least a month, I'd say.

537
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,540
Can't it be faster?

538
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,700
We're treating injuries here,

539
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,850
not some kind of child's play.

540
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,850
It needs to be step by step.

541
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,090
Thank you, mister.

542
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,890
Please prepare the medicine.

543
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:40,940
All right.

544
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:47,300
[Divine Techniques Sect Hua]

545
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,410
How can there be an old injury?

546
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,260
I got injured from working hard
day and night

547
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,570
at Zhennyu Hall. Why?

548
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,330
I mean

549
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,610
you knew about your wrist injury.

550
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,220
Why did you make the bet
with the Li brothers?

551
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,130
I even bet...

552
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:19,890
So

553
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,300
are you just going to watch from afar?

554
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,740
That's not what I meant.

555
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,090
Wait.

556
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,130
I'm serious.

557
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,260
I'm really serious.

558
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,130
My father was a great chess player.

559
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,020
After he joined the official circle,

560
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,940
my mother thought playing chess

561
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,170
would affect his future career.

562
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,410
So she forbids him from playing anymore.

563
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,330
But I learned a few tricks from him

564
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,890
when I was young.

565
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,330
I'm confident

566
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,370
I can handle it.

567
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,780
Go back and play a game.

568
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,500
You even know how to play chess?

569
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,330
They seem to teach everything
at Zhennyu Hall.

570
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,090
It makes me want to go there.

571
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,260
Young Master,

572
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,500
could you please check
if the medicine is ready?

573
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,130
Lady Jiang Li needs to take it.

574
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,650
Of course, I'll go and get it.

575
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,570
Is it ready yet?

576
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,740
Li,

577
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,740
how can you play the qin
with your wrist like this?

578
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,740
There's always a way.

579
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,020
Let's take care of others first.

580
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,090
Your son is not himself.

581
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,170
It looks pretty serious to me.

582
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,330

583
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,980

584

I can play with you.

585
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,540
I need to prepare for the exam.

586
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,540
Don't disturb me.

587
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,130
She's not acting like herself.

588
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,780
She's really overestimating herself.

589

590
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:56,940
What is it?

591
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,130
How do you get the courage
to compete for the top spot?

592
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,460
Because I'm not content.

593
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,460
I'm not content to be confined
in Zhennyu Hall,

594
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,170
to be trampled on
at the School of Integrity,

595
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,210
and even to be hidden away at home

596
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,690
just to marry a good husband.

597
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,860
I want to compete.

598
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,060
I want to break free
from this stifling place

599
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,460
and fight for justice.

600
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,570
There's nothing to hide about it.

601
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,770
I know

602
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,730
why Ye Shijie was convinced by you.

603
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,020
You have determination.

604
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,420
Only you

605
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,570
can persuade such a proud person
to join us.

606
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,420
I've said

607
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,770
I want to win against Li Lian.

608
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,420
He should also be worthy
of an audience with the Emperor.

609
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,570
This time, whether it's for me,

610
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,020
for him,

611
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,250
or for us.

612
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,650
This time, I'm going all out.

613
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,820
Me too. I'll give it my all.

614
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,170
What's wrong?

615
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,690
I fell off a horse before.

616
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,020
I never want to ride again.

617
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,460
Now, I want to try again.

618
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,860
Liu Xu, don't worry.

619
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,650
I'll ride with you.

620
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,060
Let's first get used to the feeling
of being on horseback.

621
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:16,730
It's okay.

622
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,010
No rush. Take your time.

623
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,850
Your thumb ring is loose,

624
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,930
don't you know that?

625
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,120
Duke Su?

626
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:25,850
You were following me.

627
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,370
In your eyes,

628
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,200
do I really have the time for that?

629
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,490
This place is usually for hunting.

630
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,490
As for you,

631
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,160
it's quite dangerous for you
to barge in like this.

632
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,090
We couldn't find anywhere else.

633
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,050
Duke Su,

634
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,530
what did you say about Liu Xu?

635
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:40,850
What's loose?

636
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,720
This friend of yours

637
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,410
deliberately wore a loose thumb ring

638
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,410
because of fear of an old injury
on the thumb.

639
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,410
You see.

640
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,970
If the ring doesn't stick to the skin,

641
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,970
the ring will rotate due to friction
with the arrow shaft

642
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,490
when shooting arrows.

643
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,680
Before the arrow leaves the bow,
its direction is already off.

644
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,970
A slight deviation can lead

645
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,090
to a huge difference.

646
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,490
How can you shoot accurately?

647
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,680
That's really impressive.

648
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,890
Do you know archery?

649
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,090
No.

650
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,530
A bow and arrow are light weapons.

651
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,120
It's good for women
to learn for self-defense.

652
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,890
Get off the horse and stand here.

653
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,280
Hold this for me.

654
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,280
I never said I wanted to learn archery.

655

Do as I say.

656
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,010
Hold the bow handle in the middle
with one hand.

657
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,760
Hold it firmly

658
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,640
without looseness.

659
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,680
Your thumb pulls the string.

660
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,450
Just like this.

661
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,160
Remember the position
of your thumb pulling the string.

662
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,370
I'll guide you to pull the bow once.

663
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,410
Once you've held the bow, hold it tight.

664
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,850
Or else you'll be inviting
your opponent to kill you.

665

Focus on the target.

666
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,200
I'll count to three.

667
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,570
Then release

Remember.

670

Don't hesitate.

with an injury like that?

Duke Su, you don't have to worry.

680
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,010
The physician said it'll take
at least a month to fully heal.

681
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,280
Can you wait that long?

682

why Duke Su came
to give me some pointers.

00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,240
and expecting me to treat her?

742
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
You're breaking my rules.

743
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,320
I won't break your rules.

744
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,760
I'll take her place to do it.

745
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,320
You'll take her place?

746
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,010
Who is she to you?

747
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,490
What rules?

748
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,930
Xiao Heng hasn't told you, right?

749
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,050
If you want me to treat you,

750
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,130
you need to gamble with me first.

751
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,770
If you're willing to treat me,

752
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,540
I'd naturally take that bet.

753
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:40,340
Fine.

754
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,610
Straightforward.

755
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,770
I happened to have received
a venomous spider.

756
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:00,900
I need someone to test its poison.

757
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,540
If you win against me,

758
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,210
I'll cure your hand.

759
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,460
What if I lose?

760
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,650
You'll forfeit your life to me.

761
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,290
How do we do this?

762
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:20,380
Of these two spiders, one is poisonous,
the other is not.

763
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,090
Pick one.

764
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,570
Sometimes,

765
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,210
staying alive requires luck.

766
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,610
Even if I save you this time,

767
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,770
you might not live long.

768
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,500
Let me remind you.

769
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,610
One of these is highly toxic.

770
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,980
If you pick the wrong one

771
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,540
and it bites you,

772
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,570
you might not survive.

773
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:49,500
Shall we start?

774
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,460
Wait.

775
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,570
Are you scared?

776
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:56,380
You said I need to bet a life.

777
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,900
But you didn't say it had to be my own.

778
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,380
This is the life I'm using for the bet.

779
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,860
I introduced the physician to you.

780
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,900
This is an act of betrayal, you know?

781
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,690
If anything happens to you,

782
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,340
I will take my own life in return.

783
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:17,770
Die with me, huh?

784
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,900
Xiao Heng, I'm warning you.

785
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,570
This spider is truly poisonous.

786
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:31,650
What are we waiting for?

787
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,460
Let me carefully pick

788
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,610
which one is the venomous spider.

789
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,210
Is it this one?

790
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,340
Or this one?

791
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,060
Open it.

792
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:56,650
Open it.

793
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:06,940
It's not poisonous.

794
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,090
Xiao Heng!

795
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,170
Then I'll pick this one.

796
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,650
Open it.

797
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,090
You won.

798
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,650
This is not poisonous.

799
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,570
It looks like my hand gave you luck.

800
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,130
You can leave now.

801
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,380
I need to do the treatment now.

802
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,290
What a pity

803
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:42,690
that she can die with me.

804
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:44,980
Can you walk quickly?

805
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:53,500
How did you guess it?

806
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,250
When you look at him,
I can see love in your eyes.

807
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,090
So what?

808
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,130
Don't you?

809
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,650
He isn't the one I love.

810
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,650
If you dare lie to me,

811
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,210
I'll kill you.

812
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,250
Women shouldn't show
their feelings easily.

813
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,380
Otherwise, they'll lose the first round.

814
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,690
You speak as if you've experienced it.

815
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:14,860
Give me your hand.

816
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,210
The meridians are in disarray.

817
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,650
Ordinary methods won't work.

818
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:35,730
We can only fight fire with fire.

819
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,820
But this method is intense.

820
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,650
You'll endure immense pain,

821
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:40,650
mental turmoil,

822
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:41,980
and sleepless nights.

823
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,290
I trust you, Miss Situ.

824
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:45,980
You have quite the nerve.

825
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,820
No wonder Xiao Heng came
to beg me for you.

826
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,420
Miss Situ and Duke Su
seem well acquainted.

827
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,380
We saved each other before.

828
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,130
Give me your hand.

829
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,940
[Duke Su's Residence]

830
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,660
Did you stay up all night

831
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,220
just to make sure I didn't poison her?

832
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:34,340
How is she?

833
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,510
The poison hasn't completely
dissipated yet.

834
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,030
Give it two more days.

835
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,140
She'll be fully recovered.

836
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,590
Xiao Heng,

837
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,110
I never imagined

838
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,740
you would care so much for a woman.

839
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,510
She's the pawn I want to groom.

840
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,510
If her hand is crippled,
how can she continue with her act?

841
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:54,660
Xiao Heng,

842
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,990
have you developed feelings for her?

843
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,590
Stop asking me such questions.

844
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,390
You'd better not let me find out
you're lying to me.

845
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:21,780
Lu Ji,

846
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,300
send Second Lady Jiang back.

847
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,870
She's asleep.

848
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,950
Do you want me to carry her back

849
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:31,430
or throw her over my shoulder?

850
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,140
Send a message to her maid.

851
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,140
