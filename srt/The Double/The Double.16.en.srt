[Episode 16]

17
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,280
I am the daughter of the Secretariat Director
and Grand Preceptor,

18
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,710
Jiang Li.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,680
I didn't expect that Jiang Li is willing

20
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,640
to disclose her identity

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,480
just to stand up for the Ye family.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,230
Isn't she afraid of being accused
of covering up for the Ye family?

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,230
Mr. Li.

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,680
The show hasn't begun yet.

25
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,150
Why should we believe in you?

26
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,710
We shouldn't be fooled

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,120
by her lies.

28
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,950
That's right.

29
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,240
That's your one-sided proclamation.

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,840
That's right.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,400
Impersonating relatives of an Imperial
Court official is a serious offense.

32
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,150
Well.

33
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,470
We have our
District Defender with us today.

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,560
He is well-versed in the law.

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,080
Official Zhu.

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,310
Tell us. Am I right?

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,800
Is it true?

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,400
Even if you're from the Jiang family,

39
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,360
you couldn't abuse your power.

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,750
The Jiang family covers up
for their in-laws, the Ye family.

41
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,030
This is a collusion between

42
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,000
official and businessman.

43
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,150
You act evilly

44
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,190
in collusion.

45
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,000
Nonsense.

46
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,240
The Jiang family is strict
even with their daughters.

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,800
I made a mistake when I was little

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,240
and was punished
at Zhennyu Hall for a decade.

49
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,800
To uphold justice,

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,240
my father could even
abandon his blood-related daughter.

51
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,750
Covering up? Who said that?

52
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,560
Say that again!

53
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,000
My Lord.

54
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,470
The Ye family are the in-laws
of the Secretariat Director.

55
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
If we treat the Ye family like this,

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
will we...

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,150
Their daughter died at the Jiang family.

58
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,030
Their granddaughter

59
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,080
has been locked away
in Zhennyu Hall for a decade.

60
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,680
Both families have severed ties.

61
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,470
Why would the Jiang family concern
themselves with the Ye family's affairs?

62
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,000
Got it.

63
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,590
Jiang Li.

64
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,630
However, the Soochow brocade

65
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,630
of the Ye family is problematic.

66
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,150
If you wish
to stand up for the Ye family,

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,800
you need to justify your statements.

68
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,680
Otherwise, you'd be accused

69
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,520
of covering up for them.

70
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,310
That's right.

71
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,080
You said that people died
after wearing the Soochow brocade.

72
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,910
I'd like to ask you a question then.
How did you know

73
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,000
that the Soochow brocade
was problematic then?

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,080
All the tailor's shops said so.

75
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,910
Everyone in Luyang knows about it.

76
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,000
Didn't Mr. Ye

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,750
get arrested by the officials as well?

78
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,360
Official Zhu.

79
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,870
When did the officials
start conducting investigations

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,310
based on hearsay?

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We found evidence.

82
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,910
The victim's Soochow brocade
is kept at the yamen.

83
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,430
That's why we're here

84
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,240
to bring the Ye family's
butler back for interrogation.

85
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,560
What was the cause
of death for the victim?

86
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,630
What's the problem
with the Ye family's Soochow brocade?

87
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,600
This has yet to be investigated.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,830
Since it's still pending investigation,

89
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,720
that means you don't have the evidence.

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,270
You're arresting someone
without any evidence.

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,950
Is this how
the Luyang officials do their duties?

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,430
Mind your words, Jiang Li.

93
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,120
There's a murder case in Luyang.

94
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,160
The Governor has
the authority to judge the case.

95
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,680
The Ye family's Soochow brocade is
available for sale in Zhongyuan.

96
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,480
I came from the capital.

97
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,240
Many nobles and officials
in the capital are wearing it.

98
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,160
According to your statement,

99
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,870
people who wear
the Soochow brocade died.

100
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,560
It's not a coincidence.

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,040
I suppose that aside
from the Soochow brocade in Luyang

102
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,830
is problematic,

103
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,600
the Soochow brocade
in other regions is problematic as well.

104
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,070
If the nobles
and officials in the capital

105
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,240
died after wearing Soochow brocade,

106
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,190
it'd certainly create chaos.

107
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,360
This is serious.

108
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,800
It concerns the lives
of the people of the Great Yan.

109
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Isn't it absolutely imperative

110
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,560
that we should investigate the issue

111
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,830
regarding the Ye family's
Soochow brocade?

112
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,240
You're stopping us from arresting him.

113
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,040
How are we supposed
to investigate the case then?

114
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,120
I've never stopped you
from arresting anyone.

115
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,120
The head of the Ye family is in jail now.

116
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,830
Everyone in Lizheng Hall

117
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,040
has no idea about this.

118
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,630
Moreover, you said

119
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,390
that the evidence is at the yamen.

120
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,800
If that so, you should perform autopsy,
file the relevant evidence

121
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,630
and send it to the Office
of Weaving and Dyeing.

122
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,190
Then, the Office will
send their officials

123
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,070
to investigate
the Soochow brocade case in Luyang.

124
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,920
But what did Governor Tong do instead?

125
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,480
They barged into
the residence to arrest people

126
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,720
and interrogate them.

127
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,920
Yet, you mentioned nothing
about the Office of Weaving and Dyeing.

128
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,070
He's the one
who's covering up for the Ye family.

129
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,020
Why didn't you ask

130
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,650
the Office of Weaving and Dyeing
to investigate the case, Governor Tong?

131
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,740
That's right.

132
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,210
What's wrong with the Soochow brocade?

133
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,500
Jiang Li's fallacious statements

134
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,500
are really impressive.

135
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,700
It's worse than fallacious.

136
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,820
Mr. Li.

137
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,820
She seems proficient

138
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,380
in abusing her power.

139
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,410
Official Zhu.

140
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,620
Please pass my message to Governor Tong.

141
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,590
I've written to my Father.

142
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,620
My Father will get the Office of Weaving
and Dyeing to investigate the case.

143
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,300
In just a few days,

144
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,470
the Office of Weaving and Dyeing
will send their men to Luyang.

145
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,470
By then, the truth behind

146
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,860
the problematic Soochow brocade

147
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,710
will be revealed.

148
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,260
Don't worry.

149
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,060
My Second Uncle is still detained.

150
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,150
The Ye family will not make off.

151
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,150
Official Zhu.

152
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,670
I've made myself clear.

153
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,820
If you insist to arrest us,

154
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,590
you shall face the consequences.

155
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,180
Withdraw.

156
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,060
Why are they leaving?

157
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,940
Are they leaving?

158
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,670
I have an idea,

159
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,110
but I'd need some money.

160
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,230
No worries.

161
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,790
Listen.

162
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,470
The Ye family wish
to keep the Soochow brocade

163
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,670
that you bought as evidence.

164
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,710
Aside from returning your money,

165
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,060
we'll compensate you in cash.

166
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,060
That's great!

167
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,420
Mr. Qian.

168
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,670
Please take out
all the cash in the shop.

169
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,500
If it's not enough, send someone
back to retrieve more cash.

170
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,260
Register their names.

171
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,350
Noted.

172
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,420
If you'd like to return the cloth,

173
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,790
please line up here.

174
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,620
This way please.

175
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,300
Come on.

176
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,990
One by one.

177
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,420
What a great show!

178
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,550
The exposition is mediocre,

179
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,990
but there's a sudden climax
towards the end.

180
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,380
It's still worth the money
that you paid for tea, Mr. Li.

181
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,030
Mr. Li.

182
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,150
What do you think?

183
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,820
She's just a young lady,
yet she's very capable.

184
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,060
That's interesting.

185
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,150
Well, if Grand Chancellor Jiang
who's in the capital

186
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,260
knows about this,

187
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,910
will he blame it on her?

188
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,150
If Grand Chancellor Jiang gets to know

189
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,620
that Mr. Li is involved in this,

190
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,500
he'd be cheering

191
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,820
for his daughter for fighting

192
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,910
against the evil forces today.

193
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,140
My Lord.

194
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,830
Li Jing is right.

195
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,140
Jiang Li is leveraging
on Jiang Yuanbai's name.

196
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,380
Isn't she scared...

197
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,110
She needs to leverage
on Jiang Yuanbai's name.

198
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,590
As Jiang Yuanbai is
the Secretariat Director.

199
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,740
Tong Zhiyang will be somewhat wary.

200
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,190
But Tong Zhiyang has
the Li family behind him.

201
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,380
She's trying to worsen the dispute
between the Jiang family and Li family.

202
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,590
Without any mercy.

203
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,830
Why?

204
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,620
That's her own agenda.

205
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,190
Come on.

206
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,190
Drink some water.

207
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,990
You must be thirsty.

208
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,660
She saw us.

209
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Looks like Jiang Li is still in rage.

210
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,780
Invite her again, Wen Ji.

211
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,140
Seems like Jiang Li

212
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,830
isn't willing to meet you, My Lord.

213
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,310
Tell Jiang Li

214
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,260
that I've enjoyed
a pot of good tea with Mr. Li.

215
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,310
Noted.

216
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,380
Did Li Jing

217
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,620
find this spot to watch the show,

218
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,830
or was it you, Duke Su?

219
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,950
Is there a difference?

220
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,860
Yes.

221
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,430
If Li Jing found this place,

222
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,470
I enjoyed playing the act very much.

223
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,190
But if it's you...

224
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,020
Do you have stage fright?

225
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,660
I don't have stage fright.

226
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,230
After watching every show,

227
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,710
you'd always ask me over.

228
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,190
Your sophistries

229
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,740
are apathy,

230
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,540
yet they hit the bulls eye

231
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,350
and touch the key points.

232
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,500
It put me

233
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,110
in debt to you.

234
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,660
Yet, you're

235
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,950
unbothered, sitting at the tea house,

236
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,190
showing none of your cards till now.

237
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,470
Are you really here to watch the show?

238
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,540
Are you getting angry at me?

239
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,590
Can't I?

240
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,260
Your words are really pleasant then.

241
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,140
You!

242
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,020
It's better to conduct investigation
from an elevated space.

243
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,310
A brothel isn't an elevated space.

244
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,770
Can't you let me win for once?

245
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,980
The person you met
at the brothel is called Wu LAN.

246
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,500
Wu LAN.

247
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,810
That's a nice name.

248
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,340
She's Taohong's accomplice.

249
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,170
Really?

250
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,650
What does this has
to do with the Ye family then?

251
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,460
Nothing much.

252
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,930
I just think

253
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,410
that you should know about this.

254
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,050
Okay.

255
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,570
Well noted.

256
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,690
Did she understand my explanation?

257
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,340
My Lord.

258
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,650
I understand.

259
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:41,930
You

260
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,620
are not her client.

261
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,050
My Lord is definitely not her client.

262
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,170
[Whoever does good will be rewarded]

263
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,740
Li is really incredible.

264
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,140
With just a few words,
she dominated the crowd.

265
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,620
Those shameless scoundrels

266
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,500
and scums were so terrified

267
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,620
that they couldn't even

268
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,740
open their mouths.

269
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,410
The Lizheng Hall is saved

270
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,050
all thanks to Li.

271
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,770
We're family.

272
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,810
That's what I should do.

273
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,690
You're too modest, Li.

274
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,930
You helped us

275
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,740
to overcome today's trouble.

276
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,380
It's really odd.

277
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,890
The officials

278
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,410
treated us harshly yesterday.

279
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,770
Yet today, they were so polite.

280
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,020
They even said
it's just a misunderstanding.

281
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,410
We thought

282
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,500
we need to spend a fortune to see him.

283
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,980
But he's acting oddly
and didn't take a single cent.

284
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,650
Governor Tong must be wary
of Grand Chancellor Jiang.

285
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,290
Hence, he changed his attitude.

286
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,570
He's greedy yet afraid
of ruining his career.

287
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,460
Tong Zhiyang is truly a vile man.

288
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,410
Let's not bother about him.

289
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,570
Today's suppression is just temporary.

290
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,220
We shouldn't let down our guard.

291
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:53,980
Li.

292
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,980
Did you really write to your Father?

293
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,460
Would your Father really help us out?

294
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,220
It's too complicated
to explain to my Father

295
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,050
in words.

296
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,460
The letter is for Shijie.

297
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,500
Shijie is the newly appointed

298
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,380
Serving Officer
of the Ministry of Revenue.

299
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,890
If he seeks help
from the Office of Weaving and Dyeing

300
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,100
to conduct investigations in Luyang,

301
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,410
the Office of Weaving and Dyeing
will consider it for his sake.

302
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,810
As for my Father,

303
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,530
I was just leveraging on him
to threaten Tong Zhiyang.

304
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:20,620
Otherwise,

305
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,890
they won't let us go easily.

306
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:23,930
Li.

307
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,530
If you leverage on your Father's name,

308
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,260
will he get upset?

309
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,500
My Father has spent his whole life
building his good reputation,

310
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,380
if we couldn't leverage it
to protect the family

311
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,890
nor the innocents,

312
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,170
it's useless.

313
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,650
Well.

314
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,890
You're too daring.

315
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,220
You acted on your own.

316
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,020
After you return to the capital,

317
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,340
your Father would reprimand you.

318
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,380
If this goes well,

319
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,140
it's advantageous for my Father.

320
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,570
He won't reprimand me.

321
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,500
As for Tong Zhiyang,

322
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,460
he dares not make any move recently.

323
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,890
As for the recalled Soochow brocade,

324
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,980
we need to keep it well.

325
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,340
The Soochow brocade
that I'm wearing is perfectly fine.

326
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,260
This means
that the problematic Soochow brocade

327
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,340
appeared recently.

328
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,530
Or it can also mean...

329
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,930
It's only found in Luyang.

330
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,410
Currently,

331
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,810
I can only pin my hopes
on the Office of Weaving and Dyeing

332
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,140
to prove
that the Soochow brocade is all right

333
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,890
and clear the Ye family's name.

334
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,020
Jia'er.

335
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,500
Second Aunt.

336
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,340
I believe

337
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,980
that we'll surely overcome this hurdle.

338
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,410
[Tong Zhiyang]

339
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,410
My Father has mentioned about you,
Governor Tong.

340
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,530
He said that you're quick-witted

341
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,260
and capable.

342
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,410
It's my honor
to finally meet you today.

343
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,690
I'm flattered.

344
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,770
I'm really flattered.

345
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,020
If this doesn't involve
Grand Chancellor Jiang,

346
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,650
it'll surely be done.

347
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,410
My Father has a message for you.

348
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,500
Don't worry
about Grand Chancellor Jiang.

349
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,330
You just need to do as he said.

350
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,810
One tenth of the Ye family's fortune

351
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,090
will then

352
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,690
be yours.

353
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,970
Thank you, Mr. Li.

354
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,540
Thank you, Grand Chancellor Li.

355
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,420
I left the capital in secret.

356
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,260
I couldn't stay any longer.

357
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,420
So, I'll return to the capital tomorrow.

358
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,850
I'll leave the rest

359
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,060
to you.

360
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,450
Please be rest assured,
Mr. Li and Grand Chancellor Li.

361
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,690
As long as I have
Ye Mingxuan in my hands,

362
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,780
we can certainly
take over the Ye family.

363
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,180
Thank you.

364
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,850
I'll do my best.

365
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,500
[Luyang]

366
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,780
Your Excellency.

367
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,810
We're entering Luyang.

Once we enter the city,

Who should we side with?

372
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,410
Since the Jiang family is
the one bringing the charge,

373
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,930
we should side with the Jiang family.

374
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,340

against the Governor too.

00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,770
There is indeed a sweet scent.

550
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,810
Do you know
what the smell is, Lady Jia'er?

551
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,290
I have no idea.

552
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,260
I feel dizzy.

553
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,020
Li Yu.

554
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:08,900
Put out the flame.

555
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,460
Are you all right?

556
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,530
It's quenched
when it's away from the fire.

557
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,290
There's a slight scent of burnt hair.

558
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,740
The burnt part is greyish.

559
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,770
It breaks when pressed.

560
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,020
The original ingredients are fine.

561
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,370
The sweetness must have developed
in the later stages.

562
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,330
The incense

563
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,850
or the final product have been altered.

564
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,980
It's Tuoluo from Xiyu.

565
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,180
Tuoluo?

566
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,290
Did you know, Lady Jia'er?

567
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,650
My Father saw it
while he was exploring the regions.

568
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,460
My Father told me too.

569
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,740
Tuoluo is a type of plant
that originates from Xiyu.

570
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,540
After extraction
and concoction of its juice,

571
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,260
it exhibits analgesic properties
when used in small amounts.

572
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,610
It's also hallucinogenic

573
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,740
and highly addictive.

574
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,850
However,
unprocessed Tuoluo is poisonous.

575
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,890
A few drops can be deadly.

576
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,300
It causes ulceration all over the body.

577
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,890
You're indeed knowledgeable.

578
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,260
Why would the Soochow brocade
smell like Tuoluo?

579
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,980
The incense for the Soochow brocade

580
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,330
is handmade by my Father.

581
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,540
All these years, nothing went wrong.

582
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,370
Why would we destroy our own reputation

583
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,130
and harm the innocent with this poison?

584
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,700
Lady Jia'er.

585
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,330
Before we find out the truth,

586
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:23,610
I'm afraid

587
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,330
that the Ye family is
still related to this case.

588
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,570
The Tuoluo flower is rare.

589
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,540
Its habitat is extreme.

590
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,020
It can only thrive
in the wetlands of Southern Xiyu

591
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,500
and cannot survive in other areas.

592
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,260
It costs at least a few liang of silver,

593
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,410
or even several tens of liang.

594
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,650
The more poisonous it is,
the higher the price.

595
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,090
To poison people to death
using the Soochow brocade,

596
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,700
it'd cost around
a few hundred liang of silver.

597
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,260
A bolt of premium Soochow brocade

598
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,890
only costs a few tens of liang of silver.

599
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,610
Adding the Tuoluo flower,
worth hundreds of liang of silver,

600
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,850
into the Soochow brocade

601
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,260
is not only costly,

602
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,370
but it also caused death.

603
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,890
This is definitely not
the act of a businessman.

604
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,330
Someone is trying
to sabotage the Ye family

605
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,740
by poisoning the Soochow brocade.

606
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,330
Trace back to the source.

607
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,650
We need to find out
the source of the poison.

608
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,780
Since Tuoluo isn't a local plant,

609
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,980
it must have been brought into Luyang

610
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,500
through merchants.

611
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,130
If we investigate
the merchants entering Luyang annually,

612
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,780
would we be able
to trace back to the source?

613
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,060
To find the source of the Tuoluo flower,

614
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,220
we need to report it to the officials.

615
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,460
The Office of Weaving and Dyeing
has no rights to investigate it.

616
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,810
I understand your concerns,
Your Excellency.

617
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,300
However,

618
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,260
if Your Excellency manage
to find anything useful,

619
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,700
my Father will reward you bountifully.

620
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,650
Your Excellency.

621
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,570
Shouldn't you take this chance
to befriend Grand Chancellor Jiang?

622
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,130
Do you know
what's the most dangerous thing?

623
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,700
Greed.

624
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,540
Jiang Li is just
assuming her Father's authority.

625
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,810
Are you taking it seriously?

626
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,940
I don't care
who's investigating the case.

627
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:03,500
As the Office of Weaving and Dyeing,
we found out about the Tuoluo flower.

628
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,020
Our job is done here.

629
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,940
Whether the culprit

630
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,650
is the Ye family or someone else,

631
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,300
it has nothing to do with me.

632
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,810
What should we do then?

633
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,780
Pretend.

634
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,610
Then, tell Jiang Li
that we've done our best

635
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,170
but to no avail.

636
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,370
Genius.

637
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,700
We won't offend any parties then.

638
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,850
It's apparent
that the Office of Weaving and Dyeing

639
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,260
wants us to investigate this on our own.

640
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,980
If we couldn't find it,

641
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,980
will my Father be imprisoned forever?

642
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,090
Calm down.

643
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,130
At least we have a lead

644
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,700
to follow now.

645
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,060
If only my Father were around.

00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,740
I know nothing about the logistics.

647
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,260
I don't even know who to look for.

648
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,850
I have a person in mind.

649
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,780

Who are we meeting?

733
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,980
The head of Luyang ghost market,
Lai Biao.

734
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,650
Rumor has it that he was in the army.

735
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,740
He killed millions during the war.

736
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,260
He's now in charge
of the underground market.

737
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,850
I heard that he can
do the things that yamen

738
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,130
couldn't do.

739
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,100
Like stacks of wheat

740
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:57,890
catching fire.

741
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,340
What does it mean?

742
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,820
It means that we're stupid and rich.

743
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,300
Let's see who's the foolish one.

744
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,260
Keep quiet when we're inside.

745
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:14,370
I'll go first.

746
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,170
Biao.

747
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,060
They're here.

748
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:25,650
Have a seat.

749
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,610
[Lai Biao]

750
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,370
What do you want?

751
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,090
My Master is a drug addict.

752
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,130
He's addicted
to the Tuoluo flower from Xiyu,

753
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,810
but he couldn't find it in Luyang.

754
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,370
Please show us the way.

755
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,260
Tuoluo.

756
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,060
It's not easy to find it.

757
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,690
My Master said

758
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,260
if you could help us find it,

759
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,780
you can keep the change, Biao.

760
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,610
That's really generous of you.

761
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,540
Unfortunately, you're too late.

762
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,130
We just sold out the previous batch.

763
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,980
The next batch won't arrive so soon.

764
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,780
My Master really wants it.

765
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,260
Don't you understand

766
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,370
what I said earlier?

767
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,170
Tell me the whereabouts
of the previous batch.

768
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,370
I'll ask the person to sell me some.

769
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,570
You're not here to buy things.

770
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,810
You're here to look for him.

771
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,570
Well, Biao.

772
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,130
There's no harm in telling us
who that person is.

773
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,780
To be honest,

774
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,210
the officials from the capital
is looking for him.

775
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,540
If you're involved in this,

776
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,820
it'd be bad.

777
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,610
Are you threatening me?

778
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,060
Why would I be scared
of the officials from the capital?

779
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,580
Liu.

780
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:54,690
Send the guests off.

781
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,260
Please filter my guests from now on.

782
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,690
Let's go.

783
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,570
Never mind.

784
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,370
Let's think of another solution.

785
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,570
Seriously?

786
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,210
You're the head
of Luyang underground market.

787
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,250
Your customer is offering a deal.

788
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,570
Yet, you're chasing us out.

789
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,650
I'm sure you're just

790
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,380
incapable of doing this.

791
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,170
How dare you!

792
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,460
There are dos and don'ts
in the ghost market.

793
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,980
If you're asking
for the buyer's details,

794
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,860
it's against my rules.

795
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,100
Rules are dead.

796
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,610
If he dares to buy it,

797
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,700
why would he fear anyone discovering it?

798
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,030
What if I insist to get an answer today?

799
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:38,910
You.

800
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,070
Name your price.

801
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,950
You're brave indeed.

802
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,990
I'll give you a chance then,
according to the rules.

803
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,990
Do you dare to take up the challenge?

804
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,510
What is it?

805
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,350
Your friend is one of us.

806
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,430
Ask him.

807
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,740
The Golden Water Formation challenge.

808
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,220
Golden Water Formation?

809
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,100
My Lord.

810
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Wu LAN has updated

811
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,030
that Chu Lan will
arrive in Luyang tonight.

812
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,510
She'll meet you
at the residence in the West district.

813
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,510
Be prepared.

814
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,550
Tell her to buy us
as much time as possible.

815
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,430
Noted.

816
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,830
My Lord.

817
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,990
There's one more thing.

818
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,260
Jiang Li and Mingyu

819
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,350
went to the underground market
in disguise.

820
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,140
Why?

821
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,220
They probably went to Lai Biao
because of the Ye family's

822
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,350
Soochow brocade case.

823
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,030
Judging by their looks,

824
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,910
they won't give up.

825
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,780
I heard

826
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,180
that Lai Biao has rules
about the Golden Water Formation.

827
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:49,740
Well.

828
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,260

829
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,780
What formation?

830
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,350
You can think of it

831
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,740
as a group of people drinking together.

832
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,990
The opening
of the Golden Water Formation.

833
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,470
The so-called Golden Water Formation
is a drinking game.

834
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,990
Roll the dice and the player
with the highest number wins.

835
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,220
If you lose, you need to drink.

836

According to the rules,

837
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,550
if they get drunk first,

838
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,620
they will do you a favour.

I'm okay.

843
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,350
Since we're challenging
the Golden Water Formation,

844
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,660
I'll go all out.

845
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,620
Look at those weaklings.

846
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,390

We shall drink two bowls.

854
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,660
They have so many people,
yet they only drink two bowls.

855
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,470
That's unreserved!

856

This is the rules
of the Golden Water Formation.

857
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,580
We need to defeat thrice
the number of challengers

I'm not drunk yet.

919
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,130
When you get drunk,

920
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,420
who will send you back?

921
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,330
- I...
- Are you going to spend the night here?

922
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,130
I'll send her back.

923
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:36,900
Who's that?

924
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,940
Drink as much as you like.

925
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,580
If you get drunk, I'll send you back.

926
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,130
I thought at this moment,

927
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,690
you should say

928
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,730
that you'll drink on behalf of me.

929
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,940
If you beg me...

930
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,940
I beg you.

931
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,300
You're really shameless.

932
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,780
Are you putting this on the tab?

933
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,700
No.

934
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,780
Good.

935
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:17,950
You...

936
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,070
I...

937
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,830
Don't be scared.

938
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,140
Drink till he drops.

939
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,780
Is he

940
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,700
your savior

941
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,420
or your enemy?

942
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,770
It's none of your business.

943
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,420
I'm competing with him.

944
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:34,860
Who are you?

945
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,290
It's no fun betting with him.

946
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,690
Let's have a good game together.

947
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,290
General Biao.

948
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,130
You

949
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,250
know each other?

950
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,300
He's my Father's nemesis.

951
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,580
He was involved in a case

952
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,620
and became a bandit.

953
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,470
I didn't know he had
become the head of this area.

954
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,070
I'm considered unlucky
to fall into your hands.

955
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,830
Do whatever

956
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,350
you want.

957
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:20,510
Is your Father

958
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,700
Xiao Minghan?

959
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,550
That's right.

960
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,510
You both like to be knight in shining
Armour, saving the damsel in distress.

961
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,390
Like father, like son.

962
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,740
I warn you.

963
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,140
According to our rules,

964
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,740
if you join halfway through,
you need to double up your drinks.

965
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:38,870
Shake it.

966
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,550
I'm very lucky today.

967
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,870
Open.

968
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,470
Biao wins.

969
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,300
Biao! Biao!

970
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,910
Bottoms up.

971
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,830
If this continues,

972
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:09,990
even if there were ten Xiao Hengs,
we couldn't win.

973
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:11,870
What should we do?

974
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,140
Well.

975
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,030
I've played dice for ages.

976
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,740
I know the numbers just by listening.

977
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:21,700
Hang on for two rounds.

978
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,870
Wake me up with this then.

979
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,740
It's my turn to counterattack.

980
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,390
Shake it.

981
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,510
Do you trust me?

982
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,740
Borrow me your luck.

983
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:43,700
What are you doing?

984
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,300
I'm feeling sleepy.

985
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,580
I'm just trying to stay awake.

986
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,350
You!

987
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,140
The Golden Water Formation

988
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,910
doesn't prohibit fireworks, right?

989
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,430
Open!

990
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,350
Xiao Heng wins!

991
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,510
Why are you only using this idea now?

992
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:03,580
What did you say?

993
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,300
Are you trying to get me drunk?

994
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,100
Why would I do that?

995
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:12,030
You're so skeptical.

996
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,030
Are you not upset now?

997
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,430
What are you mumbling?

998
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:20,910
Again.

999
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,510
Another round.

1000
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,620
[Uphold the good and punish the wicked]

1001
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,350
That's enough.

1002
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:49,660
You

1003
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:51,910
win.

1004
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,830
What?

1005
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,430
Say that again.

1006
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,780
Enough is enough.

1007
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:57,990
If this continues,

1008
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,350
everyone will lose their hearing.

1009
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,430
Can you tell us

1010
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,030
who is the buyer
of the Tuoluo flower now?

1011
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,430
Wait a minute.

1012
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,910
I want to talk
to your defeated opponent.

1013
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,950
Are you here to look for me

1014
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:19,780
or to save that young lad?

1015
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:20,830
Both.

1016
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,030
I'm asking you
for a favour, General Biao.

1017
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:24,990
Why should I help you?

1018
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,550
My Father saved your life.

1019
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,300
You're just and frank.

1020
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,780
You never meddle
in the disputes between the parties.

1021
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,070
You offended Li Zhongnan and
were subsequently framed and imprisoned.

1022
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,300
You were then exiled to Nanjiang.

1023
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,910
My Father knows that you're innocent.

1024
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,430
He admires your spirit.

1025
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,390
Hence, he let you go.

1026
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,620
This time, I'm going against

1027
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,950
