184
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,900
Mother, why are you here?

185
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,620
I don't know why you returned to Luyang

186
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,990
and insisted on
overturning the magistrate's case

187
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,660
but I know

188
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,110
your father has grown a lot of grey hair

189
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,380
because of you.

190
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,190
Will you be able to face your father
and the Jiang family?

191
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,020
As your mother,

192
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,020
I can't ignore your father

193
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,710
and the honor of the Jiang family.

194
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,350
When you return to the Jiang family,

195
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,830
you can explain it

196
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,380
to your father and Old Madam.

197
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,540
You are right, Mother.

198
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,110
Grandmother,

199
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,990
I have returned.

200
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,260
Good.

201
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,500
Sit.

202
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,860
Do you know why your father
isn't going to meet you?

203
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,190
I'm sure

204
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,620
father was very worried about me
regarding the Dingzhou issue.

205
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,660
I caused such a big trouble.

206
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,900
I'm sure Father is angry at me.

207
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,310
You are not related
to the Xue family's magistrate.

208
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,660
Why would you get yourself involved
in such a case?

209
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,020
You even brought so many villagers
back to the capital

210
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,140
and risked your life

211
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,860
together with the future
of the Jiang family.

212
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,070
Magistrate Xue's daughter, Xue Fangfei.

213
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,430
She's my savior.

214
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,110
When I was in Zhennyu Hall,

215
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,660
I was mistreated by the Mistress

216
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,020
and almost lost my life.

217
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,900
It was Xue Fangfei who saved me.

218
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,990
Something like that happened?

219
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,780
I went to Luyang

220
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,900
not only to visit my close ones

221
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,110
but also to meet my savior.

222
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,950
However, she passed away at a young age.

223
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,990
Her father was in danger

224
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,780
and I couldn't ignore him.

225
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,350
Li,

226
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,740
I won't stop you
if you want to repay a debt of kindness

227
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,620
but did you have to do that?

228
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,540
I know.

229
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,310
I am a part of the Jiang family.

230
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,660
Every move I make
will affect the Jiang family.

231
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
So, it wasn't my intention
to act recklessly.

232
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,020
I only wanted to go to Huaixiang
to meet my benefactor at first.

233
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,660
After I arrived at Huaixiang,

234
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,660
I accidentally discovered
that the new magistrate

235
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,230
was lawless

236
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,110
and exploited the people.

237
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,020
You didn't see it.

238
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,900
Huaixiang was a prosperous place

239
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,110
but it fell to a state

240
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,830
where people dared not step outside
of their homes during the day.

241
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,510
It was very sad.

242
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,580
Grandmother,

243
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,470
you told me

244
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,390
the family rules set by Grandfather.

245
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,630
Protect justice

246
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,110
and righteousness

247
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,390
instead of being greedy
for temporary fame.

248
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,820
It's exactly
because I am a part of the Jiang family

249
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,180
that I can't ignore the people

250
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,540
who are aggrieved and suffering.

251
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,300
I'm very happy

252
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,820
to see you have such integrity.

253
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,630
However, you could tell your father

254
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,700
and let him handle this.

255
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,510
There was no need for you
to put yourself in danger again and again.

256
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,990
I was forced to do that.

257
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,780
The new Huaixiang magistrate

258
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,230
I told you just now

259
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,820
was from the Li family.

260
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,820
What?

261
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,270
In the Soochow Brocade incident
at the Ye family in Luyang,

262
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,510
someone purposely
poisoned the Ye family.

263
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,990
I wrote a letter
to inform Father about that.

264
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,470
I also found clues in Luyang.

265
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,350
The Li family is most probably
the mastermind behind this.

266
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,630
Are you going
to overturn the case for a criminal next?

267
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,150
Since ancient times,

268
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,510
there have been countless wronged cases.

269
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,030
Only a few could be overturned.

270
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,700
If you help a death row prisoner escape

271
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,270
and can't overturn the case,

272
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,230
you'll be executed.

273
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,030
Grandmother,

274
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,150
I've gotten
Xue Huaiyuan's corruption dossier.

275
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,110
The case is a mess

276
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,390
and full of flaws.

277
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,540
Besides, if Magistrate Xue is guilty,

278
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,300
there won't be so many people

279
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,940
entering the capital with me
to make an imperial complaint.

280
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,350
The new magistrate
supported by the Li family

281
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,870
bullies the people

282
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,630
and is nefarious.

283
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,900
The people hate him.

284
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,630
I'll tell your father about this.

285
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,060
Thank you, Grandmother.

286
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,510
What?

287
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,940
The magistrate of Huaixiang
is someone from the Li family?

288
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,060
I'm not wrong.

289
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,300
The Li family and the Jiang family
have been enemies for so long.

290
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,270
Over the years,

291
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,030
the Li family has been
nurturing its faction.

292
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,350
Meanwhile, the Jiang family
is not as powerful as it used to be.

293
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,390
I'm sure you know this
better than anyone else.

294
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,030
The Li family has made their move now.

295
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,470
Are we going to turn a blind eye to it?

296
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,390
No wonder Li Zhongnan
wrote the memorial himself.

297
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,420
He wanted Jiang Li dead.

298
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,580
You've finally understood.

299
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,660
If Xue Huaiyuan's case
can be overturned,

300
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,780
we can hurt
the Li family's morale indeed.

301
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,990
However, Li Zhongnan
will also have a grudge against us.

302
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,270
When he gets an opportunity
in the future,

303
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,870
he will take revenge
on the Jiang family like crazy.

304
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,580
If you don't do anything,

305
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,660
will the Li family stop hating us?

306
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,630
They started the whole thing

307
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,540
and they've harmed the Ye family.

308
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,780
Who is the Ye family?

309
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,900
They are our relatives
bonded by marriage.

310
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,540
If we don't do anything,

311
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,780
how will the people
view the Jiang family?

312
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,780
Although Li does things
with her passion alone

313
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,150
and seemed reckless
to hit the Dengwen Drum,

314
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,900
His Majesty said he would
judge the trial himself.

315
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,300
That means His Majesty also thought

316
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,060
there was something wrong
with Xue Huaiyuan's case.

317
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,180
Doesn't that
give us a chance to counter?

318
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,940
Shuran has brought Li back now.

319
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,870
We have nothing to be afraid of.

320
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,230
Since it has come to this,

321
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,820
we should help Li

322
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,060
and strike the Li family.

323
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,510
Did you miss out?

324
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,820
What do you mean?

325
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,390
I thought you came back late

326
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,660
because you went
to the Court of Judicial Review's prison

327
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,900
to see Jiang Li

328
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,540
who looks the same as your late wife.

329
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,990
Hold it!

330
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,470
You are so boring.

331
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,140
You can't be teased at all.

332
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,190
Help me take a look

333
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,780
and see which outfit
makes me look better.

334
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,060
Help me take a look.

335
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,750
Which outfit makes me look better?

336
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,950
All bright colours suit you.

337
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,060
Don't you prefer plain colours?

338
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,670
That's because I'm lowly.

339
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,860
All right.

340
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,030
I'll choose the red outfit.

341
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,540
I'll wear it

342
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,950
to meet Second Lady Jiang.

343
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,950
Your Highness,

344
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,860
why are you going to the trial tomorrow?

345
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,380
I'll be there to add salt to the wound.

346
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,230
I hope you don't start a fire

347
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,510
and end up burning yourself.

348
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,430
Shen Yurong,

349
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,990
I've tolerated you for a long time.

350
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,270
Your Highness, please turn around.

351
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,620
I'll help you tidy your sleeves.

352
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,860
I've always wanted to know

353
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,190
that if given another chance,

354
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,270
would you bury Xue Fangfei

355
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,750
or kill me?

356
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,380
I'd rather

357
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,030
die in Your Highness' hands.

358
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,700
[Taiji Hall]

359
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,620
Second Lady Jiang.

360
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,580
Why isn't Jiang Yuanbai here with you?

361
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,060
I think you've gotten used to
the Court of Judicial Review prison.

362
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,230
You've become brave now.

363
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,820
I'm sure you are Grand Chancellor Li.

364
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,430
Thanks for your concern,

365
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,340
I've been released from prison.

366
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,670
The Secretariat Director
has always been a steady man.

367
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,780
I didn't expect her daughter

368
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,820
to be courageous.

369
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,380
Now that you've become capable,

370
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,030
it's really surprising.

371
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,470
That's too much praise,
Grand Chancellor Li.

372
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,820
It seems like
Second Lady Jiang is confident.

373
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,750
Are you sure you will get me involved

374
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,820
in today's matter

375
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,620
which is why
you don't feel scared at all?

376
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,100
What are you thinking?

377
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,430
Are you thinking about
how I know about this?

378
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,750
Let me tell you,

379
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,910
Second Lady Jiang.

380
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,300
There's nothing in this world

381
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,580
that I don't know of.

382
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,710
You are too naive

383
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,190
if you plan to play tricks

384
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,580
behind my back.

385
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,300
Even your father dares not do that

386
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,990
but a young girl like you

387
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,230
acts so greedily.

388
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,470
Are you not afraid

389
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,510
that you might die a cruel death
in the end?

390
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,190
Grand Chancellor Li, are you reminding me
to leave you a way out

391
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,380
and not back people into a corner?

392
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,030
Second Lady Jiang, you are brave.

393
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,190
You are so much better

394
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,670
than the two incapable sons of mine.

395
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,060
I wonder how long
can you keep your bravery up.

396
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,270
After today's ruling before His Majesty,

397
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,710
I'm afraid Jiang Yuanbai

398
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,430
will have no choice but to abandon you.

399
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,570
Grand Chancellor Li.

400
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,700
Duke Su, you are early as well.

401
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,810
I was standing far away

402
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,940
and couldn't hear you clearly.

403
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,700
What were you saying
to educate Second Lady Jiang?

404
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,980
She even said something about
leaving you a way out.

405
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,700
I was rude.

406
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,130
Second Lady Jiang,

407
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,170
what you said comes from the art of war.

408
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,980
It's aggressive.

409
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,370
If you meet someone old

410
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,980
such as Grand Chancellor Li
in the future,

411
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,500
you must speak cautiously.

412
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,650
Yes.

413
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,170
Duke Su, you take good care of her.

414
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:53,890
Not really.

415
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,500
I'm just better

416
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,980
at teaching someone than you,
Grand Chancellor Li.

417
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,570
We still don't know the results
of today's trial.

418
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,540
Second Lady Jiang
is still confident now.

419
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,980
I hope she can still smile
the way she does now

420
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,650
when the trial is over.

421
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,370
Farewell.

422
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,940
Duke Su, thanks for helping me
in a crisis once again.

423
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,300
This is not a crisis

424
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,700
for you.

425
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,140
You can't say that.

426
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,100
At least, I can see

427
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,190
that Li Zhongnan comes prepared.

428
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,910
In that case,

429
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,990
I have to tell you something in advance.

430
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,950
Relax.

431
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,580
I'm not planning

432
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,780
to hand you over to the opponent yet.

433
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,300
If Duke Su says that,

434
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,470
I'll need to offer my thank you gift.

435
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,340
I've been trapped
in my residence recently.

436
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,620
I sewed the handkerchief
you asked me to sew.

437
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,620
Your embroidery is good.

438
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,860
My embroidery cannot be compared
to the one who sewed your handkerchief.

439
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,820
I didn't even dare sew it at first

440
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,060
because I was afraid
I would ruin the feelings of the dead.

441
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,230
You've learned about my background?

442
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,380
Duke Su, your father, General Xiao,
is a famous general of our kingdom.

443
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,540
He was a soldier his whole life.

444
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,990
The whole world knows that.

445
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,860
Madam Yu loved her a lot.

446
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,300
She was also a woman to be respected.

447
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,710
What about your father?

448
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,510
What about me?

449
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,190
Grand Chancellor Jiang.

450
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,750
Grand Chancellor Jiang,
I'm sure you work hard

451
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,910
and love the people.

452
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,270
I have something to say to my daughter.

453
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,030
Father.

454
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,820
You've suffered.

455
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,270
I thought
you wouldn't forgive me anymore.

456
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,230
You are my daughter after all.

457
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,860
Your grandmother
told me all of your thoughts.

458
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,060
Don't be scared later.

459
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,710
Just say anything on your mind.

460
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,340
I have your back.

461
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,190
Thank you, Father.

462
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,780
[Prosperous Era]
His Majesty is here!

463
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,820
Greetings, Your Majesty.

464
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,910
Everyone, stand up.

465
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

466
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,860
[Prosperous Era]

467
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,580
Regarding the Huaixiang Magistrate,
Xue Huaiyuan's corruption case,

468
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,230
it was supposed to be judged
by the state court

469
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,140
and the dossier was handed
to the Ministry of Justice

470
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,540
to be closed.

471
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,430
Due to the people of Huaixiang
doubting the result of the case,

472
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,860
they have appealed for him.

473
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,620
His Majesty
understands the people's pleas

474
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:30,540
and ordered the Ministry of Justice to hand
the case to the Court of Judicial Review.

475
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
It will be hosted by
the Secretary of Judicial Review

476
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,580
and judged together

477
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,230
with the Ministry of Justice.

478
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,820
The trial today

479
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,030
will be supervised by His Majesty.

480
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,030
Zhou,

481
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,990
you may begin.

482
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,780
Yes.

483
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,710
Summon Second Lady Jiang.

484
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,580
Summon Second Lady Jiang!

485
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,030
Summon Second Lady Jiang!

486
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,300
I, Jiang Li, greet Your Majesty.

487
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,780
Stand and speak.

488
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

489
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,780
Second Lady Jiang,

490
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,230
did you bring the people of Huaixiang
into the capital

491
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,270
because of

492
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,950
the corruption case of Xue Huaiyuan,
the Huaixiang magistrate?

493
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,270
Secretary of Judicial Review,

494
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,540
Half a year ago,

495
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,950
the Huaixiang magistrate, Xue Huaiyuan,

496
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,950
was accused
by the magistrate's guard, Feng Yutang,

497
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,580
for embezzling the court's money.

498
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,750
He was judged to be executed
after the court's trial

499
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,670
and was awaiting his execution.

500
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,060
I went to Huaixiang to visit a friend

501
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,950
and accidentally discovered there was
more than meets the eye to the case.

502
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,780
According to my understanding,

503
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,340
All of you

504
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,140
rushed into the Huaixiang county yamen

505
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,950
on the day
when Xue Huaiyuan would be executed

506
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,820
to take him away.

507
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,780
Do you admit to this?

508
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:56,750
I admit.

509
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,470
Do you know that the action
is a serious crime?

510
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,300
I know.

511
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,860
It was a last resort.

512
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,430
If we didn't do that,

513
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,300
Xue Huaiyuan's grievance
and the suffering of Huaixiang's people

514
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,190
will never see the light of day.

515
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,140
I will take responsibility
for the crime I committed.

516
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,910
But I hope
Your Majesty and all officials

517
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,100
can help Magistrate Xue
redress the injustice before convicting me.

518
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,270
Who was in charge

519
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,540
of Xue Huaiyuan's case
at the Ministry of Justice?

520
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,060
[Prosperous Era]

521
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,540
I was in charge.

522
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,060
I remember

523
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,470
the dossier of this case
was not complicated.

524
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,620
Ten crates of silver were found
in Xue Huaiyuan's residence

525
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,580
which totaled 5,000 taels

526
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,230
and a private ledger.

527
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,950
Along with the testimony
from the county magistrate, Feng Yutang,

528
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,620
we had both evidence and a witness.

529
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,100
There was nothing strange
as Second Lady Jiang mentioned.

530
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,140
Second Lady Jiang went
to Huaixiang personally.

531
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,340
I think she had discovered
something unknown to others.

532
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,540
Since you are trying
to overturn a case for a criminal,

533
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,620
please present new evidence
before His Majesty, Second Lady Jiang,

534
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,470
and let us judge.

535
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,100
I have no new evidence.

536
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,270
How dare you.

537
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,100
Since you have no new evidence,

538
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,780
how dare you bewitch the people

539
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,860
to come to the capital
and sound the Dengwen Drum

540
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,270
and force His Majesty to retry the case?

541
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,950
Second Lady Jiang,

542
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,710
are you underestimating Your Majesty?

543
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,270
My daughter is not done talking yet.

544
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,820
Why do you feel anxious?

545
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,380
Since I can't present new evidence,

546
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,950
I will change my request.

547
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,270
Your Majesty,

548
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,950
I came all the way

549
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,300
with the people of Huaixiang
to sound the Dengwen Drum

550
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,100
not to help Xue Huaiyuan get acquitted

551
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,540
but to ask Your Majesty to convict him!

552
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,300
Silence!

553
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,140
Convict him?

554
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,060
What do you mean?

555
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,430
As you all know,

556
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,430
there's concrete evidence
to the Huaixiang magistrate,

557
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,580
Xue Huaiyuan's embezzlement.

558
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,820
He is a worm in the government.

559
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,620
Your Majesty prioritizes integrity.

560
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,510
How dare a mere magistrate of Huaixiang

561
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,990
be so daring?

562
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,190
Imprisonment and execution
cannot appease the people's anger.

563
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,510
I think

564
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,540
he should be punished
by slashing with a thousand knives.

565
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,540
Didn't she say
she is overturning the case?

566
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,580
Is she admitting defeat

567
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,030
because she has no evidence?

568
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,780
Xue Huaiyuan might have
a lowly position

569
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,340
but he is still an official
of the Great Yan.

570
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,950
He has been an official
of Huaixiang for a decade.

571
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,230
He only got found out
with corruption last year

572
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,340
and the evidence
was just a mere 5,000 taels.

573
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,300
Ten years

574
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,580
and only 5,000 taels.

575
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,300
I don't think the number is right.

576
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,540
How is it wrong?

577
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,950
For ten years,

578
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,270
he has been an official with integrity

579
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,380
or should I say
his corruption was perfect?

580
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,990
Perhaps he was working with someone else

581
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,540
to transport the money.

582
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,340
The last 5,000 taels left
was only the leftover amount.

583
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,380
Where's the other money?

584
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,340
The Ministry of Justice
did not investigate

585
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,820
and it was not recorded in the dossier.

586
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,950
Perhaps he used the money
to purchase soldiers and horses.

587
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,140
Then, he should be suspected of treason.

588
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,670
The Court of Judicial Review killed him
without investigating this.

589
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,340
If you think carefully,

590
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,380
aren't you worried?

591
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,340
We must investigate it in detail.

592
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,470
However, we have no new evidence

593
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,780
to reinvestigate this dossier.

594
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,300
What should we do?

595
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,710
That is why

596
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,620
I brought the people of Huaixiang
to the capital.

597
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,780
I want to summon witnesses.

598
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,100
Approved.

599
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,470
Summon the witnesses!

600
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,380
[Prosperous Era]

601
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,300
Kneel!

602
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,270
Regarding the Huaiyang Magistrate,
Xue Huaiyuan's corruption case,

603
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,670
what do you have to say?

604
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,030
Your Majesty,

605
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,750
I don't know about
Magistrate Xue's corruption case.

606
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,340
I only know...

607
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,860
Raise your head and speak.

608
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,910
I only know that both my daughter and I
would be bullied

609
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,380
and killed

610
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,620
if it wasn't for Magistrate Xue.

611
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,620
After my husband died,

612
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,510
I was raising my child alone.

613
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,300
When we were
at our most difficult period,

614
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,340
Magistrate Xue used his own salary

615
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,140
[Inner Tranquility]
to subsidize us.

616
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,140
He Jun,

617
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,750
help them clean the place.

618
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,340
If someone dares bully them,

619
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,470
punish them according to the law.

620
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,060
Yes.

621
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,750
Ping'an.

622
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,470
Go and thank Magistrate Xue.

623
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:29,950
Hurry.

624
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,990
[Inner Tranquility]

625
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,060
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

626
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,780
All right.

627
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,140
It's fine now.

628
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,780
No one dares bully you again.

629
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,990
If Magistrate Xue didn't sponsor me,

630
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,060
I might still be illiterate.

631
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,820
My house was poor

632
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,950
and couldn't study.

633
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,910
Magistrate Xue was generous

634
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,620
and gave me money

635
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,820
so I could return to the academy

636
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,030
and become a scholar.

637
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:52,860
Gu Da.

638
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,620
Give him money to study.

639
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,430
Get the money from my salary.

640
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,510
Yes.

641
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,140
Mother.

642
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,710
Son.

643
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,710
I can study again.

644
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,270
Yes! That's great!

645
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,030
They said the pork I sold

646
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,060
was poisonous.

647
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,670
If it wasn't for Magistrate Xue,

648
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,300
my ancestor's assets would've been stolen
by the bullies.

649
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,340
Stop!

650
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,580
I wanted to pay Magistrate Xue

651
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,620
but he refused.

652
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,910
Your Majesty,

653
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,300
please investigate it.

654
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,780
Magistrate Xue
will never do something corrupt.

655
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,270
Magistrate Xue is a good person.

656
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,270
Yes!

657
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,860
Magistrate Xue is a good person.

658
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,340
He wouldn't do something like that.

659
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:30,990
Yes!

660
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,270
These are just their testimonies.

661
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,430
If they were paid

662
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,140
to speak for the corrupt officials,

663
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,100
it wouldn't be something too difficult.

664
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,860
Zhou,

665
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,230
you need to be careful.

666
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,140
Secretary of Justice, you are right.

667
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,270
A corrupt official

668
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,990
will not do so much for the people.

669
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,430
I'm sure these people were bribed

670
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,710
and spoke nonsense.

671
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,820
Please summon other witnesses.

672
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,430
Summon the witnesses.

673
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,470
Kneel!

674
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,620
Magistrate Xue paved my entrance's road.

675
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,670
There was a flood

676
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,780
and Magistrate Xue
did not return for three days.

677
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,580
Magistrate Xue gave me money
to treat my illness.

678
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,270
Magistrate's Xue's grace...

679
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,230
Magistrate Xue's kindness...

680
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,780
If it wasn't for Magistrate Xue...

681
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,230
Your Majesty, please investigate it!

682
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,140
Your Majesty, please investigate it!

683
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,100
Every incident sounds touching.

684
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,860
They remind me

685
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,340
of the corruption case three years ago
by the Qingzhou Magistrate.

686
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,340
The magistrate embezzled
a huge amount of money back then

687
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,030
and used a small amount of money
to help the people.

688
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,030
When we seized his assets,

689
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,380
there were also many people

690
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,030
who knelt and plead

691
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,340
for him.

692
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,540
Secretary of Judicial Review,
you supervised the case.

693
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,670
Have you forgotten?

694
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,950
I still recall it.

695
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,030
Grand Chancellor Li, you are right.

696
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,340
He spent a small amount on the people

697
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,750
and a big amount on buying lands, right?

698
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,780
The Great Yan does have
such a greedy official.

699
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,860
Feng Yutang is one of them.

700
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,780
After Feng Yutang became
the Huaixiang Magistrate for half a year,

701
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,950
[Prosperous Era]
He bought furniture for himself.

702
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,380
His family members
are wearing jewellery.

703
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,230
They live a lavish lifestyle.

704
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,990
Xue Huaiyuan was a magistrate
at Huaixiang for ten years.

705
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,300
I'm sure he has more assets than him.

706
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,540
Half a year ago,
Xue Huaiyuan was imprisoned

707
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,820
and his assets were seized.

708
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,990
I request the censorate

709
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,620
to announce the assets seized
from the Xue family

710
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,540
and the Feng family.

711
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,060
Show everyone

712
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,540
how much worse

713
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,990
Xue Huaiyuan is compared to Feng Yutang.

714
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,540
Censorate, please present
both their family's assets.

715
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,140
The former Huaixiang Magistrate,
Xue Huaiyuan

716
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,430
had no houses and lands

717
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,710
when he was a magistrate.

718
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,820
The amount of money
seized from his residence

719
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,060
and his total assets
amount to a total of 5,000 taels.

720
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,950
The current Huaixiang Magistrate,
Feng Yutang,

721
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,790
has more than 40 houses
when he is a magistrate.

722
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,220
The number of fields he owned
has not been recorded yet.

723
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,350
[Prosperous Era]

724
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,510
After investigation,
his houses, fields, and savings,

725
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,470
exceed a total of 200,000 tales.

726
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,870
200,000 taels?

727
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,430
[Prosperous Era]

728
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,870
He has more than 200,000 taels?

729
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,510
A complicated 200,000 taels

730
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,700
and a clean 5,000 taels.

731
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,310
In that case,

732
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,990
Magistrate did not even leave himself

733
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,950
a piece of roof tile in Huaixiang.

734
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,620
He only embezzled 5,000 taels.

735
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,620
The money was also exchanged into ingots

736
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,870
and put into crates

737
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,390
in his own residence

738
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,540
waiting for the Ministry of Justice
to seize them.

739
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,430
He is indeed an example

740
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,220
of corrupt officials.

741
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,790
Stop using your eloquent words.

742
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,390
No matter how much

743
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,060
and how he got the money,

744
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,620
he is still corrupt.

745
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:00,310
Secretary of Judicial Review,
please summon other witnesses.

746
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,470
Summon the witnesses.

747
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,820
[Prosperous Era]

748
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,140
Your Majesty,

749
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,950
we were the guards of Huaixiang

750
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,830
when Magistrate Xue was in charge.

751
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,830
Magistrate Xue stayed in Huaixiang
for ten whole years.

752
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,790
He never acted corrupt.

753
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,140
After he was imprisoned,

754
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,660
all of us who knew the truth
were confined in a mine.

755
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:46,470
Your Majesty!

756
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,260
We are willing
to guarantee with our lives.

757
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,100
If we tell a lie,

758
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,910
our clans should be annihilated.

759
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,790
We are willing
to guarantee with our lives.

760
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,470
If we tell a lie,

761
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,030
our clans should be annihilated.

762
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,580
We are willing
to guarantee with our lives.

763
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,950
If we tell a lie,

764
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,220
our clans should be annihilated.

765
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,030
We are willing
to guarantee with our lives.

766
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,540
If we tell a lie,

767
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,060
our clans should be annihilated.

768
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,950
[Prosperous Era]
We're willing to guarantee with our lives!

769
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,310
If we tell a lie,

770
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,700
our clans should be annihilated!

771
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,340
No matter what,

772
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,770
it is true that Xue Huaiyuan is corrupt.

773
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,540
As Second Lady Jiang mentioned,

774
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,170
he should be punished
with a thousand slashes.

775
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,060
Hold it.

776
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,610
Jiang Li,

777
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,380
keep talking.

778
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,210
The Huaixiang Magistrate,
Xue Huaiyuan committed a crime.

779
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,690
When he was in charge for ten years,

780
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,340
his crime apart
from embezzling the disaster relief funds,

781
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,090
is that had almost no desires,

782
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,980
calm,

783
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,060
responsible,

784
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,020
and upright.

785
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,730
It's hard
to find a corrupt official like him.

786
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,250
So, when he was on duty,

787
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,060
he would have more plans
and evil actions.

788
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,730
When he was on duty,

789
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,380
where did his money go?

790
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,940
Building dams and footpaths,
and bribing the people.

791
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,650
He is trying to embarrass

792
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,130
the good officials of the capital
who live a lavish life

793
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,900
and own millions of mu of land.

794
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,650
He is shameless and arrogant!

795
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,420
Xue Huaiyuan's crime
must not be forgiven.

796
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,820
I request Your Majesty

797
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,290
to punish Xue Huaiyuan
with a thousand slashes.

798
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,420
In that case,

799
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,420
Xue Huaiyuan did not commit a crime

800
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,770
and even contributed instead.

801
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,690
I request

802
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,770
for the Huaixiang Magistrate,
Xue Huaiyuan to appear in court.

803
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,060
Xue Huaiyuan is a witness as well.

804
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,980
I want Your Majesty

805
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,340
to see
what Magistrate Xue looks like now.

806
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,540
Approved.

807
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,460
Summon Xue Huaiyuan.

808
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,500
[Prosperous Era]

809
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,060
Your Majesty,

810
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,980
this man is Xue Huaiyuan,
the Huaixiang Magistrate.

811
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,690
He was imprisoned by Feng Yutang

812
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,020
and was tortured.

813
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,860
He is now mentally confused

814
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,900
and behaves like a child.

815
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,690
What a pity that an upright official

816
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,690
ended up like this.

817
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,940
If news of this spreads,

818
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,540
how many upright officials
will feel scared?

819
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,130
How many people

820
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,250
will swear loyalty to Your Majesty?

821
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,210
How dare you, Jiang Li?

822
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,940
How dare you doubt His Majesty?

823
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,690
Second Lady Jiang's statement

824
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,460
is similar to mine.

825
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,340
Kind advice is hard on the ears.

826
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,380
Second Lady Jiang's words
might be out of line

827
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,540
but they sound reasonable.

828
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,770
If we abandon the upright officials

829
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,290
and only use the corrupt officials,

830
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,940
the kingdom will be in ruins.

831
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,650
Duke Su is right.

832
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,730
I'm not someone
who can't hear honest words.

833
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,770
Jiang,

834
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,540
you raised your daughter well.

835
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,730
Such an upright official
who loves the people

836
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,060
was falsely accused and sent to prison.

837
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,650
Now, he is in such a pitiful state.

838
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,940
This is my fault

839
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,420
and a loss for the Great Yan!

840
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,570
It is all of our crimes!

841
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,690
Stand.

842
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:35,940
Wei Qian!

843
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,210
You misjudged a case.

844
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,090
Do you know your crime?

845
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,500
I deserved to die!

846
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,460
I didn't know there was

847
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,500
such a nefarious person

848
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,650
like Feng Yutang.

849
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,250
Zhou Dezhao!

850
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,610
I order you to reinvestigate
Xue Huaiyuan's corruption case.

851
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,170
Those who are involved
in harming Xue Haiyuan

852
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,290
should be punished severely!

853
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,940
Yes.

854
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:02,860
Jiang Li,

855
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,730
you are brave and wise.

856
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,690
You impressed me again.

857
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

858
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,060
Stand.

859
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,820
Xue Huaiyuan's case has been cleared.

860
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,500
Zhou, you should judge

861
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,460
Second Lady Jiang's case
of escaping with the criminal.

862
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,460
Your Majesty.

863
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,210
My daughter is reckless

864
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,210
but after hearing the truth

865
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,650
about Xue Huaiyuan's case,

866
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,420
I'm reluctant to punish her
for what she did that day.

867
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,340
A good official's death

868
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,170
does not just trouble the official

869
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,210
but every official's morale.

870
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,250
My daughter made a grave mistake

871
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,380
but she saved a good official
whom I couldn't save.

872
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,540
At the hall today,

873
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,460
I...

874
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,020
I feel shameful.

875
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:02,610
We are shameful!

876
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,260
[Prosperous Era]

877
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,610
We are shameful!

878
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,250
We are shameful!

879
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,380
We are shameful!

880
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,170
We are shameful!

881
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,420
We are shameful!

882
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,090
We are shameful!

883
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,090
We are shameful!

884
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,860
We are shameful!

885
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:35,980
Zhou Dezhao,

886
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,090
what do you say?

887
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:37,900
Your Majesty,

888
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,980
Since Xue Huaiyuan
is wronged in his case,

889
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:44,540
that means he is not a criminal.

890
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,210
So, there is no truth

891
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,290
in Second Lady Jiang
helping a criminal escape.

892
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,340
It is reasonable.

893
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,250
Jiang Li,

894
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,610
I forgive you for your crime.

895
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,500
The Court of Judicial Review will
close your case and you may go home.

896
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

897
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,210
Stand up.

898
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

899
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,770
Does Xu Huaiyuan have
children and family members?

900
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:06,980
I want to compensate them.

901
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,500
Xue Huaiyuan
has one son and one daughter.

902
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,770
As far as I know,

903
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,130
his son, Xue Zhao,

904
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,980
was killed by bandits in the capital.

905
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,690
His daughter, Xue Fangfei,

906
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,420
is Mr. Shen's late wife.

907
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,940
This is too cruel.

908
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,610
When I found out
my father-in-law was corrupt,

909
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,540
I was shocked.

910
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,090
Now that I've learned

911
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,060
that he was harmed,

912
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,340
it pains me

913
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,980
now that I recall.

914
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,290
Father-in-law.

915
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:58,380
Father-in-law.

916
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,460
It must be tough for you.

917
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:06,730
Ye Shijie.

918
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,340
Magistrate Xue,

919
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,130
it's all right.

920
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,250
It's fine now.

921
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,420
Magistrate Xue,

922
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,290
it's all right.

923
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,380
It's fine now.

924
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,900
Mr. Shen, please forgive him.

925
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,210
You've not met Magistrate Xue
for a long time.

926
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,020
I'm afraid
he can't recognise you anymore.

927
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:26,290
Zhou,

928
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:27,900
Magistrate Xue is in shock,

929
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,210
can I take him back to rest?

930
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,170
You may leave.

931
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,610
Who wrote this script?

932
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,090
It's really cruel.

933
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,170
What do you mean?

934
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,610
The father is corrupt.

935
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,020
The daughter was in an affair.

936
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,420
The son died in an accident.

937
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,650
The whole family faced a disaster
one after the other.

938
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,290
Isn't this common in storybooks?

939
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,380
What storybook?

940
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:00,290
Framing

941
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:01,570
and killing a witness.

942
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,290
Framing?

943
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,420
Was Mr. Shen's late wife framed

944
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:08,690
for having an affair as well?

945
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,060
That's not necessary.

946
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,860
Duke Su is brave.

947
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,420
He dares say anything.

948
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:14,820
Duke Su,

949
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,250
I'll leave this to you.

950
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,860
Investigate the truth
behind the Xue family's death

951
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,460
and prove the Xue family's innocence

952
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,290
so Mr. Shen can be relieved.

953
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,020
Yes.

954
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,900
Interesting.

955
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:34,170
[Prosperous Era]

956
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,210
How interesting.

957
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,460
This is
such an interesting court trial.

958
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,820
Why didn't Your Majesty call me?

959
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,210
An investigation is not child's play.

960
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,340
Why did you come here?

961
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,020
I have something important
to inform you.

962
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,460
Second Lady Jiang has a sharp tongue.

963
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,500
She has successfully overturned

964
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,380
the Xue family case.

965
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,500
What a pity that
while Your Majesty was feeling outraged

966
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,020
by your officials being harmed,

967
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,770
have you thought

968
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:10,060
that you were also fooled

969
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,730
like a donkey?

970
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,210
Wanning,

971
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,690
don't speak nonsense.

972
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,290
What a coincidence.

973
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,500
I heard Mr. Shen's wife

974
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,650
was Huaixiang's most talented lady

975
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,570
so I got curious
and went to take a look.

976
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:27,500
Indeed.

977
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,730
Mrs. Shen has a unique face.

978
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,730
It is rare indeed.

979
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,570
So, I was shocked

980
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,290
when I saw Second Lady Jiang

981
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,060
because she looks exactly the same

982
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,570
as Xue Fangfei.
