[Spring of the First Year of Tianbao,

Master Li's ink artwork
is indeed valuable.

72
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,870
The value lies in its artistic charm.
So it's priceless and rare.

But

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,630
this painting is an imitation.

It's really an imitation.

77
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,430
Take a look
at this silk fabric for painting.

78
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,560
In the previous dynasty,
they only produced silk cloth

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,680
that was coarse and thin.

80
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,800
But the silk fabric of this painting
is pristine and delicate.

81
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,560
This is clearly double silk.

82
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,510
So Master Li of the former dynasty

83
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,240
couldn't have used double silk
of this dynasty.

This seal is also fake.

The former dynasty
seldom used stone-carved seals.

86
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,040
If it were a seal
from the former dynasty,

87
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,190
it would have the unique marks
of the seals from that time.

88

The ends of each stroke
in the seal script

89
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,120
would be slightly thicker
than the original stroke,

90
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,070
and the color would be lighter,
appearing yellowish.

91
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,920
But the ends of the strokes
in the seal on this ink artwork

92
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,500
are all smooth,

93
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,000

98
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,230

183
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,190
That Meng Hongjin is the daughter

184
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,990
of General Xuanwei, Meng Youde.

185
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,900
When she gets angry,
she even dares to bite a dog.

186
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,190
Why didn't you say earlier?

187
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,990
You've already done him
such a huge favor.

188
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,860
You should discuss
the Entry Exam with him.

189
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,500
No rush.

190
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,740
We're running out of time here.

191
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,900
Fine. Let's see
when you start getting anxious.

192
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,860
Carry this box for me.

193
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,710
Second Lady Jiang,
His Lordship wants to buy you tea.

194
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,020
Duke Su?

195
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,350
Did she commit some crime again?

196
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,260
Mr. Jiang, we're just inviting her
for some tea.

197
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,190
Oh, tea.

198
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,860
Then I'll go with her.

199
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,620
Mr. Jiang.

200
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,110
His Lordship only invites
Second Lady Jiang.

201
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,950
There's nothing Duke Su
and I can talk about.

202
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,110
We shall take our leave then.

203
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,190
Excuse us.

204
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,140
We'll take this way.

205
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,110
This way, then.

206
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,830
Jiang...

207
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,740
It's fine.

208
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,500
Listen. I have a bad temper.

209
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,710
- Jiang Jingrui.
- Hey, buddy.

210
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,540
Here's some money.

211
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,310
Ouch!

212
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,590
I'll go now.

213
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,020
[Awakening Stone. Drunken Moon]

214
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,380
Duke Su, what matters do I owe again?

215
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,430
You're the second person
who asked that question today.

216
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,020
Please have some tea.

217
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,590
I dare not.

218
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,710
I thought I was brought here
to be interrogated.

219
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,020
Don't be so angry,

220
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,110
Li.

221
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,500
Duke Su,

222
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,380
the name "Li" was given by an elder.
[*Also a cat breed]

223
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,190
We're not close enough
for you to address me as such.

224
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,740
When a cat is caught by the tail,

225
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,190
it looks just like you do now.

226
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,420
I've had my tea.

227
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,470
So I'll take my leave.

228
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,260
[Awakening Stone. Drunken Moon]

229
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,940
Duke Su, what's the meaning of this?

230
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,420
Why did you stand up
for Ye Shijie earlier?

231
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,940
Ye Shijie is my cousin.

232
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,270
I can't ignore him when he's in trouble.

233
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,230
I heard this year's exam requires students
from two schools to team up.

234
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,350
Did you set your eyes on him?

235
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,630
Yes. Is that a problem?

236
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,630
Shen Yurong is in charge of the exam
by imperial decree.

237
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,580
Do you think

238
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,300
you can pass under his watch?

239
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,540
If I can't pass,

240
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,230
are you going

241
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,700
to accuse him

242
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,350
of favoritism and corruption for me?

243
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,750
Smart enough.

244
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,110
Second Lady Jiang,

245
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,110
I heard a story before.

246
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,060
It's pretty interesting.

247
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,700
How about I tell you about it?

248
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,180
It's called,
"Duke Huang of the East Sea".

249
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,900
Duke Huang from the East Sea
gained divine power in his youth.

250
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,630
He went up the mountains
taming wild beasts and admired by many.

251
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,630
He thought he was unrivaled.

252
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,990
Later, a big white tiger appeared
in the East Sea.

253
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,110
Duke Huang went to subdue it

254
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,230
but was killed instead.

255
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,060
Have you heard this story?

256
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,870
Duke Su, are you trying to remind me

257
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,270
that the people I face now

258
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,990
are just young snakes and weak tigers,

259
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,780
luckily subdued by me?

260
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,230
If I encounter a real fierce tiger
in the future,

261
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,870
I won't escape death either.

262
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,270
Second Lady Jiang,
I rarely read people's fortunes.

263
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,820
But I'll make an exception today.

264
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,700
The path you're on

265
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,150
has a fierce tiger ahead
and a cliff behind.

266
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,750
I advise you to pause

267
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,580
and think carefully
before moving forward.

268
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,300
Who is the real fierce tiger?

269
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,150
You will find out in time.

270
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,900
Li,

271
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,700
I have no choice.

272
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,350
If she wants,

273
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,990
she could crush us like ants.

274
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,700
Duke Su, you've been an official
for many years.

275
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,110
Have you ever killed a tiger?

276
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,230
What were you thinking
when you killed it?

277
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,470
When I raise my blade and bring it down,
I think of nothing.

278
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,030
I think of nothing but seeking justice.

279
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,700
Justice?

280
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,940
It's ugly.

281
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,350
Try to make do with it.

282
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,110
What does my business
have to do with you?

283
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,990
Maybe in the future,

284
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,230
our paths will converge.

285
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,900
Second Lady Jiang

286
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,180
stomped on the snack you gave her.

287
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,900
Well stomped.

288
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,300
If you want to enjoy the show,

289
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,110
you must first support the actors.

290
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,180
Tong.

291
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:34,990
Tong?

292
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,180
Li.

293
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,580
Li, why are you back so late?

294
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,900
Something happened after school.

295
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,230
I got into a conflict.

296
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,390
It will probably reach home soon.

297
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,750
We must make the preparations.

298
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,630
My Lady, I have a message
from Old Madam.

299
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,870
She wants you to go to Wanfeng Hall.

300
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,660
[Wanfeng Hall. Humble Underneath]

301
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,700
You're the mother,

302
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,900
you can just handle it yourself.

303
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,660
Why drag me into this?

304
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,110
In the past, I always thought

305
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,580
Li should learn proper manners
before attending the School of Integrity.

306
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,230
Li knows this.

307
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,150
But I'm worried
she might not accept it willingly

308
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,630
if I were to handle this matter.

309
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,030
Old Madam, she listens to you.

310
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,660
I hope you can teach her
our family rules and traditions well.

311
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,350
Second Lady is here.

312
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,990
Greetings, Grandmother.

313
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,630
Greetings, Mother.

314
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,990
Li, Yu'er said

315
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,030
you had a dispute with Lady Meng
in public today.

316
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,300
Is that true?

317
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,990
Yes, it is true.

318
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,510
Do you know that Lady Meng's
father is General Xuanwei?

319
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,700
Yes, I know.

320
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,940
If you know,

321
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,990
why did you still confront her?

322
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,150
Your actions will put your father
in a difficult position.

323
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,060
Mother,

324
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,660
I don't know how this matter

325
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,870
had anything to do with Father.

326
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,620
Li, you may not know this.

327
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,710
General Xuanwei and Chancellor Li
have a close relationship.

328
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,380
Although they don't seem
to interact much on the surface,

329
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,380
they have deep connections.

330
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,470
In court,

331
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,820
Chancellor Li and your father
often have differing opinions.

332
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,430
Your actions have now escalated

333
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,100
the tension between them.

334
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
Chancellor Li?

335
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,300
Who is the real fierce tiger?

336
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,470
You will find out in time.

337
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,750
Our Jiang family has always
had strict family rules.

338
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,780
The most important rule
is not to stir up trouble.

339
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,470
That doesn't mean

340
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,190
our children should hide

341
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,910
when they make mistakes or face issues.

342
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,470
But in the capital,
the officialdom is complex

343
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,780
and people are complicated.

344
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,100
Your father has a hard time
navigating around it.

345
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,140
Li, you were reckless this time.

346
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Grandmother, please calm down.

347
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,710
It was also my fault
for not keeping an eye on Li.

348
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,710
She is straightforward

349
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,710
and may clash with other students.

350
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,710
I'll make sure to step in
and stop her next time.

351
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,060
You're indeed wrong.

352
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,950
Your sister just started
at the School of Integrity

353
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,510
and isn't familiar with the rules there.

354
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,300
You should have watched out for her.

355
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,710
How could you leave her alone?

356
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,950
Old Madam,

357
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,860
it's also my fault

358
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,580
that Li got into this trouble today.

359
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,030
How about Li stays with me

360
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,670
for a few days

361
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,820
to learn the rules?

362
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,540
I want her to quickly learn

363
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,190
the ways of the capital.

364
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,950
No rush.

365
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,100
We still need to listen
to what Li has to say.

366
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,300
Grandmother,

367
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,430
I did nothing wrong today.

368
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,030
Years ago, I made a mistake
and was sent to Zhennv Hall.

369
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,030
Father bore the brunt
of the scandal because of me.

370
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,380
It was my lack of education
and carelessness.

371
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,140
People gossiped badly

372
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,470
about Father.

373
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,430
By chance,

374
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,300
I recognized that the painting
was a fake today,

375
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,670
which disproved
the rumors of my ignorance

376
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,100
and restored Father's reputation.

377
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,340
Moreover,

378
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,860
knowing the painting was fake
and not exposing it would be dishonest.

379
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,300
Although there were some mistakes today,

380
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,470
they didn't harm anyone's dignity.

381
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,270
If I just kept quiet about this,

382
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,540
that would tarnish
the Jiang family's reputation.

383
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,300
If you put it that way,

384
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,100
you've also considered
the bigger picture.

385
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,780
Grandmother,

386
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,860
no matter how well Li explained it,

387
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,470
it doesn't change the fact

388
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,750
that she got into a dispute
in the street.

389
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,100
There's no justification
for our family's conduct.

390
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,060
She was almost in a fight
with someone on the street.

391
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,230
Onlookers were pointing fingers

392
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,140
at the Jiang family.

393
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,300
When others are criticizing
the Jiang family,

394
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,380
you just stand by and watch?

395
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,950
I...

396
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,750
I only heard about it.

397
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,910
By the time I arrived,
the crowd had dispersed.

398
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,430
Yu'e, don't take rumors seriously.

399
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,580
How could relay this to Grandmother?

400
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,300
The gossip is so unpleasant.

401
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,340
Imagine how disgraceful
you were at the time.

402
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,190
I also heard

403
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,670
that the person who was tricked
by Meng Hongjin

404
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,670
is Ye Shijie of the Ye family
from Luyang.

405
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,380
They have a close relationship with Li.

406
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,340
So it's no wonder
she defended him fervently.

407
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,270
Since they're family
and both studying in the capital,

408
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,300
why has Li never mentioned him

409
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,990
after returning home all this time?

410
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,910
It seems like our Jiang family

411
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,510
is deliberately distancing ourselves
from relatives.

412
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,470
Li, were you in contact
with the Ye family

413
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,470
even before you returned?

414
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,780
I've never met Ye Shijie.

415
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,620
If Ruoyao hadn't informed me,

416
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,950
I wouldn't have known he was my cousin.

417
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,620
I didn't expect to unknowingly help

418
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,100
a relative in distress.

419
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,780
Grandmother,
my birth mother may have passed away.

420
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,510
But she was related to the Ye family.

421
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,230
If I turn a blind eye

422
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,030
and let my cousin be taken

423
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,860
to the county office,

424
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,270
if this matter spreads

425
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,030
what would people think

426
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,860
of the Jiang family's upbringing?

427
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,470
What about Father?

428
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,300
Why are you dragging Father into this?

429
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,540
That's right.

430
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,750
You may not know this, my dear sisters.

431
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,300
An official from the Ministry of Rites

432
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,580
disrupted his elder brother's funeral
because he was drunk.

433
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,540
When the officials brought it up,

434
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,860
he was accused
of disregarding familial relations.

435
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,380
Out of anger, the Emperor punished him
with ten floggings.

436
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,060
Being an official,
it's not easy for Father.

437
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,510
If this matter were blown out
of proportion,

438
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,580
what should we do then?

439
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,910
Yu'e, I wonder who you meant

440
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,030
being disgraced?
Whose reputation is at stake?

441
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,470
Li is right.

442
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,030
We owe Li a lot

443
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,780
over these ten years.

444
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,860
I understand

445
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,340
if you've been resenting the family.

446
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,820
I just hope you can forgive and forget.

447
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,620
After all,
you have Ye family blood in you.

448
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,670
If you're close to your cousin,

449
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,950
there's no need to keep it from us.

450
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,950
Keep it from you?

451
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,270
Are you saying I'm not being honest?

452
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,300
I will always believe whatever you say.

453
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,950
Grandmother!

454
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,710
Grandmother.

455
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:30,950
Greetings, Grandmother.

456
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,820
Greetings, Aunt Shuran.

457
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,710
Aunt Shuran,

458
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,540
I was with Jiang Li when it happened.

459
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,910
I can testify for her.

460
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,950
Jiang Li didn't intend to hide anything.

461
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,540
At first,

462
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,670
she didn't know the people
who were in dispute.

463
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,540
She only found out after I told her.

464
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,100
Whether it's disgraceful
or making a scene or not,

465
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,190
the door is wide opened, Aunt Shuran.

466
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,910
You can hear what people are saying.

467
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,060
Everyone

468
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,750
at the scene

469
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,670
praised Jiang Li.

470
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,820
Our Second Lady Jiang's
reputation outside

471
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,620
is good.

472
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,430
I know you're close with Li.

473
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,230
You'd naturally take her side.

474
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,950
But as a lady,

475
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,750
we should always watch our conduct.

476
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,820
It's admirable for Li
to stand up for justice.

477
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,510
But for a lady to interfere
in men's affairs in public

478
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,540
is not elegant and reflects poorly
on our morals.

479
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,780
Speaking of morals,

480
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,540
you're trying to make
a logical argument today?

481
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,060
Then can you criticize Duke Su too?

482
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,510
What does this have to do with Duke Su?

483
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,270
Grandmother, if you must know.

484
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,510
Naturally, it's because
he praised Jiang Li endlessly.

485
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,620
After the matter was resolved,

486
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,060
we were about to leave

487
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,300
when Duke Su personally sent someone

488
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,100
to invite Jiang Li for tea.

489
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,300
What did he say to you?

490
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,860
What did he say?

491
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,380
Nothing much.

492
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,780
He just complimented me.

493
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,270
Duke Su said,
"Like father, like daughter".

494
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,380
He also sent his regards to Father.

495
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,860
Since that's the case,

496
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,910
it seems today's incident
was not Jiang Li's fault after all.

497
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,860
All right. Now that everything is clear,

498
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,710
you can all go back.

499
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,750
Well, the children are young

500
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,140
and afraid of tarnishing
the family's reputation

501
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,540
ended up disturbing Old Madam's rest.

502
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,510
We'll leave now.

503
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,510
We won't be disturbing you now.

Grandmother, I'll take my leave too.

505

Grandmother, I'll take my leave too.

506
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,860
I was worried at first.

507
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,510

[Wanfeng Hall]

509

Duke Su sure is useful.

510
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,860
No wonder you insisted

511
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,270
that I mention Duke Su
in front of Grandmother.

512
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,540
One praise from him is enough

513
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,910
to outweigh a hundred criticisms
from Ji Shuran.

514
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,380
Did Duke Su really praise you?

515
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,100
No.

516
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,780
I can't believe you made such a lie.

If Duke Su finds out later,

518
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,190
he will surely hold you accountable.

519

What a true gentleman.

In the past, you only focused
on studying the classics.

00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,260
from such slander.

729
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,660
Could there be some misunderstanding?

730
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,990
Please blame me for being harsh.

731
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,140
The Ye family of Luyang

732
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,700
is a merchant family.

733
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,430
Do you think they genuinely
want to take you back?

734
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,260
They just want to control and use you

735
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,580
and leverage My Lord's official position

736
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,700
for their business in the future.

737
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:56,620
They say a stepmother's life
is difficult.

738
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,580
If you go with that Ye family,

739
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,350
it will confirm the slander

740
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,620
against Madam.

741
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,260
Those are slanders!

742
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:11,310
They just trying
to push Madam to the brink.

743
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,430
Mother, don't be angry.

744
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,660
I won't go anywhere.

745
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,350
The Jiang family is my home.

746
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,740
I won't let anyone bully Mother.

747
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,100
It's heart wrenching.

748
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,660
I was young and foolish then.

749
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,350
I believed their words

750
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,660
about the Ye family being greedy.

751
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,660
How was your life

752
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,700
in the Jiang family afterward?

753
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,660
How did your stepmother treat you?

754
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,620
She was meticulous.

755
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,740
She's always kind
to me in public and private.

756
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,910
If I didn't want to study,
I didn't have to.

757
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,030
If I didn't want to practice calligraphy,
I didn't have to.

758
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,140
If I didn't want to do embroidery,

759
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,990
I didn't have to.

760
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,790
She covered up my mistakes

761
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,740
and allowed me

762
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,470
to become more and more arrogant
at home.

763
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,220
Are you suggesting...

764
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,660
Spoil me rotten.

765
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,620
These are just your words.

766
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,540
Now you're telling me all this

767
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,830
because you want to reconcile
with the Ye family

768
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,140
without offending
the Meng family, right?

769
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,620
So you're upset with me

770
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,350
because of this incident.

771
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,100
Are you upset

772
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,030
about not sending Meng Hongjin
to the authorities

773
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,060
and giving her a way out?

774
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,140
Isn't that so?

775
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,140
I didn't mean to give her a way out.

776
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,700
It's just that in this complex capital,

777
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,100
there are various powers at play.

778
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,830
Even though the Ye family is wealthy,

779
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,060
their lack of official positions

780
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,870
makes them vulnerable.

781
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,700
In the world of officials and merchants,

782
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,260
officials have authority over merchants.

783
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,910
Giving Meng Hongjin a way out

784
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,060
is also for your sake.

785
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,910
If you kept pushing
and causing a fallout,

786
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,140
the Meng family
would seek a death warrant.

787
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,540
You're a smart person.

788
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,030
You were just upset yesterday.

789
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,540
That's why I dare to remind you of this.

790
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,870
I understand that.

791
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,310
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have let her off this time.

792
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,540
What do you mean by this?

793
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,910
I never like owing any favors.

794
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,830
This is my gratitude
for your help yesterday.

795
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,990
Your way of expressing thanks

796
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,620
is indeed characteristic
of the Ye family.

797
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,950
Your family is of a business background.

798
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,660
But I am not.

799
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,030
If my assistance becomes a transaction,

800
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,660
wouldn't I also become
someone like Meng Hongjin?

801
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,700
Return it in another way.

802
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,580
What do you have in mind?

803
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,510
Team up with me

804
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,510
and help me pass the exam.

805
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,470
This...

806
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,390
It shouldn't be difficult
for you, right?

807
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,740
To be honest,

808
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,740
Li Lian approached me.

809
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,030
Li Lian, the son of Li Zhongnan?

810
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,580
Yes.

811
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,390
Do you know the relationship

812
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,180
between Meng Hongjin and Li Lian?

813
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,350
Do I need to know?

814
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,910
General Xuanwei, Meng Hongjin's father,

815
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,260
has a close relationship
with Li Zhongnan.

816
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,260
The two families have deep ties.

817
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,430
Perhaps Li Lian and Meng Hongjin
are already acquainted.

818
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,990
You shouldn't speculate
on this matter so lightly.

819
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,580
When did Li Lian approach you?

820
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,260
It was after Meng Hongjin
caused trouble.

821
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,540
That's right.

822
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,950
What do you mean?

823
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,430
I'm guessing he would say
if you join his group,

824
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,310
similar incidents

825
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,310
won't happen to you again.

826
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,350
How did you know?

827
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,310
In that case,

828
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,660
Li Lian was behind Meng Hongjin's plot.

829
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,430
Shijie,

830
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,100
their original plan

831
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,220
was to use Meng Hongjin
to make things difficult for you first.

832
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,030
Then come to your aid

833
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,660
when you're helpless against Lady Meng.

834
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,870
They just want to recruit you.

835
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,510
But they didn't expect me to show up.

836
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,260
Are you telling me this

837
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,510
to form a team with you

838
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,510
so you can pass the exam?

839
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,580
I want to establish myself
in the School of Integrity.

840
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,990
But what I want most

841
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,430
is for the Ye family to know

842
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,030
the real Jiang Li.

843
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,390
When I was young, I was deceived,

844
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,740
which broke Grandmother's heart.

845
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,660
The truth is,

847
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,660

I'll join you.

Has General Meng's side
been taken care of?

852
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,870
Don't worry.

853
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,060
We sent clothes to his wife.

854
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,060
They also responded with gifts as well.

855
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:44,220
The issue between Li and Meng Hongjin
is considered settled.

856
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,260
I originally thought Li

857
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,180
would face bullying upon entering
the School of Integrity.

858
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,060
But I didn't expect her

859
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,310
to have such courage.

860
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,790
My Lord,

861
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,220
you have always been cautious
in court matters.

862

The School of Integrity
and the Imperial Academy

863
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,700
are for high-ranking officials
and nobles.

864
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,510
The conflict between Li
and Meng Hongjin is not a concern.

865
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,430
But I fear

866
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,790
it might cause trouble in the future

868

I shouldn't be bogged down
by such matters.

If Li can achieve such great things,
