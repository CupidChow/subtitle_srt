The others, too!

Tong, stop playing with water.

20

Hurry up

21
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,000
and water the plants.

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:45,920
Hey!

23
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,150
Focus on the work of posts.

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,480
Wipe all eight posts down.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,790
Come.

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,070
Put it here. Put it on the ground.

28
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,000
Then put one here.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,870
Put one here. Do you copy?

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,760
- Yes.
- Xiangqiao.

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,960
simply beautiful.

My Lady.

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,710
You must be thirsty.

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,310
Should I get you some tea and pastries?

42
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,470
- Sure.
- Hey, you!

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,310
What's wrong with the flowers?

44
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,590
They look bad.

45
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,150

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,840
What flowers?

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,190
Just some common peonies, tree peonies,

50
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,030
and chrysanthemums.

51
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,190
Pretty common.

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,750
But it's

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,750
quite a lot.

54
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,910
I heard that Xiangqiao and Yunshuang

55
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,800
moved them back and forth

56
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,400
to fill the courtyard.

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,430
It's still something to talk about.

58
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,680
Ask everyone in Jiang's Residence

59
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,150
to say that Second Lady Jiang

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,680
acts recklessly
as soon as she comes back.

61
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,400
Not only does she squander,

62
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,520
but she also ill-treats her servants.

63
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,560
Got it.

64
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,710
Is the gift for Mr. Shen ready?

65
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,680
Yes.

66
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,120
Come.

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,400
Look.

68
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,960
These are the best snacks

69
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
from Ji's family.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,400
Come.

71
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,360
The credit for compiling the book
goes to you.

72
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,680
I just shared some ideas with you.

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,280
It makes us look distant

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,120
that you come and offer thanks.

75
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,520
Without your guidance,

76
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,150
I would not have been able
to satisfy His Majesty.

77
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,840
I'm honored to pay a visit.

78
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,120
I would like to take this opportunity

79
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,710
to thank you for your help.

80
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,590
Done talking?

81
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,080
My man often compliments you

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,400
for being a role model
for the younger generation in the court.

83
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,870
You're flattering me.

84
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,590
Mr. Shen.

85
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,680
This is a token of our regard.

86
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,630
Please accept it.

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,190
Thank you, Prime Minister.
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,520
Please feel free

90
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,240
to show up.

91
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,360
It would be a great honor.

92
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,360
I should leave now.

93
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:20,950
All right.

94
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,750
Please see Mr. Shen off.

95
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,270
Yes.

96
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,240
This way.

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,310
My Lady, should I put this over here?

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
Yes, just put it over there.

99
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,160
All right.

100
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,510
Put these here.

101
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,720
Be careful.

102
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,190
Mind your step.

103
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,920
Put this over there.

104
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,720
Got it.

105
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,630
Mr. Shen.

106
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,310
Put some more over there.

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,040
This way, please.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Mr. Shen.

109
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,240
All right.

110
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,190
My Lady.

111
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,160
Xiangqiao is here.

112
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,600
Xiangqiao.

113
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,750
Have a seat.

114
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,800
I...

115
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,240
You've had a hectic day.

116
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,240
Have a seat.

117
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,390
All right.

118
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,510
Open it.

119
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,160
My Lady.

120
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,240
You give...

121
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,160
Take it.

122
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,560
Thank you, My Lady.

123
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,000
This...

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,560
This is too expensive.

125
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,360
More is yet to come.

126
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,120
What did I do to deserve it?

127
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,950
Well...

128
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,310
Thank you, My Lady.

129
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,560
Xiangqiao.

130
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,950
You need to look after
the flowers in this garden.

131
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,630
Dry weather increases body heat.

132
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,240
Chrysanthemum dispels heat.

133
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,040
When you have time,
pick some chrysanthemums

134
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,190
in the yard,
and sundry them to make tea.

135
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,390
Needless to say.

136
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,800
I was going to make this for you today

137
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,430
but the Lord had a guest.

138
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,800
I'd been rushing around
thanks to Mrs. Jiang

139
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,830
and I forgot about it.

140
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,920
Who was the visitor?

141
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,680
You made much of him.

142
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,310
It's Mr. Shen, Shen Yurong.

143
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,240
My Lady.

144
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,830
I'm not that thirsty.

145
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,480
Was Mr. Shen you mentioned

146
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,510
the scholar whose wife just died?

147
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,510
Yes.

148
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,480
Mr. Shen
is the Principal Graduate of the Year.

149
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,270
The Lord thinks highly of him.

150
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,800
He is even invited

151
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,120
to the Third Lady's adult ceremony.

152
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,390
Is he?

153
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,680
That's right.

154
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,270
It's a pity
that his wife was a bad woman.

155
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,430
She even cheated on Mr. Shen

156
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,270
and wanted to escape
after being discovered.

157
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,310
Guess what?

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,160
She fell off a cliff.

159
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,120
Serve her right!

160
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,920
Poor Mr. Shen,
he was head over heels in love.

161
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,800
He didn't eat or drink
for three days and three nights

162
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,950
when he heard about his wife's death.

163
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,830
The love of Mr. Shen

164
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,560
is deep.

165
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,310
But maybe there is divine justice.

166
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,680
His Majesty values love and loyalty.

167
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,800
In appreciation of Mr. Shen's devotion,

168
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,000
His Majesty even issued a decree
to praise him.

169
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,310
I heard

170
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,830
that His Majesty

171
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,040
is paying more attention to him now.

172
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,750
It's a blessing in disguise.

173
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,240
I

174
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,160
see.

175
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,600
Mr. Shen...

176
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,120
Xiangqiao.

177
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,800
Shouldn't you
take care of the flowers now?

178
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,800
I haven't finished.

179
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,360
It's okay, let's go.

180
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,120
I'll see you off.

181
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,750
The bangle!

182
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,720
- My Lady, see you.
- Let's go.

183
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,630
I'll continue later.

184
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,120
Miss.

185
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,240
Miss.

186
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,120
What's wrong, Miss?

187
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,360
Tong.

188
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,440
Mrs. Shen

189
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,200
who is known by everyone

190
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,200
as an evil woman of infidelity

191
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,000
is me.

192
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,440
I thought
it was an ordinary family dinner.

193
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,390
It's been a long time

194
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,600
since we get together for a meal.

195
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,390
I was busy with the book compilation

196
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,960
and neglected my family.

197
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,670
My lady, thank you
for your careful attention to detail.

198
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,790
Thanks also to Mother and Ruyun
for helping out.

199
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,670
Come.

200
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,030
Let's raise our cups.

201
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,480
Wishing my son a prosperous career ahead

202
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,910
and bring honor to our ancestors.

203
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,720
Li.

204
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,360
Everyone drinks wine

205
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,200
but you drink tea.

206
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,480
What do you mean?

207
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,550
Mother.

208
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,550
I'm not feeling well today.

209
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,030
I'll drink tea instead of wine.

210
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,910
Just a sip.

211
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,910
Li is not feeling well.

212
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,720
Don't force her.

213
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,870
Li.

214
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,030
Just do Mother a favor.

215
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,390
Drink it.

216
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,200
A grown son cannot be kept for long.

217
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,550
My son is ungrateful.

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He always takes the other side.

219
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,790
We are a family.

220
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,440
Mother, don't talk nonsense.

221
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,270
Mother.

222
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,440
I was not feeling well

223
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,200
and offended you.

224
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,030
Today is a day of celebration.

225
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,030
Be happy.

226
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,670
Who knew that the wine was drugged?

227
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,390
Shen Yurong sent me back to the room.

228
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,510
When I woke up...

229
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,480
Who are you?

230
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,480
Madam.

231
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,670
I once suspected

232
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
that the mother and daughter
of the Shen family framed me.

233
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,200
But I never thought

234
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,750
that Shen Yurong knew about it.

235
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,600
I know.

236
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,120
Miss.

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,870
I know.

238
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,030
I thought my lady

239
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,600
was the most miserable person
in the world.

240
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Little did I know that you...

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
I was a fool.

242
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,720
In the end, I got my father

243
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,600
and brother into trouble

244
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,720
and killed.

245
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,200
All of them are blood debts.

246
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,720
God's justice will prevail.

247
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,320
Those evildoers

248
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,320
must be punished.

249
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,750
All right.

250
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,750
Miss.

251
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,750
I'll help you.

252
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,600
I will help you.

253
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:13,910
Tong.

254
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,800
♪I'm willing to follow her home♪

255
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,360
Tong.

256
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,440
Since the people
who framed Jiang Li and me

257
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,960
will turn up at the ceremony,

258
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,630
we need to change our plan.

259
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,120
How?

260
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,080
Showing up at the adult ceremony
is not enough.

261
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,630
Tong.

262
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Do you remember

263
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,790
how's the adult ceremony of Li?

264
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,480
She has no adult ceremony.

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,150
Then we will administer
an adult ceremony for Jiang Li.

266
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,550
Administer?

267
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,910
Yes.

268
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,440
Jiang Li risked her life to save me.

269
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,790
Now I've returned to the capital
and Jiang's Residence.

270
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,440
I must administer justice

271
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,270
for her life.

272
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,390
Jiang Li

273
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,200
is a distinguished woman.

274
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,320
She deserves to stand
in front of everyone in the capital.

275
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,480
She deserves praise and blessings.

276
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,840
Tong, that's why

277
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,600
the adult ceremony

278
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,720
is not only for Jiang Ruoyao

279
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,840
but also for Li.

280
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,200
I will make Jiang Li

281
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,080
return to her position fair and square.

282
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,600
But Miss,

283
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,440
it's hard.

284
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,000
Ji Shuran will stop you.

285
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,960
No matter how hard it is,

286
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,320
we will do it for Li.

287
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,320
If Shen Yurong sees

288
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,600
you again...

289
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,870
As long as I show up
at the adult ceremony,

290
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,790
my identity as Jiang Li
will be indisputable.

291
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,320
Even if Shen Yurong suspects me,

292
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,390
he will never dare
to make trouble in Jiang's Residence.

293
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,870
The destinies of Jiang Li and I
were intertwined.

294
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,030
She will help me

295
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,790
from above.

296
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,390
She will make him

297
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:33,030
meet me again
from the best family in the capital.

298
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,240
Finally.

299
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,440
I never thought

300
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,360
that cutting chrysanthemums
would be so hard.

301
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,600
You see, all the sunny spots

302
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,000
are taken up by the small garden.

303
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,910
There is no sunlight elsewhere.

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,120
It causes dampness easily.

305
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,790
Xiangqiao.

306
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,200
Do you know of other places
in the residence

307
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,120
that get more sunlight?

308
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,390
Tong.

309
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,870
You came to the right person.

310
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,840
There's plenty of sunshine
in the courtyard.

311
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,870
Then let's put them there.

312
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,150
They are just chrysanthemums.

313
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,960
Are you ready to quit

314
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,600
just because you've received

315
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,910
the only one mutton fat jade bangle
of its kind?

316
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,080
Nonsense!

317
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,840
Then let's go
dry chrysanthemums together!

318
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,240
Wait.

319
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,750
Tong.

320
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,120
It's not how it's supposed to be.

321
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,510
Redo.

322
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,630
Be elegant

323
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,120
when you arrange chrysanthemums.

324
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,510
Stop.

325
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,630
What are you doing?

326
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,320
Being lazy?

327
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,240
I saw Mr. Jiang.

328
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,510
I'm thinking of giving a bow.

329
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,790
My Lord.

330
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,840
Get out of the way.

331
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:19,840
My Lord.

332
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,080
How is Li doing?

333
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
- She...
- She is doing good.

334
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,480
You talk too much.

335
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,670
Stay out of it.

336
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,870
Yes.

337
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,390
She is doing good.

338
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,550
But she feels hot.

339
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,790
That's why

340
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,720
we are sun-drying chrysanthemums
to make tea.

341
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,510
I did it all.

342
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,360
Look.

343
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,750
No wonder it looks bad.

344
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,320
You still have the nerve to mention it.

345
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,720
Redo.

346
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,630
Yes.

347
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,720
What's wrong with you?

348
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,640
Nothing.

349
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,000
His Majesty just ascended the throne.

350
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,680
Internal affairs are complicated.

351
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,960
My nose is a little out of joint.

352
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,590
I just made the chrysanthemum tea.

353
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
It's able to clear heat
and brighten eyes.

354
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,270
No wonder it has a pleasant smell.

355
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,750
As long as it can relieve your fatigue.

356
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,720
Father.

357
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,830
Li.

358
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,270
Are these few chrysanthemums
grown by you?

359
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,920
Yes, Father.

360
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,790
I grew

361
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,110
these few chrysanthemums.

362
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,400
Mother used to look after
the flowers and plants with great care.

363
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,550
I'm careless.

364
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,350
Mother often said
that chrysanthemums are unwavering.

365
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,200
It is the symbol of strength and virtue.

366
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,550
Chrysanthemums stand out
in the cold autumn

367
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,440
like a gentleman.

368
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,960
Just like Father.

369
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,240
Li.

370
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
I didn't think you remember this.

371
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,400
Where are you going?

372
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,270
We're going

373
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,790
there.

374
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,160
There.

375
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,960
Then I don't think
you need to go anywhere.

376
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,440
We want to

377
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,270
use the lavatory.

378
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,160
Yes.

379
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,400
I also need to take a biobreak.

380
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,960
- Is it okay?
- Okay.

381
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,240
Let's go together.

382
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,590
How could you?

383
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,110
Father.

384
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,240
They went to get some snacks.

385
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,510
Please have a seat.

386
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,830
No.

387
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,720
I need to go to the palace.

388
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,680
Well.

389
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,030
Father, can you help me

390
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,440
bring some snacks to grandmother?

391
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,920
That day, I disturbed her.

392
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,750
I feel guilty.

393
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,480
It's not all your fault.

394
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,400
Forget it.

395
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,270
Let's sit for a while.

396
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,310
Father.

397
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,000
Please taste

398
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,640
the premium chrysanthemum tea
grown by me.

399
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,440
Don't beat me!

400
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,880
Don't beat me.

401
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,510
Li.

402
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,790
Don't.

403
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,920
I'll never do it again.

404
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,440
Li.

405
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Never, ever.

406
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,400
What's wrong with you?

407
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,240
Li.

408
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,200
No...

409
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,000
It's nothing.

410
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,510
All right.

411
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,790
All right, Li.

412
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,590
Don't be afraid.

413
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,270
Okay, don't be afraid.

414
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,070
I'm here.

415
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,160
Tell me.

416
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,640
When I was in Zhennv Hall,

417
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,350
sometimes I got beaten and punished

418
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,400
if I didn't finish my work.

419
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,720
And I...

420
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,640
Let me see.

421
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,720
Well.

422
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,920
You have grown up.

423
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,070
You are a big girl now.

424
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,680
But you will always be my daughter.

425
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,110
How dare
the Zhennv Hall be harsh to you!

426
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,590
Father.

427
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,510
I'm home.

428
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,510
As long as you keep coming here

429
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,550
for flowers and tea,

430
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,480
I will be contented.

431
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,350
Li.

432
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,920
What is...?

433
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,350
I embroidered it at Zhennv Hall.

434
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,590
It's not up to much.

435
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,750
I'm afraid that you...

436
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,200
I'm afraid that you are ashamed of me.

437
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,270
Is this Li's embroidery for Old Madam?

438
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Do you know what Li has been doing

439
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,200
in Zhennv Hall?

440
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,960
To get enough to eat,

441
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,640
she was forced to steal some insoles

442
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,920
and exchange them for money.

443
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,070
If word gets out,

444
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,000
others will be laughing
at the daughter of the Jiang family

445
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,110
for not having

446
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,960
enough to eat.

447
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,030
The person in charge
must have embezzled money.

448
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,030
Master.

449
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,960
I'll ask someone to teach her a lesson.

450
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,310
Shuran.

451
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,920
Do you know she's injured?

452
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,790
Injured?

453
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,920
She was beaten in Zhennv Hall.

454
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:54,000
There are wounds all over her body.

455
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,480
I've been busy
with the adult ceremony these days

456
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,750
so I missed her out.

457
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,510
I failed as a mother.

458
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,110
I failed to win her heart.

459
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,790
She didn't tell me anything.

460
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,000
Instead, she told you

461
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,350
and you had to remind me.

462
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,030
I owe her that.

463
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,070
This is not

464
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,830
the most painful thing I heard today.

465
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,880
She's afraid that I'm ashamed of her.

466
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,240
How could she think so?

467
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,110
This girl

468
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,000
keeps everything from me.

469
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,750
She doesn't dare
to get too close to you.

470
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,830
Since you mentioned the adult ceremony,

471
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,350
let Li attend.

472
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,880
We owe her so much over the years.

473
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,310
We can't break her heart again.

474
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,720
Li

475
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,480
has never attended any banquets.

476
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,510
No one taught her the rules.

477
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,680
I'm worried that she will make a fool
of herself at the adult ceremony.

478
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,350
It will freak her out instead.

479
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,510
The daughter of the Jiang family

480
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,550
will have to meet people
sooner or later.

481
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,110
Think about it.

482
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,400
If word gets out

483
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,000
about what happened to her
in Zhennv Hall

484
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,200
and how we erase her name
from the adult ceremony,

485
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,310
the rumor of bad parenting
will be irrefutable.

486
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,830
How to get away?

487
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,070
Okay.

488
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,720
I will make arrangements.

489
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,310
Thank you, Shuran.

490
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,200
Morons!

491
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,790
Mrs. Jiang told you a thousand times

492
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,550
not to let Jiang Li meet the Lord.

493
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,920
You can't even handle something trivial.

494
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,030
What's the use of keeping you?

495
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,880
I'm clueless.

496
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,510
It's Xiangqiao.

497
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,110
She goes for a slight profit.

498
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,880
Jiang Li gave her some money.

499
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,480
She helped her do a lot of things.

500
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,240
Drying chrysanthemums

501
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,830
was also her job.

502
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400
I didn't have the slightest idea.

503
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,750
If I knew,

504
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,030
I will stop them.

505
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,070
Xiangqiao.

506
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,110
Is this true?

507
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,750
I'm innocent.

508
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,880
I only approached her

509
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,440
to gain her trust

510
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,680
and get information.

511
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,110
The chrysanthemum tea incident

512
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,200
would never have happened

513
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,480
if Tong hadn't followed me.

514
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,070
Madam, don't worry.

515
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
After this incident,

516
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,590
Jiang Li will trust me more.

517
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,480
It will be easier for you

518
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,830
to do anything from now on.

519
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,720
Madam,
this is a reward from Jiang Li to me.

520
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,030
I am about to hand it over to you.

521
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,110
Keep it.

522
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,160
All right.

523
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,680
If you can gain her trust,

524
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,110
the loss is nothing.

525
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,790
Next time,

526
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,310
you won't just lose
your monthly allowances.

527
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:11,920
All right.

528
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,270
Shameless.

529
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,830
Loathe me on sight?

530
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,400
Want Mrs. Jiang to punish me?

531
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,480
And?

532
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,400
Instead of punishing me,

533
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,920
Mrs. Jiang let me keep the reward.

534
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
You better watch out.

535
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,550
If I'm punished by Mrs. Jiang again
because of you,

536
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,440
I will not spare you.

537
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,400
Let me tell you.

538
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,160
If I hear you speak ill of me

539
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,750
in front of Mrs. Jiang again,

540
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,590
I will not spare you.

541
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,960
Are you guilty?

542
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,240
Don't think I don't know

543
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,480
what you did in Jiang Li's room.

544
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,110
What did I do?

545
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
You're just jealous
that I'm more likable.

546
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,350
I can please Mrs. Jiang and Lady Li.

547
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,350
But you can't.

548
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:54,960
Naturally,

549
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,400
these rewards are all mine.

550
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,550
Madam.

551
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,070
Madam.

552
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,200
Shameless.

553
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,160
Hey!

554
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:05,960
What's the matter?

555
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,070
You have a sour face.

556
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,830
Who likes you?

557
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,960
Nobody likes you

558
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,720
so you take it out on me.

559
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,830
If I am a sour face,

560
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,680
then you will be a flat face.

561
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,030
Hey!

562
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,880
You...

563
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,030
You take advantage of Madam

564
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,070
and bark at me every day.

565
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,750
You call me a dog?

566
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,240
Yes.

567
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,680
You are!

568
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,550
Well.

569
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,240
Then you will experience
dog bites today.

570
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,110
You mad dog!

571
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,350
Get ready for your death!

572
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,510

[Fangfei Garden]

574
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,440
Jiang Li has been home for several days

575
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,720
but we haven't seen her come out.

576
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,070
Is she shy

577
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,270
or someone won't let her out?

578
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Well done, Detective.

579
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,000
Mind your own business.

580
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,070
Li loved to run around

581
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,720
when she was little.

582
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,240
Rui also liked to play with her.

583
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,310
But it's true that

584
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,400
a young woman is very different
from the little girl she once was.

585
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,830
When Li was little,

586
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,550
her face was chubby.

587
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
She is graceful now.

588
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,960
If I run into her on the street,

589
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,590
I might not be able to recognize her.

590
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,440
Your main concern should be your son

591
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,240
instead of your niece.

Aren't you in charge of this matter?

598
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,550
Why do you blame me now?

599
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,400
I wanted to be responsible for him.

600
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,240
- Look at him.
- My Lady, don't hit me.

601

Don't hit me, my Lady.

- Stop. Argh!
- Don't hit me.

Stop!

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,200
Miss, you're smart.

605
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,790
The Lord must have
said something to Ji Shuran.

606
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,680
She sent so many supplements

607
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,590
and rewards today.

608
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,790
It looks nice.

609
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,550
Then it's yours.

610
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,440
Thank you, Miss.

611
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,030
It's a beauty.

There's a monster there.

You're a big girl.

615
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,480
And you're afraid of a tortoise?

616

He is the son of Jiang Yuanping,

619

the brother of Mr. Jiang.

620
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,880
He's the most facetious person
in the family.

Over dramatic, noisy, silly,

622
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,310

and undisciplined are his descriptions.

623

Are you okay?

628
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
Did they hurt you?

629
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,510
It's okay.

630
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,590
It's okay.

631

Hello cousin.

are not Jiang Li.

Young Master.

635
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,480
What do you mean?

636
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,750

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,550

Now you make sense.

Your serious look just now

643
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,310
gave me goosebumps.

644
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,640
You made me sick.

645
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,070
You gave me this nickname

646
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,960
when you were little.

647
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,350
I'm uncomfortable

648
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,590
with you looking like a stuffed shirt.

649
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,000
I thought

650
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,480
I would never see you again.

651
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,310
You don't even know.

652
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,790
Ever since you left,

653
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,000
I had been crying every day.

654
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,640
I was devastated

655
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,510
and pierced to the heart.

656
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,960
I could only depend on
the little tortoise.

657
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,240
Fortunately, Uncle is scrupulous

658
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,440
and brought you back.

659
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,960
Thank you for your concern, Rui.

660
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,510
You're welcome.

661
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,240
Have a seat.

You too.

663
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,160
But

664
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,550
if you don't want
to be kicked out again,

665
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,000
you have to be smart.

666
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,030
Thanks for the reminder, Rui.

667
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,720
Does Jiang Ruoyao give you problems?

668
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,790
I haven't seen her since I got home.

669
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,640
But I'd been away from home
for a long time.

670
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,240
Why is she giving me problems?

671

Did you forget?

674
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,720
You and Zhou Yanbang
had been engaged since childhood.

675
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,830
After you were sent away,

676
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,000
the family
has changed his marriage partner

677
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,880
to Jiang Ruoyao.

678
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,750
Now you are back.

679
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,750
Jiang Ruoyao must have
got something against you.

680
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,920
I think

681
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,720
let's not attend the adult ceremony.

682
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Think about it.

683
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,590
You and Zhou Yanbang
can't be together anymore.

684
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,400
It doesn't matter how awful you feel.

685
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,030
You're going to
watch Zhou Yanbang and Jiang Ruoyao

686
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,440
exchange glances
in front of so many guests.

687

How would you feel?

688
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,350
You will feel terrible.

689
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,030
And you will complain

690
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,070
that you lose face at the ceremony.

691
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,070

704

what you want to buy.

00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,400
How about I ask her to meet you later?

761
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,670
It's just a question without ceremony.

762
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,440
I remember you were engaged.

763
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,760
How about you cancel our marriage

764
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,440
and get back to her?

765
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,550
Why are you offended?

766
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,670
Jiang Li has been in Zhennv Hall
for many years.

767
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,400
She is ignorant

768
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,230
and vulgar.

769
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,320
How can she be comparable to you?

770
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,280
Look.

771
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,710
I bought you

772
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,670
your favorite cookies.

773
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,110
There was a long queue.

774
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:07,960
Let's go.

775
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,630
Let's go to school.

776
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,190
Don't get upset.

777
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:09,840
Let's go.

778
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,000
My Lord.

779
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,000
Secret guards have been dispatched
to search Qingcheng Mountain.

780
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,510
It is estimated to take two more days
to complete the search.

781
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,280
It's too slow.

782
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,760
We're short-handed.

783
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,480
We can only
move some of the secret guards

784
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,280
around His Majesty.

785
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,510
Just proceed.

786
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,920
My Lord, I'm glad

787
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,630
to hear you say so.

788
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,510
Jiang Li is out.

789
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,880
Her patience finally snapped.

790
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:45,960
Continue to follow her.

791
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:46,960
Yes.

792
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:04,880
Tong.

793
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,360
I'll go and pick a gift
for Jiang Ruoyao.

794
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,280
You go to the pawnshop.

795
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,360
Redeem something for me.

796
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,150
Got it.

797
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,000
Lady.

798
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,510
These are all famous and dear goods
in our store.

799
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,400
Have a look.

800
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,030
This is the calligraphy scroll
given by Mr. Shen,

801
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,030
the Principal Graduate to our store.

802
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,840
It is worth its weight in gold.

803
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,190
Like gold dust.

804
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,630
Mr. Shen is not only good at calligraphy

805
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,960
but also a good man.

806
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,920
He will become a good official

807
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,000
who works for the welfare of the people.

808
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,590
You're right.

809
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,760
He has a good handwriting.

810
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,000
- You're right.
- Look at this.

811
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:57,100
[Shen Yurong]

812
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,510
Please take a look at this.

813
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,110
This is also a rare treasure.

814
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,230
Mrs. Shen?

815
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,710
But...

816
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,920
Mrs. Shen.

817
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,590
You...

818
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,110
Who is Mrs. Shen?

819
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,070
But...

820
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,280
Isn't she Jiang Li who just came back?

821
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,710
You're right.

822
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,320
We didn't see her last time.

823
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,440
She is really pretty.

824
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,190
Sir, I'm ready to pay.

825
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,480
I...

826
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,190
Take care.

827
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,150
Miss.

828
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,110
The leopard cat jade pendant
you asked for

829
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:00,960
was bought by someone.

830
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,920
Who?

831
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,150
Jiang Li went to the pawnshop
to redeem this.

832
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,480
I let the shopkeeper know in advance

833
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,190
as instructed.

834
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,760
Whatever she wants to redeem

835
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,840
will be taken by us.

836
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,840
Who put it in the pawnshop?

837
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,030
The owner said it was a married woman,

838
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,920
but he couldn't remember the details.

839
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,480
A married woman?

840
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,000
The shopkeeper said it was Duke Su.

841
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,510
He also said
that he is now in the tea house.

842
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,440
Weird.

843
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,440
Why is he eyeing our things?

844
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,150
He is not eyeing our things.

845
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,710
He's targeting me.

846
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,880
Miss.

847
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,880
Miss, stay calm.

848
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,510
He's Duke Su.

849
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,760
We can't mess with him.

850
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,190
The shopkeeper would not mention

851
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,670
his whereabouts for nothing.

852
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,320
We are invited.

853
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,550
Not going

854
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,440
would be foolish and disrespectful.

855
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,360
Why draw back?

856
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,800
Besides,

857
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,070
I have to get the thing back.

858
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,710
Sorry, guys, I'm late.

859
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,590
Have a seat.

860
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Drink. You must have a drink.

861
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,480
Sure.

862
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,800
Three shots first.

863
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,880
Madam, please stop.

864
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,400
The private room upstairs is booked.

865
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,400
You can't go in.

866
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,230
The dishes are served.

867
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,440
Please let the guest know

868
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,000
that Jiang Li turns up for a rendezvous.

869
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,110
Hi.

870
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,280
Have a seat.

871
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,320
It is a good day.

872
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,630
You're late today.

873
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,360
Never mind.

874
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,920
Come, sit down, please.

875
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,840
Duke Su.

876
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,550
I wonder what you want from me.

877
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,710
The waiter said you were looking for me.

878
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,630
You asked the shopkeeper of the pawnshop
to send a message.

879
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,280
I dare not refuse to come.

880
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,590
Besides, you still hold

881
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,550
the jade pendant
that my servant is going to redeem.

882
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,000
I don't have any jade pendant
of a servant.

883
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,960
The shopkeeper of the pawnshop

884
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,840
told me that it belonged
to a married woman

885
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,030
called

886
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,110
Li.

887
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,110
Is he the right one?

888
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:27,670
Yes.

889
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:33,510
This is what your mother left behind
when she passed away.

890
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,150
She said

891
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,670
it must be given to you
when you get married.

892
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,440
It will send you peace and success.

893
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:45,150
Since you have made up your mind,
take it.

894
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,590
Go. Remember, don't be shy to ask

895
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,510
if you encounter difficulties.

896
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,400
You will always be my daughter.

897
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,480

898
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,030
Jiang Li.

899
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,960
Jiang Li.

900
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,400
This is left behind
by an old friend of mine.

901
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,150
I can't tell you.

902
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,840
You have been in Zhennv Hall for years.

903
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,760
Where did this old friend come from?

904
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,230
Duke Su, this is personal.

905
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,630
Okay, then. Tell me.

906
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,190

Your man overworked himself.

910
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,510
He needs to rest.

911
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,630
It takes at least three months
for him to recover.

912
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,550
No way.

913
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,280
He will have the Palace Examination
in one month.

914
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,190
Is there any other way?

915
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,280
Caterpillar fungus is good for the body.

00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,840

00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:46,070
Where does this jade pendant come from?

928
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,110
is not worth mentioning.

Please return the jade pendant to me,
Duke Su.

930
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
You can give me a quote.

931
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,960
Do I look like I'm short of money?

932

00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,030
I haven't got the answer I need.

934
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,000
That day at Zhennv Hall,

935
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,480
I had no choice but to make use of you.

936
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,590
Please forgive me

937
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,440

938
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,360
Don't be so nervous.

939
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,670
Otherwise, I would take it

given to you by your lover.

941
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,000
As I said before,

942
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,630
I do not know him.

943
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,400
All right.

944
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,150
Tell me.

945
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,800
Where did Qin hide the stolen goods?

946
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,280
If you speak the truth,

947
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,480
I'll give it back to you.

948
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,280
Okay?

949
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,550
Again.

950
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,280
I don't know anyone named Qin.

951
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,630
Stop horsing around, my Lord.

952
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,360
Finding stolen goods is more important.

953
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,150
If it cannot be found
in Qingcheng Mountain,

954
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:18,360
is there any other way?

955
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,920
Are you looking for what the man hid

956
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,480
when he burst into Zhennv Hall?

957
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,440
If I tell you

958
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,000
where it is hidden,

959
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,110
will you return my jade pendant

960
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:31,800
to me?

961
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,190
Tell me more.

962
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,280
In the backyard of Zhennv Hall.

963
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,000
How do you prove that?

964
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,400
The fruit puree dyed his hands.

965
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,630
There is a tree in the backyard.

966
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:46,670
It was windy.

967
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,150
There were windfalls.

968
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,230
Those fruits are like mulberries.

969
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,030
They dye your fingers if you touch them.

970
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,670
It's hopeless to clean your hands
for several days.

971
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,840
He was digging.

972
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,440
How do you know

973
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,670
he didn't get it somewhere else?

974
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,880
I stayed at Zhennv Hall for ten years.

975
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,920
I know very well

976
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,670
that the fruits there
are different from those elsewhere.

977
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,800
That's a good excuse.

978
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,110
I'm telling the truth.

979
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,320
Duke Su,
please return the jade pendant to me.

980
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,230
What's the hurry?

981
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,190
We will know the answer soon.

982
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,190
My Lord, it is found.

983
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,440
I've been out for quite a while.

984
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,960
Duke Su,
please return the jade pendant to me.

985
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,760
I have to hurry home.

986
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,030
Duke Su.

987
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,710
Why didn't you ask

988
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,190
how your lover was doing?

989
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,550
He's still in my hands.

990
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,710
It seems that

991
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,190
you still suspect that

992
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,110
I have an affair with Qin.

993
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,440
Why?

994
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,630
No?

995
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,920
That day I had a knife put to my throat.

996
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:38,840
Today I

997
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,000
tell you everything I know.

998
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:42,590
Is this an affair?

999
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,150
Is love greater than life
and the future?

1000
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,400
Duke Su, where is your brain?

1001
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,760
Did you

1002
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,150
just call me brainless?

1003
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:02,030
Yes.

1004
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:05,510
You're brainless.

1005
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:08,480
A woman's reputation matters.

1006
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,920
There's no way you don't know that.

1007
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:13,510
My shelter was broken into
for no reason.

1008
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,630
The intruder became the lover.

1009
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,030
I became a strumpet.

1010
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,920
You talk and laugh

1011
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,030
while my reputation is ruined.

1012
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,150
What's worse is

1013
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,190
giving a dog a bad name and hanging him.

1014
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,440
Are you trying to force me to death?

1015
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,400
I can't prove my innocence.

1016
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,110
If you think

1017
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:50,480
I have an affair with your prisoner,

1018
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,190
just head to Jiang's Residence

1019
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,710
and lock me up.

1020
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,760
What's that look for?

1021
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:18,800
Why?

1022
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,920
My Lord, do you think
there's something wrong with our look?

1023
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,030
Go back and get ten strokes.

1024
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,510
Why?

1025
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,110
You are filthy.

1026
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,960
Do you think I went too far?

1027
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,480
I dare not.

1028
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,000
It's nothing.

1029
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,320
I also think I'm shameless.

1030
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:46,670
If I'm not shameless,

1031
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,800
I can't force the truth out of her.

1032
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,760
Do we need to send someone
to continue following her?

1033
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,320
No.
