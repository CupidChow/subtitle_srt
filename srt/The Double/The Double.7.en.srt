100 like Peng Zu, guided the Fan Zhong.]

191
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,860
The Zhennv Hall is not a place to learn.

192
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,980
You must have practiced hard.

193
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,140
Knowing you appreciate it,

194
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,890
it was worth the effort.

195
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,570
Come.

196
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,380
Your father had
excellent handwriting as well.

197
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,890
After becoming the Prime Minister,

198
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,810
a few words he wrote

199
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,170
became the treasured
calligraphy artwork.

200
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,650
So, he stopped writing.

201
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,770
Show these writings to him.

202
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,290
He will be thrilled.

203
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,980
Then, ask him to send you to the school.

204
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,530
I'll prepare
the necessary stationery for you.

205
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,050
I wouldn't want to trouble you.

206
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,810
Are you concerned
this might displease someone?

207
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,020
Do not be concerned.

208
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,620
I'm keeping this paper.

209
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,810
I'll convince your father.

210
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,620
Thank you.

211
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,340
Have some pear soup.

212
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,050
Sure.

213
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,220
These are Li's handwriting.

214
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,650
What do you think?

215
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,050
[Wang Jiuling, despite not living to
100 like Peng Zu, guided the Fan Zhong.]

216
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,930
Upright and with the right force.

217
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,170
Straight and not without a shine.

218
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,410
Even you agree it's good handwriting.

219
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,220
Is this enough to enroll her

220
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,410
in the School of Integrity?

221
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,570
Li wants to study
at the School of Integrity?

222
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,170
What do you think?

223
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,050
But...

224
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,930
Li is passionate about learning.

225
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,650
I'm glad that she does.

226
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,050
But the School of Integrity
is unlike the average schools.

227
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,140
Every year, women would get expelled

228
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,740
due to lackluster results.

229
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,290
Li barely had an education before this.

230
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,100
I'm worried the people there
might give her a hard time.

231
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,890
Yuanbai is the current Chief Secretary.

232
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,500
His children

233
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,380
must not be illiterate
and mocked by the people.

234
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,740
After years in the Zhennv Hall,

235
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,020
Li still managed
to have remarkable handwriting.

236
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,410
She has worked hard to accomplish this.

237
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,100
Bullies won't dwindle her spirit.

238
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,690
I think

239
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,380
the handwriting

240
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
is better than Ruoyao's,
who you practically raised.

241
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,650
Indeed, Madam Jiang.

242
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,740
However, we don't get to decide

243
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,570
if Li can get a place there.

244
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,890
My husband,

245
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,050
we should hire a tutor

246
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,530
to test Li's standards.

247
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,530
Knowing her capability

248
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,100
is the best for her and this family.

249
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,170
Makes sense.

250
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,410
Ask Yuan Ping

251
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,980
to hire the tutor
who taught Jiang Jingrui.

252
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,260
He is experienced and sharp.

253
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,690
He once said

254
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,380
that Jingrui would make it
into the Imperial Academy.

255
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,740
He was right.

256
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,460
Indeed.

257
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,810
I'll go to Yuan Ping later.

258
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,530
Wait.

259
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,980
The two schools are not the same.

260
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,570
Well, who should we hire?

261
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,380
I know someone for the task.

262
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,620
If he thinks Jiang Li can make it past

263
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,860
the selection
of the School of Integrity,

264
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,220
the others will have to
accept the decision made by us

265
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,460
and the school.

266
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,930
Scholar Shen.

267
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,980
Prime Minister Jiang.

268
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,050
Let's have a word.

269
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,860
You are in charge
of the Entry Exam for both institutes.

270
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,020
That's a tremendous task.

271
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,410
Do you have some time?

272
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,740
Thank you for the concern.

273
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,930
It's my day off. I have some time.

274
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,380
Perfect.

275
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,170
I need a favour from you.

276
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,170
My daughter Jiang Li wants
to enroll in the School of Integrity.

277
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,380
But as you know,

278
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,620
she has never gone to a proper school.

279
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,570
She is your daughter.
I believe she will do remarkably.

280
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,460
I hope you are right.

281
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,810
Test her standards for me.

282
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,690
It should give my wife and I
an ease of the mind.

283
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,890
Is there a problem, Scholar Shen?

284
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,930
A request from an elder.

285
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,810
I'll do my best.

286
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,860
Much appreciated.

287
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,890
Mrs. Jiang.

288
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,690
Scholar Shen, take a seat.

289
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,260
Have some tea.

290
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,290
I'll bring Li here.

291
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,650
Scholar Shen.

292
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,530
Li spent ten years at the Zhennv Hall.

293
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,770
If she offends you in any way,

294
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,460
I hope you won't mind.

295
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
I won't.

296
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,530
Scholar Shen.

297
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,810
A token of appreciation.

298
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,380
This gesture is unnecessary.

299
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,380
I'll take it that you accept the silver.

300
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,650
Remember to do your job well.

301
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,860
Li is the firstborn.

302
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,850
It shouldn't be a problem for her

303
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,020
to get into the School of Integrity.

304
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,050
Scholar Shen,
do not leave me disappointed.

305
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,020
I thought the money was
meant for another purpose.

306
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,370
Why are you helping Jiang Li?

307
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,940
Do you know why I asked
Scholar Shen to test her?

308
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,740
I have no idea.

309
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,530
Scholar Shen came
from an impoverished family.

310
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,290
When he became the Principal Graduate,

311
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,770
he held a banquet
to meet the people in high places.

312
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,180
But no one attended.

313
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,850
It was all for nothing.

314
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,940
Therefore, he hates

315
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,050
the privileged who look down on others.

316
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,850
No money can sway him.

317
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,260
I hired him

318
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,770
so he could hate Jiang Li to the bones.

319
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,940
Greetings,

320
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,420
Scholar Shen.

321
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,050
Where are your manners?

322
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,020
You remind me...

323
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,330
of someone close.

324
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,330
I apologise for the behaviour.

325
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,130
My father often talks about you.

326
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,980
It's an honor

327
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,570
to have your guidance.

328
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,770
When the incense burns out,

329
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,220
I'll mark the paper.

330
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,090
Have you been to Qingcheng Mountain?

331
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,570
Yes.

332
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,020
With whom?

333
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,740
She is gone.

334
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,370
Let's not talk about her.

335
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,610
Are you afraid of the thunder?

336
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,180
It's personal.

337
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,090
Let's not make it
part of the conversation.

338
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,050
Jiang Li.

339
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,810
Show some respect.

340
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,530
The nights of Qingcheng Mountain

341
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,900
are piercing cold.

342
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,330
It's cold enough to open your eyes.

343
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,290
I never understood

344
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,050
why my loved ones
would be so cold to me.

345
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,090
They made me stay
on Qingcheng Mountain for ten years.

346
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,810
But I get it now.

347
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,610
I saw the money my mother left you.

348
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,610
I know I misunderstood.

349
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,610
My mother still cares about me.

350
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,660
Therefore, I have a request.

351
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,180
I survived ten years

352
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,220
on Qingcheng Mountain.

353
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,610
Now, I only want to rely on myself.

354
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,530
I hope you are fair

355
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,610
in your judgment.

356
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,170
[The shaded peaks
of Zhongnan are beautiful.]

357
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,060
[Snow accumulates,
floating at the cloud's edge.]

358
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,120
[The forest's outline reveals
the vivid color after rain.]

359
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,940
[In the city,
the evening cold intensifies.]

360
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,260
The handwriting...

361
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,740
Scholar Shen.

362
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:38,980
What do you think?

363
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,370
Will this earn me a spot?

364
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,220
Based on my understanding,

365
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,170
you are indeed talented.

366
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,090
But you need a year or two

367
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,540
before making it
into the School of Integrity.

368
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,610
Since I have the talent,

369
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,810
why the wait?

370
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,260
Why won't you look at me?

371
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
I will inform Prime Minister Jiang
of the result.

372
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,090
It's getting late.

373
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,170
I must go.

374
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,540

Yes.

They left.

This is a blessing in disguise.

00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,740
Why squeeze into their carriage?

578
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,700
It's not worth it.

579
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,140
They always go to school
in the same carriage.

580
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,510
Not really.

581
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,140
Sometimes, Zhou Yanbang

582
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,950
would give Jiang Ruoyao a lift.

583
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,510
Are you going to the School of Integrity

584
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,550
just to meet Zhou Yanbang?

585
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,030
What else could it be?

586
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,740
Isn't it better to stay at home?

587
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,260
Why keep yourself locked at the school?

588
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,350
I bet this is about Zhou Yanbang.

589
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,870

He's not worth your time.

592
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,910
From what I heard,

593
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,870
His Majesty would personally meet

594
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,740
the examinee with the highest score.

595
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,140
There is also a reward.

596
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,510
That's a reward

597
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,740
I'd want.

598
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,350
You want a place
in the palace for the reward?

599
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,070
What do you take the school for?

600
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,140
You don't simply
become the best there is.

601
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,510
We are taking the exam
as a team of four.

Firstborn, Li Jing.

609
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,990
He is always in the top three
for this year's regular tests.

610
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,100
He usually keeps

611
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,260
a low profile.

612
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,220
Li Lian is the second son.

613
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,780
Not as outstanding as the firstborn,

We can't team up with them.

00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,070
Hey!

748
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,580
[Liu Xu]

749
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,140
I'll bring it tomorrow.

750
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,700
I have two gifts for you.

751
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,620
Do you want the one
in my left hand first

752
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:49,700
or the right hand?

753
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:50,740
Right hand.

754
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,220
I bought this for you.

755
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,820
Your favourite desserts.

756
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,030
What are you looking at?

757
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,620
Isn't that Jiang Li?

758
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,590
I can bring her here
so can you stare at her all day!

759
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,110
I'm curious about

760
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,990
her sudden decision
to come to this school.

761
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,620
She is not as qualified as you.

762
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:44,950
All right.

763
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,660
You haven't seen the other gift

764
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,550
I prepared.

765
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,340
I had this hairpin custom-made for you.

766
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,470
Wear it

767
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,870
and you'll be the most beautiful Ruoyao.

768
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,660
Fancy words.

769
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,700
Interesting.

770
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:07,470
Look!

771
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,780
That is the Chief Secretary's
second daughter.

772
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:10,870
Don't you think

773
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,390
she is prettier than Ruoyao?

774
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,110
I heard she was the first
to be engaged with Zhou Yanbang.

775
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,820
The little sister stole
the older sister's fiance.

776
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,660
Will the older sister
try to win him back?

777
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,620
Given her tarnished reputation,

778
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,180
after the Marquis of Ningyuan
canceled the engagement,

779
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,590
no one would propose.

780
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,620
I should try my luck

781
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:27,430
and make her my concubine.

782
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,620
Go get it, tiger.

783
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:30,510
Let's go.

784
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,220
Ms. Jiang Li, care to
join me for some tea?

785
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,180
What was that for?

786
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,510
A bunch of young boys

787
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,180
gossiping about a female student
of the School of Integrity.

788
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,340
You should be ashamed.

789
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:50,620
You're a brute

790
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,340
who raises her voice against men.

791
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:53,950
No men in the city would marry you.

792
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,070
If I had to be virtuous

793
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,070
just to marry someone of your standards,

794
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,990
I'd rather shave my head
and become a nun.

795
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:00,950
What?

796
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:01,870
Why you...

797
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,180
What did you say?

798
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,300
Forget it. Don't argue with her.

799
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,510
She is Liu Xu
from the School of Integrity.

800
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:08,820
Famous for her rudeness.

801
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:09,870
Let's go.

802
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,620
- Let's go.
- She is just trouble.

803
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,430
Why you...

804
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,340
Let's go.

805
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:26,220
Forget it.

806
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:26,950
Let's go.

807
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:28,180
Let's go!

808
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,340
You're just trouble!

809
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:30,780
Come on.

810
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,390
I'll see if...

811
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:33,340
- If she weren't a girl...
- Forget it.

812
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:33,950
Thanks.

813
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,070
I wasn't helping you.

814
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,780
I hate it when they get in my way.

815
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,390
I know you.

816
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,590
You used my mother at the Zhennv Hall.

817
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,220
The elderly like you,
but I can't stand you.

818
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,620
You're full of schemes.

819
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,390
I've heard that you're a candid person.

820
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,660
The rumors didn't disappoint.

821
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:02,950
My conscience is clear,

822
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,110
unlike the scheming

823
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,220
and treacherous kind you are.

824
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,070
My Lord, news from the Red Pavilion.

825
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,910
A customer by the alias
"Lonely Gentleman"

826
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,780
always splurged his money.

827
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,390
He got drunk lately.

828
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,910
He said he couldn't
frequent the place anymore.

829
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,390
I bet the guy's stream
of revenue was cut off,

830
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:26,390
but wanted to save face.

831
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,030
Who is this Lonely Gentleman?

832
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,340
He's from Qiantang.
Arrived in the capital in recent years.

833
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,660
A man from Qiantang...

834
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,510
Judge Kong's wife was
from Qiantang as well.

835
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:37,110
Welcome, Duke Su.

836
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,140
My apologies,

837
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,660
your regular booth on the second floor

838
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,910
was taken today.

839
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,170
I'll arrange another booth for you.

840
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,460
Are you new here?

841
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,100
Don't you know that is Duke Su's spot?

842
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,810
It couldn't be helped.

843
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,060
Mr. Li insisted on taking the booth.

844
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,460
I offered a different spot,

845
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,100
but he wouldn't go.

846
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,210
Mr. Li?

847
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:58,770
We rarely get to meet.

848
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,620
I'll sit by his table.

849
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,260
Duke Su, they ordered us

850
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:04,340
not to disturb them.

851
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,300
So...

852
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:15,340
Sons of the Li family.

853
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,180
You're in a good mood today.

854
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,180
What do you want, Duke Su?

855
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,340
I'm not always working.

856
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,980
Today, I'm here for some tea.

857
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,700
The view here is stunning.

858
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,250
But we've taken the spot.

859
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,770
If it's tea you want,

860
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,900
go somewhere else.

861
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,060
As for the tea,

862
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,620
the bill is on me.

863
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:47,850
Never mind.

864
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,460
I don't usually fancy a crowd.

865
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,250
But I'm in a good mood today.

866
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,850
I'll keep you company.

867
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,940
