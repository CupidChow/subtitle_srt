To ensure this play doesn't end poorly,

164
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,160
I want to remind you this.

Consort Li is the Emperor's
favorite consort.

166
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,240

168
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Avoid conflict

169
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,750
and not act hastily.

170
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,080
You seem to think

171
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,120
that Ye Shijie treats you well, right?

172
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,150
Or else you would not

173
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,270
be willing to reconcile
with the Ye family now.

174
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,630
He's a decent person,

175
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,510
and he looks

176
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,200
quite handsome too.

177
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,790
Though

178
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,840
not as much as me, of course.

179
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,670
If he can keep protecting you,

180
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,910
that is a good thing.

181
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,510
Besides in my opinion,

182
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,360
if both of them
always spend time together...

183
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,390
It'll also make it easier for you
to approach Liu Xu.

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,030
Both of us are best friends for life.

188
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,600
I can never see her that way.

189
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,790
Why are you doing this?

190
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,960
- Jiang Jingrui.
- It's impossible for me to like her.

191
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,630
Why are you two doing this?

192
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,440
You are making me feel embarrassed.

193
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,000
Why are you doing this?

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,790
[Jiang's Residence]

195
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,390
Li,

196
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,510
Lady Jiang had a fallout
with the Ye family.

197
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,270
Now, you're going alone to make amends,

198
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,600
I worry you might be treated unfairly.

199
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,720
That's why I must go.

200
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,910
It's also Jiang Li's wish.

201
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,870
I want to help her mend things
with the Ye family.

202
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,440
Li,

203
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,720
you treat Lady Jiang so well.

204
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,960
Actually, I have my own selfish reason.

205
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,480
I remember Luyang is not far
from Huaixiang.

206
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,270
Now, Jiang Li's reputation is rising
in the capital.

207
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,600
I can take a breather now.

208
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,790
I want to go back to Huaixiang.

209
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,550
At that time, Shen...

210
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,630
That person

211
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,000
said my father was convicted

212
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,790
and executed.

213
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
Perhaps no one buried him at that time.

214
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,270
It's been so long.

215
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,750
So I should go back and see.

216
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,360
Quickly.

217
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,200
Liu Xu and Ye Shijie
should have arrived long ago.

218
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,240
- Hurry up.
- All right.

219
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,440
Liu Xu.

220
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,960
Liu Xu.

221
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,870
Why did you start eating?

222
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,320
I arrived long ago

223
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,150
and waited for you for a very long time.

224
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,200
But none of you came.

225
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,750
So I went around on my own.

226
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,870
Where's Ye Shijie?

227
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,840
Ye Shijie?

228
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,840
I think

229
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,080
he should be the last one to arrive.

230
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,030
No need.

231
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,270
Then I now announce

232
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,200
that we'll eat, drink,
and have fun tonight.

233
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,870
All expenses will be paid by Ye Shijie.

234
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,790
Agreed!

235
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,000
When he arrives,

236
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,120
I'll accompany you for another round.

237
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,750
All right.

238
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:09,910
There he is.

239
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,120
Ye,

240
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,840
thanks to us

241
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,030
you've gained an official position.

242
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,000
That's right.

243
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,000
Mr. Ye,

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,030
you have to treat us tonight.

245
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,360
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,030
I forgot to tell you something.

247
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,510
My second uncle is in the capital
on business

248
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
and will return to Luyang in a few days.

249
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,440
So

250
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm afraid I can't celebrate
the Autumn Festival with you.

251
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,320
That's no fun.

252
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,480
We agreed

253
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,030
the last person
who arrives has to cover the expenses.

254
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,630
Not only you're not treating,

255
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,270
but you're also not joining us.

256
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,480
That's right.

257
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,510
That's no fun at all.

258
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,390
Yes, you're no fun at all.

259
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,120
Hello, everyone.

260
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,440
I'm Ye Shijie's second uncle.

261
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,320
I came

262
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,510
at an inconvenient time today

263
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,150
and disturbed your fun.

264
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,390
I'm very sorry

265
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,750
about that.

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,550
How about this?

267
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,240
I've reserved a table
at the restaurant.

268
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,030
If you don't mind,

269
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,080
let's have a meal together.

270
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,030
It's all right.

271
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,870
It's hard to see anything lively
from the restaurant upstairs.

272
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,750
Besides, we don't want to disturb you

273
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,720
when you and your nephew are talking.

274
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,630
All right. Let's go then.

275
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,150
Uncle.

276
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,910
Since you're inviting us sincerely,

277
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,910
I also want to catch up with you.

278
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,790
Sure.

279
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,240
Jiang Jingrui,

280
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,790
bring Liu Xu around and have fun.

281
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,790
I'll make plans to meet you guys later.

282
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,360
What?

283
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,510
They're leaving just like that?

284
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,720
Exactly.

285
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
That's no fun at all.

286
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,600
What a letdown.

287
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,240
We're not friends anymore!

288
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,790
I'm going home!

289
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,030
What are you doing?

290
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,870
Liu Xu,

291
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,510
I know of a game over there

292
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,870
that requires two people to play.

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There are prizes too.

294
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
Who wants to play with you?

295
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,240
Since we're already here,
let's go together.

296
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,720
I promise

297
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,120
it'll be really fun.

298
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,960
Let's go and play together.

299
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,320
All right, then.

300
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,750
I'll play one round.

301
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,720
If it's not fun, I'll go home.

302
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,750
All right. Come on.

303
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,390
Shijie mentioned you before.

304
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
But I never expected you
to grow up so beautifully

305
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,360
after all these years.

306
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,240
When you called out to me,

307
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,720
I was so surprised.

308
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,030
I almost didn't recognize you.

309
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,000
Dear guests, please come this way.

310
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,670
It's been a long time
since you've met me.

311
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,270
It's only natural
that you don't recognize me.

312
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,150
That's why we need

313
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,000
to celebrate today's reunion properly.

314
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,670
You're right.

315
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,960
Come and take a seat.

316
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:47,960
Li,

317
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,480
it's thanks to you

318
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,790
that His Majesty values Shijie

319
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,480
and appointed him
to serve as an official,

320
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,600
which brings honor to our family.

321
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,030
I heard about your good reputation

322
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,840
as soon as I entered
the capital yesterday.

323
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,510
Here.

324
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,480
This drink is to thank you

325
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,840
and celebrate.

326
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,910
Please accept a toast from me.

327
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,240
Oh no, Uncle.

328
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,910
I can't take all the credit.

329
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,630
I should toast Uncle.

330
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,030
It's the festivity

331
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,600
and for family reunion.

332
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,270
Why didn't you visit
the Jiang's Residence?

333
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,000
I came to the capital

334
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,030
for business matters.

335
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,270
Shijie knows about this.

336
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,600
So it was rushed

337
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,390
and didn't inform
the Jiang family in advance.

338
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,120
I'm afraid of troubling them
if I visit suddenly.

339
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,790
Since it's for business matters,

340
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,320
won't it be more convenient

341
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,790
with the Secretariat Director's help?

342
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,320
Indeed, it will.

343
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,870
But we haven't had much contact

344
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,910
with the Jiang family for years.

345
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,480
Earlier, there were

346
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,840
some misunderstandings.

347
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,120
So

348
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,910
it might be too presumptuous.

349
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,840
I understand.

350
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,550
Uncle,

351
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,390
it was my fault because I was young
and ignorant.

352
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,790
Now, I'm more mature.

353
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,960
I'm regretful of the past.

354
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,670
If Uncle agrees,

355
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,480
I'll mediate with the Jiang family.

356
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,200
That would be great.

357
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Then

358
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,720
I'll visit them tomorrow.

359
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,390
Is that convenient?

360
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,360
Of course.

361
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,510
Since Uncle is visiting
the Jiang family,

362
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,150
we should respond.

363
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,030
Respond?

364
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,440
How about the day after tomorrow,

365
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,790
I'll follow Uncle to visit
the Ye family in Luyang together?

366
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,270
This way,

367
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,790
both families will get
to know each other better.

368
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,240
You... you want to go to Luyang?

369
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,120
But

370
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,080
Li,

371
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,600
you might need approval

372
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,510

559
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,030
If you consider this as a favor to me,

560
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,270
I will have someone else
bandage it for me.

Favors are also debts.

566

They need to be returned in the end.

Are you blaming me now?

572

The moment you invited me
to this theater,

00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,030
I may appear to be your esteemed guest.

574

But in reality, I'm just your cover.

575
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,860
You hid the ambushes you laid around you

576
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,060
to let these theater group
lower their guard.

577
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,060
When you said

578
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,780
I blame you.

579
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,670
I really don't.

580
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,780
I'm grateful

581
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,380
that I'm useful to you, Duke Su.

582
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,820
You used the theater group

583
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,100
to gather unjust wealth from the capital

584
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,750
and use it as a cover

585
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,860
to transport it to the northern borders.

586
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,620
So your plan is to gather funds

587
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,750
to recruit soldiers and buy horses
for King Cheng.

588
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,030

King Cheng pays you
to risk your life for him.

593
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,710
Do you really think a performer like you

594
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,190
can become the king's consort?

595
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,340
I'm annoyed.

and throw her out.

If King Cheng still wants you,

601
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,860
I'll give you three or two liang
as travel expenses.

602

What's wrong with His Lordship today?

603

Fine. I'll tell you.

607
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,340
Didn't you arrest them?

608
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,380
Why do I find you moody?

609
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,060
Are you keeping it from me too?

610
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,670
Fine, forget it
if you don't want to tell.

They tried to kill you.

612
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,230
It seems you've gotten in their way.

The northern borders aren't prosperous.

King Cheng has been recruiting soldiers
for years

615
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,510
and drained his resources.

By cutting off his wealth in Zhongyuan,

617
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,230
we're choking him.

This move

00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,860
is already late.

00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,750
I have a feeling

622
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,270
that salt smuggling
is just one of the money routes.

623
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,060
There must be a bigger one.

624
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,540
How did it go with the assassin?

625
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,910
She gave me some intel.

626
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,340
She said King Cheng

627
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,030
has a secret training ground
for assassins in Luyang.

before King Cheng acts.

633
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,340
So you need to go to Luyang personally.

00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,910
I'm here to express my gratitude

638
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:39,990
for being appointed.

639
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,780
It was the Emperor's grace.
It has nothing to do with me.

640
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,990
Why express gratitude?

641
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,060
I don't think you come here

642
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,230
without a reason.

00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,990
It looks like
I can't hide anything from you.

This is my Second Uncle, Ye Mingxuan.

645
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,270
He had come from Luyang

00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,820
with a small gift.

647
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,340
I hope you can accept it.

Oh, my brother-in-law.

00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,340
we met at the Lantern Festival

So I invited Ye

I have to rely on you to look after him.

That's too kind.

It's good that Shuran interacts
with Consort Li.

about family matters constantly

Based on the information provided
by Taohong,

839
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,140
we know that King Cheng's manager
in Luyang

840
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,510
is his trusted aide, Chu Lan.

However, Chu Lan isn't always in Luyang

00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,350

They don't realize
they're already in a trap.

If the Ye family
is so easily controlled,

929
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,790
and sieve them finely.

930
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,030
I will serve him some good tea

931
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,220
when Mingxuan returns.

932
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,180
Yes, Madam.

933
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:22,430
Madam,

934
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,350
[Embracing Preciousness]
do you know

935
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,510
something huge happened
at Zhang's Residence?

936
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,100
Really? What happened?

937
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,550
Mrs. Zhang was being

938
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,430
all dramatic at home.

939
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,140
She finally has it coming.

940
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:33,990
Do you know why?

941
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,220
It was because a little mistress visited

942
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,260
the Zhang's Residence yesterday.

943
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,260
Now, there's something to watch.

944
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,990
What does the little mistress look like?

945
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,620
Well,

946
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,780
- she looks just like...
- Madam!

947
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,180
A little mistress came to our house.

948
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,220
What?

949
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,350
Something big is going to happen!

950
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:55,940
[Xinzhu Chamber]

951
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,470
Ye Mingxuan!

952
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:58,950
Ye Mingxuan, you unfaithful man!

953
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:59,580
Come out!

954
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,030
Where is Mingxuan?

955
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,470
He just went out.

956
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,350
You little mistress,

957
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,780
how dare you enter
the gates of my Ye family!

958
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:06,910
Watch how I deal with you.

959
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,300
Madam.

960
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:07,870
Come out!

961
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:08,950
Madam!

962
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,300
Madam, you can't do this.

963
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,870
Your status is noble.

964
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,390
How can you personally go

965
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,780
and confront that little mistress?

966
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,350
You might fall for her trap
if you're not careful.

967
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:19,100
What trap?

968
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,260
When a person is fumed with rage,

969
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,140
it's easy to act impulsively.

970
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,580
No matter how you beat or scold her,

971
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,390
won't it give the mistress

972
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,070
to make up stories in front of Master?

973
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,350
Madam,

974
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,740
don't dirty your hands.

975
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,070
Let me go and find out first.

976
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,070
You're right.

977
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,740
I'll wait for you in my room.

978
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,620
You'll go and do it.

979
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,350
I want you to tear her apart today.

980
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,660
Just watch me.

981
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,180
Open the door!

982
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,580
Open this door now!

983
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:46,950
Who is it?

984
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:47,870
- Open the door now!
- Coming.

985
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:48,620
Open this door now!

986
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,030
I said, open this door.

987
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,740
You must be
the little mistress's sister.

988
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:56,830
Who are you?

989
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,350
Tell your mistress to show herself.

990
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,620
Who are you?

991
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,220
Who are you to ask who am I?

992
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,510
Tell her to come out now!

993
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:05,950
Don't taint the Ye's Residence!

994
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,260
How can you be so rude?

995
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:08,510
It was your master

996
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,780
who let us stay here.

997
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,220
- You, mistress!
- Do not enter.

998
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,260
Come out! Show yourself!

999
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,220
Get out!

1000
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,350
If you want us to leave,

1001
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,510
tell your master to do it.

1002
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,700
You bunch of home wreckers,

1003
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,910
I've asked you to come out,
but you refused.

1004
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,140
Fine, just you wait!

1005
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:30,700
Tong,

1006
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,870
who was that just now?

1007
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,580
Why were you arguing?

1008
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,390
Li,

1009
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,830
we can't stay at the Ye's Residence.

1010
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,220
A servant was being difficult

1011
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,180
and told us to leave.

1012
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,910
She even said you were a little mistress

1013
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,950
and I'm the sister.

1014
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,030
If you ask me,

1015
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,510
the Ye family is trying
to humiliate you.

1016
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,140
Since that is the case,

1017
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,580
we can go out first.

1018
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:53,950
We'll see how it goes
when Second Uncle returns home.

1019
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,660
Pretty imposing, eh?

1020
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,390
That mistress is taking advantage
of Mingxuan's favor

1021
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,220
and doesn't even regard me

1022
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:02,870
as the lady of the house.

1023
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:03,700
That's right.

1024
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,300
This little mistress
is getting out of hand.

1025
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,070
Madam,

1026
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,510
it's time for you to step in

1027
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,220
to take care of this little mistress.

1028
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,990
Since someone is daring enough
to cause trouble,

1029
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,870
let me deal with this little mistress.

Madam,

1032
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,070
could this little mistress

1033
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,260
have sensed
that she was getting into trouble,

1034
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,030
so she went to complain to Master?

1035
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,470
You, little mistress.

1036
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,070
Ye Mingxuan,

1037
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,430
I won't let you off the hook.

1038
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:50,100
Li,

1039
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,390
where are we going?

1040
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,580
Will you accompany me
to visit an old friend?

1041
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:56,740
Old friend?

1042
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:58,620
Wait.

1043
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,660
Are you here to find Qiongzhi?

1044
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,430
Qiongzhi is not home at this time.

1045
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,030
Where is she now?

1046
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,430
If you're in a rush,

1047
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,830
go and find her at Xihua Brothel.

1048
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:14,830
Xihua Brothel?

1049
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,390
That's the most famous brothel
in Luyang.

My Lord,

1052
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,430
Wulan is very alert.

1053
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,580
If we monitor her in advance,

1054
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:39,580
I'm afraid she'll notice something.

1055
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,430
If we alert her,

1056
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,300
Chu Lan won't show up.

1057
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,100
So

1058
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,070
we should disguise ourselves as guests,

1059
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,870
get close to her, control her,

1060
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,030
and use her to lure out Chu Lan.

1061
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,550
What are we waiting for?

1062
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:55,700
Let's begin.

1063
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:56,510

looks more like a guest?

Have you made the arrangement
with Wulan?

1068
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:16,700
All right.

00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:17,990
Be patient.

I'm not someone's wife
to cause anyone trouble here.

I'm here to inquire about something
with Lady Qiongzhi.

Please grant me this favor.

Who are you?

1087

What else could
a man coming here be for?

and looking even more charming
than Wulan.

Since Wulan isn't here yet,

1093

why not join me for tea?

00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,350
How did you see through me?

1095

for so many years.

Young Lady,
you've entered the wrong room.

1100
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:07,100
Would you like to listen to music
or have a drink?

1101
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,700
Some guests like
to play big games like this.

1103
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:24,140
do you really believe
Taohong would give you information?

1104
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,950
Since you know Taohong,

1105
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,430
my trip here isn't a waste.

I know your sweetheart.
