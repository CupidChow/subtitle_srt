00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,130
Someone.

184
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,250
Yes.

185
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,100
Take her away.

186
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,820
Yes.

187
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,220
My Lord,

188
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,340
Jiang Yuanbai just brought

189
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,770
Second Lady Jiang
to the Court of Judicial Review.

190
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,460
Suddenly,

191
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,420
she retracted her testimony

192
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,820
and was detained on the spot.

193
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:55,850
What?

194
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,180
Gentlemen,

195
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,130
can I talk to Second Lady Jiang?

196
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,490
You found a nice backer for yourself.

197
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,420
She insisted on saving you at all costs.

198
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,060
I never asked her to save me.

199
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,420
She captured my brother
and tortured him every day

200
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,890
in a secret dungeon.

201
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,340
Don't you know about that?

202
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,490
Xue Zhao?

203
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,010
Is he still alive?

204
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,180
Stop pretending, Shen Yurong.

205
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,420
You're both intimate. How could she
possibly hide that from you?

206
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,100
I really don't know.

207
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,700
She exchanged my brother for you.

208
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,250
Shen Yurong,

209
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,180
after you leave,
don't just indulge in pleasure.

210
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,100
Remember, every moment you live

211
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,250
was paid for with the suffering
of the Xue family.

212
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,850
Do you think

213
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,850
I'm that kind of person?

214
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,300
I once believed
your conscience was intact

215
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,300
and gave you a chance.

216
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,770
However, you chose Wanning.

217
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,220
I wish you happiness.

218
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,220
I didn't choose her.

219
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,700
I just couldn't give up
on my mother and younger sister.

220
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,770
I know that well.

221
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,460
Just like how you abandoned me,

222
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,730
my father, and my brother,

223
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,610
right?

224
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,770
I won't expect more from you.

225
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,890
I'll eventually expose the evil deeds

226
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,610
you've done to the public.

227
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,180
Li.

228
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,530
Don't call me that again.

229
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,940
This time,
I find it disgusting for real.

230
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,290
Is this what you call
being forced by circumstances?

231
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,700
I need your help

232
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,290
regarding something.

233
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,810
Now you're asking for my help?

234
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,420
You're the only person
I trust to do this.

235
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,700
What is it?

236
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,980
Pick up my brother
at Eldest Princess' Residence.

237
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,460
Xue Zhao is still alive?

238
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,700
But he's barely alive.

239
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,420
After I get him, then what?

240
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,090
What about you?

241
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,050
I'm waiting for Jiuyue's reply.

242
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,290
If possible, please urge them.

243
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,290
Are you not afraid?

244
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,090
This isn't the first time.

245
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,380
Duke Su,

246
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,140
please make sure
my brother is safe first.

247
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,570
Little Leopard Cat
isn't adorable when it cries.

248
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,180
Duke Su,

249
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,980
you came personally to pick him up?

250
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,700
Where is he?

251
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,940
I've sent him to your residence.

252
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,540
[Duke Su's Residence]

253
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,530
Duke Su,

254
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,660
how could I possibly let
you and your people

255
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,980
see Xue Zhao walk out of here
with your own eyes?

256
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,980
I thought you'd

257
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,290
continue to keep this card
in your hands.

258
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,900
Duke Su,

259
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,900
you don't know me well.

260
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,090
I keep my promises.

261
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,050
Besides, the show has just begun.

262
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,700
Killing him and ending it so easily.

263
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,730
How could I let her have her way?

264
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,530
I want her to see her brother

265
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,050
become a cripple, unable to walk.

266
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,420
That's far more devastating
than simply killing him.

267
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,980
I'm afraid you're going
to be disappointed.

268
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,380
What do you mean?

269
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,980
She isn't as greedy as you.

270
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,010
As long as he's alive,
that's enough for her.

271
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,530
Don't call me that again.

272
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,900
This time,
I find it disgusting for real.

273
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,460
Yurong?

274
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,570
Mother asked me to bring you dinner.

275
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,090
Go have the servants

276
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,810
clean up the room I used to stay in.

277
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,700
Are you moving back?

278
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,940
Yes, I'm moving back.

279
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,330
That's great.

280
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,330
Would you like me
to get anything for you?

281
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,020
There's no rush.

282
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,050
You've lost weight and look even better.

283
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,130
Your Highness, you've also lost weight.

284
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,290
Have you thought it through?

285
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,810
Yes.

286
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,290
While in prison, I failed you. I deserve
a thousand deaths for my crime.

287
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,570
Tell me. What do you plan to do?

288
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,940
Xue Fangfei won't be sentenced to death.

289
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,370
The Jiang family and Xiao Heng
will find ways to save her.

290
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,180
She won't be imprisoned for long.

291
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,570
So?

292
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,660
No one can touch Xue Fangfei
in the Jiang family.

293
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,570
It might be better to retrieve her first

294
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,460
and place her in the Shen family's care.

295
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,740
What do you mean?

296
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,660
I'll request His Majesty to arrange
for me and Xue Fangfei to get married.

297
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,050
What was that?

298
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,530
I said,

299
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,770
I'll request His Majesty to arrange
for me and Xue Fangfei to get married.

300
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,980
Have you already planned to do this?

301
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,130
To reunite with your Mrs. Shen.

302
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,050
She ruined me, leaving me with nothing.

303
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,850
It was you who saved me,

304
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,500
restoring my honor and future.

305
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,660
I'm not a fool.

306
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,980
Why would I want to reunite with her?

307
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,770
If you have a Mrs. Shen,

308
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,660
how will you be my husband?

309
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,020
Your Highness, you are the princess.

310
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,330
If you were to marry me in the future,

311
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,570
you can demote her from wife to maid.

312
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,700
That way, she can serve you forever.

313
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,740
Your Highness, don't you want to see her

314
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,700
grovel at your feet?

315
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,940
Do you hate her that much?

316
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,700
I have no one but you now.

317
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:32,700
What does that mean?

318
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,090
Stand up and talk.

319
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,370
Adorning you

320
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,570
and puting your hairpin on
for you, my darling.

321
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,330
My darling.

322
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,810
This is the first time
you've given me a gift.

323
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,020
That's because you're noble

324
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,290
and have everything, including me.

325
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,900
We have to enjoy
this rare happiness to the full,

326
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,610
even with chrysanthemum flowers
all over our hair.

327
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,770
You really went to great lengths

328
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,330
to persuade me to agree to the marriage.

329
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,570
The marriage by decree is just an act,

330
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,130
aimed to please you, Your Highness.

331
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,370
If the Jiang family disagrees,

332
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,700
the emperor won't force them.

333
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,370
So, we need to find someone

334
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,940
to bring this up to His Majesty.

335
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,050
Who?

336
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,700
Consort Li.

337
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,610
This is an available pawn.

338
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,620
[Duke Su's Residence]

339
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,810
How is he?

340
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,460
Although the injuries are serious,

341
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,940
they are not life-threatening.

342
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,420
Currently, he is asleep

343
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,260
after taking some calming medicine.

344
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,260
What did the doctor say about his leg?

345
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,220
Can it be healed?

346
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,770
The doctor said he might need
to use crutches for the rest of his life.

347
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,050
Have you investigated Zhou Dezhao?

348
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,180
Anything on him?

349
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,260
Not yet. He has always been impartial.

350
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,700
Lady Jiang's false accusations
against a court official

351
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,660
have already been finalized.

352
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,290
The Court of Judicial Review
is currently discussing the sentence.

353
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,570
What about the Jiang family's reaction?

354
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,220
A spy found out

355
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,180
that the Secretariat Director
approached His Majesty,

356
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,530
who referred him to Zhou Dezhao.

357
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,570
Thus, the Secretariat Director is
at the Court of Judicial Review every day.

358
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,050
It seems the emperor intends
to remain a bystander.

359
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,220
Prepare my carriage.

360
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,090
Your Highness,
Eldest Princess is here.

361
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:01,940
Your Highness.

362
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,740
It's indeed rare for you

363
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,740
to visit me personally.

364
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,900
I'm a bit late.

365
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,900
I should have come earlier
to offer my well wishes

366
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,130
when Mrs. Jiang had her accident.

367
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,770
Your Highness, you must be here

368
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,530
for a reason.

369
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,850
Speaking of which,

370
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,090
if it weren't for you using
my sister as a pawn,

371
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,290
she wouldn't have ended up
in such a situation.

372
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,530
Even if I hadn't teamed up with her,

373
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,500
she would have clashed fiercely
with Jiang Li anyway.

374
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,330
She isn't Jiang Li's match.

375
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,700
It was Jiang Li who brought harm
to Mrs. Jiang.

376
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,420
What's the point
of bringing this up now?

377
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,900
I have an idea

378
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,850
for you to avenge your sister.

379
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,090
It depends on whether you're willing.

380
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,180
Say it.

381
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,610
Request His Majesty
to arrange for a marriage

382
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,940
between Jiang Li and Shen Yurong.

383
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,130
An arranged marriage?

384
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,940
What do you mean?

385
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,420
The Secretariat Director treasures
his daughter dearly,

386
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,130
and the Jiang family protects her well.

387
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,020
We can't touch her.

388
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,330
But Shen Yurong belongs to me.

389
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,850
If she comes to the Shen family,

390
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,900
then we'll have control over her.

391
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,090
That does sound like a good idea.

392
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,980
However, I won't let myself
be used as a pawn

393
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,220
by you like my sister was.

394
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,610
How could I possibly use you as a pawn?

395
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,940
At most, I'll threaten you.

396
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,500
What?

397
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,020
I heard

398
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,260
that there was a disturbance
of evil spirits in the imperial harem,

399
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,050
and the Office of Imperial Diviner
went to exorcise it.

400
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,530
Strangely, Consort Xian

401
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,220
passed away.

402
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,700
Besides the Imperial Diviner,

403
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,130
everyone else involved
from the Office of Imperial Diviner

404
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,180
has resigned and returned
to their hometowns.

405
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,500
That's so strange.

406
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,900
Where did they go?

407
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,850
You know,

408
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,660
and I know.

409
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,610
Speaking of which, I must thank you.

410
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,130
If it weren't for you,

411
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,900
I wouldn't have thought
of this exorcism method,

412
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,180
which ended up causing
your sister to suffer so much.

413
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,130
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

414
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,130
You didn't root
out the problem back then,

415
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,220
so it's too late to be cruel now.

416
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,530
You sent a palace maid who knew
about the incident back home.

417
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,260
Later, I found her.

418
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,660
With a little coercion,

419
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,130
she would surely disclose
the whole truth

420
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,220
to His Majesty.

421
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,260
Simply persuading

422
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,660
His Majesty to arrange a marriage

423
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,020
is certainly easier than explaining

424
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,460
why you killed Consort Xian.

425
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,570
Once the matter is settled,

426
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,850
I will promptly return
the palace maid to you

427
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,050
for you to handle as you see fit.

428
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,740
Why stand there, Your Highness?

429
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,810
Come over and have some tea.

430
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,700
Your Majesty, are you going
to stay out of Jiang Li's case?

431
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,370
Do you really think I

432
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,850
have nothing better to do than
to meddle in such minor cases?

433
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,850
What if Wanning is involved in this?

434
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,370
I've previously instructed you

435
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,740
to watch over your pawns carefully.

436
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,220
Why would you need a dead pawn?

437
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,420
Why the rush?

438
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,370
They have yet to take action, right?

439
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,940
Xiao Heng, concern causes anxiety.

440
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:40,700
Your Majesty,

441
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,370
Her Highness Consort Li invites you
to a stroll in the imperial garden.

442
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,770
I should rest.

443
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:46,980
You can head back.

444
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,980
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]

445
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,900
I think your pawn

446
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,810
is calmer than you.

447
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,900
Shen Yurong has entered the palace.

448
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,180
Continue watching him.

449
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,050
Inform me as soon as there is any news.

450
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,770
Yes.

451
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:19,980
Your Majesty,

452
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,020
it's been a while

453
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,090
since we had a chance
to take a stroll together.

454
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,530
Yes.

455
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,530
I've been too busy lately.

456
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,940
I just finished dealing
with the alliance with Great Zhao,

457
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,180
and now there's another pile
of matters ahead.

458
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,500
[Hua'an Hall]
Are you talking about Second Lady Jiang

459
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,850
and Mr. Shen?

460
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,700
Their affairs are causing quite a stir.

461
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,330
It seems tensions are rising between
the Shen and Jiang families as well.

462
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,130
Mr. Shen and the Secretariat Director

463
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,660
are both trustworthy court officials.

464
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,660
They are both important to me.

465
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,130
I'm in a dilemma too.

466
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,610
I have an idea.

467
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,050
It can solve your concerns

468
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,370
and satisfy both
the Jiang and Shen families.

469
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,090
Speaking of which,
Li is my sister's daughter.

470
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,180
Despite their past

471
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,050
misunderstandings,

472
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,180
I've always considered Li as my niece.

473
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,940
A lady

474
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,090
in prison.

475
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,020
Her dignity and reputation are all gone.

476
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,530
It's heartbreaking to witness.

477
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,290
I sent someone to inquire
about the reason from Mr. Shen,

478
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,090
only to find out it was
all a misunderstanding.

479
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,290
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

480
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,500
I was thinking

481
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,220
what kind of misunderstanding it was.

482
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,740
I've sent someone
to invite Mr. Shen here.

483
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,570
Why don't we let him explain
to you in person?

484
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,700
Sure.

485
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

486
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,810
Greetings, Your Highness Consort Li.

487
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,770
Consort Li told me the matter between
you and Li Jiang was a misunderstanding.

488
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,090
It was my fault.

489
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,850
After all, in this case,

490
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,810
a lady's reputation is more important.

491
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,050
I believe Lady Jiang acted
in a moment of confusion

492
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,770
rather than with malicious intent

493
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,460
I also implore Your Majesty
to pardon her

494
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,370
and refrain
from pursuing this matter further.

495
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,900
Do you truly not mind?

496
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,130
I naturally will not hold it
against Lady Jiang.

497
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,530
Mr. Shen, you're a gentleman

498
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,420
and magnanimous.

499
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,980
You're a fitting match.

500
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,900
With this incident,

501
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,570
Li's reputation
will likely be tarnished.

502
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,330
After she made such a mistake,

503
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,740
it may be difficult
for her to marry well.

504
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,700
She previously professed affection

505
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,220
for Mr. Shen.

506
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,500
Since Mr. Shen doesn't mind,

507
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,180
why don't you

508
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,260
arrange for them
to get married, Your Majesty?

509
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,090
I can resolve the matter

510
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,900
and preserve Li's reputation.

511
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,900
In that case,

512
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,900
it would indeed
be quite unfair to Mr. Shen.

513
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,420
If it can preserve
Lady Jiang's reputation,

514
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,420
I'm willing to heed Consort Li's words.

515
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,780
Marriage is a significant matter.

516
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,860
Naturally, I must inquire about
the Secretariat Director's opinion.

517
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,570
However, Mr. Shen has agreed not
to pursue the matter.

518
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,300
Issue a decree to the Court
of Judicial Review to dismiss the case,

519
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,780
release Jiang Li, and let
the Jiang family take charge of her.

520
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:22,820
Yes.

521
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,020
Let me ask the Secretariat Director.

522
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,380
If both families are willing,

523
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,460
I am more than willing
to accumulate merit

524
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,210
by arranging such a good match.

525
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,940
Okay, let's do as you say.

526
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,980
I am willing to go to the prison
and issue the decree

527
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,090
to release Lady Jiang.

528
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,130
Go ahead.

529
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,420
They want His Majesty
to decree an arranged marriage.

530
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,130
So, that's the plan
they've been working on.

531
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,250
My Lord,

532
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,900
should we return to the palace
or head to the prison?

533
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,690
Let's go to the prison directly.

534
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:01,460
Yes.

535
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,090
Second Lady Jiang, you may leave.

536
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,570
Let me escort her out.

537
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,570
Yes, Mr. Shen.

538
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,980
You've suffered for these few days.

539
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,820
Will you marry me?

540
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,570
Are you crazy?

541
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,860
Aren't you curious

542
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,860
why you were released?

543
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,420
His Majesty intends
to arrange for us to get married.

544
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,780
We love each other,

545
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,860
so what you did wasn't wrong.

546
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,780
Was this your plan from the beginning?

547
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:15,730
Yes.

548
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,050
So, you married me once,

549
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,690
killed me once,

550
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,130
and now you want
to marry me a second time

551
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,690
to kill me again?

552
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,250
What if I say

553
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,900
I'm protecting you this time?

554
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,300
Do you believe that?

555
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,500
I do.

556
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,650
Your words merely disgust me.

557
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,530
Li,

558
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,380
you can choose not to trust me,

559
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,130
but ultimately,
the emperor's decree cannot be defied.

560
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,650
I'll give you a ride home.

561
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,420
Think about what I said.

562
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,530
Your carriage leads
to the road to the underworld.

563
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,420
I dare not ride it again.

564
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,250
Are you planning to walk back
to the Jiang's Residence?

565
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,210
Someone will escort me.

566
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,380
My hand is cramping.

567
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,900
Loosen your grip a bit.

568
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,570
I won't move.

569
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,050
Just now, Shen Yurong said

570
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,340
that His Majesty wants
to arrange for me to marry him.

571
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,420
I heard about it.

572
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,780
It was Consort Li who initiated it.

573
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,530
How did she get involved?

574
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,940
Is she now allied with Wanning?

575
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,730
In the past, she wasn't,
but now I'm not certain.

576
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,610
I've already sent someone
to investigate.

577
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,170
Consort Li should know
how dangerous Wanning is.

578
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,730
Previously, Ji Shuran's downfall

579
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,900
was partly due to Wanning's failure.

580
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,300
Now that Consort Li is willing
to help Wanning,

581
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,050
there must
be some hidden motive behind it.

582
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,210
Don't overthink it for now.

583
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,500
Let's wait for news from the spy.

584
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,530
I'll take you to my residence first
to see your younger brother.

585
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,570
While we're at it, prepare an excuse
before returning to the Jiang family.

586
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,740
[Benefiting the people]

587
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,980
[Duke Su's Residence]

588
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,500
Fangfei.

589
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,420
Zhao.

590
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:24,980
Fangfei.

591
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,780
Everyone is saying that you're dead.

592
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,170
I thought you were dead, too.

593
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,500
And Father.

594
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,530
Did you see him?

595
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,170
Does he know about us?

596
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,570
Yes, he knows.

597
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:42,610
Father is doing well.

598
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,530
What about the gold mine
on Dong Mountain?

599
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,820
Are they still mining?

600
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,170
No.

601
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,250
No, Zhao.

602
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,380
You did a good job.

603
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,250
The blueprint you drew
has saved many lives.

604
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,530
I'm glad to hear that.

605
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,530
Fangfei, I want to ask...

606
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,340
That's enough.

607
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,860
First, focus on recovering
from your injuries.

608
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,380
I'll tell you everything gradually,

609
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,420
okay?

610
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,460
Zhao,

611
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,610
I'm not Xue Fangfei now.

612
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,020
I have a new identity.

613
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,300
I'm Jiang Yuanbai's daughter,

614
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,340
Jiang Li.

615
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,780
Jiang Li?

616
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:29,650
Fangfei,

617
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,530
I didn't realize
you've suffered so much.

618
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,690
It's all over.

619
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,530
You and Father are both alive.

620
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,090
That makes me happy.

621
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,250
Anyway,

622
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,570
why did I hear
you were killed by bandits?

623
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,020
After receiving the letter that day,

624
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,610
I didn't want Father to worry,

625
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,500
so I went to the capital alone
to find out the truth.

626
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,860
I felt something was amiss,

627
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,420
so I had someone write
to the magistrate in the capital.

628
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,210
Unexpectedly, on the way there,

629
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,130
I encountered a gang of bandits.

630
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,300
Who's lying in ambush here?

631
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,940
Show yourself now!

632
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,300
When I woke up,

633
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,300
I found myself in the private dungeon
of Eldest Princess' Residence.

634
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,860
I later discovered

635
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,340
Eldest Princess was behind this.

636
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,460
She never showed herself before

637
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,260
and just kept me locked
there without a word.

638
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,350
I thought

639
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,260
I'd die there
without anyone finding out.

640
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,910
I never thought someone
would come to my rescue.

641
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,860
Now, I get to see you again.

642
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,260
Father is also in the capital.

643
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,740
It seems that heaven

644
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,700
has left a path for us.

645
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,830
Fangfei, they say
after hardship comes comfort.

646
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,260
We've endured hardships,

647
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,510
so surely better days

648
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,140
lie ahead for us.

649
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,180
Focus on recovering.

650
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,990
If you need anything, send someone
to the Jiang's Residence to find me.

651
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,350
I need to go back
and handle some matters for now.

652
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,700
Okay.

653
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,540
Father, I'm back.

654
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,470
I knew you were coming back,

655
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,950
and I was planning to go pick you up.

656
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,510
However, you weren't there.

657
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,660
Duke Su came to pick me up.

658
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,790
He asked me
about the details of the case,

659
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,660
so that took some time.

660
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,660
Why did Duke Su suddenly get involved?

661
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,030
Perhaps it was related
to Eldest Princess,

662
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,140
so he came to ask me some questions.

663
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,060
I know you and Duke Su

664
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,470
often contact each other.

665
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,060
Since you trust him,

666
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,580
I won't say much more.

667
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,030
But about clearing your name

668
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,140
did Wanning have something on you?

669
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,620
I know because
of what happened in the past,

670
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,180
you don't trust me at all.

671
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,350
But we're still father and daughter.

672
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,870
If you need anything,
you can always come to me.

673
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,740
Even if the sky were to fall,

674
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,220
I'd protect you.

675
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,390
This sudden change in testimony

676
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,910
must've embarrassed you.

677
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,100
I thought you'd blame me.

678
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,390
I've known your temperament
for a long time.

679
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,660
Your actions may seem reckless,

680
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,700
but you always have your reasons.

681
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,340
Since I've decided
to come back and help you,

682
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,130
I've also decided to trust you.

683
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,690
If you want to explain, go ahead.

684
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,900
If you don't, just tell me

685
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,380
what I can do to help.

686
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,290
Father,

687
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,060
now that the matter with
Eldest Princess has been resolved,

688
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,060
there's no need for you
to worry about it.

689
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,540
However, there's another
urgent matter at hand now.

690
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,390
What is it?

691
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,620
the emperor intends to arrange
for me to marry Shen Yurong.

692
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,100
When did that happen?

693
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,790
I just heard it from Shen Yurong
while I was in prison earlier.

694
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,580
What do you think?

695
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,030
I'm unwilling,

696
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,690
but the emperor has agreed
to the marriage.

697
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,860
A formal decree hasn't been issued yet.

698
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,170
Consort Li has been entrusted
with handling the specifics.

699
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,730
Consort Li took the initiative
to handle the marriage arrangements.

700
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,090
Her sudden involvement

701
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,570
may involve ulterior motives.

702
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,290
the emperor arranging a marriage

703
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,730
is a matter of bringing glory
to one's ancestors.

704
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,130
From past dynasties to now,

705
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,090
there has never been a precedent
of refusing such an arrangement.

706
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,730
The groom

707
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,460
is Shen Yurong,

708
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,380
who I claim to have feelings for.

709
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,340
If you refuse
the marriage arrangement's suggestion,

710
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,380
Consort Li can
make a huge issue out of it.

711
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,020
Resisting the imperial decree

712
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,290
could place you in a difficult position.

713
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,380
Is Mother doing well?

714
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,770
Besides being senile,

715
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:58,820
she's otherwise fine.

716
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,980
Mother and Consort Li need to meet up.

717
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,380
Given Ji Shuran's current condition,

718
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:07,820
I'm afraid she may not be able
to persuade Consort Li.

719
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,290
Let's give it a try first.

720
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,650
Please make the arrangements, Father.

721
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,210
No problem.

722
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,540
My Lord, I've found
the information you requested.

723
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:28,690
The spy reported

724
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,650
overhearing Wanning and Consort Li

725
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,580
discussing the supernatural events
that occurred in the palace years ago.

726
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:36,810
The death of Consort Xian?

727
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,330
Yes, the spy reinvestigated

728
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,060
and realized there's more to it.

729
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,380
Evidence?

730
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,170
We're still investigating whether any
of the palace maids who were released

731
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,330
back then knew what happened.

732
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,290
Since Wanning has approached Consort Li,

733
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,500
she likely has the evidence in hand.

734
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,900
Start investigating her.

735
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,460
Should we inform His Majesty about this?

736
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,540
No need.

737
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,580
His Majesty may be in the know.

738
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,420
Then we need to conduct
the investigation discreetly,

739
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,940
but it might take some time.

740
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,020
I'm afraid by the time
we find out the truth,

741
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,250
Consort Li might've already
arranged the marriage.

742
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,290
I'll promptly proceed
with the investigation.

743
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,540
Tell Li about this.

744
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,610
Yes.
