You can't.

187
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,650
She's mad and can be violent.

188
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,770
Moreover, if you keep coming,

189
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,180
what if others see her?

190
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,580
They'll start gossiping.

191
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,980
Never mind. There will be opportunities
to visit her in the future.

192
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,610
All right.

193
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,460
Tong,

194
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,460
do you find Aunt Hu

195
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,130
a little strange?

196
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,890
Strange? How so?

197
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,530
Just now, she seemed
to be observing me secretly.

198
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,820
Especially after I confronted Ji Shuran,

199
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,610
her gaze was fixed on me.

200
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,220
It's just strange.

201
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,650
Are you suspecting
that she's not really hysterical?

202
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,250
But how could
an ordinary person pretend to be crazy

203
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,060
and guard a dead person's tomb?

204
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,900
[Jiang Family Ancestral Temple]

205
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,700
Let's go.

206
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,460
Are you all right?

207
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,130
I'm fine.

208
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,820
What's going on?

209
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,490
Second Lady, I'm really sorry.

210
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,180
The reins unexpectedly broke.

211
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
The horse also ran off.

212
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,650
Why does

213
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,100
the rein suddenly break for no reason?

214
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,100
Maybe it's worn out.

215
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,730
I'll go and find the horse right away.

216
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,580
Hurry.

217
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
What happened to you?

218
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,530
Ruoyao, my horse ran away.

219
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,490
What luck.

220
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,460
Jinhua, stay with her maid here.

221
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,890
You can ride in my carriage
and leave first.

222
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,820
Yes.

223
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,370
Why? Are you planning to go back later

224
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,180
and play the victim in front

225
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,250
of Father and Grandmother?

226
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,460
You're always good at spinning tales.

227
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,060
I don't want to go back

228
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,340
and have you accuse

229
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,130
my mother of damaging your carriage
and plotting against you again.

230
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,100
In that case, thank you for the ride.

231
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,250
You should know

232
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,060
about my marriage with the Qi family.

233
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,460
I heard.

234
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,890
You ruined my engagement
with Zhou Yanbang.

235
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,340
You must be happy now.

236
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,010
He is not a good husband prospect
for you.

237
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,060
You know nothing.

238
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,610
The matter has come to this.

239
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,060
Do you feel remorse?

240
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,940
If I'm not mistaken,

241
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,100
it was you and Ji Shuran
who tried to set me up first.

242
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,770
That's because you've been targeting us

243
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,250
since you returned.

244
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,250
If you

245
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,010
had stayed quietly at Zhennyu Hall,

246
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,650
none of this would have happened to me.

247
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,420
I'll still be the Jiang's family's
only legitimate daughter.

248
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,340
It's all your fault.
It's all because of you.

249
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,890
You say I've taken everything from you.

250
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,580
But have you ever thought

251
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,610
about where did you get it from

252
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,460
and from whom did you get it from?

253
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,420
Do you know

254
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,730
what kind of life I had at Zhennyu Hall?

255
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,460
What concern is it of mine
how you lived at Zhennyu Hall?

256
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,010
Give me your hand.

257
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:17,890
Does it hurt?

258
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,770
I'm asking you if it hurts.

259
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,650
The pain I endured at Zhennyu Hall

260
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,770
was a thousand times worse than this.

261
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,580
When I was eight,

262
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,100
did I really cause harm to your mother?

263
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,340
They framed me

264
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,250
and sent me to Zhennyu Hall unjustly.

265
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:35,770
Why?

266
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,650
Can't I return to clear my name?

267
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,530
I have no bias

268
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,770
or grudges against you.

269
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,940
We were both young back then.

270
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,340
I believe it wasn't your idea

271
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,130
for me to stay
at Zhennyu Hall for so long.

272
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,370
Now that I'm back,

273
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,220
I just want to reclaim

274
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,220
what rightfully belongs to Jiang Li,

275
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,250
nothing more.

276
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,300
If you insist

277
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,340
that I took everything from you

278
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,650
and keep pressuring me,

279
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,370
I can only tell you one thing.
You're a fool.

280
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,420
What did you say? Say it again.

281
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,490
What's there to be afraid of?

282
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:10,820
I...

283
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,650
Jiang Ruoyao,

284
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,890
have you gone mad
from staying at the mansion?

285
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,180
As the legitimate daughter
of the Jiang family,

286
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,890
you've shattered our sisterly bond

287
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,770
for such a worthless person
from the Zhou family.

288
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,370
Think carefully about it.

289
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,010
Do you not regret it?

290
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,060
Now that I call you foolish,

291
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,700
that's the least of it.

292
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,610
Do you think I would listen to you

293
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,650
after talking big in front of me?

294
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,580
No matter what,

295
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,060
you owe me.

296
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,420
You must pay
for what you've done to me.

297
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,820
What price?

298
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,610
Don't move. Behave and come with me.

299
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,650
Why did you knock her out?

300
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,220
Didn't you say
we were only after money?

301
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,730
You could've asked her
about the money and left.

302
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,770
By delaying like this,

303
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,220
what if we get caught...

304
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,890
She's the obstacle between us.

305
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,100
Without her,

306
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,370
we could have been together long ago.

307
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,850
Think about it.

308
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,130
Before Jiang Li came back,

309
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,730
you were the most beautiful lady
in the city,

310
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,130
with excellent musical talent.

311
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,530
I was also a handsome
and talented young man.

312
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,060
We've become like this now.

313
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,460
Shouldn't Jiang Li die?

314
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,250
Shouldn't she?

315
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,220
Are you planning to kill her?

316
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,530
In the deep mountains and forests,

317
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,130
who would know we were behind this?

318
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,890
Even if we were caught,
family secrets must not be revealed.

319
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,650
The Jiang family and the Zhou family

320
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,820
will protect us at all costs.

321
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,850
Are you crazy?

322
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,250
This is a human life!

323
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,650
She's always been a troublemaker.

324
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,890
We won't have peace until she's gone!

325
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,530
Ruoyao,

326
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,850
I'm doing this

327
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,610
so we can be together.

328
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,770
Last night,

329
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,890
have you forgotten

330
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,340
what you said?

331
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,940
Ruoyao,

332
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,100
I finally get to see you.

333
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,100
Aren't you already married to Yu'e?

334
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,570
Why are you saying these things now?

335
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,330
Ruoyao, you knew

336
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,010
I was set up.

337
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,530
Besides,

338
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,010
I've never stopped sending you letters
all this time.

339
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,490
I've never touched Jiang Yu'e.

340
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,730
You're the only one in my heart.

341
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,380
What's the use of saying all this now?

342
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,250
Do you know...

343
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,900
Do you know

344
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,010
my mother wants to marry me off
to the Qi family?

345
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,050
How

346
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,980
about we elope?

347
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,900
What?

348
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,490
Let's elope to another place.

349
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,180
To a place surrounded
by green hills and clear waters.

350
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,700
We'll gather some money

351
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,010
and live a simple life there,

352
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,010
away from Yan Capital,

353
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,730
away from everyone
and everything you dislike.

354
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,050
Just us.

355
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,980
But my mother is keeping
a close eye on me now.

356
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,660
I'm afraid

357
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,980
it'll be hard to get money from home.

358
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,900
I can't bear to see you suffer.

359
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,730
I'll gather the money myself.

360
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,620
If necessary, I can work as a laborer.

361
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,010
In any case, I won't let you suffer.

362
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,570
You're from a prestigious family,
a scholarly family.

363
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,010
- How can you...
- So what?

364
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,090
I just want to be with you.

365
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,290
Ruoyao,

366
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,460
I suddenly remembered someone.

367
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,250
She should provide the money.

368
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,420
Who?

369
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,530
Jiang Li.

370
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,570
She has the backing
of the wealthy Ye family.

371
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,140
If we capture her,

372
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,860
we can get a lot of money.

373
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,620
It'll be enough for our future.

374
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,220
You've wanted
to kill her from the start.

375
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,810
Am I right?

376
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,730
You've been lying to me all along.

377
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,980
Ruoyao, trust me.

378
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,460
I won't harm you.

379
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,530
Ruoyao, believe me.

380
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,420
Ruoyao.

381
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,420
Ruoyao, you can't leave.

382
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,860
If you leave, it'll be over for us!

383
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,570
Let me go.

384
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,660
- Ruoyao, listen to me.
- Let me go!

385
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,810
Ruoyao! Ruoyao!

386
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,220
Why are all of you forcing me?

387
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,980
Jiang Li must pay the price.

388
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,380
On the day of the palace banquet,
I asked to see you.

389
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,940
It would've been fine
if you didn't come.

390
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,140
Why did you have to set me up?

391
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,980
I never intended to set you up.

392
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,860
That day, I was just like you.

393
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,380
I was also a victim of the trap.

394
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,730
Stop deceiving me.

395
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,010
Jiang Yu'e has told me everything.

396
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,250
It was you who's been scheming
behind my back.

397
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,090
I don't understand what you're saying.

398
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,380
It's you who betrayed me.

399
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,090
It was you who caused me
to fall to this point.

400
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,010
You can't escape.

401
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,940
Jiang Li,

402
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,660
you do think your status
is precious, right?

403
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:13,980
Well,

404
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,090
why don't we make up
for the previous night

405
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,250
together?

406
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,660
Zhou Yanbang,

407
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,290
you're the son
of the Marquis of Ningyuan.

408
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,380
How can your mind be so muddled?

409
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,980
Can't you even figure out

410
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,860
who's the one really harming you?

411
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,140
Who do you think you are?

412
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,660
Who are you to lecture me?

413
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,010
If anything happens to me today,

414
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,220
do you think you'll escape?

415
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,140
Even if the Zhou family
and the Jiang family don't pursue it,

416
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,660
I still have the Ye family behind me.

417
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,220
If you, a hereditary nobleman
end up in jail,

418
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,980
you'll ruin your reputation

419
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,770
and disgrace the Zhou family.

420
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,700
Oh, Jiang Li.

421
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,980
I almost fell for your deception again.

422
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,770
But you've reminded me of something.

423
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,220
After I'm done with you,

424
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,380
I'll cut your tendons, and your hands,

425
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,900
and cut off your tongue.

426
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,900
Finally, I'll gouge out your eyes.

427
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,900
Then you won't be able to speak, write,

428
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,220
or see.

429
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,460
How will you accuse me then?

430
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:48,860
Wait.

431
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,570
Zhou Yanbang,

432
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,380
are you not afraid
of breaking Ruoyao's heart

433
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,090
for doing this to me?

434
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,050
Among us Jiang sisters, we each have
our own desires and grievances,

435
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,860
except Ruoyao alone.

436
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,330
She desires nothing else.

437
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,290
She only has you in her heart.

438
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,700
No matter what I do,

439
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,700
she'll forgive me

440
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,660
as long as I coax her.

441
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,250
She's been strictly controlled
by her mother since childhood.

442
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,490
She lacks determination.

443
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,180
She'll obediently follow me

444
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,010
if I coax her a little.

445
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,290
As for you,

446
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,220
you're so independent like a wild horse,

447
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,620
making people want to conquer you.

448
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,530
Shameless.

449
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,330
Ruoyao forgives you

450
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,010
because she likes you.

451
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,250
You're using her feelings.

452
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,380
Do you really have her in your heart?

453
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,530
If she wasn't Jiang Yuanbai's daughter,

454
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,730
would I have been engaged to her?

455
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,010
No more questions, right?

456
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,140
Let's begin.

457
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,330
Don't touch me!

458
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,900
Get off me!

459
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,980
Zhou Yanbang,

460
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,140
you brought this upon yourself.

461
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,900
I killed someone.

462
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,290
I killed someone.

463
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,290
I killed someone.

464
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,220
I killed someone.

465
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,050
Don't panic.

466
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,530
He's not dead.

467
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:34,940
Jiang Ruoyao,

468
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,770
you've sacrificed so much

469
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,730
for someone like him.

470
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,490
Once you're done crying,

471
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,490
we should hurry up and go home.

472
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,010
This matter might not be easy to handle.

473
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,250
Considering

474
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,980
that you promptly knocked out
Zhou Yanbang in time,

475
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,290
I'll let go

476
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,770
of your role in bringing me here.

477
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,620
You need to figure out

478
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,290
how to explain this to the Zhou family.

479
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,380
[Jiang's Residence]

480
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,290
Madam.

481
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,730
Madam.

482
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,980
Has Ruoyao returned?

483
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,860
Why hasn't she come back yet?

484
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,810
Wasn't she supposed

485
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,700
to return with our convoy?

486
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,090
I find it strange too.

487
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,460
Even Jiang Li

488
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,570
hasn't returned.

489
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,140
What?

490
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,010
Madam Sun.

491
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,090
Madam Sun.

492
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,090
All right.

493
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,140
What happened?

494
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,050
She said Jiang Li
and the Third Lady returned together.

495
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,330
But they were covered in blood.

496
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,220
What?

497
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,180
The daughter of the Grand Chancellor,

498
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,940
making such a ridiculous mistake
of eloping with someone.

499
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,490
Don't you care about your reputation?

500
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,220
Don't you even know you were being used?

501
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,860
How did I raise such a foolish daughter?

502
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,530
Mother, what should I do?

503
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
What should I do?

504
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,420
Why didn't you think about the outcome
before causing trouble?

505
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,180
I'm scared, Mother.

506
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,220
You brought this upon yourself.

507
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,140
Mother.

508
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,770
Don't call me.

509
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,090
From today on,

510
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,010
stay in this courtyard.

511
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,090
You're not allowed to leave
without my permission.

512
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,770
Mother.

513
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,420
Madam,

514
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,900
the Third Lady is scared right now.

515
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,020
She should be comforted.

516
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,770
Comfort?

517
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,130
She doesn't even think
about the foolish things she's done.

518
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,610
I spoiled her too much in the past,

519
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,370
which led to her being so reckless.

520
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,810
Now, let her reflect on her actions.

521
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,980
Go and pass a message to Jiang Yu'e.

522
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,570
Remember, don't let anyone see you.

523
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,530
Just say...

524
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:15,850
Yes, Madam.

525
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,740
Oh, my son. Yanbang.

526
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,570
My poor son.

527
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,330
What am I supposed to do now?

528
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,900
I hurriedly went

529
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,420
and saw Li's back figure leaving

530
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,570
and my husband covered in blood,

531
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,900
unconscious on the ground.

532
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,980
My poor son.

533
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,940
Jiang Li!

534
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,660
Come out!

535
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,180
You can go in.

536
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,090
Why are you stopping me?

537
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,180
Don't stop me!

538
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:51,850
Get out of my way!

539
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,530
- What are you doing?
- Grand Chancellor Jiang.

540
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,050
Grand Chancellor Jiang!

541
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,290
- My son is dying.
- Madam.

542
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,900
It's because of Jiang Li.

543
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,260
She must come out and explain today.

544
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,370
Jiang Li!

545
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,610
- Calm down, Madam.
- Jiang Li, come out here!

546
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,460
Or else I won't leave today.

547
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,130
Jiang Li, come out!

548
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,330
Come out!

549
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,500
Have you found Jiuyue?

550
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,570
My Lord, it's not like you don't know.

551
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,980
She's the one
who usually comes and finds us.

552
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,370
When have we ever managed
to track her whereabouts?

553
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,290
Why are you so anxious?

554
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,330
Second Lady Jiang is in trouble.

555
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,500
Second Lady,

556
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,370
Master summons you to the main hall.

557
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,050
The Jiang family owes me an explanation.

558
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,220
My son, a healthy man,

559
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,460
was beaten like that.

560
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,810
If I hadn't arrived in time
to treat him,

561
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,850
he might have died.

562
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,900
Jiang Li, tell us.

563
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,810
What on earth happened?

564
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,220
Father, yesterday after the ritual,

565
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,260
the carriage driver took me
to a remote area.

566
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,770
By the time I realized,

567
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,770
he had already disappeared.

568
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,290
Then

569
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,770
Zhou Yanbang knocked me out,
tied me up,

570
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,370
and took me to an abandoned house.

571
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,810
He tried to sexually assault me.

572
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,420
But luckily, Ruoyao arrived
just in time and stopped him.

573
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,290
I had sent Ruoyao to buy some things.

574
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,770
That's why she returned late.

575
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,530
She never mentioned seeing you.

576
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:43,940
See?

577
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,500
You lying little girl!

578
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,530
It must be you

579
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,980
who tried to seduce Yan but failed.

580
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,370
You were afraid he'd expose you

581
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,090
so you attacked him to silence him!

582
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,740
If what you said is true,

583
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,530
how do you explain my injuries?

584
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,770
Did I do this to myself?

585
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,940
You better confess it yourself.

586
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,290
Father, Ruoyao was there yesterday.

587
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,220
Why not call Ruoyao and ask her?

588
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,180
That'd be best. I'll go and get her.

589
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,420
Remember what I told you?

590
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,570
Just say you don't know anything.

591
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,740
I've taken care of the rest.

592
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,850
Mother, I don't want to go.

593
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,610
Yesterday,
you were asking me what to do.

594
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,420
Now, you're scared?

595
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,260
Are you letting Jiang Li blame

596
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,500
everything on you?

597
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,850
Do you want to protect yourself or not?

598
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,050
Show some courage.

599
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,020
Don't let Jiang Li outshine you.

600
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,940
Go and wash up.

601
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,530
Mother, you've been scolding me

602
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,420
since yesterday.

603
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,810
Am I really your daughter?

604
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,610
What are you saying?

605
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,460
Who am I doing this for?

606
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,610
Yao,

607
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,980
be good and do as I say.

608
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,570
I'm doing this for your own good.

609
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,900
I've already spoken to the Qi family.

610
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,500
Once we take care of Jiang Li,

611
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,700
your marriage will be arranged.

612
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,980
When you're married to the family,

613
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,610
you'll be well taken care of.

614
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,130
Ruoyao, tell me.

615
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,370
Were you there when Yan
and Jiang Li were together yesterday?

616
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,330
What did Li say?

617
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,020
Yesterday, the carriage driver took me
to a remote place.

618
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,460
Zhou Yanbang tried
to sexually assault me.

619
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,980
It was you who arrived just in time
and saved me.

620
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,570
Ruoyao, tell us.

621
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,900
What exactly happened yesterday?

622
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,660
Li, even if you fear punishment

623
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,660
for hurting Zhou Yanbang,

624
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,570
you shouldn't blame your sister.

625
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,610
Even if Zhou Yanbang tried

626
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,980
to assault you as you said,

627
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,370
why was Ruoyao there?

628
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,610
Do you think Yanbang

629
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,220
brought Ruoyao to harm you?

630
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,700
Mother.

631
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,090
Father. Mother.

632
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,290
Ruoyao saw that I hadn't returned
after so long.

633
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,130
She was worried about me
so she went searching for me.

634
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,020
She was concerned I might be in danger

635
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,290
and saved me.

636
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,090
If not for Ruoyao,

637
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,740
I would have been harmed.

638
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,420
I watched Ruoyao grow up.

639
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,420
She would never hit Yan.

640
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,940
It must be you making up lies

641
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,420
to avoid punishment.

642
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,900
Enough. I don't want
to hear any more of this.

643
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,940
Marchioness Ningyuan, please calm down.

644
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,330
Mrs. Jiang, I came here first

645
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,610
to ask for an explanation

646
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,740
out of respect for our family ties.

647
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,770
Otherwise, I would have reported
this to the authorities directly.

648
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,900
As her parents,

649
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,460
are you letting this girl

650
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,850
twist her words?

651
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,180
In that case,

652
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,180
we'll go to the yamen.

653
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,700
Let us
all face public humiliation together.

654
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,290
Maybe then

655
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,570
you'll give a proper explanation.

656
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,900
Li, I'll ask you one more time.

657
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,570
What exactly happened
between you and Zhou Yanbang?

658
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,180
Father, I already told you the truth.

659
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,810
Fine, keep denying it.

660
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,660
My son can't move

661
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,700
and might not survive.

662
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,130
In that case,

663
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,290
why should I save face for you?

664
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,940
Someone! Take her to the yamen!

665
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:50,810
Yes, Madam.

666
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,090
Wait.

667
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,180
Do you have something else to say?

668
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,090
I don't want to see

669
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,850
a poor person's reputation ruined
at the yamen.

670
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,260
What nonsense are you spouting?

671
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,900
I've said everything I needed to.

672
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,530
I'm waiting for Ruoyao to speak.

673
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,220
Ruoyao, why are you still silent?

674
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,330
We're sisters.

675
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,260
No matter the reason,

676
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,740
you saved my honor yesterday.

677
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,180
I'll never forget this kindness.

678
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,050
You've always been brave.

679
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,660
Even if you made
a mistake trusting someone,

680
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,130
it's not a big deal.

681
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,330
The real mistake is covering
for someone

682
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,050
who makes you live in fear.

683
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,020
Li, stop pressuring your sister.

684
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,570
She can't lie for your sake.

685
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,740
I'm not pressuring her.

686
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,810
I'm waiting for her to speak up.

687
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,660
She's old enough.

688
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,460
She can't rely on Mother forever.

689
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,570
She needs to discern right
from wrong on her own.

690
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,770
She can't just
let anyone control her life forever.

691
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,570
What are you saying?

692
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,050
Are you trying

693
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,460
to drive a wedge between us?

694
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,130
You've been wronged for so long

695
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,420
and didn't even realize it.

696
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,380
Whenever you face any trouble,

697
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,900
you always hide in your room

698
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,980
and wait for others to comfort you.

699
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,050
A few kind words
and you're easily swayed,

700
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,780
willing to be manipulated.

701
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,050
Have you truly lived freely?

702
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,940
You've had no opinions of your own,
always controlled by others.

703
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,820
Ruoyao, do you understand
what I'm saying?

704
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,050
She's been under Mother's strict watch
and lacks her own will.

705
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,210
As long as I coax her a bit,

706
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,690
she'll be completely devoted to me.

707
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,820
Ruoyao isn't feeling well.

708
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,300
Madam Sun.

709
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:58,860
Yes, Madam.

710
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,650
Take her back to her room to rest.

711
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:01,650
Yes, Madam.

712
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,300
Third Lady, come.

713
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,050
Let's go back and rest.

714
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,130
Let's go.

715
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,940
Jiang Ruoyao,

716
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:09,730
are you going to hide

717
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:10,980
in your room again?

718
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,730
Do you want to live like this
for the rest of your life?

719
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,860
How deceptively persuasive.

720
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:24,730
Someone!

721
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,130
Tie her up
and report to the authorities!

722
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:26,650
Yes, Madam.

723
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,130
Let's go.

724
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,300
Father,

725
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,610
what Li said is true.

726
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,940
I was there yesterday.

727
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,900
I was the one
who accidentally hurt Zhou Yanbang.

728
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,570
What nonsense are you talking about?

729
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,730
I'm not talking nonsense.

730
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,610
Jiang Ruoyao,
do you know what you're saying?

731
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,610
I know.

732
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,820
Zhou Yanbang was bullying

733
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,900
and trying to harm Li.

734
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,860
I couldn't bear to see her suffer.

735
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,380
So in a moment of desperation,

736
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,940
I accidentally hit him too hard.

737
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,170
Everything I said is true,

738
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,420
and I'm willing to take responsibility.

739
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,860
Ruoyao, you...

740
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,170
Grand Chancellor Jiang,

741
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,020
you must seek justice for our Yan.

742
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,460
Justice?

743
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,730
Shouldn't we also ask
the Marquis of Ningyuan

744
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,210
to seek justice
for my daughter, Jiang Li?

745
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,300
You wanted to report
to the yamen, right?

746
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,380
Let's go together
and get to the bottom of this.

747
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:29,650
You...

748
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,130
All of you...

749
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,420
The Jiang family...

750
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,250
You...

751
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,570
Madam.

752
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,090
- Madam.
- Fetch the physician.

753
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,050
- Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

754
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,090
- Madam.
- Madam.

755
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:45,900
Madam.

756
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:47,530
Madam.

757
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,130
Go back to your rooms.

758
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,300
Madam.

759
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,420
Madam.

760
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,690
Wait.

761
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,170
Why did you reveal

762
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,090
that I was the one
who took you to Zhou Yanbang?

763
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
If I revealed it,

764
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,860
you would say you don't know anything.

765
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,380
You still set me up.

766
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,820
I made you speak the truth,

767
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,860
reveal Zhou Yanbang's true colors,

768
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,570
make you see the truth,
and stop being so deluded.

769
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,340
Is this setting you up?

770
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,170
Enough with your smooth talk.

771
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,170
You must be very satisfied now, right?

772
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,610
You walk away unscathed

773
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,340
while making Marchioness Ningyuan
hate me even more.

774
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,690
Jiang Li,
since my coming-of-age ceremony,

775
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,420
you've stolen my spotlight,

776
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,020
taken my man, and snatched away
everything from me.

777
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,820
After all this time,

778
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,650
why do you still oppose me?

779
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
If you hadn't come back,

780
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,690
I wouldn't be

781
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,730
this miserable, selfish,

782
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,250
cold, and incompetent.

783
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,050
If I hadn't come back,

784
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,020
you wouldn't have turned out this way?

785
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,530
You've said this

786
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,340
to me so many times.

787
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,050
Does it work?

788
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,860
Is it really because of me

789
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,570
that you've become

790
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,210
someone you don't even like?

791
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,460
If things had gone smoothly for you,

792
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,380
and you married Zhou Yanbang,

793
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,650
this despicable person,

794
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,780
wouldn't you be scared now?

795
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:26,730
Are you going to hide again?

796
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,940
You refuse to admit your mistakes
and hide when you're scared.

797
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,380
People out there are ruthless

798
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,250
and extremely exploitative.

799
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,420
How long
can your little room protect you?

800
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,610
Stop talking already!

801
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,460
I made you tell the truth

802
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,610
to clear my name.

803
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,420
But not every word was insincere.

804
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,730
I said you have courage.

805
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,530
When Zhou Yanbang was in trouble,

806
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,650
the Qi family was more powerful
than the Zhou family.

807
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,170
Yet, you still held on
to your old sweetheart.

808
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,610
It shows you're not heartless.

809
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,020
But Zhou Yanbang is a scoundrel.

810
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,090
He's unworthy of you.

811
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,940
Jiang Ruoyao,
think about this carefully.

812
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,610
What kind of person you truly are?

813
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,780
No one really cares

814
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:21,340
what Jiang Ruoyao is truly like.

815
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,090
She tried everything for her daughter.

816
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
But she never considers

817
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,980
that she almost pushed her to the brink.

818
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,130
It's truly sad.

819
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,250
Second Lady, someone is here to see you.

820
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:02,900
Where's Jiang Li?

821
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,820
Greetings, Official Ye.

822
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,650
Second Lady has gone out
on some matters.

823
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,300
Some matters?

824
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,940
I came as soon as I heard

825
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,650
about the Marquis
of Ningyuan's incident.

826
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,090
Did Marchioness Ningyuan take her away?

827
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,300
The matter has been resolved.

828
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,090
Marchioness Ningyuan has handled it.

829
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,020
So why did Jiang Li go out?

830
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,050
No need to explain.

831
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,690
I think I know.

832
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,820
I remember the last time
you invited me to dinner

833
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,980
it was in Luyang for some buns.

834
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,050
This time, you're really generous.

835
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,420
That day, you beat Tong Zhiyang.

836
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,300
But you weren't happy.

837
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:00,650
How about now?

838
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,380
Can we have a drink to celebrate?

839
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,090
Do you think I won this time?

840
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,900
Winning or losing isn't important.

841
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,420
But you can't skip the meal.

842
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,170
Do you know

843
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,500
every move that I make?

844
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,650
A player always knows

845
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,940
where their pieces are.

846
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,860
Do we have a chance to switch roles?

847
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,570
I'd like to play the game.

848
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,130
I want to compete

849
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,250
with those people in Capital of Yan.

850
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,530
Using what pieces?

851
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,020
Me?

852
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,170
You can say that.

853
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:47,690
But I dare not.

854
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,530
But I do wonder

855
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,610
if a woman like me

856
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,090
could ever see a bigger world?

857
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:57,690
Enough talk.

858
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,050
I should thank you

859
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,500
for today's feast.

860
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,940
I am happy today.

861
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,650
But I must say,

862
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,780
I can't drink much.

863
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,690
Just this one cup.

864
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,690
If I offend you,

865
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,650
please don't send me away.

866
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,530
Well, I won't go that far.

867
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,900
By the way,

868
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,650
Situ Jiuyue is not in the capital.

869
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,380
It might take some time to find her.

870
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,730
I thank you on behalf of Magistrate Xue.

871
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,090
Are you already drunk with just one cup?

872
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:43,860
No, I'm just tired

873
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,420
after the commotion this morning.

874
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,530
I'd like to take a nap.

875
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:48,860
Then sleep.

876
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,820
Everywhere else is not comfortable.

877
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,500
But the place you picked

878
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,050
sure is not bad.

879
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,420
I'm glad you like it.

880
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,130
I have something for you.

881
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,860
What is it?

882
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,820
When you need help, blow this whistle.

883
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:32,940
My men will come to protect you.

884
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,050
Does that mean

885
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,730
you will always have

886
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,420
someone watching me?

887
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,050
You could see it that way.

888
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:44,170
Take it.

889
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,730
I just don't want my game
to end prematurely

890
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:54,610
because

891
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,340
someone else takes my piece.
