Ning Lian, Yu'er, hurry.

186
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,230
Coming!

187
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,680
Come, Magistrate Feng.

188
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,160
Get away from me.

189
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,680
We only want Cuizhu today.

190
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,510
These people have been here once.

191
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,110
My dear sister Cuizhu hosted them.

192
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,470
They paid handsomely,

193
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,400
but

194
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,920
according to Cuizhu,
as those three were drunk,

195
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,230
they just...

196
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,280
What are you doing?

197
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,230
What are you doing? Let me go.

198
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,960
Let go!

199
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,200
Cuizhu my girl, do you miss me?

200
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,160
Please don't, Magistrate Feng.

201
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,080
Let me go!

202
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,870
Please, Magistrate Feng.

203
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,040
Let me go!

204
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,440
Let me go!

205
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,560
Let me go!

206
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,040
Don't move.

207
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,160
I beg you,

208
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,200
let me go!

209
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,630
No!

210
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,080
Cuizhu.

211
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,590
Cuizhu!

212
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,440
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

213
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,230
It's me.

214
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,870
Cuizhu.

215
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,440
These animals.

216
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,200
I'll go and report this.

217
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,630
Don't.

218
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,440
Don't, Miss.

219
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,800
I still need this money
to treat my mother's illness.

220
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,990
Don't go.

221
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,140
Two days ago, those three came again.

222
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,500
Everyone didn't dare to host them.

223
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,310
The madam asked us to draw lots.

224
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,310
Just draw it. Think of it
as saving money for our family.

225
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,260
I'll go.

226
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,350
After Magistrate Xue
was put on death row,

227
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,190
he wasn't executed immediately.

228
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,430
The execution is six months later.

229
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,260
Now, it's almost time for his execution.

230
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,950
That is all I can get

231
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
from them.

232
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,780
It's all right.

233
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,110
My little, unworthy life

234
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,620
wouldn't be able to wait
till the day of justice.

235
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,230
Justice will come.

236
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,990
You have to wait

237
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,620
and see, with your own eyes,

238
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,780
what ending awaits those men.

239
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,070
Qiongzhi,

240
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,390
I will return to Huaixiang
to seek justice for you and

241
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,870
overturn the case for the Xue family.

242
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,100
I want to, with my own hands,

243
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,820
capture these lowly beasts,

244
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,540
peel their skin

245
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,740
and drink their blood.

246
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,300
I swear to you.

247
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,670
You just wait.

248
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,150
You must live on well.

249
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,100
The Xue family is fortunate
to have a friend like you.

250
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,340
Second Lady Jiang,

251
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,540
do you remember
the drawings in this box?

252
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,390
Xue Zhao is not an ignorant fool.

253
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,100
This drawing is not
some leisurely doodles.

254
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,340
It's just that I am not smart enough

255
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,430
to figure out what he left me.

Xue Zhao's last work.

258
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,470
I'll leave it to you

259
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,300
to solve it.

260
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,390
Wait, Qiongzhi.

261
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,780
I'll go get the physician.

262
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:25,910
Miss,

263
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,500
I know my condition well.

264
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,020
When I first arrived at Xihua Brothel,

265
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,870
I've sought death countless times
to no avail.

266
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,150
Now I know.

267
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,470
The heavenly skies kept me alive

268
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,100

Miss,

270
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,990
you must remember what you promised.

271
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,780
Seek justice

272
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,300

273
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,390

287
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,990
Chu Lan's rent is paid annually,

288
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,580
in gold.

289
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,630
Gold bars?

290
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,990
If so, investigations would be easier.

291
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,670
Not the imperial court-casted gold bars.

292
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,540
It's scrap gold.

293
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,950
Paid in grains of gold?

294
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,910
There seems to be a gold mine around.

295
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,500
That can't be. There were land disasters
two years ago in the south.

296
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,540
The imperial court
closed down all mines.

297

Luyang's mining ban
has yet to be lifted.

298

There can't be any gold mines around.

299

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,230
Private mines?

301
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,230
Oh, my heavenly skies.

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,500
To privately mine
the imperial gold mines

303
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,150
is as guilty as treason.

304
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,990
We still don't know
where the gold mine is.

and mines
that can be accessed immediately

308
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,470
are mostly open-pit sand gold mines.

Wait. Why are you all looking at me?

don't know how to comfort others.

00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,470
You have to stay here
in Ye's Residence.

369
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,780
Huaixiang...

370
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,580
I go on my own.

371
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,540
Don't you treat me like an outsider!

372
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,540
It's fine if it was anywhere else.

373
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,820
But Huaixiang...

374
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,740
worries me.

375
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,740
What do you mean?

376
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,390
The Ye family used to have
a store in Huaixiang.

377
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,990
After the magistrate's position
changed hands...

378
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,820
Tax inspection!

379
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Your store didn't pay anything
for occupancy tax last month.

380
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,020
Why,

381
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,150
does the Ye family wish to rebel

382
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,190
in the Huaixiang territory?

383
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,990
Sir,

384
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,540
our occupancy and passing tax

385
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,870
were all paid together.

386
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,710
Here,

387
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,580
we still have

388
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,910
the tax receipts that you gave to us.

389
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,950
Hold on, sir. I'll get it for you now.

390
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,820
How dare you forge tax receipts?

391
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,020
It seems like you would like us

392
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,990
to cuff you up today, huh?

393
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,580
Come, cuff him, and take him away.

394
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,540
Sir, sir!

395
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,190
I'll pay those taxes right now.

396
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,230
It was such a calm, peaceful region,

397
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,950
now it's all rotten and corrupted.

398
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,820
That was why our business

399
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,100
couldn't go on,

400
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,910
and we withdrew the business.

401
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,950
Now that you're going there,

402
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,150
no matter what, I must accompany you.

403
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,910
Jia'er shouldn't go either. I'll go.

404
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,780
Uncle, you're eavesdropping!

405
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,340
If I weren't eavesdropping,

406
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,500
I won't even know that you both,

407
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,870
one plans to go alone,

408

another is following to cause trouble.

409
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,990
Do not underestimate me, I'm going.

410
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,670
You better just stay at home.

411
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Although I couldn't get into
the escort agency,

412
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,630
my escort's skills are still sound.

413
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,390
I can protect Li, no problem,

414
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,910
but if you're coming too
for the adventure,

415
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,150
when something happens,

416
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,580
who should I save?

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,430
you should stay at Ye's Residence.

421
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,870
how to tell Second Uncle and Second Aunt

422
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,430
about this properly.

Let me first say thank you then.

429
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,820
We found it, Master Su.

430
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,190
Sure enough, it's a sand gold mine.

431
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,470
I walked down the Dong Mountain waterway

432
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,710
and saw it
within three miles of walking.

433
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,870
Is it not secluded at all?

434
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,710
Not really.

435
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,540
They are working in the name
of mining sand and earth.

436
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,580
During the day, it seemed
to be just digging sand.

437
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,780
The workstations are cleverly designed.

438
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,580
It was scattered along the river.

439
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,950
The very first station

440
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,990
is right next
to the sealed imperial gold mine.

441
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:30,990
Guess what?

442
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,230
The mine is open.

443
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,710
So they are not just digging
for sand gold,

444
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,260
they are also mining
the imperial gold mines.

445
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,910
That's impossible.

446
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,430
Never mind the open-pit mining
of placer gold, to open up new mines...

447
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,630
Do they have that many laborers?

448
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,630
Where is the imperial gold mine?

449
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,990
In Huaixiang.

450
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,780

451
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:49,910
Are you surprised?

452
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,190
The Xue Huaiyuan
who was jailed for being greedy,

453
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,710
he used to be the county's magistrate.

454
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,580
What a coincidence.

455
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,710
When was the sand mine built?

456
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,990
About half a year ago.

457
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,020
Six months ago, Xue Huaiyuan
was imprisoned.

458
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,910
The sand mine was built.

459
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,710
You are saying this
has to do with the Xue family?

460
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,780
They can mine
for placer gold themselves.

461
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,150
But anyone who wants to mine
the sealed imperial gold mine

462
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,430
in the territorial borders of Huaixiang,

463
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,300
no matter how deep
the capital's connections are,

464
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,020
it wouldn't be able to reach the yamen.

465
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,020
What's so difficult about that?

466
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,990
If you can't reach it, just buy it over.

467
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,630
That lowly Governor from Luyang

468

469

What you mean is...

472
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,390
Li Zhongnan was embezzling
from the imperial gold mine

473
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,630
and framed Xue Huaiyuan for it.

474
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,910
Looks like the deaths
of Xue Fangfei and Xue Zhao

475
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,950
is not solely caused
by offending Wanning.

476
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,670
They were afraid that Xue Huaiyuan

477
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,340
told this to his children,

478
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,990
