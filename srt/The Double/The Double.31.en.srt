to make him come
to Jiang's Residence to see me.

That's it?

191
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,110
Yes.

192
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,960
So

193
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
you're asking me to act as myself?

194
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,680
Don't think that Mr. Shen

195
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,870
will come to Jiang's Residence
just because you want him to.

196
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,990
Oh, Jiang Li.

197
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,400
I have to admire your insight.

198
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,510
If you ask Liu Xu or Ye Shijie for help,

199
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,350
they will surely fail to do it.

200
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,920
But you found me

201
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,350
as if fate

202
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,830
has opened up a new path for you.

203
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,080
Well, it seems like fate
has been kind to you as well.

204
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,040
How dare you say that? Aren't you afraid
of getting struck by lightning?

205
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,470
But I've thought it over.

206
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,510
Why does someone like Duke Su

207
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,510
love watching you act?

208
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,230
You have an idea to head east

209
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,080
but tell everyone you're heading west.

210
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,870
Even though your stories
are poorly written,

211
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,990
they somehow make people want
to keep watching.

212
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,750
I want to know what your idea

213
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,440
of heading east is.

214
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,040
This is what they call

215
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,560
suspense.

216
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,400

but don't point it out.

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,220

It is a crucial time now.

226
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,730
Everyone needs to stay on high alert.

227
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,650
Don't slack off.

please let me know in advance.

230
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,220
Yes.

231
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,980
Is anyone absent today?

232
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,340

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,730
He has gone to the palace

Everyone has been arriving early
and leaving late recently

236

without taking any leave.

237
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,420
Such dedication and effort

238
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,530
deserve praise.

239
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,650
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

you are close to Liu Xu and Jiang Li.

245
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,580
Do you know about her quitting?

246
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,610
Yes.

What happened?

248
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,490
Should we talk in private?

249
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,420
It's because

250
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,420
of the collaborative performance
with the Hanlin scholars.

251
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,890
No one wanted to perform with her,

252
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,700
so she fell ill.

253
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,220
That's debatable.

254
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,490
Did she fall ill because of this?

255
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,220
Do you know what people
are saying about Jiang Li?

256
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,700
They say

257
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,100
she has a face
just like your deceased wife's,

258
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,060
so she's trying hard
to get close to you.

259
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,580
To avoid arousing suspicion,

260
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,940
Mr. Shen is avoiding her.

261
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,890
Who said that?

262
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,940
Nonsense!

263
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,650
Mr. Shen, your reputation
is well-established,

264
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,370
so you're not afraid.

265
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,580
However, for a young lady

266
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,460
who is not yet married,

267
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,890
such rumors can be as sharp as a knife.

268
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,980
If I were Jiang Li,

269
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,370
I would rather just die
and be done with it.

270
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,460
As her sibling and friend,

271
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,980
you should advise her

272
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,340
to not pay attention
to these filthy gossips.

273
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,890
You overestimated me.

274
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,820
I wouldn't know how to advise a lady.

275
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,610
I'm at a loss too.

276
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,340
Otherwise, I wouldn't be anxious.

00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,250
If the reception
of the delegation is delayed,

278
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,340
the blame will fall on the Jiang family.

279
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,730
What should we do?

281
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,340
Aunt is senile,

282
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,650
and Grandmother is elderly.

283
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,700
No one in our family can persuade her.

284
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,300
But

I often hear Jiang Li speak highly
of you, Mr. Shen.

286
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,340
Perhaps you could help persuade her?

287

about the rumors.

I will investigate and
find out who started them.

It's just that the Grand Zhao delegation
is about to arrive,

310

is very important to His Majesty.

be influenced by rumors.

where the rumors originated from?

to endorse my name card,

The best way to dispel rumors

332
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,220
is to confront them directly.

333

would be the best proof.

a clear conscience.

342

I suppose it must be hatred.

373
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,250
Yuan Jiang, the Commissioner
of the Capital Security Office

374
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,050
took considerable effort

375
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:33,900
to win over.

376
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,010
Don't mess things up for me.

377
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,570
Don't worry, Father.

378
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,180
Yuan Jiang has only
recently pledged allegiance.

379
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,900
This situation is precisely
the opportunity

380
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,620
for me to test their loyalty to you.

381
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:45,940
Jin,

382
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,330
be extra careful.

383
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,010
Yes.

384
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,860
Are you fine?

385
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,460
Your eyes are affectionate
when you look at him.

386
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,460
He isn't the person I love.

387
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,180
I don't do romance.

388
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,730
It's up to you
whether you want to save me or not.

389
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,050
Two liars.

390
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,290
Two liars?

391
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,530
What does that mean?

392
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,700
Ignore her.

393
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,980
What are you holding?

394
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,090
This is chrysanthemum tea
I brewed myself.

395
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,010
It clears heat.

396
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,530
Wen Ji.

397
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,010
[Return of the Clouds]

398
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,180
Brew some and deliver it to Jiuyue.

399
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,010
This isn't about decreasing her anger.

400
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,330
It's a jealousy issue, right?

401
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,980
Go find Lu Ji.

402
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,330
20 strokes of the cane, right?

403
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,980
Even 200 strokes
won't alleviate this jealousy!

404
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,010
Have those who attempted
to assassinate Jiuyue been caught?

405
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,090
We're on it.

406
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,530
What about you?

407
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,900
Is the plan progressing smoothly?

408
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,050
It's almost time to pull in the net.

409
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,180
I heard you're going
to play the guqin for Shen Yurong.

410
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,860
Duke Su, I thought
you didn't like to ask around.

411
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,250
Why monitor my every step
so closely then?

412
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,010
I don't even need to ask around.

413
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,570
Once I hear of it,

414
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,010
it feels unsettling.

415
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,250
Then next time
I'll bring some orange peels.

416
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,460
What does that mean?

417
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,660
To alleviate jealousy.

418
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,180
You're actually planning

419
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,620
to perform together with Jiang Li?

420
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,140
What are you thinking?

421
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,090
Are you out of your mind?

422
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,010
What if Eldest Princess finds out?

423
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,980
Do you want our family to die?

424
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,940
Keeping the most dangerous person
close is the safest.

425
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,420
Son,

426
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,940
are you still in love with Xue Fangfei?

427
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,460
Don't forget

428
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,290
that Jiang Li and Xue Fangfei
are enemies

429
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,660
of Eldest Princess.

430
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,090
If you don't distance yourself

431
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,220
and instead actively involve yourself,

432
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,220
how do you think
Eldest Princess will perceive it?

433
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,570
Mother, don't worry.

434
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,490
I know what I'm doing.

437
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,290
Are they really rehearsing together?

438
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,770
These few days,

439
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,570
they have been rehearsing together
at Hanlin Academy.

440
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,090
Do you want Mr. Shen to come over?

441
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,380
No need.

442
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,180
Some words are better left unsaid.

443
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,290
He needs to see it with his own eyes

444
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,140
to understand what he should not do.

[Honor the Way]

447
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,290
Who is he?

448
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,570
A servant of the Jiang family.

449
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,770
Luckily he's around.

450
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,850
I thought you'd be curious

451
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,180
about who wanted to kill me first.

452
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,610
The authorities
will investigate thoroughly.

453
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,180
He didn't stab hard,

454
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,420
and the injury isn't severe.

455
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,330
Come with me.

456
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,130
The Hanlin Academy was invaded.

457
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,660
I'll send someone to escort you back.

458
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,500
[Jiang's Residence]

459
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,460
That person has exceptional qinggong.

460
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,900
I followed for several streets

461
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,700
but still got left behind.

462
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,530
Do you think the assassin today

463
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,900
was sent by Shen Yurong?

464
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,850
It seems the assassin

465
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,090
aimed to strike Shen Yurong
with a vicious blow.

466
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,530
Had they not restrained
their force in time,

467
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,010
it might have been fatal,

468
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,660
piercing through his chest.

469
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,420
So it was

470
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,380
Wanning's men.

471
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,980
What a pity.

472
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,570
That would be a great piece of evidence.

473
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,180
So, this was your plan all along.

474
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,140
You...

475
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,380
Did you fly here?

476
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,570
What else?

477
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,900
Initially, you said you were
getting close to Shen Yurong

478
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,660
to get something on him.

479
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,250
It looks like

480
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,460
that's not all you want.

481
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,980
You want to provoke Wanning.

482
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,010
Shen Yurong's leverage is Wanning.

483
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,570
I told you not to get yourself
involved in this scheme.

484
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,380
Did you not remember a single word?

485
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,620
Zhao Ke is secretly protecting me.

486
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,250
I

487
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,220
trust the man Duke Su sent

488
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,730
will protect me.

489
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,290
Don't flatter me.

490
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,770
If Zhao Ke couldn't stop

491
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,770
the assassin today,

492
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,940
if you...

493
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,660
What will you do?

494
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,180
While getting involved directly
may not be the best strategy,

495
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,660
given the current circumstances,

496
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,380
I have no choice but
to proceed this way.

497
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,570
I just didn't expect

498
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,570
Wanning would directly
send someone to kill me.

499
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,490
She ended up taking this step
because of this man.

500
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,460
Don't bring up anything else.

501
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,050
I don't care about Wanning.

502
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,220
I know.

503
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,770
You care about me.

504
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,460
Rest assured,

505
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,250
getting involved directly

506
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,770
will bring success this time.

507
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,010
I promise I won't do it again
in the future.

508
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,180
You're eloquent.

509
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,980
Then decline the joint performance
with Shen Yurong tomorrow.

510
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,490
Shen Yurong took a knife for me today.

511
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,180
Was he acting?

512
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,860
It was true.

513
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,530
So?

514
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,380
So I'm thinking

515
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,570
maybe I can take a different approach.

516
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,380
Is this approach still going
to involve you personally?

517
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,570
Not this time.

518
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,330

519
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,530
please trust me

520
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,900

523
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,420
you've grown up.

524
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,050
Not only you took the knife for her,

525
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,330
but after recognizing my man,

526
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,420
you dared to protect her.

527
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,810
Your Highness, if you kill someone
at the entrance of the Hanlin Academy,

528
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,290
tomorrow I,
as the person in charge of editing,

529
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,620
will be taken away for questioning.

530
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,090
Looks like

531
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,860
it's my fault after all.

532
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,570
I just want to remind you

533
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,220
that if you want
to kill her in the future,

534
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,460
don't involve me.

535
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,180
Why are you playing dumb?

536
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,380
Xiao Heng is by her side.

537
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,380
As I miss this chance to end her once
and for all, there won't be another.

538
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,530
In fact,

539
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,770
you were the one who made me angry.

540
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,810
Why didn't you inform me

541
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,090
before agreeing
to perform a song with her?

542
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,860
No one in Hanlin Academy wants
to perform with her.

543
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,460
This is a task entrusted to me
by His Majesty.

544
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,050
If I don't handle it well,

545
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,860
I will definitely be punished.

546
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,330
With me around,

547
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,940
who dares to punish you?

548
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,180
This matter concerns state affairs.

549
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,530
I don't want
to be someone who relies on you.

550
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,700
You wouldn't value me either.

551
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,290
Besides,

552
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,180
I have forgotten all past grievances

553
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,460
and have a clear conscience.

554
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,460
That's why I dare
to perform with Jiang Li.

555
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,420
Avoidance is a sign
of a guilty conscience.

556
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,250
You have a way with words,

557
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,530
but you better speak the truth,

558
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,290
or you know what I'm capable of.

559
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,770
I dare not lie to you, Your Highness.

560
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,530
In that case,

561
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,660
focus on your state affairs.

562
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,460
Let me see your clear conscience.

563
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,490
After my house arrest ends,

564
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,250
I will go meet her properly.

565
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,980
[Honor the Way]
A few days ago, the Hanlin Academy

566
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,660
was raided by thieves.
They were fugitives.

567
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,180
Everyone should be cautious.

568
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,250
Tomorrow is the day
the Grand Zhao delegation

569
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,290
enters the capital.

570
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,460
It's a critical time,
so everyone must not slack off.

571
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,770
Give your full effort.

572
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,900
Once everything goes smoothly,

573
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,180
not only will everyone
receive rewards from His Majesty,

574
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,460
but I'll also host a banquet
at home to treat everyone

575
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,770
and comfort you all for your hard work.

576
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,730
[Honor the Way]
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

577
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,900
Prepare yourselves accordingly.

578
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,290
We're going to be busy these few days.

579
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,290
Yes, let's go.

580
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:35,980
With you.

581
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,010
Jiang Li, when everything ends,

582
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,250
let's drink.

583
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,490
Yes, we haven't gathered in ages.

584
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,220
Sure.

585
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,220
We'll take our leave now.

586
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,380
There are still many things to do.

587
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,460
Go.

588
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,770
- Let's go.
- Okay.

589
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,730
Jiang Li.

590
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,770
Jiang Li.

591
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,290
Let me tell you,

592
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,220
these days have passed so quickly.

593
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,490
I haven't had enough yet.

594
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,940
Why? You've become addicted
to receiving gifts?

595
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,940
She loved the things you sent.

596
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,900
Lately, she's been smiling
at me a lot more.

597
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,330
But honestly,

598
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,370
as long as I receive
the rewards accordingly,

599
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,130
I can continue to help you.

600
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:13,900
Okay.

601
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,180
Jiang Li.

602
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,260
I'll take my leave now.

603
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,020
Okay.

604
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,420
Shijie.

605
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,700
I heard it was because no one

606
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,020
at the Hanlin Academy
wanted to perform with you,

607
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,940
so you had to perform with Mr. Shen.

608
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,220
But there seemed to be no conflict

609
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,420
between you and Zhao Qi.

610
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,050
Mr. Shen's talent is unmatched
in the Hanlin Academy.

611
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,330
Performing with him
is naturally the best.

612
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,610
I'm going to rehearse now.

613
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,420
Your Majesty,

614
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,420
the Ministry of Rites

615
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,260
has already prepared everything
for welcoming

616
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,180
the Grand Zhao delegation.

617
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,850
Today, Secretary of Court for Dependencies
will personally greet the delegation to enter the city.

618
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,570
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]

619
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,500
They will stay
at the official guesthouse.

620
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,660
After resting and settling in, they will
enter the palace for a banquet.

621
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,900
Thank you, Official Shen.

622
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,500
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]

623
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,610
Have you arrested Chu Lan?

624
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,530
We have basically narrowed it down
to the Capital Security Office.

625
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,530
Capital Security Office?

626
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,420
Have they also sided with Li Zhongnan?

627
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,530
What about the Grand Zhao princess?

628
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,770
She is now recuperating in my residence.

629
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,050
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]
We'll suffer a drawback if this goes on.

630
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,770
That's what I'm worried about too.

631
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,260
The alliance is approaching,

632
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,090
and Jiuyue has suffered a blow.

633
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,770
With the assassin still at large,

634
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,330
Grand Zhao is bound
to question our sincerity.

635
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,370
If Lord Cheng, rises in rebellion
someday, it will add another variable.

636
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,700
Let's use this opportunity to take down
the Capital Security Office.

637
00:31:59,220 --> 00:31:59,980
How can I allow

638
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,770
my city gates
to be controlled by Lord Cheng?

639
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,180
My secret guards alone

640
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,090
cannot take down
the Capital Security Office.

641
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:05,980
What do you want?

642
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,330
I want the Longwu Army.

643
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,290
Longwu Army?

644
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,090
After training in secret for so long,

645
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,740
are you going to expose them now?

646
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,810
Since they have already
set up the stage,

647
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,330
why don't we put on a good show

648
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,090
as a deliberate act to warn them?

649
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,770
Remember,

650
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,260
city defense is crucial
for the stability of our capital.

651
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,180
Please always remember
your mission. Do you understand?

652
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,130
I'll complete the mission successfully.

653
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,090
Good.

654
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,370
Grand Chancellor Li.

655
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,850
How did Duke Su find the time
to come to the Capital Security Office?

656
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,940
I receive intelligence

657
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,660
there is an assassin
from the northern border hiding here.

658
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,770
Duke Su, do you have evidence?

659
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,770
Grand Chancellor Li, my specialty
lies in intelligence gathering.

660
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,980
The evidence is within
the Capital Security Office.

661
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,700
[Yuan Jiang]
We'll find out after I investigate.

662
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,130
Come!

663
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,940
Duke Su, the Capital Security Office
is not an easy target.

664
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,700
Your display of power elsewhere

665
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,020
might not work as effectively here.

666
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,900
By order of the emperor,
Longwu Army is conducting a search

667
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,290
of the Capital Security Office.
General Yuan, please open the gates.

668
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,740
If it is an imperial order,
where is the decree?

669
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,290
General Yuan, you seem to be confused.

670
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,980
The Longwu Army has the privilege
to act first and report later.

671
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,090
Xiao Heng, the Capital Security
Office's guards protect the capital.

672
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:44,900
This isn't someplace else.

673
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,130
Please bring the decree
with you, Duke Su.

674
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,290
Search the place.

675
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,810
Kill anyone who dares to stop you.

676
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,500
Search the place!

677
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,290
Yes!

678
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,530
Grand Chancellor Li, you should
stay away. Weapons have no eyes.

679
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,900
They might accidentally

680
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,500
kill you first and report later.

681
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,130
Duke Su, have you considered
the consequences?

682
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,020
When the flood arrives,

683
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,460
don't let the mice escape.

684
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,130
Yes.

685
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,130
How dare you return?

686
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,300
This time, you can't escape.
I brought my lackeys along.

687
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,570
They are harsh and specialize
in dealing with defeated enemies.

688
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:55,780
Go!

689
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,690
Lord Cheng's subordinate escaped again.

690
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,530
The relationship between
Chu Lan and Lord Cheng

691
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,020
is akin to yours with me.

692
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,300
It isn't easy to catch him.

693
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,610
We can take this opportunity

694
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,980
to replace everyone
in the Capital Security Office.

695
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,090
I didn't hold back yesterday.

696
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,820
Quite a number of people have
to recuperate at home.

697
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,900
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]

698
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,610
Because of this incident,
many officials have accused you.

699
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,300
Yuan Jiang privately harbored a fugitive

700
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,570
and even allowed his subordinates
to release Chu Lan.

701
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,500
This accusation alone
is enough to silence them.

702
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,090
He's quite clever. He found
a subordinate to take the blame

703
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,610
and resigned from his post in disgrace.

704
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,610
Do you need me to interrogate him?

705
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:55,940
With foreign envoys in the capital,

706
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,940
now is not the time for us
to handle internal cases.

707
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,420
Reclaiming control
of the Capital Security Office

708
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,570
has already neutralized
one of Lord Cheng's moves.

709
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,900
We'll settle the scores with Yuan Jiang
and Li Zhongnan in due time.

710
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:15,820
Father.

711
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,650
Who leaked the news about Chu Lan

712
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,900
being in the Capital Security Office?

713
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,250
I'm not sure.

714
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,020
The Capital Security Office
is heavily guarded.

715
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,300
Besides them,

716
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,820
only the three of us knew about this.

717
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,820
Chu Lan couldn't have
leaked it himself, could he?

718
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,530
Father.

719
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,460
If it wasn't him,
then it must be one of us.

720
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,250
It's either me or you.

721
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,610
Father.

722
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,380
It's Xiao Heng.

723
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,250
I find it hard to swallow the fact

724
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,980
that Xiao Heng repeatedly sabotaged
our major plans before.

725
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,860
Those in the Capital Security Office
are not to be underestimated.

726
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,380
How many secret guards
could Xiao Heng possibly have?

727
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,420
He wouldn't be Yuan Jiang's match,

728
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,570
which was why I used Chu Lan as bait

729
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,610
to lure him over.

730
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,610
It also gave me a chance

731
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,650
to test the loyalty
of the Capital Security Office.

732
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,170
But I never expected

733
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,300
Xiao Heng would bring the Longwu Army.

734
