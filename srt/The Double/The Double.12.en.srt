Put it here.

18
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,760
You just put it over there.

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,430
The tall one. Yes.

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,710
Be careful. That pot of flowers is rare.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,590
You come here and put it over there.

22
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,950
Father, I won.

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,560
I didn't expect you to improve so much

24
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,590
under Li's tutelage.

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,590
What do you mean
by "under her tutelage"?

26
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,200
I'm the one who's talented.

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,310
You're right.

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,790

You've sent me so many pots of flowers.

Yeah, they're in full bloom.

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,710

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,400
I'm glad you've helped

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,120
I never ever dreamed

that this no-good brat would be able
to receive an honor at the palace.

My dear niece,

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,750
I really don't know how to thank you.

47
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes, Li.

48
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,800
It's all thanks to you.

We're family.

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,080
Don't say that.

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,310
Do you three

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,150
have to be so hypocritical?

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,150
- Jiang Jingrui!
- Jiang Jingrui!

54
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,870
What?

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,080
Let me beat you up. I...

56
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,470
My dear!

00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,680

What's wrong with you, my dear?

59
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
- My back.
- What's wrong with your old back?

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,470
It's your back that's old.

61
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,960
My dear, come here.
I'll give you a massage.

62
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,870
Don't touch me.

Quick.

Let me see where it hurts.

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,520
- Where is it?
- Down there.

70
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,310
What's the matter?

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,800
I've heard

72
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,470
that Zhou Yanbang wants to ask
you to change the engagement.

73
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,080
Zhou Yanbang

74
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,870
has been spoiled since he was a child

75
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
and has no qualms about doing

76
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,190
whatever he wants.

77
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,590
Don't bother.

78
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,630
Marquis of Ningyuan has
put him in confinement.

79
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,680
For days, the family
has been going around

80
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,150
trying to squash the case.

81
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,000
Is that so?

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,190
But that's karmic justice.

83
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,240
It's all because Aunt Shuran
was in a hurry to replace you

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,120
with Jiang Ruoyao just a few days

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,310
after you went to Zhennyu Hall.

86
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,840
It hurts!

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,360
In broad daylight,
you're being lovey-dovey

88
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,710
and showing affection for each other.
It's not acceptable!

89
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,310
- Yuanbai, what brings you here?
- Yuanbai, what brings you here?

90
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,600
I'd like to ask you

91
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,480
why being so inappropriate to flirt
with each other in broad daylight,

92
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,870
in my residence.

93
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,920
Yuanbai, I've sprained my back.

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,040
Yuanping would like to help me.

95
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,390
She's sprained her old back.

96
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,510
You're...

97
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,750
Yuanbai.

98
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,510
Yuanbai.

99
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,950
What's wrong with you?

100
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,360
Last night, I overworked my old back.

101
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,830
Yuanbai.

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,560
Give me a massage.

103
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,920
Go.

104
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,600
Yuanbai, let me give you a massage.

105
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,040
Jingrui got the first place
in the Entry Exam

106
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,630
thanks to Li's tutelage.

107
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,750
We're here to thank her.

108
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,750
Do you want to kill me with your hands?

109
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,870
Be gentler.

110
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,630
Go home and massage
your wife's old back.

111
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,430
My dear.

112
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,070
Let's go home
and I'll massage your old back.

113
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,360
Rui!

114
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,360
Coming.

115
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,630
I'm going back now.

116
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,750
Come on, my dear. Be careful.

117
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,480
Come on.

118
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,870
Mother, be careful.

119
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,830
Look.

120
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,120
Jingrui, let's carry her.

121
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Your mother weighs
almost as much as a sow.

122
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,680
What a shame.

123
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,240
Father.

124
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,630
Slow down.

125
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,310
I've been busy with my work
for the past few days,

126
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,240
and I only heard

127
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
about you getting the first place
in the Entry Exam from His Majesty.

128
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,950
I haven't even held a banquet
to celebrate for you.

129
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,000
Thinking of your studies
at the School of Integrity.

130
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,920
I've been negligent.

131
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,800
Father, you don't have to
blame yourself.

132
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,120
I'm used to it after 10 years
in Zhennyu Hall.

133
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,240
I don't think I should disturb you

134
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
with my life at the School of Integrity.

135
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,680
I was worried that you wouldn't be able
to cope with your studies

136
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,920
at the School of Integrity,

137
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,630
so I thought I'd be adding
to your worries by asking too much.

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,310
I didn't expect you
to be not only good at calligraphy,

139
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,390
but also at playing the zither.

140
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,390
I'm so glad.

141
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,800
There's a sister at Zhennyu Hall
who's a zither player.

142
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,070
I had been learning from her.

143
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,040
Before she left, she left me
her zither and music sheet

144
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,600
so I could practice more.

145
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,240
I was scolded by the lady-in-charge
for missing a few cleanings

146
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,160
because I was practicing the zither.

147
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
You've suffered.

148
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,270
There's nothing to hide
between a father and a daughter.

149
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,070
I have no secrets.

150
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,040
If you have any questions, just say so.

151
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
I know

152
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,240
you were engaged to Zhou Yanbang

153
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,870
but it was changed to Ruoyao

154
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,680
and I never asked you
about your thoughts.

155
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,270
Father, you're worrying too much.

156
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,680
I've never liked Zhou Yanbang,

157
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,160
not before, not now,

158
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,190
not in the future.

159
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,870
If he comes to you
to change the engagement...

160
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,950
As you said,

161
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,510
it was him who proposed it,
I didn't initiate it,

162
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,310
and I've already refused.

163
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,600
You bring it up now
because you don't believe me?

164
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,630
No.

165
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,160
Fine, let's not talk about it.

166
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,190
I'll throw you

167
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,680
a celebration banquet some day.

168
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,270
You should be rewarded
for making the Jiangs proud.

169
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,430
Thank you, Father.

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,510
All right, I'm leaving.

171
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,190
Miss.

172
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,560
Look.

173
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,120
I can only rely on myself.

174
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,950
If I hadn't made a name for myself

175
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,720
in this Entry Exam,

176
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,000
it would have been my fault

177
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,950
if I hadn't been able to explain this.

178
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,840
You got the first place this time,

179
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,720
His Majesty personally honored you,

180
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,240
and you've made a reputation
for yourself in the capital of Yan.

181
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,390
It'll be easier for you to
get things done in the future.

182
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,030
My Lady will be happy

183
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,870
in heaven.

184
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Considering the possible dangers when
you're safe and being prepared for them.

185
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,630
It's not the time to rest easy.

186
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,670
I'm afraid the real danger lies ahead.

187
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,480
Idiot!

188
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,600
Father,

189
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,550
I was just saying
that I wanted to become a monk.

190
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,200
They didn't take it seriously.
Why did you take it seriously?

191
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,170
Besides, if I really become a monk,

192
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,740
our family will be dishonored.

193
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,500
Honor?

194
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,860
So now you're thinking
about our family's honor?

195
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,100
I've been in the court all these years,
what have I been relying on?

196
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,410
Acting on my words.

197
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,460
You've made a mess of things,

198
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,170
so you'll have to swallow
the consequences today.

199
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,050
Anyway, Father,

200
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,020
you can't really let me
become a monk, can you?

201
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,100
Why not?

202
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,050
Jiang Li was trapped
in Zhennyu Hall for ten years

203
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,690
and still managed
to get the first place.

204
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,050
Look at yourself.

205
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,100
I've been hiring teachers
for you for over ten years

206
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,050
and what do I get?

207
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,530
You've accomplished nothing.

208
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,690
Yes, Father. I know I'm wrong.

209
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,500
I'll study twice as hard

210
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,050
and never be left behind.

211
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,020
It's too late now.

212
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,380
Now that everyone in the capital

213
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,770
knows about your bet,

214
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,740
I can't defend you anymore.

215
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,340
You stay well in the temple.

216
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,380
If you do well, when the fuss dies down,

217
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,050
I might have a chance to get you out

218
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,690
and change your cocky ways.

219
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,620
Take him away.

220
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,050
Father! Father!

221
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,020
Wait.

222
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,980
Father! Jing, Jing!

223
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,260
Plead for me.

224
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,620
Jing, plead for me.

225
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,290
Jing! Father!

226
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,860
I don't want to be a monk, Father.

227
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,980
I haven't got married yet.

228
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,650
I haven't given you
a grandson yet, Father.

229
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
Don't let me become a monk, Father.

230
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,140
What are you laughing about?

231
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,810
I just feel pity that my second brother

232
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,410
can't understand your intention.

233
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,140
You're just doing it
to show Princess Wanning.

234
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,460
For the sake of the ambition
of Princess Wanning

235
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,170
and King Cheng,

236
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,260
our family has sacrificed a son.

237
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,170
If success comes in the future,

238
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,770
our family will still be
the most meritorious one.

239
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,770
When did you realize this?

240
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,980
A son of a distinguished family

241
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,020
betting with a girl in the street

242
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,340
is so absurd and ridiculous,

243
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,980
but you didn't stop it.

244
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,980
From that moment on, I thought

245
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,460
you must have had another reason.

246
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,690
Tell me,

247
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,980
what would you have done if it were you?

248
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,020
Why are we going round in circles

249
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,930
on Ye Shijie's case?

250
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,650
If we go

251
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,050
straight to Luyang

252
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,410
to solve the roots of the problem,

253
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,740
the Ye family

254
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,220
will soon come under your control.

255
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,380
Don't give me any more trouble.

256
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,770
How come you can't
even handle a little girl?

257
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,140
I thought the Li brothers
could deal with her,

258
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,020
but I didn't expect Zhou Yanbang
to be charmed by her.

259
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,770
If she wins

260
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,260
Jiang Yuanbai's heart,

261
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,930
it'll be too late.

262
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,740
A wild girl who spent 10 years
in Qingcheng Mountain,

263
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,290
fooled you as soon as she came back
to the Jiang family.

264
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,810
Now, she's out of the Jiang family
and got the first place in the Entry Exam,

265
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,220
she's turning the School of Integrity
upside down.

266
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,530
As the stepmother who raised her,

267
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,140
don't you think it's strange?

268
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,260
I know what you're trying to say is

269
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
that she's not even Jiang Li.

270
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,770
I'm not that stupid.

271
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,220
I've looked into the person

272
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,340
who wants to kill Jiang Li the most.

273
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,930
You're the head of Zhennyu Hall
in Qingcheng Mountain?

274
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,770
Do you want to be released?

275
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,570
Who are you?

276
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,380
I've been sent
by Secretariat Director's wife.

277
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,530
What does she want with me?

278
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,020
I have a question for you.

279
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,810
If you give me a satisfactory answer,

280
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,650
my lady will get you out.

281
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,860
What's the question?

282
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,050
Look who it is.

283
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,340
Isn't this your second lady?

284
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,570
Look carefully.

285
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,860
She's been with me for 10 years.

286
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,860
I'd recognize her even if she was ashes.

287
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,810
When Liu Yuanfeng disclosed the scandal

288
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,650
of Zhennyu Hall in front of His Majesty,

289
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,290
the witness for him was Jiang Li.

290
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,050
The head of Zhennyu Hall
hates her to the core.

291
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,340
If her identity was false,

292
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,170
the head of Zhennyu Hall
wouldn't have helped her hide it.

293
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,260
It's clear that she's Jiang Li,

294
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,810
but she's just very cunning

295
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,290
and hides herself well before everyone.

296
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,980
In that case, she can't be kept.

297
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,340
What else can I do?

298
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,140
Do you remember the Shen family's case?

299
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,220
You mean Xue?

300
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,770
Xue was caught in adultery
and fled to the mountains

301
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,100
and ended up dead in the end.

302
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,740
A woman's greatest fear
is to lose her virginity.

303
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,620
They're being summoned
to the palace in a few days, aren't they?

304
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,220
If she

305
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,340
lost her virginity in the palace,

306
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,340
it would be difficult

307
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,460
for even Grand Chancellor Jiang
to cover up in front of His Majesty.

308
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,100
Now, Grand Chancellor Jiang favors her,

309
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,690
but you don't have to be annoyed.

310
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,500
Raise her reputation first,

311
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,860
and she will naturally fall badly.

312
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,260
This is the palace.

313
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,220
I'm afraid it'll be hard to clean up
if things get out of hand.

314
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,410
What do you take me for?

315
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,930
I won't harm your husband.

316
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,570
With me in the palace,
you can rest assured.

317
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,220
[Jiang's Residence]

318
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,890
Greetings, Grandmother.

319
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,890
His Majesty is granting us
a banquet at the palace,

320
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,860
as you got the first place
in the Entry Exam,

321
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,980
we should dress decently,

322
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,930
especially you.

323
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,740
It's your first time
entering the palace,

324
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,260
so you should dress up carefully.

325
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,050
I've found

326
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,100
some of the most famous shops
in the capital

327
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,620
for you to choose from.

328
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,690
Grandmother,

329
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,460
I'm entering the palace
to be rewarded in the name of

330
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,570
the Jiang family.

331
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,020
You can decide what you want me to wear.

332
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,020
You're

333
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,690
passing the buck to me, huh?

334
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,570
Fine, I'll decide it for you.

335
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,460
You are the first place candidate,

336
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,890
you should dress
with elegance and dignity.

337
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,140
The color of this silk material elegant,

338
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,460
with a soft texture.

339
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,980
If it's made into a dress,

340
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,260
it'll suit your temperament.

341
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,020
What do you think?

342
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,770
I like it.

343
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,570
Thank you, Grandmother.

344
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,380
Madam Zhang, show them the way out.

345
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,410
Yes.

346
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,980
You grew up in a maiden's hall,

347
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,100
but your bearing follows your mother's.

348
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,340
You just look like a noblewoman.

349
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,340
Thanks for the compliment, Grandmother.

350
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,290
Everyone praises you outside.

351
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,340
How can we be stingy
with compliments at home?

352
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,530
I'm so happy to be able to see you

353
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,380
as you are today.

354
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,290
After ten years of separation,

355
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,140
I didn't expect you to develop

356
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,100
such a good character and skill.

357
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,890
I dare not let my father and you down.

358
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,260
Good, you're a good child
of the Jiang family.

359
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,260
I have a few more words
of advice for you.

360
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,170
If you're the Jiang family's child,

361
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,340
you'll share in the family's
prosperity and loss.

362
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,140
The palace is not like home.

363
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,980
Be careful in everything.
Take care of yourself

364
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,570
and your sisters.

365
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,130
The world is full of deceitful people.

366
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,770
If anything happens,

367
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,180
don't keep it to yourself.

368
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,330
Come back and tell me.

369
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,260
Okay, I know what to do.

370
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,050
What are you doing?

371
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,940
Mother, I'm not going
to the palace banquet.

372
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,850
The banquet's hosted by His Majesty.

373
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,460
You can't just say you won't go.

374
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,260
His Majesty wants
to see the top performer.

375
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,850
I'm just a sidekick.

376
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,290
It doesn't matter whether I go or not.

377
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,020
Ruoyao,

378
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,740
you just lost this year's Entry Exam.

379
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,850
What's the big deal?

380
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,940
I've been practicing the zither

381
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,460
day in and day out for years,

382
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,810
but what's the point?

383
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,740
In the end,

384
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,850
I was outshone by that wild girl

385
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,660
from the mountains.

386
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,770
Either I'm not cut out for this,

387
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,020
or it was a mistake for you

388
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,220
to make me learn this.

389
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,570
What's the big deal about losing once?

390
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,850
It seems that I've pampered you too much

391
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,020
and that's why you can't accept defeat.

392
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,420
You'll have to go to the banquet
even if you don't want to.

393
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:33,770
You've already

394
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,290
embarrassed me once at the Entry Exam.

395
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,940
If you dare to embarrass me
a second time,

396
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,610
I'll consider that I never had you
as my daughter.

397
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,420
Watch her put her clothes on.

398
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,050
Yes.

399
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,740
Miss,

400
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,180
you won the first place at the exam and
will have an audience with His Majesty.

401
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,020
You're expecting it
every step of the way.

402
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,660
You said

403
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,460
you wanted to enter the palace
to lure out the person behind Shen Yurong,

404
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,610
so how should we do it?

405
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,810
Through Shen Yurong, of course.

406
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,940
Although I don't know
the person's background,

407
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,020
I'm certain

408
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,090
that the person has a high regard
for Shen Yurong,

409
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,090
and that's exactly what I want
to use to force the person to show up.

410
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,610
But you don't even know
if the person is a man or a woman,

411
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,220
how can you force the person to show up?

412
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,460
It's a woman.

413
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,090
Woman?

414
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,090
Shen Yurong said he had no choice
when he killed me.

415
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,220
I was just the daughter
of a petty official,

416
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,180
and my father and brother
had no enemies.

417
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,180
The person who used
Shen Yurong to kill me

418
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,460
was most likely targeting

419
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,900
the position
of Principal Graduate's wife.

420
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,530
This man is from a noble family,
thought highly of Shen Yurong,

421
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,460
and disregarded my life
as nothing more than an ant.

422
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,090
No matter what,
she's not a simple person.

423
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,370
You must be very careful.

424
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,180
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

on my way to do some errands.

429
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,940
Are you going to the palace?

430
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:45,980
Yes.

431
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,220
I'm also on my way
to the palace banquet.

432
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,940
Why don't I take you there?

433
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,650
I shouldn't have bothered you.

434
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,890
My family's arranged for a carriage.

435
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,980
Right. I'll see you
at the palace entrance.

436
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,570
Shijie, are you here to pick me up?

437
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,060
That's too nice of you.

438
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,220

440

What's wrong?

449
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,130
Why are you staring
at Jiang Li like that?

00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,330

it's turning into a little red face.

459

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,660
Why else do you think His Majesty

543
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,900
would have taken her as Concubine Li

544
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,340
in spite of all the opposition?

545
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,340
Keep your voice down.
Do you have a death wish?

546
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,070
Greetings, Your Majesty, Concubine Li.

547
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:55,950
Rise.

548
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,790
Thank you, Your Majesty.

549
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,620
Since ancient times, scholars have
been meeting friends in the six arts.

550
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,990
You are among the best.

551
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,660
Today, His Majesty hosted a banquet

552
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,860
to honor the scholars
for their diligence

553
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,510
and the top candidates
of the Entry Exam.

554
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,340
The top candidates step forward
and greet His Majesty.

555
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,550
You're Ye Shijie?

556
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,070
Replying to Your Majesty, yes, I am.

557
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,270
Good.

558
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,470
The Ye family of Luyang

559
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,900
has produced
such an outstanding talent as you,

560
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,950
so it's obvious that you're
dedicated to your studies.

561
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,660
Your Majesty, you've flattered me.

562
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,180
I must work hard

563
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,510
to improve the people's livelihood
to live up to Your Majesty's grace.

564
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,420
Well said.

565
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,270
The Ministry of Revenue
has been considering

566
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,950
a new posting to safeguard
the people's livelihood.

567
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,900
Today, I'm appointing you to the post

568
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,620
of Serving Officer
of the Ministry of Revenue.

569
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,030
Tomorrow, I'll order the Ministry of
Personnel to issue an appointment order.

570
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,900
I accept the decree.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

571
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,140
I've heard that Second Lady Jiang

572
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,510
who's been living in isolation
for 10 years in Zhennyu Hall,

573
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,310
but managed to rise to the top
of this year's Entry Exam

574
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,580
and make a name for herself
in the capital.

575
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,790
That's you, right?

576
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

577
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,310
You're so well-versed in your speech,
and remain unperturbed.

578
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,420
I heard that you were in Zhennyu Hall
for ten years.

579
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,900
I'm very curious how you did it.

580
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,860
Zhennyu Hall is in the mountains,

581
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,470
but it nourishes my soul.

582
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,380
There are many recluses
in the mountains.

583
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,340
It's just that ordinary people
can't see them

584
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,070
because they're blinded by

585
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,750
the worldly things.

586
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,990
I left home at a young age.
I was lonely

587
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,580
but I was free of distractions.
My simplicity

588
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,380
made me catch the attention
of the masters,

589
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,990
and I learned some superficial things
from them.

590
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,070
Living in such a desolate place,

591
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,510
you didn't give up,

592
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,620
but you never forgot
to improve yourself. It's rare.

593
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,620
Come on. Present the gifts.

594
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,550
The four of you are
the pillars of the country.

595
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,180
I shall reward you.

596
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,550
These jewels and jades are for you.

597
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,230
Your Majesty.

598
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,620
These are rare jewels
and jades, Your Majesty.

599
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,470
But I'm not interested in them,

600
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,030
so I'd like to ask Your Majesty
to exchange them for something else.

601
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,620
It's the first time someone
has refused gifts from me.

602
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,900
I don't dare to refuse,

603
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,140
but I don't know how to appreciate them.

604
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,580
The jewels and jades
are bound to get dusty,

605
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,790
which is why I ventured to speak out.

606
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,230
What do you want, then?

607
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,860
I'm obsessed with knowledge.

608
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,860
I've read an article by Mr. Shen,
"A Treatise on Men's Servitude".

609
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,660
His discourses,
analyzing the issues of the day,

610
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,510
were widely circulated
among the literati.

611
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,230
I'm incompetent,

612
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,270
but I have great admiration
for Mr. Shen's literary skills.

613
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,070
It's just that I don't dare to seek
teachings because of gender difference.

614
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,470
Today, I'm asking Your Majesty
to grant me permission

615
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,580
to be mentored
by Mr. Shen in the future.

616
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,790
If I have a mentor, I'm sure
I'll gain more knowledge in the future.

617
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,790
Second Lady Jiang is so bold.

618
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,230
I wonder if she's taken
a liking to Mr. Shen.

619
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,550
You don't say, they make a good couple.

620
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,340
Don't talk nonsense.

621
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,270
What's the matter, my dear?

622
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,030
Today, I went to the market to buy food.

623
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,310
The greengrocer,

624
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,270
who usually goes out rain or shine,
didn't show up.

625
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,750
When I asked,

626
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,580
I learned that his family was sparse,

627
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,070
and his only son had gone off
to serve in the army.

628
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,380
So even though he was old,

629
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,860
he had no choice
but to serve in the army.

630
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,070
In the end, he died of exhaustion.

631
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,510
Is there such a tragedy?

632
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,900
People's lives are hard.

633
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,100
Thank you, my dear.

634
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,030
What's wrong?

635
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,470
There are questions on the subject
of Men's Servitude in the imperial exam.

636
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,180
I was at a loss for ideas.

637
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,340
Thanks to you, I was inspired
to write about it.

638
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,180
No wonder you said you were simple.

639
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,100
No one else would dare to request that.

640
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,710
Even if there's gender difference,

641
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,230
there's no harm in pursuing knowledge.

642
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,820
"A Treatise on Men's Servitude"
is well-written indeed.

643
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,420
It can't be written by those who are
not concerned about the people's lives.

644
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,470
It was only after I read this article

645
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,660
that I realised
Official Shen's worldly talents.

646
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,510
And as a woman,
it's rare for you to be so keen

647
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,620
on knowledge.

648
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,580
I approve.

649
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,580
Official Shen.

650
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,310
Mr. Shen,

651
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,790
His Majesty is calling you.

652
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

653
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,550
I want you to give Second Lady Jiang
some guidance seriously

654
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,790
and not to be negligent.

655
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

656
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,990
I have a question for Second Lady Jiang.

657
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,310
Mr. Shen, please go ahead.

658
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,990
"A Treatise on Men's Servitude"
was written when I was a scholar.

659
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,750
It's been years

660
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,660
and I've forgotten.

661
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,230
I don't know why you like it.

662
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,230
Maybe it's because
you were not an official

663
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,750
when you wrote it.

664
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:45,620
An ordinary commoner's
intentions are pure.

665
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,070
An ordinary commoner's
intentions are pure.

666
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,990
I'd like to share this with you,
Second Lady Jiang.

667
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,700
What's wrong with you?

668
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:36,950
Nothing.

669
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,780
Your Majesty is having
a good time today,

670
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,430
and I've had quite some drinks.

671
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,550
But I can't hold my liquor

672
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,260
and I'm getting dizzy.

673
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,700
It's all right, Your Majesty.
Don't worry about me.

674
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,140
I'll go back with you to rest.

675
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,870
His Majesty is leaving.

676
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,510
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

677
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,470
Mr. Shen.

678
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,030
- Please.
- Please.

679
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,390
Mr. Shen.

680
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,030
It was rude of me

681
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,030
to ask for your guidance
when I had no regard

682
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,300
for the fact that you are still
in mourning for your late wife.

683
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,550
Please forgive me.

684
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,910
It's all right.

685
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,260
You've already gifted me
with two fine lines of judgment.

686
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,180
The word "judgment" is unlucky,

687
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:00,180
as if it were a judgment on you.

688
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,990
My wife is dead,

689
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,220
and my life has already been judged.

690
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,100
You're missing your late wife?

691
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,780
She used to play zither by my side,

692
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,300
but now it's all just a mirage,

693
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,620
so how can I not be sad?

694
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,390
Princess Wanning has arrived.

695
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,140
Greetings, Princess Wanning.

696
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,140
I didn't expect to see
Princess Wanning today.

697
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,070
His Majesty is busy
with political affairs

698
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,070
and has called me here
to drink with you.

699
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,140
Don't be so formal.

700
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,550
I'll have a toast with you.

701
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,990
Rumor has it that Princess Wanning
is not to be trifled with.

702
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,140
We must be careful.

703
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,780
[Hening Gate]

704
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,910
Mr. Shen.

705
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,070
Greetings, Princess Wanning.

706
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,140
Did you just have a drink with a lady?

707
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,070
Your Highness,

708
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,140
it's the scholar of the Entry Exam
who's toasting to me.

709
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,660
Scholar?

710
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,260
I heard on the way here

711
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,990
that a diligent lady wants
Mr. Shen to be her teacher.

712
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,580
I wonder which lady
has such an eye for talent.

713
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,950
Who is this?

714
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,870
Could it be her?

715
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,990
Your Highness,

716
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,180
I'm Grand Chancellor Jiang's daughter,
Jiang Li.

717
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,390
So you're Jiang Li.

718
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,950
Your looks

719
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,470
are a surprise to me.

720
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,580
Play some music.

721
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,430
Mr. Shen, enlighten me

722
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,070
on the meaning
of "play zither by your side"

723
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,390
and "it's all just a mirage."

724
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:06,070
Please defend my honor
at the palace banquet.

725
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,350
You know

726
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,510
I love to toy

727
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,300
with your honor.

728
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,990
Are you waiting for me here?

729
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:45,580
Why do I think Second Lady Jiang

730
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,070
and Mr. Shen's late wife

731
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,470
look like twin sisters?

732
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,390
I've never met Mrs. Shen.

733
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,430
I wonder why Your Highness
would say that.

734
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,580
But as it happens,

735
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,390
all my sisters are here today.

736
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,740
Everyone knows that Mr. Shen
loved his wife as much as his life.

737
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,030
How?

738
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,180
Do you think
she looks like your late wife?

739
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,300
There are a lot of people
who look alike in the world.

740
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,580
I dare not take offense.

741
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,430
I've heard that a girl dared to bet

742
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,100
with the young master of the Li family
in this year's Entry Exam.

743
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:33,350
But now that I've seen her,
she's really something.

744
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,740
Well, we've had our fill of wine,

745
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,660
so let's have some fun.

746
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,550
I'll verify whether

747
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:48,540
you're the real thing or not
for His Majesty.

748
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:06,610
I've heard that Second Lady Jiang's
not only good at the zither

749
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,420
but also at archery.

750
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,380
Can you show your skills for us?

751
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,650
Your Highness, you've got it wrong.

752
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,210
I'm not good at archery.

753
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,330
I see.

754
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:23,170
Well, I'll have to find you
a good target.

755
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,980
There's no fun
with something that's not alive.

756
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,100
It's all been seen enough.

757
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,980
Pick a live target to play with.

758
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,100
Who should I pick?

759
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,330
Your Highness,

760
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,460
I request to be the target
of Second Lady Jiang.

761
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,580
Shen Yurong, you're really something.

762
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,690
Except for me, all the students
at the banquet

763
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,020
are young.

764
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,060
If any of them offend Your Highness,

765
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,810
I hope Your Highness
won't make things difficult

766
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,130
for my sake.

767
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,100
Fine.

768
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,250
But it's no fun for Mr. Shen

769
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,860
to be involved
with the arrow without an arrowhead.

770
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,900
Guards, replace the arrow
with an arrowhead.

771
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,770
Mr. Shen, hold it up.

772
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,730
Second Lady Jiang, shoot the jug.

773
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:51,610
If you hit the target, I'll reward you.

774
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,610
What's this?

775
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,250
On the way back, I found it interesting,

776
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,330
so I bought it for you.

777
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,140
I wanted to surprise you,

778
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,550
but you saw it first.

779
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,740
Your Highness,

780
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:53,550
There is no problem for archers
to hit a live target when they are sober,

781
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:54,950
but at the banquet today,

782
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,620
Second Lady Jiang
has already had a few drinks,

783
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:57,430
I am afraid...

784
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,100
Who are you to interrupt
when I'm talking?

785
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,140
Second Lady Jiang,

786
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,100
what are you waiting for?

787
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:12,430
Mr. Shen's hands are sore
from holding it up for you.

788
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,830
What if I miss?

789
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:23,580
It's just for fun in the banquet,
to entertain Her Highness.

790
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:24,910
Second Lady Jiang,

791
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,470
don't worry about my life or death.

792
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:02,950
Focus on the bull's eye.

793
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,350
On the count of three,

794
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,700
let go of your fingers
on the string with me.

795
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,070
Remember, don't hesitate.

796
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,180
Li, close your eyes.
