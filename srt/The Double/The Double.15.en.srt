[Episode 15]

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,470
I came to ask you something.

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,470
Why? Do I know your lover?

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,830
Perhaps

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,270
I know your lover.

21
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,520
I didn't even know I had a lover.

22
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,080
The son of the magistrate of Huaixiang,

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,390
Xue Zhao.

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,550
I didn't expect Duke Su
to have such good manners.

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,240
What are you doing?

26
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,870
You've seen my body.

27
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,710
Can't I have a look at yours?

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Rough and wild. I like it.

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,360
What did you just make me eat?

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,360
Nanjiang's poisonous insect.

Without the antidote,

33

Who are you?

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,430
I am Zhao's friend,

Hold her down and take her

Abducting a woman in broad daylight.

46

Who are you?

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,480
Mind your own business.
She owes me money.

49
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,710
I already told you

50
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,270
I'd pay you five silver liang
every month.

51
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,270
I won't renege on the debts.

52
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,270
Five silver liang?

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,520
Your father owed me fifty silver liang.

54
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,200
What if one day

55
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,150
you disappear like him?

56
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,800
Who can I ask for the money then?

57
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,800
Forcing a decent lady into prostitution
is against the law.

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,710
Moreover,
this lady said she would repay.

59
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,200
Why are you still forcing her?

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,430
Such a busybody.

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,320
Beat him up!

Do you admit your mistakes?

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,480
Yes. Yes.

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,670
She will repay you monthly from now on.

65
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,800
If you harass her again,

66
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,390
don't blame my fists
for being merciless.

67
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,830
Yes, yes, I'll listen to you.

68
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,320

Are you alright?

71
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,040
I will never forget your great kindness.

72
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,120
Those people won't give up easily.

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,560
I will come to Luyang every five days.

74
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,150
If they dare cause trouble again,

75
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,910
I will drive them away for you.

76
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,830
I thought
he was just saying it casually.

77
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,200
Never did I expect

78
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,390
that he really came to see me
every five days.

79
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,960
Back then, before he came to Luyang,

80
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,230
he would always try on several outfits

81
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,560
until he was satisfied before leaving.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,470
You seem to know him well.

83
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,470
Zhao's sister is my friend.

84
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,680
It was Zhao's sister who told me.

85
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,440
What are you carving? It looks so ugly.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,590
Never mind, I'll carve another one.

87
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
So many?

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,440
Who are you carving this for?

89
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,440
You're putting in so much effort.

90
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,270
For my lover.

91
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,030
People usually carve the name
of the recipient.

92
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,880
Why are you carving your own name?

93
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,520
I'm carving my own name on this

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
so that when she sees it,
she'll think of me.

95
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,590
When we first met,

96
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,390
I was still a decent lady.

97
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,120
But now,

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,710
he must be very disappointed in me.

99
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,470
So he never sought me out again.

100
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
Life is unpredictable.

101
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,230
It's not that he doesn't want
to see you.

102
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,000
It's just

103
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,230
that he died.

104
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,830
Xue Zhao was killed by bandits

105
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,120
on his way to the capital.

106
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,320
His body was thrown into the river.

107
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,910
Not only that,

108
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,590
but three members of the Xue family,

109
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,080
his father

110
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,470
and his sister,

111
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,520
all died.

112

Zhao.

113
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,760
Within just half a year,

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,030
three members of the Xue family
met with misfortune.

115
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,230
There must be something unusual
behind this.

116
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,320
I came here this time
to investigate the truth.

117
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,880
I want to ask you if you know anything.

118
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,230
[Zhao]

119
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,080
This

120
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,320
was given to me by Zhao
the last time he saw me.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,790
It originally had ten silver liang.

122
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,200
He said if the creditors came again,

123
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
I could use the silver to repay them.

124
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,830
But those people,

125
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,760
seeing that Zhao never showed up again,

126
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,710
became even more savage.

127
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,080
They didn't care about the money.

128
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,590
Have you seen this before?

129
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,470
See if you recognize it.

130
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,260
[Mining area, landslide, steep path,
narrow and rugged road]

131
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,760
This was hidden among the silver
by Zhao.

132
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,200
I don't understand the drawing on it,

133
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,640
but I recognize the handwriting.

134
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,680
It's Zhao's.

135
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,760
I've been keeping it to myself.

136
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,520
[Mining area, landslide, steep path]
I've never shown it to anyone.

137
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,320
Since it was left to you by him,

138
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,000
keep it safe.

139
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,910
My Lady,

140
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,640
is there anything I can do to help?

141
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,390
This Xihua Brothel﻿

142
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,440
is Luyang's most flourishing brothel.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,830
You can inquire about Luyang's matters
more easily than I can.

144
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,270
I'd like to ask you to help me inquire

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,710
how the magistrate of Huaixiang,
Xue Huaiyuan,

146
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,030
died six months ago,

147
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,640
who handled his funeral,
and where he was buried.

148
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,270
This would fulfill my obligations
to the Xue family.

149
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,620
[Zhao]

150
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,350
This is what I owe Zhao.

151
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,200
I will help you.

152
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,510
Then I will await your good news.

153
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,870
My Lady,

154
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,920
where

155
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,630
is Zhao buried?

156
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,630
The Xue family's cenotaph.

157
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,230
In the capital.

158
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,440
He and his sister will go back
to their hometown.

159
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,470
I will make sure they reunite again.

160
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,710
I'll give you two options.

161
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,990
One, go and tell Chu Lan.

162
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
Two, join forces with me.

163
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,440
Join forces?

164
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,040
Bring down Chu Lan,
and I'll give you the antidote.

165
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,080
You're more interesting than Chu Lan.

166
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,080
If I help you bring him down,

167
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,200
will you visit often?

168
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,200
It depends on your performance.

169
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,200
Duke Su?

170
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,200
Why are you here?

171
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,200
To investigate a case.

172
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,990
What a coincidence.

173
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,080
I came to Luyang, and you also came
to Luyang to investigate.

174
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,200
Why? Are you going to say
I'm stalking you again?

175
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,870
You were in such a hurry
that you dropped something.

176
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,510
Such an exquisite jade pendant.
You might as well give it to me.

177
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,040
It looks like I misunderstood.

178
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,320
You are indeed here for the case.

179
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,750
I won't disturb you.

180
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,870
I'll be going now.

181
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,710
Li.

182
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,590
It seems you don't want to cooperate.

183
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,320
It's normal
for a young lady to be jealous.

184
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,630
Just explain it to her clearly.

185
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,870
Jealous?

186
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,320
I'll let you off this time.

187
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,200
If you do this again,

188
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,830
I won't mind finding someone else
to cooperate with.

189
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,870
Miss, I was just wandering around
at the front door,

190
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,230
and I saw Duke Su here too.

191
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,630
What he does is none of my business.

192
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,400
My Lady, these are the accounts
for this month.

193
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,350
No need to calculate.
They're all in my head.

194
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,160
Lizheng Hall sold 921 bolts of fabrics
this month,

195
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,990
[Ye Jia'er]
totaling 1,353 silver liang.

196
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,990
Revenue is up 10% from last month.

197
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,590
It's good if you look
at the accounts alone.

198
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,040
But as the cold autumn begins,

199
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,590
people are buying new clothes.

200
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,680
Autumn clothes are much more expensive
than summer ones.

201
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,960
So looking at the overall accounts,

202
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,160
we are actually running a deficit
this month.

203
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,280
My Lady, stop calculating.

204
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,680
Madam is still waiting for you
in the room.

205
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,280
Let's go!

206
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,920
Mother, I'm back!

207
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,990
Madam!

208
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,400
- Just let me die!
- Mother!

209
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,320
What's wrong now?

210
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,200
Madam Li!

211
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,920
My Lady,

212
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,830
Master Ye came back

213
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,510
with a little vixen this time.

214
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,160
- I don't want to live anymore!
- Madam!

215
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,830
My dear, I'm back!

216
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,160
Madam Li, take good care of my mother.

217
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,440
I'm going to ask my father about this.

218
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,200
Little vixen!

219
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,200
Madam.

220
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,590
Madam!

221
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,080
Father,

222
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,680
what's wrong with you?

223
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,830
What do you mean?

224
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,230
Little vixen!

225
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,500
What little vixen?

226
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,110
You brought her back,
and you're asking me?

227
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,590
Me?

228
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,830
I brought her back?

229
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,590
Little vixen?

230
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,710
Are you talking about Li?

231
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,710
Look.

232
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,620
You're calling her so affectionately,

233
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,830
and you still say
she's not a little vixen?

234
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,500
The one you're calling a little vixen

235
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,830
is our relative.

236
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,710
Li, from the Jiang family
in the capital.

237
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,350
The one who looked down on the Ye family
for being merchants?

238
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,260
Father, our family is already a mess.

239
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,110
Why did you bring
such a big trouble back?

240
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,740
Watch your words.

241
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,070
She's now
the Grand Chancellor's daughter

242
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,140
and also your cousin.

243
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,230
That little vixen has entered the doors
of our Ye family.

244
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,230
You say...

245
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,660
Father,

246
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,950
you'd better solve
the current trouble first.

247
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,540
Let me die!

248
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,310
The moment that little vixen

249
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,110
steps into the Ye family's doors,

250
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,780
there will be no peace in the Ye family.

251
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,660
Madam, you cannot die.

252
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,540
- Let me die!
- Madam.

253
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,710
If the little vixen is in this family,
there won't be me.

254
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,620
If I'm here, there won't be room
for that little vixen.

255
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,900
I'll go with you
to see the King of Hell.

256
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,140
Why are you messing around?

257
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,740
I don't want to live anymore!

258
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,990
My dear.

259
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,430
Even if you die,

260
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,660
we still need to make things clear.

261
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,950
Madam Li, I don't want to live anymore!

262
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,780
Shut up!

263
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,020
The person that you are talking about

264
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,140
is not a little vixen.

265
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,140
That's our niece, Jiang Li.

266
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,110
Help!

267
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,470
My dear!

268
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,470
- My dear!
- Mother!

269
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,110
My dear!

270
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,430
As Shijie becomes a serving officer
in the Ministry of Revenue,

271
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,950
she eagerly comes to us.

272
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,500
Father, you too.

273
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,110
Why did you have to bring her back?

274
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,710
You're always blabbering.

275
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,830
Even when Shijie
has become the serving officer,

276
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,710
the Jiang family

277
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,230
doesn't need to curry favor with us.

278
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,350
Furthermore,

279
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,740
your cousin said
she wanted to come with me.

280
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,190
Could I stop her from coming?

281
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,540
I don't even consider her my cousin.

282
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,620
Let's leave it at that for now.

283
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:00,950
Let's see how it goes.

284
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,350
There's been a lot going on
at home lately,

285
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,710
and the shop isn't peaceful either.

286
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,350
Old Madam is having a headache

287
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,380
over business matters.

288
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,310
If she finds out that Li is here,

289
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,780
she might make a big scene.

290
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,380
Let's handle the business matters first.

291
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,190
[Bingde Hall]

292
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,070
We'll slowly break it to Old Madam,

293
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,260
so as not to shock her.

294
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,710
But we can't just leave her
like this either.

295
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,310
One person in our family should step up

296
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,590
to properly entertain Jiang Li tomorrow.

297
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,310
Otherwise, it'll seem like our family

298
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,660
has no manners,

299
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,070
making us a joke to the Jiang family.

300
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,110
Who will go?

301
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,020
Why are you looking at me?

302
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,990
I just had a disagreement with her.

303
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,500
Anyone can go, but not me.

304
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,190
Don't look at me.

305
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,780
I have to go to the shop tomorrow.

306
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,990
I don't have time.

307
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,470
Why are you all looking at me?

308
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,780
I've been the one
entertaining Jiang Li all along.

309
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,860
You never show up,

310
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,230
making it look like the Ye family

311
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,500
doesn't welcome her.

312
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,870
Why don't we follow
our family's old tradition?

313
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,820
Let's draw lots.

314
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,190
There are three paper balls,
and only one has "yes" on it.

315
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,700
Whoever draws it will go.

316
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,430
I'm not drawing.

317
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,980
My dear first.

318
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,530
Jia'er is the youngest, Jia'er first.

319
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,740
I already said I'm not drawing.

320
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,370
Draw one, draw one.

321
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,660
Draw one.

322
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,850
Thank you, Jia'er.
Take a day off tomorrow.

323
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,290
Quickly tell the coachman
to prepare the carriage.

324
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:06,980
Yes.

325
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,980
Remember to tell the kitchen
to prepare some snacks for the ride.

326
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:09,500
Yes.

327
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,130
And is the warm water
for washing the face ready?

328
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,220
- Yes.
- What about the clothes and jewelry?

329
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:12,900
They're ready.

330
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,660
Rouge.

331
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,500
Tong?

332
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,770
Tong!

333
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,290
Miss, you're awake?

334
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,180
It's so early in the morning.
Who's talking outside?

335
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,090
Miss, it's Lady Jia'er.

336
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,940
Lady Jia'er got up early

337
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,260
and invited us to go out to play.

338
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,460
Go out to play?

339
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,090
So early?

340
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,660
Miss, after yesterday's matters,

341
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,740
you didn't get enough rest.

342
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,420
Should I go and reject now,

343
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,460
so we can sleep a bit more?

344
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,530
She was kind enough to arrange it.

345
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,700
We can't reject her.

346
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,130
It's for fun anyway.

347
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,610
Let's go. Help me freshen up.

348
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,770
Not up yet? Fine.

349
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,900
We've been waking her up
a long time in advance.

350
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:00,940
You got up late.

351
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,850
More people
will help you freshen up faster.

352
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,660
Jia'er.

353
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,420
Today, we'll go
to Baizhang Mountain first.

354
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,850
Then, we'll go to Sijing Lake.

355
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,980
At noon, we'll eat
Juewei Restaurant's specialties.

356
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,530
In the afternoon,
we'll watch a magic show at Bai House

357
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,660
and see monkeys at Miao Garden.

358
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,370
In the evening, we'll go boating
on Liangshui River.

359
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,770
Jia'er, there's no need
to visit so many places.

360
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,530
We can have more time to spare.

361
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,220
These are all must-go places in Luyang.

362
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,940
As long as you stick to the schedule,

363
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,020
we'll be able to complete it.

364
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,260
I can't spare two days to accompany you.

365
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,980
Jia'er, I know you're entrusted
by your family.

366
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,260
You're worried I'd feel unwelcome,
so you want to take me everywhere.

367
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,290
Actually, I'm tired
from the previous journey

368
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,700
and don't feel like going out.

369
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,810
What do you mean?

370
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,610
You're not happy with my plans?

371
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,090
If you don't like it, we can change it.

372
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,610
How about this?

373
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,090
I'll tell Second Uncle and Second Aunt

374
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,460
that you've shown me

375
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,660
all the scenic spots
and delicacies of Luyang.

376
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,460
That way,
you won't have to work so hard,

377
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,850
and we won't waste time.

378
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:16,900
How about that?

379
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,770
Since you're so open with me,

380
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,740
I'll be straightforward.

381
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,180
You're the one
who said you don't want to go,

382
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,740
not because I'm not being a good host.

383
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,980
You've put in a lot of effort.
You are definitely a great host.

384
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,090
You should have said so earlier.

385
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,810
I have a lot of issues at the shop

386
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,700
that need my attention.

387
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,500
The carriage is ready for you.

388
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,180
You can go wherever you want
during the day

389
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,050
and come back in the evening.

390
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,330
Jia'er.

391
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,370
I want to visit our family's shop.

392
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,420
I didn't bring many clothes with me.

393
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,420
I'd like to make some new ones.

394
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,810
Don't you know it's still dark?

395
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,050
Don't you know the shop isn't open yet?

396
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,220
We'll leave in two hours.

397
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:04,980
Let's go.

398
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,940
[Lizheng Hall]

399
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,130
Third Master,
this money can't be given to you.

400
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,180
Third Master,

401
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,660
all the money in the shop
has to be accounted for.

402
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,850
If you want to withdraw it,

403
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,020
you must have a receipt stamped
by my master.

404
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,980
That's the rule.

405
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,700
Last time, there was no such rule.

406
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,090
[Ye Mingyu]
This time, there is.

407
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,500
Are you making rules for me?

408
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,610
Third Uncle?

409
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,290
Third Uncle?

410
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,420
Third Master, you can't do this.

411
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,850
Third Master, you can't do this.

412
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,850
Jia'er,

413
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,050
what's the matter with him?

414
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,370
I bet he got into a business deal again

415
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,700
and lost all his money.

416
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,900
Now, he's here to borrow money.

417
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,740
You wait here for a moment.

418
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,500
Come over after I've sorted this out.

419
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,260
I can't...

420
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,810
Third Uncle, you're not coming home
after you're back in Luyang.

421
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,900
What are you doing here?

422
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,610
Lady Jia'er, you're finally here.

423
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,700
Jia'er.

424
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,090
You came just in time.

425
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,770
Quick, give me some money.

426
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,260
I have a business deal,

427
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,610
and I'm just left
with the final payment.

428
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,260
How much do you need?

429
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,220
Just a few thousand silver liang
should do.

430
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,130
What kind of business deal is it?

431
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,770
You wouldn't get it even if I told you.
Just give me the money.

432
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,260
When I make money,
I'll return more to you.

433
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,940
Third Uncle, I don't want to be saddled
with bad debts.

434
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,580
You've really grown some guts.

435
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,390
[Gauze fabric, plain brocade for robes]
You little brat.

436
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,020
You've made some money in business,

437
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,820
and you don't recognize me anymore.

438
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,230
Cut the crap and just give me the money.

439
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,020
No way.

440
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,390
Third Uncle, it's not hard to borrow
after you've repaid the money.

441
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,540
I'll lend it to you after you've cleared
your previous debts.

442
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,260
Otherwise, you'd better find my father.

443
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,670
You've really grown bold,

444
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,630
using your father to pressure me.

445
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,780
Don't blame me
for not being polite today.

446
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,100
If you don't give me the money today,
I'm not leaving.

447
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,500
That's right, we're not leaving.

448
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,300
Third Master.

449
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,260
What? Are you going to hit me?

450
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,540
Try hitting me.

451
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,500
I wouldn't dare.

452
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:34,870
Get lost.

453
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,910
I am your third uncle.

454
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,260
Do you believe
I'll go to your grandmother

455
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,670
and make you suffer?

456
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,630
Third Uncle.

457
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,670
Lizheng Hall's accounts are managed
by my cousin now.

458
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,340
Don't make things difficult for her.

459
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:55,910
Third Uncle?

460
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,060
How am I your uncle?

461
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,230
Go away.

462
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,670
Third Uncle, I'm Jiang Li.

463

[Bingde Hall]

465
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,090
[Young Ye Mingyu]
You have never left home before.

466
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,430
You must learn
to protect yourself outside.

467
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,740
You are always my hero.

468
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:35,990
You will protect me.

469
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,260
Zhen, you must be happy.

470
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,870
I am very happy.

471
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,230
Mother, I beg you!

472
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,260
Please let me go to the Jiang family

473
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,540
to bring Zhen and Li back.

474
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,470
Zhen was most afraid of being alone
when she was alive.

475
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,500
I can't let her leave

476
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,990
all alone.

477
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,710
Mother!

478
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,430
[Bingde Hall]
She has married into the Jiang family.

479
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,260
She was a member of the Jiang family
when she was alive,

480
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,780
and she will be the Jiang family's ghost
after dying.

481
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,580
Mother!

00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:42,700
[Bingde Hall]

483
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,300
This...

484
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,020
Li?

485
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,430
Yes.

486
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,260
When did you come to Luyang?

487
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,580
I came two days ago with Second Uncle.

488
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,340
I'm free today,
so I came to take a look at the shop.

489
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,990
Have you been well these years?

490
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,230
It's a long story.

491
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,340
Third Uncle, why don't we go home
and talk in detail?

492
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,020
Forget it!

493
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:20,710
Forget it?

494
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,580
Forget it!

495
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,990
Today, on account of your mother,

496
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,100
I don't want the money anymore.

497
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,430
Shun,

498
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,870
let's go.

499
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,340
We're leaving just like that?

500
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:35,990
Just go.

501
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,150
Li, don't you want
to have some clothes made?

502
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,500
Come, take a look
and see if there's anything you like.

503
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,500
Second Lady Jiang,
these are the new fabrics

504
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,540
from our shop.

505
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,390
The quality is excellent.

506
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,340
The colors are the most fashionable too.

507
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,230
Mr. Qian!

508
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,100
Mr. Qian! I want a refund.

509
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,580
Uncle Zhao.

510
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,430
What did you just say? Refund?

511
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,950
This matter cannot be delayed
any longer.

512
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,430
Since your father is not here,

513
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,710
I'll talk to you first.

514
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,630
Li, I have something to discuss
with Uncle Zhao.

515
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,820
Tell the shop manager
to pack up any fabrics you like

516
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,540
and charge it to me.

517
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,740
Jia'er, go ahead.

518
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,230
This way, please.

519
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:15,820
Alright.

520
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,060
[Ye's Residence]

521
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,230
Miss, do you have something
on your mind?

522
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,340
I keep feeling
that the Ye family is in trouble.

523
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,060
And this trouble is not small.

524
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,780
[Bingde Hall]
Ye Mingyu, that scoundrel!

525
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,990
What has he become
after a few years outside?

526
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
A bandit!

527
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,390
Tell me, which shops did he go to?

528
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,740
I don't know.

529
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,300
You!

530
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,950
This Mingyu!

531
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,710
Li is back.

532
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:43,710
Second Uncle.

533
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,060
Li, why did you come back alone?

534
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,340
Didn't Jia'er accompany you?

535
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,430
Jia'er arranged everything very well.

536
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,710
I had a lot of fun today.

537
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,190
She went to handle some matters
at the shop.

538
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,470
That's why I came back alone.

539
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,710
That's good.

540
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,430
Second Uncle.

541
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,300
Is there something wrong

542
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,500
with the family's business?

543
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:09,870
This...

544
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,020
Mingxuan.

545
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:11,950
My dear.

546
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,670
Governor Tong has sent people here.

547
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,950
Governor Tong?

548
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,710
Why did he send people here?

549
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,910
I don't know either.

550
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,060
Official Zhu,

551
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,670
what brings you here this time?

552
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,950
[Official Zhu]
Mr. Ye, Governor Tong asked for you.

553
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,820
Where to?

554
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,340
What crime has he committed?

555
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,630
Why only him?

556
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,740
What is this about?

557
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,260
Madam, you have quite a temper.

558
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,430
I'm just doing my job.

559
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,780
Please let Mr. Ye discuss these matters

560
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,740
with Governor Tong.

561
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,260
You!

562
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,630
Our business is clean.

563
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,950
A clean hand wants no washing.

564
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,100
I will go with them.

565
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,430
Official Zhu, could you wait a moment?

566
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,260
Let me tell my family a few things.

567
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,630
Li, I originally planned

568
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,430
to take you to see your grandmother
these few days.

569
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,580
I didn't expect these issues to arise.

570
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,820
You will have to wait a little longer.

571
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,950
Second Uncle,
take care of your matters first.

572
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,190
My dear, while I'm away,

573
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,190
please take care of the household.

574
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,820
If anything comes up at Lizheng Hall,

575
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,710
let our Jia'er handle it.

576
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,340
This is a good opportunity

577
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,910
for her to gain experience.

578
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,060
As for Mother,

579
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,670
don't tell her for now

580
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,820
about me meeting Governor Tong.

581
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,990
Remember that.

582
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,230
Official Zhu,

583
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,950
when can Mingxuan return?

584
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,870
You would have to ask Governor Tong.

585
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,430
Mr. Ye, let's go if you're done.

586
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,340
Chu Lan will enter Luyang in seven days.
Be ready.

587
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,340
Feed me.

588
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,020
You don't want it?

589
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,870
Then throw it away.

590
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,580
When you have time,
come to Xihua Brothel.

591
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,260
I'll set a time aside for you.

592
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,780
My Lord, you were handling your matters,

593
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,230
but why did you also flirt around?

594
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,260
It's not easy to clear the debt of love.

595
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,020
Shut up.

596
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,100
My Lord,
Tong Zhiyang has already taken action.

597
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,260
That's a bit early.

598
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,100
He sent people

599
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,870
straight to the Ye family's front hall
and made an arrest.

600
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,630
The commotion was big.

601
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,580
The Ye family can't hide it now,
even if they want to.

602
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,990
I reckon the whole of Luyang knows
about it.

603
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,390
It's for the Li family to see.

604
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,060
Naturally, the commotion can't be small.

605
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,230
I heard Second Lady Jiang
was also present at the time,

606
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,710
but she didn't do anything.

607
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,870
This time,

608
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,540
could it be
that the Li family is going to succeed?

609
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,190
You never learn your lesson.

610
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,910
Why do you still dare
to underestimate her?

611
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,670
I already dare not underestimate her.

612
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,020
It's just that once the word
of the Soochow brocades

613
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,990
being problematic spreads,

614
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,910
Lizheng Hall will be in jeopardy.

615
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,430
Now that Ye Mingxuan is away,

616
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,990
the Ye family only has a few women left.

617
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,500
The Li family can swallow them up
in one mouth.

618
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,430
My Lord, should we intervene now?

619
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,230
Don't treat people like fools.

620
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,710
This show isn't over yet.

621
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,500
Don't draw conclusions too early.

622
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,780
Keep watching the Ye family.

623
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,020
Yes.

624
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,150
Tong,

625
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,390
help me get a cup of strong tea.

626
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,870
Miss, it's so late now.

627
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,340
Drinking too much strong tea is harmful.

628
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,950
You woke up so early this morning.

629
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,430
Li, you should go back to your room
and rest.

630
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,260
Don't stay up here with us.

631
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,540
If we don't get news tonight,

632
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,430
I won't be able to sleep either.

633
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,670
I'm afraid that in the end,

634
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,990
it will be the worst outcome.

635
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,060
Madam.

636
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:42,950
What did they say?

637
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,260
I didn't even get
to see Governor Tong's face.

638
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,780
I thought of using money
to bribe those officials,

639
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,100
but no one dared to accept it.

640
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,430
This is absurd!

641
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,430
Even a murderer has a three-court trial.

642
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,740
A Ye family member was arrested,

643
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,060
and there's not even an explanation.

644
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,060
I...

645
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,580
Mother, what are you doing?

646
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,780
I'll hang myself
at the governor's door.

647
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,260
Don't make it worse.

648
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,020
Don't make it worse!

649
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,500
I'll see if they still dare
to be so arrogant!

650
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,230
Second Aunt, don't be anxious.

651
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,430
Second Uncle should still be safe
for now.

652
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,710
They caused such a big scene today

653
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,950
by coming and arresting someone.

654
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,060
After taking Second Uncle away,
they didn't hold a trial,

655
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,300
and no official documents were announced
to the public.

656
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,150
I guess

657
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,430
Tong Zhiyang and his people are waiting
for the highest offer.

658
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,500
The highest offer?

659
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,150
But didn't they refuse our money?

660
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,190
It's like doing business.
Both sides set prices.

661
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,260
Then negotiate.

662
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,340
There's a bargaining process
in the middle.

663
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,470
This time, someone is the product,
and they are waiting for an offer.

664
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,300
But they refused to set the price.

665
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,580
They are waiting for us
to offer everything we have.

666
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,670
How dare he? He...

667
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,260
Mother,

668
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,390
hear Jiang Li out first.

669
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,710
What Second Aunt said is valid.

670
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,150
Although Tong Zhiyang is the governor,

671
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,340
the Ye family

672
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,580
is not insignificant in Luyang.

673
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,340
One, there is no evidence.

674
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,020
Two, there are no official documents.

675
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,670
He arrested the head of the Ye family
just like that.

676
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,630
Doesn't Tong Zhiyang fear
being reported to the capital?

677
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,540
Li, you mean...

678
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,310
I'm afraid he is just a middleman.

679
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,270
There are others behind him
giving orders.

680
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,350
Luyang's governor
has become a middleman?

681
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,950
What a sin!

682
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,100
We are honest businessmen.

683
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,620
Which powerful person have we offended?

684
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,310
You haven't offended anyone in business.

685
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,350
But that may not be the case
in other areas.

686
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,620
You mean...

687
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,060
To be honest, in the capital,

688
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,100
Shijie once refused
to pledge allegiance to someone.

689
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,100
Pledge allegiance?

690
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:35,870
Yes.

691
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,140
The Grand Chancellor, Li Zhongnan,
has a son named Li Lian.

692
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,470
He and Shijie were classmates
at the Imperial Academy.

693
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,100
He did not hesitate to set Shijie up

694
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,750
to achieve his goal of winning him over.

695
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,830
After Shijie saw through it,
they broke off relations.

696
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,020
That shouldn't be it.

697
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,350
That is just a small matter.

698
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,790
This...

699
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,350
There is no small matter in officialdom.

700
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,950
So, you mean

701
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,020
they're using the Ye family
to threaten Shijie?

702
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,350
This is just my guess for now.

703
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,750
But before the people behind it

704
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,220
reveal their true intentions,

705
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,390
Second Uncle will be fine.

706
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:06,870
Then...

707
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,790
Then isn't Shijie in great danger?

708
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,140
Shijie just got appointed in the capital

709
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,750
to become an official by the Emperor.

710
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,350
And with the marital ties
with the Jiang family,

711
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,270
others won't be able to harm him easily.

712
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,350
We mustn't lose our composure.

713
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,140
Perhaps they want us

714
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,990
to make a mistake due to panic.

715
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,310
Hearing you say that,

716
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,790
I am much relieved.

717
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,220
Then let's wait.

718
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,580
Wait for Tong Zhiyang to make a move.

719
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,950
Second Aunt, what happened
to the Soochow brocades?

720
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,910
I've been thinking about it,

721
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,180
and I fear
this issue has been exploited.

722
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,180
The Soochow brocades are woven
by the Ye family's weaving house.

723
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,380
These are all the samples produced
by the weaving house

724
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,210
in the past three months.

725
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,940
I've checked them thoroughly,
and there were no problems.

726
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,940
Out of nowhere, there's a rumor

727
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,530
that the Soochow brocades caused deaths.

728
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,380
The rumor spread
like wildfire overnight.

729
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,300
The fabric shops and garment shops
in Luyang

730
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:05,980
all don't want them anymore.

731
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,820
They want to be refunded.

732
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,690
Now that I think about it,

733
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,730
this has been a setup
since the rumor started.

734
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,690
Have you investigated

735
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,090
whether the Soochow brocades
really caused deaths?

736
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,730
It's easy to spread rumors,
but hard to dispel them.

737
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,780
After the rumor started,

738
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,500
Father sent a lot of people

739
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,780
to investigate it.

740
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,460
We didn't find any dead people,

741
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,090
but we did find a batch

742
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,980
of problematic Soochow brocades.

743
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,170
Everyone who came into contact
with this batch of fabrics

744
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,250
has developed red rashes
all over their bodies.

745
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,300
Now we don't know whether this rumor

746
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,690
is true or false.

747
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,090
Then let's go together

748
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,020
to check this batch
of problematic fabrics

749
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,210
tomorrow morning.

750
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,900
Li.

751
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,530
If it weren't for you
stabilizing the situation today,

752
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,460
the Ye family
might have fallen into chaos.

753
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,420
Although I am skilled in business,

754
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,650
I don't understand
these political intrigues.

755
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,020
It's also thanks to you
for calming my mother.

756
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,820
I am the niece of the Ye family.

757
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,690
These are all things I should do.

758
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,650
I'm being so polite to you.

759
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,650
It's making me seem pretentious.

760
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,170
But I am still very worried.

761
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,570
Worried about what?

762
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,570
I'm afraid this is just the beginning.

763
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,940
If the people behind this

764
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,130
don't achieve their goals this time,

765
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,690
does it mean

766
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,460
that the Ye family will never have peace
from now on?

767
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,300
Why should we let them succeed?

768
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,940
Didn't you say that in officialdom...

769
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
Did they study hard for years
to become officials

770
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,730
and rise up the ranks

771
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,340
just to oppress civilians
with their power?

772
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,250
They will not stop

773
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,050
because of your concessions.

774
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,980
They will only push further
without mercy.

775
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,610
The ancestors of the Ye family
have braved hardships

776
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,380
to achieve wealth in Luyang today.

777
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,130
If even you give in this time,

778
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,540
in the future, not only the Ye family

779
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,020
but many others will suffer.

780
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,170
You're right.

781
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,730
Back then,
I almost died in Zhennyu Hall.

782
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,820
But I survived.

783
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,170
Since I could come back alive,

784
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,980
the Ye family will definitely be fine.

785
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,130
Li.

786
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,500
[Bingde Hall]

787
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,170
Why haven't I seen Second Aunt?

788
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,380
My mother went
to take care of Grandmother.

789
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,250
Now everyone in the family

790
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,130
is hiding it from Grandmother.

791
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,940
I don't know how long
we can keep it from her.

792
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,180
Don't worry.

793
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,870
Today, we will get to the bottom
of the issue of Soochow brocades.

794
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,260
My Lady, it's bad!

795
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,510
Lizheng Hall has been smashed.

796
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,990
Smashed?

797
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,220
Those people came in
and started smashing things.

798
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,030
Even the signboard
of Lizheng Hall was destroyed.

799
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,220
My nose was hit and got crooked.

800
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,140
How will I find a wife in the future?

801
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,700
My Lady, please go and take a look.

802
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,540
How many people came?

803
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,060
At least several dozen people

804
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,220
surrounded the entire Lizheng Hall.

805
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,310
They said

806
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,740
that the Soochow brocades
we sold previously

807
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,100
are still causing harm.

808
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,350
Li, you wait at home. I will go and see.

809
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,870
Let's go together
and think of a solution.

810
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,910
My Lord is indeed amazing.

811
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,140
Li Jing is inside.

812
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,390
He still likes to sit in the tea house

813
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,830
and watch his own bad shows.

814
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,620
Then we...

815
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,950
Are you Duke Su?

816
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,180
There's a Mr. Li in the private room

817
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,620
who wants to see you inside for a chat.

818
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,660
He said if you are coming to see him,
you should do so openly.

819
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,830
Why do you need to send someone
to spy sneakily?

820
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,060
Who are you calling sneaky?

821
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,430
Lead the way.

822
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,540
This way.

823
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,060
Mr. Li.

824
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,620
I didn't expect to meet you in Luyang.

825
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,220
What a coincidence.

826
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,510
I did expect to meet you in Luyang.

827
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,510
A good tea matches a good show.

828
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,220
Thank you, Mr. Li.

829
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,350
So Mr. Li invited me here

830
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,870
to watch people smash Lizheng Hall?

831
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,030
You think too much.
We're just having tea.

832
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,620
Stop!

833
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,540
We haven't encountered this before!

834
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,990
Stop it!

835
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,390
I know her! She is Lady Ye!

836
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,430
Shop Manager.

837
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,740
My Lady, you are here.

838
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,790
It's been tough on you.

839
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,260
Go inside and tend to your injuries.

840
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,740
But there are so many people.

841
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,790
It's okay. I've got this. Fu.

842
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,180
Let's go, Shop Manager.

843
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,700
Someone in charge has come.

844
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,700
Don't leave!

845
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,350
Don't go!

846
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,030
I am Ye Jia'er,
the person-in-charge of Lizheng Hall.

847
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,030
If you have anything to say,

848
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,620
we can sit down
and talk about it nicely.

849
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,350
The Ye family
will give everyone an explanation.

850
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,390
To hell with your explanation!

851
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:18,390
The Ye family's fabrics
has turned into shrouds!

852
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,140
That's right! You've caused deaths.

853
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,790
And you still dare
to earn Luyang people's money?

854
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,310
I think you're earning
black-hearted money

855
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,390
and borrowing blood money!

856
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,390
Yes!

857
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,580
Black-hearted money!

858
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,100
Everyone!

859
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:31,660
Everyone!

860
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,100
I don't know where this idea
that the Soochow brocades cause deaths

861
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:35,950
came from.

862
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,220
But the Ye family

863
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,180
has been doing business in Luyang
for many years.

864
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,180
Our reputation is well-known.

865
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,510
We can't bear such a grave accusation

866
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,830
of causing deaths for profits.

867
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,430
Please give us some time to investigate.

868
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,470
Liar! The Ye family are liars!

869
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,510
Pay with your lives!

870
00:41:52,620 --> 00:42:01,740
Murderers should pay with their lives!

871
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,100
Great! Help's on the way.

872
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,870
I'm afraid not.

873
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,350
The district defender is here.

874
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,030
Take her away.

875
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,540
Why are you arresting me?

876
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,390
Why are you arresting me
and not the troublemakers?

877
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,740
We received a report

878
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,470
that Lizheng Hall sold inferior fabrics,

879
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,100
which caused deaths.

880
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,700
Aren't you the one in charge?

881
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,620
Come with us.

882
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,180
Yes, arrest her!

883
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,310
Lizheng Hall's fabrics caused deaths!

884
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,470
Shouldn't she be arrested?

885
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,310
Arrest her!

886
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:34,580
Arrest her! Arrest her!

887
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,870
May I ask everyone

888
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,430
who told you
that the Ye family's Soochow brocades

889
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,220
have problems?

890
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,660
Look at what you're saying.

891
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,950
Who doesn't know about the problems

892
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,790
with Lizheng Hall's Soochow brocades?

893
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,700
Look at me.

894
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,390
Come, take a look!

895
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,470
Come and look!

896
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,870
I've got rashes all over my body.

897
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,390
Look, everyone!

898
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,910
Li, you...

899
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:10,540
What are you doing?

900
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:12,870
Hold it.

901
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:18,580
Tong.

902
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,260
Everyone, take a look.

903
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,740
The clothes I'm wearing

904
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,220
are from Lizheng Hall.

905
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,510
They were given to me
by Ms. Ye yesterday.

906
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,870
They were also made
from Soochow brocades.

907
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,100
But I wore them all day,

908
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,030
and I haven't developed any rashes
like you have.

909
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,180
Don't believe me?

910
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,790
Fine. If you don't believe me,

911
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,790
these ladies can pass it around
and see for yourselves.

912
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,660
Here, take a look.

913
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,350
Is it? Is it?

914
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:47,790
This...

915
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,220
It is indeed the Soochow brocade
from the shop.

916
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,260
If the Soochow brocades
really had a problem,

917
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,830
wouldn't I be seeking my own death
by wearing them?

918
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,510
What's impossible about that?

919
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,620
You're a shill for the Ye family.

920
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,950
You took the Ye family's money
to put on an act.

921
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,260
Your life is worth nothing!

922
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,660
You got it wrong.

923
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,580
My life is worth more
than the entire Lizheng Hall.

924
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,660
Boasting so shamelessly.

925
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:10,950
Who are you?

926
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:14,310
I am the daughter
of Great Yan's Secretariat Director

927
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,660
and His Majesty's Grand Preceptor,

928
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,660
Jiang Li.

929
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,220
Jiang Li?

930
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,510
I didn't expect that Second Lady Jiang

931
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,350
would reveal her identity

932
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,390
to stand up for the Ye family.

933
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,220
Isn't she afraid of being accused
of shielding the Ye family?

934
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,180
Mr. Li,

935
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,540

is yet to come.
