I've always

160
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,710
thought that Ruoyao
didn't have any ideas

161
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,350
and could only listen to you, Ji Shuran,

162
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,630
but I didn't expect
that she'd have her own ideas by now.

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,160

169
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,200

My dear.

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,470
My dear, if Ruoyao wants
to take the matter into her own hands,

173
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,750
arrange it yourself, then.

174
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,470
That way you'll have
some peace and quiet, too.

175
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,320
Just let her be.

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,560

Sit down.

179
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,960
It's Jiang Li, isn't it?

180
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,110
Did she teach you to say that?

181
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,080
No one taught me anything.

182
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,680

185
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,750
in this family,

186
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,560
I am the only one who cares about you.

187
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,680
You've been abetted by Jiang Li,
do you know that?

188
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,990
She said all those things
to confuse you.

189
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,080
She's doing it for her own benefit.

190
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,350
She's trying to hurt you.

191
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,080
Jiang Li has never tried to hurt me.

192
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,440
That day, from the beginning to the end,

193
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,350
she never mentioned
that I eloped with Zhou Yanbang.

194
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,280
It's you

195
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,350
who's been trying
to make her identify me.

196
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,160
What do you know?

197
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,870
If she dared to accuse you,

198
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,230
it would prove she's slandering you,

199
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,110
and she wouldn't be able
to get away with it easily.

200
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,080
What about me?

201
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,590
What about my reputation

202
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,470
and my feelings?

203
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,400
All you want to do is to ruin Jiang Li.

204
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,080
Have you thought about me?

205
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,680
You're always saying other people
are trying to hurt me,

206
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,110
but in fact, you just don't want me
to trust anyone else,

207
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,470
and I'll do what you want.

208
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,200
Madam Ji.

209
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,800
Do you know how much I've worked

210
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,160
for you?

211
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,560
You mean

212
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,560
you've been trying

213
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,710
to get rid of Jiang Li
and Jiang Yue for me?

214
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,630
What do you mean?

215
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,750
I don't mean anything.

216
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,200
I just want you to know

217
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,350
I don't need you to do this for me.

218
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,980
I, Jiang Ruoyao,

219
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,180
don't have to step
on other people's corpses

220
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,100
to get to the top.

221
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,460
Besides, if I have to step

222
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,370
on other people's corpses
to get to the top,

223
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,770
then I'd rather not get there.

224
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,850
I'm going to tell Father

225
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,620
that I'm going away on a study trip

226
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,290
and I don't want to get married.

227
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,220
Madam Ji, don't.

228
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,860
Third Lady, apologize to your mother now

229
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,020
and she will forgive you.

230
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,570
I won't.

231
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,810
From today,

232
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,770
she's not allowed to see anyone.

233
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:12,620
Well...

234
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,050
Are you still upset about Ruoyao?

235
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,410
It's fine that Ruoyao's engagement
with the Qi family has been broken off.

236
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,460
They're not a respectable family either.

237
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,770
Afterwards,

238
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,930
I'll ask His Majesty

239
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,410
to find another good match for Ruoyao.

240
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,050
I'm not upset about the marriage,
but Ruoyao.

241
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,620
She's been confused by Jiang Li.

242
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,890
She's a different person now.

243
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,490
I can't control her anymore.

244
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,180
How dare Jiang Li lay hands on Ruoyao?

245
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,300
If this goes on,

246
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,370
it'll be hard to deal with her.

247
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,650
I must get rid of her this time.

248
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,730
Back then, I remember you took her out

249
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,820
of Court of Judicial Review's
prison yourself.

250
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,980
I thought she'd have
some gratitude for you.

251
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,850
But now, it seems

252
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,610
I was wrong.

253
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,250
I don't regret saving her.

254
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,220
After all, I didn't want to
make things difficult for Jiang Yuanbai.

255
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,370
Do you have a plan that will work?

256
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,300
Why are you involved
with Eldest Princess?

257
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,850
Why would she come to you?

258
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,770
You mustn't be used by her.

259
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,220
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

260
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,890
She wants Jiang Li dead more than I do.

261
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,340
Looks like you've made up your mind.

262
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,940
Don't worry.

263
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,130
I'll definitely get rid of her this time.

264
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,860
[Jiang's Residence]

265
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,850
Second Lady,

266
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,180
I got a letter from home.

267
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,100
There's news about Miss Haitang

268
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,770
you asked me to find.

269
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,650
Sit down first.

270
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,250
Okay.

271
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,180
Miss Haitang you're looking for
is from the rice shop in the village.

272
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,770
She worked as a maid
for a lady in an official family

273
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,370
and left for many years.

274
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,700
Not long ago, there appeared
a woman in the village.

275
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,820
But she has a long cut

276
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,980
on her cheek,

277
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,650
and the flesh is all exposed,

278
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,700
it's horrible.

279
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,530
I'm not sure
if she's the one you're looking for.

280
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,180
Does anyone else know about
what I asked you to do?

281
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,340
Don't worry, Second Lady.

282
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,010
I've already told

283
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,250
my sister-in-law as you instructed me

284
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,220
and the woman's not alerted.

285
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,250
I'll get a hot pot of tea.

286
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,010
Okay.

287
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,650
Lady Xue.

288
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:02,980
Haitang.

289
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,770
Why are you here?

290
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,770
I'll take you out.

291
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,770
What did they do to you?

292
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,580
Shen's Residence is a hell.

293
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,220
I'm going to get you out of here.

294
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,700
Leave me alone.

295
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,250
Find a way to send a message to Xue Zhao

296
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,730
so he will come and save me.

297
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,340
Lady Xue.

298
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,130
Go now.

299
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,850
Don't fight them.

300
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,580
Wait Young Master to get here.

301
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,820
Don't worry.

302
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,460
Go now.

303
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,490
But she has a long cut

304
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,130
on her cheek.

305
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,460
I wonder what happened to her.

306
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,300
When in need,

307
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,490
blow this whistle

308
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,490
and my men will appear to protect you.

309
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,060
It doesn't seem to be working.

310
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,940
Second Lady, what do you want me to do?

311
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,370
Come here.

312
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,650
Put it this way. Put it on the ground.

313
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,420
One pot over here,

314
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,460
one pot over here. Do you understand?

315
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,820
Aren't you the gardener?

316
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,370
What's your name?

317
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,340
My name is Zhao Ke.

318
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,650
Zhao Ke?

319
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,250
How long have you been
at Jiang's Residence?

320
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,980
Since your master

321
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,850
has told me of your existence,

322
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,300
he must have expected me
to ask you this question.

323
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,010
Just tell me.

324
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,370
I assure you he will not
chastise you for it.

325
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,770
I came here seven years ago.

326
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,980
Seven years ago?

327
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,180
It seems every move I make

328
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,100
in this compound

329
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,980
is in his sights.

330
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,180
Do you have any instructions?

331
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,890
I want you to find out

332
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,650
where Ji Shuran went

333
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,530
and who she met.

334
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,490
Yes.

335
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,940
Besides,

336
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,460
I want you to take someone back
to the capital for me.

337
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,250
But my master only asked me
to keep you safe.

338
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,250
The person I asked you to find

339
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,370
is a threat to my safety

340
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,650
if she falls into someone else's hands.

341
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,180
I got it.

342
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,700
You mean

343
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,980
you've been trying

344
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,770
to get rid of Jiang Li
and Jiang Yue for me?

345
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,700
Ji Shuran,

346
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,220
I've told you before

347
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,530
that you won't get a good ending.

348
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,850
It's only a matter of time

349
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,090
before my Li reveals all the misdeeds

350
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,660
you've done.

351
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,740
I can help you get rid of Jiang Li,

352
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,250
it's all up to you.

353
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,530
Madam Ji,

354
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,460
the carriage and gifts are ready.

355
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,980
Madam Ji,

356
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,770
you don't have to force it

357
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,810
if it's difficult.

358
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,140
If the choice

359
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,420
has been made,

360
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,770
we must go all the way to the end.

361
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,940
[Ji's Residence]

362
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,250
You want to see me

363
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,530
now that you've messed up
the marriage with the Qi family?

364
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,090
I'm about to retire,

365
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,860
and I want Qi Wenbin to fill my post.

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,330
will bring benefits and no harm.

368
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,290
But now,

369
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,530
the marriage is broken off,
and we've offended the Qi family.

370
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,770
You've ruined such a good plan.

371
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,940
Father, you still can't change

372
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,250
your habit of finding fault in others.

373
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,770
I like to find fault?

374
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,460
You're the one who's caused me
the most trouble in the Ji family.

375
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:42,700
You chose

376
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,770
to elope with that poor painter

377
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,330
instead of going down the path
of riches that I arranged for you.

378
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,500
If I hadn't brought you back,

379
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,290
how could you be who you are today?

380
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,180
You're not thankful,

381
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,570
and you dare to doubt me?

382
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,570
If you come near my daughter again,

383
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,090
I'll let you die without a grave.

384
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,660
It's all my fault.

385
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,980
Please spare his life.

386
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,440
Remember what happens to him.

387
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,730
If you ever disobey me again,

388
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,730
I'll ruin

389
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,660
any man you love.

390
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,980
If I didn't do that,

391
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,810
how could you have become
the Grand Chancellor's wife now?

392
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,180
Father, have you forgotten

393
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,810
how I became
the Grand Chancellor's wife?

394
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,130
At that time,

395
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,770
you were going
to sell me to a silly man.

396
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,050
You told me

397
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,810
to be patient,

398
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,460
to marry a fool,

399
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,710
and in a few years, I would
control Marquis's Residence,

400
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,470
after having a child.

401
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,020
Then, I'll enjoy
all the riches and honor.

402
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,950
You said it was better than

403
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,740
marrying a painter with nothing.

404
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,530
I begged you on my knees
and told you I wouldn't marry him.

405
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,740
You said you wanted me to marry him

406
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,460
unless I found someone better.

407
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,260
Didn't you find someone better?

408
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,260
Shuran,

409
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,660
it's been hard on you.

410
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,580
You have to come here every day
to keep me who's sickly company.

411
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,990
We're like sisters.

412
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,950
I'll stay with you

413
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,190
until you're better.

414
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,190
I'll be going.

415
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
I'll come back tomorrow to see you.

416
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,020
Grand Chancellor Jiang, don't worry.

417
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,260
Mrs. Jiang is getting better.

418
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,090
You don't agree with the marriage
I've arranged for you

419
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,610
and you can't marry
into the Jiang family,

420
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,900
so what else can you do?

421
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,660
Zhenzhen is getting better now.

422
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,990
It's not something
I could have predicted.

423
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,630
Illnesses tend to flare up again.

424
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,990
If you make her condition worse,

425
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,470
you can marry into the Jiang family.

426
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,020
How can I do that?

427
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,780
Now you have two choices.

428
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,740
Either you marry that silly man,

429
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,190
or you do something

430
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,500
to become Jiang Yuanbai's wife.

431
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,990
I think you know how to choose.

432
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,100
It's you who turned me

433
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,780
into what I am today step by step.

434
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,260
Father, I should be thanking you

435
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,990
for making me inherit your viciousness,

436
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,390
for making me always want
to harm others when something happens,

437
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,230
and ultimately for putting me
against enemies on all sides.

438
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,820
Your problem

439
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,180
is that you are not vicious

440
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,020
and cruel enough.

441
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,260
I thought you'd improved by killing

442
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,740
Jiang Yuanbai's wife.

443
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,150
But when I told you to kill Aunt Hu,

444
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,710
you said it's fine.

445
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,340
When I told you to kill Jiang Li,

446
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,290
you said she couldn't make a fuss.

447
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,290
Now that they've started
to mess with you,

448
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,940
are you feeling good?

449
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,810
You're right.

450
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,670
I'm not viscous enough.

451
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,580
So now that I've figured it out

452
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,740
I should have been more vicious.

453
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,990
Why should I have to
suffer all the consequences?

454
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,100
What do you mean?

455
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,100
Father,

456
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,470
doesn't this tea

457
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,910
make you feel sleepy?

458
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,540
Father,

459
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
it's the finest tea,

460
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,100
please try it.

461
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,870
You... What are you trying to do?

462
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,870
Liu Wencai is back.

463
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,740
He's back to help you
teach me to be cruel.

464
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,300
What?

465
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,630
He said

466
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,820
he could help me get rid of Jiang Li.

467
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,950
[Moral Excellence]
But

468
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,770
he wants me to help him

469
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,020
take his revenge first.

470
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,570
Your father nearly beat me to death

471
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,370
and broke my fingers

472
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,220
so I could never hold a brush.

473
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,530
Now I want him to break an arm

474
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,290
and kowtow to me in person to apologise

475
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,500
for what he did.

476
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,290
What?

477
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,290
Break an arm?

478
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,530
Is that why you came back for me?

479
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,370
Didn't you say I wasn't cruel enough?

480
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,130
Now I can be cruel.

481
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,020
All it takes is one of your arms

482
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,530
and a kowtow.

483
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,370
Who is he

484
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,770
to make me break my arm

485
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,020
and kowtow?

486
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,900
Is he worthy?

487
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,850
Yes, he is.

488
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,500
He is now Imperial Diviner
from Office of Imperial Diviner.

489
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,330
He's just an eighth-rank
Imperial Diviner.

490
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,770
Should I be afraid of him?

491
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,500
He's backed by Princess Wanning.

492
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,090
Not to mention that Imperial Diviner
is in charge of royal divination.

493
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,660
It's not a high ranking position,

494
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,530
but he can enter Imperial Court.

495
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,610
So what?

496
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,770
My daughter is the most favoured
concubine in the palace.

497
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,570
So you've survived this long

498
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,850
because of your two daughters.

499
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,570
How dare you think
we're not cruel enough?

500
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,770
I'll show you how cruel I am today.

501
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,630
I'll break your arm

502
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,020
and drag you to Liu Wencai's door.

503
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,260
Liu Wencai disappeared
for so many years,

504
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,340
and now he's suddenly come to us

505
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,150
as Imperial Diviner.

506
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,950
Who knows what he's up to?

507
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,850
You can't be fooled by him.

508
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,770
I'm your father,

509
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,850
your own father who gave birth to you
and raised you.

510
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,900
Shuran.

511
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,220
Shuran.

512
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,570
Shuran.

513
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,330
Shuran.

514
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,180
Listen to me.

515
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,460
Shuran.

516
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,610
When your mother passed away,

517
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,980
in order to raise you and your sister,

518
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,850
I didn't even think of marrying again,

519
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,740
lest you should suffer.

520
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,740
How can you break

521
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,020
your father's arm

522
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,950
just to deal with a girl?

523
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,910
My good daughter,

524
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,060
you can't be so confused.

525
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,150
Shuran.

526
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,580
Shuran.

527
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,430
Looks like I'm going
to let you down again.

528
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,630
I still can't be as cruel as

529
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,630
you want me to be.

530
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,740
Guards.

531
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,430
Guards!

532
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,340
[Jiang Family Ancestral Temple]

533
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,470
We're almost there.

534
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,740
What a crazy woman.

535
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,910
Why are you keeping

536
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,300
all these things?

537
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:57,780
Give it to me.

538
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,740
Just throw it.

539
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,740
No.

540
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,340
Give it to me.

541
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,100
My Yue.

542
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,470
Give it back to me.

543
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,150
- Give it to me.
- Give it to me now.

544
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,580
What do you need this for?

545
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,100
- Throw it.
- Give it to me.

546
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,870
Don't touch these dead people's stuff.

547
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,060
What a bad luck.

548
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,230
- No.
- Give it to me.

549
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:11,820
Don't steal my Yue.

550
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,990
You keep such dead people's stuff
every day.

551
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:13,710
Is this how

552
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,260
you treat your madam?

553
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,300
Second Lady.

554
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,390
You still know the rules
of Jiang's Residence?

555
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,950
Second Lady, you've got it wrong.

556
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,910
Aunt Hu was hysterical.

557
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,580
That's why I tried to stop her.

558
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,670
If I know you're treating
your madam like this again,

559
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,500
I'll send you back to Jiang's Residence

560
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,710
and praise you in front of Old Madam.

561
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,470
Second Lady, please forgive me.

562
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,870
I know I was wrong.

563
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,950
Help your madam into the house.

564
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,470
Yes.

565
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,540
Aunt Hu.

566
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,430
Aunt Hu.

567
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,710
Aunt Hu, let's go.

568
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,910
My Yue.

569
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,470
My Yue.

570
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,950
Yue, don't be afraid.

571
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:57,820
Don't be afraid.

572
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,500
You've messed up
our ancestral blessed land like this.

573
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,870
The monthly payment
has been sent on time.

574
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,470
But you don't even put up
a charcoal fire in the middle of winter,

575
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,190
and you don't even replace
the broken window paper.

576
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,950
I should ask you for the accounts.

577
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,300
Yes, we have everything here.

578
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,230
But Aunt Hu doesn't feel cold,

579
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,780
which is why
she doesn't need the charcoal.

580
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,500
I've brought some tonic for Aunt Hu.

581
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:17,710
Tong,

582
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,190
teach her how to serve her madam.

583
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,150
Yes.

584
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,230
Let's go.

585
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,260
Yue, don't be afraid.

586
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,150
Yue, don't be afraid.

587
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,670
Yue,

588
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,870
don't be afraid.

589
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:38,910
Aunt Hu,

590
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,190
they've left.

591
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,780
We can have a heart-to-heart chat.

592
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,100
My Yue feels cold.

593
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,100
She feels cold.

594
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:49,910
She feels cold.

595
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,780
Yue.

596
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,780
This is the only time I'm here.

597
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,950
Are you sure you want
to keep pretending?

598
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,500
What did you come to see me for?

599
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,430
You're not here to catch up, are you?

600
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,910
I want to hear about
the story of you and Yue.

601
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,060
What do you know?

602
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,950
By asking that,

603
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,060
It means there's something else

604
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,580
behind Yue's death.

605
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,190
If you're here to talk to me about this,

606
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,540
I have nothing to say.

607
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,020
I don't mean to disturb you.

608
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,150
Once you and my mother
were good friends.

609
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,100
I remember you always
hugged me when I was little,

610
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,300
and Yue was very kind to me.

611
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,340
That is why

612
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,230
I don't remember much of what happened

613
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,710
when I left Jiang's Residence
for so long,

614
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,820
but I still feel very close to you
when I see you.

615
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,230
Since you don't want to tell your story,

616
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,390
I'll tell you mine.

617
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,630
I was wronged as a child,

618
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,950
abandoned by my family

619
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,710
and sent to Qingcheng Mountain
for ten years.

620
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,230
Qingcheng Mountain
is colder than this place.

621
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,950
I'd been left alone for ten years,

622
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,870
I'd learned about people's cruelty

623
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,990
and I didn't see a ray of hope.

624
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,540
But I don't want
to resign to my destiny.

625
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,260
If it's my destiny,

626
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,260
I'll go against it

627
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,670
because it's not my fault,

628
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,780
so I won't bow down.

629
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,820
Why should those who do evil

630
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,260
be exalted

631
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,500
and those who suffer be bowed down

632
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,780
and thank for not killing them?

633
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,020
That's why I had to come down
from the mountain

634
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,780
and return to the capital

635
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,910
to appear in front of the people.

636
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,500
Aunt Hu,

637
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,670
you fake hysteria and survive.

638
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,060
But you've been suffering from the pain

639
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,910
of your daughter's death every day.

640
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,260
What's the difference
between you living and dying now?

641
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,780
If you're as wronged as I am,

642
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,390
I hope you'll come forward.

643
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,820
I will help you

644
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,990
and I'm capable of helping you, too.

645
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,300
That's all I have to say.

646
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,990
I won't bother you anymore.

647
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,740
My Yue was killed.

648
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:35,780
My...

649
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,910
- My Yue was killed!
- Be careful.

650
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,820
Second Lady,

651
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,230
Yue was killed!

652
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,190
She was killed!

653
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,340
Second Lady, please help Yue
to redress the injustice!

654
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,940
[Office of Imperial Diviner]

655
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,950
I've been waiting for you for so long.

656
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,020
Why are you here alone?

657
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,740
What are you doing?

658
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,340
Don't you want my father
to kneel down and apologise?

659
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,580
I'll kneel for him.

660
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,260
I think you've got it wrong.

661
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,260
I want him to break an arm

662
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,150
and kowtow to me and apologise.

663
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,260
I'll take it for him.

664
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,020
Do it.

665
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
What about your debt?

666
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,230
Have you forgotten the fire you set?

667
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,060
Do you mean you want me
to give you my life?

668
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,710
You owe me

669
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,630
more than a life.

670
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,870
The Taoist priest said
my nature is extremely yin,

671
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,950
if I follow him,

672
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,150
I'll achieve great things in the future.

673
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,190
He taught me
how to exorcise evil spirits,

674
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,580
took care of me,

675
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,150
and provided me with food and drink.

676
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,230
I think this is probably
Heaven's way of compensating me.

677
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,950
But I didn't expect

678
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,390
the greater torture to begin.

679
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,630
It's part of the practice.

680
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,060
If you can't take it,

681
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,150
you can get lost.

682
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,390
I've been through the pain of burning,

683
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,470
so this is nothing.

684
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,470
He said that other people's exorcisms

685
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,340
only drive away evil spirits
from their bodies.

686
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,100
But his exorcism

687
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,740
is to transfer the evil spirits to me,

688
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,500
who has been reborn from fire,

689
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,780
and destroy them completely.

690
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,710
The more I am drenched in blood,

691
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,740
the more my flesh is smeared,

692
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,950
the more the nobles believe in us.

693
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,150
After all, no one

694
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,780
can hurt himself as much as me.

695
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,430
Hence, the nobles are willing
to pay more for it.

696
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,150
As words spread,

697
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,630
we gained popularity in the capital

698
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,990
and even met Eldest Princess.

699
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,430
I like people like you
who are willing to give it all.

700
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,020
There's a vacancy
in Office of Imperial Diviner.

701
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,430
I can give this position to one person.

702
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,820
You guys talk it over.

703
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,580
I prefer the one who's ruthless.

704
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,630
Don't you want to die long ago?

705
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,870
Then, I'll send you to hell.

706
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,340
I'll pray for you every day from now on.

707
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,990
But since I've decided to live,

708
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,780
I won't die easily.

709
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,700
Under the support of Eldest Princess,

710
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,620
I have become Imperial Diviner.

711
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,180
Do you think your life could compensate

712
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,140
for what happened to me?

713
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,990
I had no choice.

714
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,060
I was already married

715
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:27,910
and had Ruoyao.

716
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,470
When my father found out about you,

717
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,500
I begged him

718
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,220
to let me see you one last time.

719
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,310
There's no need to bring up the past.

720
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:43,060
Let me think about how I can
make you pay back some interest.

721
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,830
Do you know why I want
to get rid of Jiang Li?

722
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,980
I don't want to know.

[Office of Imperial Diviner]

724
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,940
It wasn't an accident that Yue fell off

725
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,500
the false mountain.

726
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,340
From the day
Ji married into the Jiang family,

727
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,380
I felt something was wrong with her.

728
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,900
It's so beautiful.

729
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,250
So this is Jiang Yue, First Lady Jiang.

730
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,090
She's so adorable.

731
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,420
Although she seemed gentle and generous,

732
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,380
she's good to Yue,

733
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,650
I just don't think

734
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,020
she's as simple as she seemed.

735
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,570
I wanted Yue to stay away from her,

736
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,020
but I didn't expect something
to still happen.

737
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,460
Yue, let me play for a while.

738
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,650
No, I won't give it to you.

739
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,940
- I won't give it to you.
- Let me play for a while.

740
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,500
[Little Jiang Ruoyao]
Yue, let me play for a while.

741
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,650
[Jiang Yue]
I won't let you play.

742
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,340
Yue, let me play for a while.

743
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:10,940
Stand up.

744
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,020
Don't cry.

745
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,130
If you want it, go get it yourself.

746
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:27,980
Give it to me.

747
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,530
My mother made this for me.

748
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,610
Don't cry.

749
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,820
I won't give it to you.

750
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,420
Ji Shuran asked Ms. Sun

751
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,090
to take Yue to the false mountain

752
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,940
to make it look like Yue
had fallen from the false mountain

753
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,980
and lost her life,

754
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,820
trying to make it look like Ji Shuran
had nothing to do with it.

755
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,210
My Yue

756
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,730
died at Ji Shuran's hands.

757
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,020
You weren't at the scene.

758
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,530
How did you find out?

759
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,900
My former maid's name was Baoqin.

760
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,690
That day, she was following Yue.

761
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,170
She went to the kitchen
to get sweet soup for the kids.

762
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,860
When she came back, she heard

763
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,780
Ji Shuran ordering Ms. Sun
to do something

764
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,300
so she came back
and told me immediately.

765
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,980
Where's Baoqin?

766
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,940
She was made the scapegoat.

767
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,420
After Yue's death,

768
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,340
Ji Shuran kicked her out
of Jiang's Residence

769
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,900
by saying that she hadn't
taken care of Yue well,

770
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,340
and there was
no trace of her ever again.

771
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,170
You knew about it then,

772
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,210
why didn't you
testify against Ji Shuran?

773
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,530
Testify against her?

774
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,050
Second Lady, you've been back
in Jiang's Residence for so long,

775
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,820
why would you ask me
something like that?

776
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,420
You should know better than me

777
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,900
what the Jiang family is like.

778
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,050
Just like when you were sent
to Zhennyu Hall,

779
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,090
didn't you defend yourself?

780
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,940
Didn't you testify against Ji Shuran?

781
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,940
Did anyone believe a word you said?

782
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,460
Ji Shuran said I was hysterical

783
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,020
because I lost Yue,

784
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,460
and that's why I accused her,

785
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,130
slandered her.

786
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,130
She's good,

787
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,050
she made herself innocent,

788
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:25,780
and had a reputation as a virtuous woman
who pitied the weak and the poor.

789
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,090
And I

790
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,300
became the one who's unreasonable.

791
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,210
If Old Madam hadn't considered our bond

792
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,210
and defended me,

793
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,860
I'd have been sent to Zhennyu Hall.

794
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,650
Later, I obeyed Ji Shuran

795
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,340
and pretended to be hysterical.

796
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,730
The Jiangs couldn't keep me
in the residence,

797
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,730
so they sent me here,

798
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,210
and I managed to survive.

799
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:02,780
And not a single person
in the entire Jiang family suspected her?

800
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,530
She's Madam Ji,

801
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,210
Master Jiang's wife.

802
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,170
She's gentle, generous,

803
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,610
and virtuous.

804
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,130
Who would believe that she would kill

805
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,130
a concubine's daughter
who didn't get in her way?

806
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,050
Even if someone found it strange,

807
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,090
the Ji family was flourishing
at that time,

808
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,250
and there was a favored Consort Li
to support the family,

809
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,860
who would offend the Ji family

810
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,340
for a dead person?

811
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,050
Second Lady,

812
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,090
you're in the Jiang family too.

813
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,340
You know better than I do

814
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,380
whether they value favors or profits.

815
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,250
Evil has its retribution.

816
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,900
I'll definitely seek justice for Yue.

817
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,300
Greetings, Mother.

818
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,250
If you're out in this rain,

819
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,860
you must be on an important errand.

820
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,500
I bet you're on an important errand, too.

821
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,530
Nothing's important to me.

822
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,650
It's all about you kids.

823
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,900
Sorry to have troubled you.

824
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:30,980
Mother,

825
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,860
you should mind

826
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,210
your own business when you have time.

827
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,340
As a mother,

828
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,730
the children's business comes first.

829
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,050
Li, go in quickly.

830
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,820
Don't let the wind and rain freeze you.

831
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,130
Mother,

832
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,050
please.

833
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:27,780
Madam Ji.

834
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,020
What's the matter?

835
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,860
A servant reported

836
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,500
that Jiang Li went to Aunt Hu's place.

837
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,780
The two of them talked for a long time
with the door closed.

838
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,130
Aunt Hu didn't behave madly.

839
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,690
It seems she wants
to settle old scores with me this time.

840
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,570
Aunt Hu

841
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,780
has been pretending to be crazy
for so many years,

842
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,050
it's really hard for her.

843
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,460
Shall we put Aunt Hu...

844
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,380
Jiang Li has found her,

845
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,900
so she'll be watched.

846
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,780
A woman who killed
her mother and brother,

847
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,940
a crazy aunt.

848
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,820
If they're involved,

849
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,940
they'll be the ones in deep trouble.

850
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,250
Third Lady,

851
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,980
time to get up and eat.

852
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,610
Madam Ji has prepared
some calming soup for you.

853
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,900
Get up and have some.

854
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,050
Ms. Sun,

855
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,050
you...

856
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:01,980
Third Lady,

857
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,460
it's all for your own good.

858
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,940
When you wake up,

859
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,210
everything will be fine.

860
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,340
What have you done?

861
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,170
What have you done to me?

862
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,820
What have you done?

863
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,500
Say it!

864
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,780
Third Lady has gone mad!

865
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,730
Third Lady has gone mad!

866
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,820
It's all for your own good.

867
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,090
Third Lady.

868
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,380
Third Lady, I'm doing this
for your own good.

869
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,900
What did the physician say?

870
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,300
Several physicians have examined her,

871
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,690
but they all say
there's nothing wrong with her pulse,

872
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,090
and there's been no symptoms.

873
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,650
They couldn't tell us

874
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,460
why a healthy person

875
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,900
would suddenly be in such a state.

876
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,420
Master Jiang,

877
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,690
forgive me for speaking out of turn.

878
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,420
Third Lady looks like...

879
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:22,570
She looks like

880
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,780
someone who's been possessed
by an evil spirit in my hometown.

881
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:28,300
Ms. Sun,

882
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,500
what nonsense are you talking about?

883
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,530
I brought up Third Lady.

884
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,940
She's in such a state now,

885
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,020
I wouldn't talk nonsense.

886
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,090
It's my own stupid idea,

887
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,420
but since ancient times,

888
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,380
many people

889
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,050
have died in this way for no reason.

890
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:45,900
Master Jiang,

891
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,980
let's get someone to check Third Lady.

892
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,780
But where can we find

893
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,300
such an expert in the capital?

894
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,860
Don't talk nonsense

895
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,460
about strange powers.

896
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,380
Ruoyao has no other symptoms.

897
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:01,130
Don't get a shaman here

898
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,460
and cause rumors to spread.

899
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,650
What about my Yao?

900
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:13,650
Possessed by an evil spirit?

901
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,690
Ruoyao's condition is strange.

902
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,500
It's good to try it.

903
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,570
Since you've decided it,

904
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,610
just listen to her.

905
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,380
I'm going to write a letter
to Imperial Diviner now.

906
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,500
Mother, take good care of yourself.

907
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,780
You'd better stay home for a few days.

908
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,250
Don't worry.

909
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:49,690
Old Madam,

910
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,690
do you believe in
what happens to Third Lady?

911
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,170
Strange powers are of heaven and earth.

912
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,380
I can't see it.

913
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,870
But if it's the doing of humans,

914
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,740
we'll figure it out eventually.

915
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:19,990
Tell Grand Chancellor Jiang

916
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,620
that I'll be there tomorrow.

917
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:22,430
Yes.

918
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,910
There's a ghost.

919
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,140
Jiang Li, there's a ghost.

920
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,350
There's a ghost.

921
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,140
What's wrong?

922
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,310
Where's the ghost?

923
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,260
You know what?

924
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,540
Something big has happened.

925
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,060
Jiang Ruoyao has been possessed
by an evil spirit.

926
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,340
Imperial Diviner is invited

927
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,540
to exorcise it.

928
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,570
Imperial Diviner?

929
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,570
Imperial Diviner is very strange.

930
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,500
It's true what they say
about royal family are merciless.

931
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,740
What's going on
in Imperial Court these days?

932
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,030
There's been

933
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,350
a lot of deaths in the harem.

934
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,470
One day a maid dies,

935
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,740
the next day an eunuch.

936
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,180
It's all over the palace,

937
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,580
saying there's an evil spirit
in the palace.

938
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:16,990
After that,

939
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,470
- Evil spirit.
- Imperial Diviner's asked to exorcise.

940
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,180
Imperial Diviner said

941
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,830
the evil spirit possessed a consort.

942
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,510
His Majesty showed no mercy

943
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,470
and granted her
poisoned liquor immediately.

944
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,430
Rumor has it that the poor consort

945
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,350
didn't even have a chance
to defend herself

946
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,140
and was...

947
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,700
Do you think Imperial Diviner
will catch the evil spirit

948
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,220
in our house?

949
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:40,740
Since he's here,

950
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,220
they won't return empty-handed.

951
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,060
They?

952
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,430
Do you really think
Jiang Ruoyao is possessed?

953
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:49,100
I got it.

954
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,990
According to you,

955
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,740
Ji Shuran is too cruel.

956
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,540
She's using her own daughter.

957
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,910
Who else can be the evil spirit
in the whole Jiang family

958
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:57,830
but you?

959
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,870
I'm ready
to be the evil spirit this time.
