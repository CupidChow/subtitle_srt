00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,800
with my life

186
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,230
but I must

187
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,200
protect the Shen family.

188
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,750
So, in your opinion,

189
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,920
the crimes of your mother
and your sister do not need to be atoned

190
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,630
while my innocence and grievance
do not need to be compensated.

191
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,590
Right?

192
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,320
Sorry.

193
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,710
Fine.

194
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,590
Shen Yurong, you won't choose this path.

195
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,990
You've let me down once again.

196
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,590
You can keep being obsessed.

197
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,230
Just wait until the day

198
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,800
when I serve you and Wanning's karma
right in your faces.

199
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,320
You will never win against Wanning.

200
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,110
She has Lord Cheng to support her.

201
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,510
I'm not like you.

202
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,500
You're a coward!

203
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,290
I'm reminding you.

204
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,170
That's not necessary.

205
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,220
Li, listen to me.

206
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,980
Let go, Shen Yurong!

207
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,170
Let go!

208
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,140
Let go of me!

209
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,860
Let go of me, Shen Yurong!

210
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,570
Are you all right?

211
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,690
I'm fine.

212
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,460
I noticed you've left for a long time

213
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,650
so I came to find you
because I was worried.

214
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,100
I didn't expect him to...

215
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,220
He's still breathing. It should be fine.

216
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,980
I'll go and find a physician.

217
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,220
Shijie,

218
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
leave this matter alone.

219
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,900
I'll deal with it.

220
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,070
Why?

221
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,830
I saw him trying to hurt you just now.

222
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,660
He was trying to hurt me indeed.

223
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,020
That was why I knocked him out.

224
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,310
I did it.

225
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,540
Shen Yurong has Eldest Princess Wanning
to support him.

226
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,950
If you bear Wanning's grudge
because of this,

227
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,900
you and the Ye family
will face huge trouble.

228
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,430
Listen to me. Wanning and I
have a grudge against each other.

229
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,110
This won't make a difference.

230
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,140
How can I push the blame

231
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,260
onto you?

232
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,380
To be honest, I was planning to hit him.

233
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,950
You just did what I wanted.

234
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,830
Moreover,
if you are not involved in this,

235
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,100
you'll be able to help me
from the shadows better.

236
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,020
I can also help you in public.

237
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,260
This is my personal grudge.

238
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,260
I know.

239
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,190
You don't know.

240
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,580
Have you been falsely accused?

241
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,910
Has your reputation been sullied?

242
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,870
Have you been locked up
in the firewood storage?

243
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,670
Have you been buried alive?

244
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,340
Do you know

245
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,340
how many people died because of this?

246
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,580
Xue Fangfei.

247
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,580
I'm sincere in helping you.

248
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,780
Since you are clear about this,

249
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,430
listen to me and leave.

250
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,100
Otherwise, you'll be causing me trouble.

251
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,580
I beg you, Ye Shijie.

252
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,710
Mother.

253
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,910
Go and do your work.

254
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,100
This is terrible.

255
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,090
Yurong!

256
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,020
[Conceal the talent and draw no attention]
Cheers.

257
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,570
Yurong, where are you?

258
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,220
Yurong! Where are you?

259
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,850
Don't scare me!

260
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,740
What happened?

261
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,770
I don't know.

262
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,810
Yurong! Where are you?

263
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,460
Mother.

264
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,130
[Conceal the talent and draw no attention]
Let's take a look.

265
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,420
- Let's go.
- Let's take a look.

266
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,460
- Let's go.
- Mother!

267
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,020
Yurong!

268
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,980
Yurong!

269
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,780
Mother.

270
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,710
What's wrong?

271
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,870
Mr. Shen was going to defile me.

272
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,500
- What?
- That's...

273
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,340
Yurong! Let go of my son!

274
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,500
Return my son to me!

275
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,710
[Shen Residence]
Yurong, come back! Yurong!

276
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,260
Return my son to me! Let him go!

277
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,300
Don't go!

278
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,260
Catch her!

279
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,580
She injured my son!

280
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:07,990
Mother.

281
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,580
What are you doing?

282
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,340
Shen Yurong attempted
to hurt Jiang Li first.

283
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,150
He has been sent
to the Court of Judicial Review.

284
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,780
If you cause any more trouble,

285
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,470
he will never return.

286
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,630
You...

287
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,740
You...

288
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,780
Mother. Mother!

289
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,580
Mother!

290
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,190
Mother, wake up! Mother!

291
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,020
Mother!

292
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,460
[Shen's Residence]

293
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,500
Mother, wake up!

294
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,990
Mother.

295
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,580
[Shen's Residence]
Mother, wake up!

296
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,500
What's wrong, Madam?

297
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,260
Are you all right?

298
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,190
Mother, are you all right?

299
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,780
Madam.

300
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,740
[Jiang's Residence]

301
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,020
Jiang Li, you must be shocked.

302
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,670
Grandmother,

303
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,670
are ugly rumors being spread out there?

304
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,500
Will it affect the Jiang family?

305
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,150
A child of the Jiang family
met a scoundrel after all.

306
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,150
When your father knew about this,
he rushed back to the capital overnight.

307
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,150
Just rest
and don't think about anything.

308
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,390
Leave it to your family.

309
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,430
We must never let you
suffer this grievance for nothing.

310
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,580
Lie down and rest.

311
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,190
How do you plan to deal with this?

312
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,150
Li is the legitimate daughter
of the Jiang family.

313
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,060
Forget about how the Jiang family

314
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,260
is going to seek justice for her.

315
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,500
The Shen family

316
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,780
dared bully the Jiang family.

317
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,630
This incident

318
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,820
has spread everywhere in public.

319
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,910
You've wanted a reputation
your whole life

320
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,630
but your reputation

321
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,190
has been tarnished
by the Shen family now.

322
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,740
Can you really let this go?

323
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,150
Li has been abandoned
at Zhennyu Hall since young.

324
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,540
You haven't fulfilled your responsibility
as a father for all these years.

325
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,470
When she came back last year,
there was a lot of trouble.

326
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,780
You had little sympathy for her.

327
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,710
This time, you must think carefully.

328
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,910
Mother, you are right.

329
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,390
I was too suspicious back then.

330
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,260
I didn't know how much
it hurt my relationship with Jiang Li.

331
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,060
This time, I must
fulfill my responsibility as a father

332
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,300
and seek justice for my daughter.

333
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,060
Start a case!
I want to write a complaint for Li.

334
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,540
It has been a while.
You are looking pale.

335
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,740
It's all thanks to you, Your Majesty.

336
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,150
I have

337
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,670
learned a lot.

338
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,740
It's great
that you understand my intentions.

339
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,060
You will be released
from your confinement today.

340
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,230
Remember not to be so willful
in the future.

341
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,820
Speaking of which,
something happened recently.

342
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,630
I was so busy

343
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,820
that I neglected you.

344
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,190
What troubles you, Your Majesty?

345
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,950
the emperor of Great Zhao
came to Great Yan

346
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,230
to pick up his sister.

347
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,230
Coincidentally,

348
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,870
his sister met an assassin.

349
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,060
That's too much.

350
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,390
Was the assassin captured?

351
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,910
He escaped.

352
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,540
They are so rampant.

353
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,910
Allowing assassins to enter
and leave the capital as they wish.

354
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,780
Don't you think I'm angry?

355
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,260
It's bad when the emperor gets angry.

356
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,540
So, I abolished
the Capital Security Office

357
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,300
for hiding the assassin.

358
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,500
The Capital Security Office?

359
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,910
Yes. I'm curious as well.

360
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,230
Why would the Great Yan's
Capital Security Office

361
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,740
changed its leader in secret?

362
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,710
Wanning, help me think about this.

363
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,260
Is there someone

364
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,580
who doesn't want a friendly relationship
between Great Zhao and Great Yan?

365
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,060
Brother contributed in battles up north

366
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,430
and Your Majesty
has formed a pact with Great Zhao.

367
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,820
Stability in the North and South
is a blessing for Great Yan.

368
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,670
Why would someone destroy the peace?

369
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,100
You are right.

370
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,260
It is extremely foolish

371
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,990
for someone to cause trouble.

372
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,710
The alliance meeting is over.
Everything is set in stone.

373
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,990
Unfortunately,
you weren't present at the banquet

374
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,500
and missed Jiang and Shen's speech.

375
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:40,910
You said

376
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,540
Second Lady Jiang
was Shen Yurong's late wife.

377
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,870
Now that I think about it, it's sad.

378
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,740
Since Your Majesty said that,

379
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,430
it became a regret of mine.

380
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,950
It's quite regretful indeed.

381
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,990
Shen Yurong is awaiting his sentence
at the Court of Judicial Review.

382
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,580
His crime is an attempt
to rape Second Lady Jiang.

383
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,780
The performance at the banquet
was their last one.

384
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,820
Mr. Shen did something so filthy?

385
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,820
Yes. I'm quite surprised as well.

386
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,430
It's late.

387
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,190
You should go back to rest.

388
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,020
Thank you, Your Majesty.

389
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,910
Go to the Court of Judicial Review.

390
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,820
Yes.

391
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,220
[Court of Judicial Review]

392
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,430
Shen Yurong,

393
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,820
is this what you mean
by having a clear conscience?

394
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,990
To the point of wanting
to be intimate with her?

395
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,710
Are you not afraid to die?

396
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,470
Raise your head.

397
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,780
Why are you laughing?

398
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,990
Kill me.

399
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,260
What do you mean?

400
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,150
You always like

401
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,870
to look down at me from above.

402
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,430
You knew I was hiding my crime

403
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,230
yet you still want to control me.

404
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,580
I'm sick of it.
Aren't you tired as well, Your Highness?

405
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,020
I killed my wife
for my mother's and my sister's sake.

406
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,990
For power,

407
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,780
I tainted the reputation
I obtained from studying hard.

408
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,910
I deserve this.

409
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,150
Are you blaming me again?

410
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,670
I'm not blaming Your Highness.
I'm not blaming anyone.

411
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,340
I hope Your Highness can live on

412
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,500
and spare my mother and my sister.

413
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,390
As for myself,
if Your Highness doesn't kill me,

414
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,230
you may wait until I'm sentenced

415
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,190
to banishment,

416
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,820
execution,

417
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,870
or lifelong imprisonment.

418
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,430
I'll accept it.

419
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,910
What kind of crazy talk is this?

420
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,150
Do you want me to pity you?

421
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,740
Feel sorry for you?

422
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,390
Save you?

423
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,300
Your Highness,
you don't need to save me.

424
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,950
You've fooled me for so long.
I'm sure you are bored of it.

425
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,670
I'm not bored.

426
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,950
Have you accepted your fate?

427
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,630
Shen Yurong, in this world,

428
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,060
I'm the only one
who can decide how you die.

429
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,260
The imperial court is nothing.

430
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,260
Your life is in my hands.

431
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,340
What do you want to do?

432
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,740
Naturally,

433
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,100
I'm going to save you.

434
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,780
You're still not resting
so late at night?

435
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,390
Did you fly back from Great Zhao?

436
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,630
You came to find me at this time.

437
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,230
Aren't you afraid
that someone might see you?

438
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,670
Tea.

439
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,260
What is your next step?

440
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,470
Do you remember when I asked you

441
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,190
which brick in the capital

442
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,540
that Shen Yurong
and Eldest Princess are standing on?

443
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,100
I thought Shen Yurong could repent

444
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,740
but I never expected him to be stubborn.

445
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,470
Right now,

446
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,580
I want to use Shen Yurong
as my pawn to find that brick.

447
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,990
I want to expose

448
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,870
their filthy relationship to the public.

449
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,910
Do you think Wanning
will save Shen Yurong?

450
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,020
If she doesn't save him, she will lose.

451
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,540
An arrogant person
like Princess Wanning

452
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,060
will fall into this trap.

453
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,230
Do you think you are amazing?

454
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,100
What's with you?

455
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,260
Is sacrificing both your reputation

456
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,710
and his future

457
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,300
a win for you?

458
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,780
Xiao Heng,

459
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,920
I'm not as shallow as you imagined.

460
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,470
I want to give Shen Yurong
another way out.

461
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,630
I wanted to see

462
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,060
if his conscience still existed
and confessed to his crimes

463
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,950
when I was being harmed.

464
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,190
I never expected him
to still reject me in the end.

465
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,060
I figured I was wasting my energy

466
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,780
and wanted to give up

467
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,630
but he wouldn't let me go.

468
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,100
It made Ye Shijie misunderstand

469
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,430
and knocked him out.

470
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,150
The Ye family is Jiang Li's family.

471
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,710
It is also my family.

472
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,710
I can't get them involved

473
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,230
because of me.

474
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,710
So, I must admit
to the crime of beating him.

475
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,820
So, he did attempt to harm you.

476
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,740
Otherwise,
you'd be the one in prison today!

477
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,430
Yes.

478
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,820
You promised me twice
not to use yourself as bait.

479
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,100
This is the second time
you have broken your promise.

480
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,580
It was not my intention this time.

481
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,580
I was forced to do it in that situation.

482
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,910
Li,

483
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,710
what should I do with you?

484
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,260
No matter what,

485
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,300
I need to apologize to you.

486
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,340
You told me

487
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,950
we would face the same end.

488
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,780
On one hand, I know
you are responsible for your kingdom

489
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,580
and on the other,
you care about my safety.

490
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,340
Right now, I'm willing
to enter this set-up of yours.

491
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,710
I'm not a liability. I want to help you.

492
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,630
Lady Jiang,
Wen Jifei asked me to tell you

493
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,490
that the lord knows what happened

494
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,820
and rushed here from the border

495
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,340
after abandoning
the Great Zhao's envoy group.

496
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:23,950
I know.

497
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,390
He was still wearing
the same outfit he wore when he left.

498
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,910
Your Highness, Lord Cheng
asked me to send a message.

499
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,260
Shen Yurong's reputation is ruined.

500
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,430
If you save him now,

501
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,740
you might dirty your hands.

502
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,580
You should kill him soon

503
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,870
and make it look like a suicide.

504
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,260
He's panicking after a small issue.

505
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,870
Brother is still so impatient.

506
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,190
Tell him to train his troops well.

507
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,340
I'll manage things
in the imperial court.

508
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:17,710
Yes.

509
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,390
Xue Fangfei,
it's time for me to meet you.

510
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,260
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]

511
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,950
How do you plan
to deal with Shen Yurong?

512
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,950
That depends on
what the Jiang family wants.

513
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,670
The Jiang family won't forgive him.

514
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,020
That suits me.

515
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,340
I want to see how Wanning will react.

516
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,910
Second Lady Jiang is a capable person.

517
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,260
Unfortunately, she is not a man.

518
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,670
Otherwise, she can be utilized
by the imperial court.

519
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,150
Your Majesty, have you considered

520
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,470
that her life might be in danger
if she keeps going down this path?

521
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,500
It was fine if you only

522
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,580
urged her to approach Shen Yurong

523
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,060
but you even got Eldest Princess
to add fuel to the fire later.

524
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,260
Have you considered

525
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,950
that she might not be able

526
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,190
to handle
Eldest Princess's counterattack?

527
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,950
She's just a pawn.
Why are you getting nervous?

528
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,830
She's no longer a pawn.

529
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,350
Xiao Heng.

530
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,340
[Govern the people, serve Heaven]

531
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,390
You fell for her.

532
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,350
Yes.

533
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,700
I warned you not to get too attached.

534
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,060
Have you forgotten

535
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,540
the path that we are walking?

536
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,910
What if I say

537
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,390
I must sacrifice her

538
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,310
to achieve our ambitions?

539
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,140
Your Majesty, do you still remember
when you first attended the audience?

540
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,470
[Prosperous Era]

541
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,140
Why isn't His Majesty here yet?

542
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,430
He doesn't attend his first audience.

543
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,430
Can he become a good emperor?

544
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,870
Your Majesty!

545
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,790
Where are you, Your Majesty?

546
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,990
- Your Majesty!
- He's not here.

547
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,470
Let's go and look for him over there.

548
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,030
Let's go.

549
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,990
They are looking for you.

550
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,260
If I leave,

551
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,990
[Young Emperor Hongxiao]

552
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,580
the bird can't live anymore.

553
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,430
It's your first audience.

554
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,350
If you are not around,
they'll be confused.

555
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,870
Come. Let me help you
put it back on the tree.

556
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,510
I know.

557
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,870
They are not really convinced by me.

558
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,570
I can't face the deceptions.

559
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,950
It's better
to get someone capable to do it.

560
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,620
How do you know you are not capable
if you don't try?

561
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,540
Tell me. What did Father see in me?

562
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,660
Perhaps the late emperor

563
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,540
saw your loyalty

564
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,060
and your love
for every life in the world.

565
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,950
If you can remember this kindness

566
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,580
and become a good emperor,

567
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,100
I believe
Heaven will bless a good emperor.

568
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,470
As for me,

569
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,540
I'll accompany you forever.

570
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,220
I don't want to remember
a time like that.

571
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,740
I know Your Majesty
has been facing huge pressure recently.

572
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,510
Lord Cheng is waiting to strike
and Wanning is ready to pounce.

573
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,950
Your Majesty shouldn't panic

574
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,180
and forget your initial intention.

575
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,390
No matter what,
I'll always be by your side.

576
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,910
If you are still a good emperor,

577
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,430
the Xiao clan and I
will swear our loyalty to you.

578
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,700
Protect your own pawn well.

579
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,910
After two days,

580
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,220
the Court of Judicial Review
will try Shen Yurong.

581
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,700
Are you sure you don't want me to admit

582
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,910
that I was the one who knocked him out?

583
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,740
If the testimony changes,
it'll only cause doubts.

584
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,910
The important thing in this case

585
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,540
is not who knocked Shen Yurong out

586
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,060
but Shen Yurong's act of rudeness
towards me.

587
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,540
No matter how I think about it,

588
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,830
it was because I was too reckless.

589
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,350
You did it for me.

590
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,580
You were helping me.

591
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,830
I wanted to thank you at first.

592
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,060
Yesterday, I also asked
the Secretary of Judicial Review.

593
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,660
He said there are evidence
and witnesses for this case.

594
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,470
Even if Shen Yurong is capable,

595
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,740
he won't be able to silence everyone.

596
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,510
If he doesn't want
to become a good official,

597
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,830
you can let his reputation
go down the drain.

598
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,510
Don't you think it's scary?

599
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,350
I'm not Jiang Li

600
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,830
and not your cousin.

601
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,950
I'm a woman with a tarnished reputation.

602
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,660
I am Shen Yurong's dead wife.

603
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,790
I lived on by replacing Jiang Li.

604
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,990
Right now, I even returned
to the Jiang family to stir up trouble.

605
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,950
I don't think it's scary.

606
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,620
No matter who you are,

607
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,540
you helped me and the Ye family.

608
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,510
The relationship between us
during this period

609
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,740
cannot be fake.

610
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,140
When I finally understand
what you went through,

611
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,830
I realised

612
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,140
my understanding of you
was so shallow in the past.

613
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:29,620
So, just do anything you want
from now on.

614
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,830
Won't you ask me what I'm going to do?

615
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,470
I just want to tell you
that no matter how far you go,

616
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,790
I'll always stand on your side.

617
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,910
Lady Jiang, Eldest Princess's Residence
sends an invitation.

618
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,910
[Jiang Li]

619
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,790
Is she planning something
with this invitation?

620
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,100
During the trial of Xue Huaiyuan's case,

621
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,390
Eldest Princess
was against Li all the time.

622
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,260
Why would she invite Li
to her residence

623
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,100
at a time like this?

624
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,030
How did Li react?

625
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,830
She said she must go.

626
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,510
She said Eldest Princess
would not give up easily.

627
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,350
If she doesn't go this time,

628
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,740
Eldest Princess will find a way
to make her go another day.

629
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,910
She also said if Eldest Princess
wanted to harm her,

630
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,260
Eldest Princess would not invite her

631
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,390
in front of us.

632
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,260
Since she has decided,

633
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,030
I will go with her.

634
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,700
I don't believe

635
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,470
Eldest Princess is so unscrupulous

636
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,310
to the point of harming Li before me.

637
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:04,420
[Princess Wanning's Residence]

638
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:19,950
Li,

639
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,260
don't be afraid. I'm here.

640
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,510
I'm sorry to trouble you
for coming here with me.

641
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,180
Second Lady Jiang, welcome.

642
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,700
Second Lady Jiang,

643
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,100
Eldest Princess only invites you alone.

644
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,620
You asked her to come here

645
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,180
but you didn't ask her to come alone.

646
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,660
Grand Chancellor,
please don't trouble me.

647
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,580
It's all right, Father.

648
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,910
Just wait for me at the entrance.

649
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,700
She can't do anything to me
with you here.

650
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,140
I've wanted to ask Second Lady Jiang
about your Guqin skills.

651
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,220
Unfortunately, I was confined.

652
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,510
Using this opportunity today,

653
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:04,870
why don't you teach me a little?

654
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,790
Your Highness,
I'm sure you didn't invite me

655
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,740
and leave my father outside

656
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,260
to learn guqin skills from me.

657
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,430
Finding a confidant in life
is difficult.

658
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,430
I want to see

659
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,580
if I can play a beautiful tune

660
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,060
with you, Second Lady Jiang.

661
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,660
Your Highness, that's too much praise.

662
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,990
I'm not worthy
of becoming a confidant of yours.

663
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,580
For Your Highness's music,
I can only hear dominance,

664
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,540
cruelty, and heartlessness.

665
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,540
I can feel endless hatred from it.

666
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,870
I don't think so.

667
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,740
Isn't this the point

668
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,990
of the tune,
Spring Fading into White Pear Blossoms?

669
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,260
Didn't you also
play your tune with hatred

670
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,910
so you could shock everyone
during the Entry Exam?

671
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,910
Your Highness,
I wonder what your hatred is?

672
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,350
As Great Yan's eldest princess,
you are loved by the people.

673
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,870
You have silk as your clothes

674
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,870
and rice as your food.

675
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,660
Your Highness, isn't it pretentious
for you to be talking about hatred?

676
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:08,470
Having good clothes and food.
Having the people love me.

677
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,100
What do you know?

678
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,950
Should I go to Dai Country alone

679
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,950
for the sake of Great Yan's peace

680
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,350
and live a difficult life
in an extremely cold place?

681
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,220
So?

682
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,030
Did you make people suffer

683
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,830
because you lived a difficult life?

684
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,510
I died accidentally as well.

685
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,580
I survived with my hatred

686
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,830
but I never hurt innocent people

687
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,790
and killed other people's wives
and family members

688
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,910
because of my selfishness.

689
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,700
It seems like you know many things,

690
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,830
Second Lady Jiang.

691
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,220
You know so much for a rabbit

692
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,870
yet you still fell into my hole.

693
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,660
Should I just kill you as well

694
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,260
and destroy all evidence?

695
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:52,910
You can't kill me.

696
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,580
Are you that confident?

697
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,350
If you kill me,
how can you save Shen Yurong?

698
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,470
Do you know
why I want to save Shen Yurong?

699
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,510
Shen Yurong played up to you
for glory and wealth.

700
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,580
If he knows that you won't save him,

701
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,470
he'll surely drag you down with him.

702
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,390
I'm not afraid of him dragging me down.

703
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:22,470
The whole imperial court
has owed me too much.

704
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,140
The person on the throne

705
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,870
can't kill me no matter what.

706
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,360
Your Highness, don't you think
you are too arrogant?

707
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,870
This is called confidence.

708
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,580
It's the same for Shen Yurong too.
He is confident and doesn't fear me.

709
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:42,790
I like him.

710
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,580
Eldest Princess, stop.

711
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,350
Where is His Majesty?

712
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,830
His Majesty summoned a few scholars.

713
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,870
I'm afraid he's busy.

714
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,260
Fine.

715
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:17,620
Who is that man?

716
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,390
He is this year's Principal Graduate,
Shen Yurong.

717
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,540
His Majesty appointed him as a scholar
of the Hanlin Academy.

718
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,140
He will soon be in charge
of revising the records.

719
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:37,300
♪It's slightly cold, I look up
and my gaze is like the warm sun♪

720
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:40,740
Mr. Shen,

721
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,100
why did you keep my handkerchief?

722
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,950
He was an interesting man back then.

723
