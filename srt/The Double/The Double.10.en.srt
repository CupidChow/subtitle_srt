187
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,390
Li Jin

188
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,750
has been influenced
by Chancellor Li since young.

189
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,270
I wonder if he's more confident.

190
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,060
The final political question
will be judged by Mr. Shen.

191
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,060
Mr. Shen,

192
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,940
please.

193
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,030
This question is set
by His Majesty and I.

194
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,300
If a new emperor ascends to the throne
and the treasury is empty,

195
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,180
there's corruption within the government

196
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,150
and the people
are suffering from droughts.

197
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,390
What is an effective method?

198
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,350
At the start of a new era,
many things are waiting to be done.

199
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,420
Something new cannot be established
if the old things aren't abolished.

200
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,820
Having many issues isn't troublesome

201
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,780
but having people
who neglect their duties is.

202
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,470
I think

203
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,780
corruption has to be dealt with

204
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,940
and corrupt officials must be punished.

205
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,780
The money seized
should be handed over to the treasury

206
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,470
before distributing it
to the victims of the drought.

207
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,700
Li Jin, what do you think?

208
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,060
I think

209
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,470
resolving the drought crisis is crucial.

210
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,470
The corrupt officials

211
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,630
shouldn't be punished first

212
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,750
to ensure a smooth distribution
of money and food for disaster relief.

213
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,780
The corrupt officials cannot be kept

214
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,780
but at the moment,

215
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,660
they are the main force
in distributing the relief aid.

216
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,350
If the crisis is not well-resolved

217
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,420
and the people's support is lost,

218
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,900
the emperor's position
will be in danger.

219
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,540
Mr. Li's idea seems reasonable

220
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,990
but it is unpleasant.

221
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,820
By using this method,

222
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,540
even if the victims' problems
are resolved,

223
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,300
it won't be long.

224
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,900
These corrupt officials
have succeeded once,

225
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,350
they won't let go of their positions.

226
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,990
They will take advantage
of the kingdom's crisis to make money

227
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,420
because that's their personality.

228
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,230
In the end,

229
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,990
the victims and the emperor will suffer.

230
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,940
Only the corrupt officials
in between will benefit.

231
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,300
Mr. Ye's vision is very good

232
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,060
but it is just imaginary.

233
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,390
In reality, I'm afraid
it won't be that easy to implement.

234
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,230
If you only seek integrity,

235
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,030
Mr. Ye,

236
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,820
there might be no one left.

237
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,510
Everyone knows about the principles

238
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,030
but when it comes to execution,

239
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,900
it is much complicated

240
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,110
compared to a mere discussion.

241
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,350
He's right.

242
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,300
He's the son of the chancellor indeed.

243
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,060
He is seeing the problem more clearly.

244
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,820
Ye Shijie has no real-life experience.

245
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,270
He is in danger.

246
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,350
This is bad.

247
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,150
Why do I feel
that Ye Shijie is going to lose?

248
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,510
No.

249
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,700
Ye Shijie

250
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,630
is going to win.

251
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,630
Why?

252
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Why did His Majesty
reward you so many things?

253
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,820
His Majesty asked me today.

254
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,230
Am I not afraid
that there will be no people left

255
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,350
if corrupt officials are punished
during a natural disaster?

256
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,060
What does it have to do
with rewarding you?

257
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,780
I said I witnessed

258
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,150
how my father was harmed
by corrupt officials

259
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,870
and caused my family to be destroyed
when I was young.

260
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,470
With corrupt officials around,
the imperial treasury will lose money.

261
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,270
An empty treasury means
a lack of funds for disaster relief.

262
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,820
Lacking funds for disaster relief
means the people will die.

263
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,580
How can I be afraid
of the lack of people with integrity?

264
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,660
I'm willing to be a lone official
than give up.

265
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,820
Mr. Li,

266
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,900
making money in a disaster

267
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,420
not only hurts the people

268
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,390
but also the emperor's reputation.

269
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,540
As an official,

270
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,030
if you turn a blind eye to corruption

271
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,660
for convenience,

272
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,110
thousands of people will die in vain

273
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,540
in this world.

274
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
If this becomes a habit,

275
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,510
it'll be like an ant hill

276
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,110
which turns into a grave mistake
in the end.

277
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,230
When the kingdom
is exhausted of its money,

278
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,510
who will be the one
to take responsibility for the world?

279
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,510
In terms of political strategy,

280
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,030
Ye Shijie wins.

281
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,630
Ye Shijie gets five points.

282
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,020
[Li Jin, Ye Shijie]

283
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,820
Ye Shijie and Li Jin
are both in first place.

284
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,150
Mr. Ye's performance today

285
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,940
is indeed incredible.

286
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,390
Mr. Li's performance

287
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,150
is also novel and unique.

288
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,940
I'll be looking forward
to the performance

289
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,510
of your team later.

290
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,470
I'll treat everyone to a meal today.

291
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,390
Let's have a feast

292
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,750
to celebrate Ye Shijie's first victory.

293
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,060
I've never seen Li Jin cornered.

294
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,510
It seems like he was going all out.

295
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,750
I wanted to give everyone
a confidence boost by winning

296
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,780
but I only got a tie unexpectedly.

297
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,510
I was even behaving
arrogantly previously.

298
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,580
I should be apologizing to everyone.

299
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,030
Mr. Ye,

300
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,870
it was difficult to get first place.

301
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,700
You're up next, Jiang Jingrui.

302
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,580
Do you think you can do it?

303
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,580
Don't doubt me.

304
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,700
My Go skills might not be the best

305
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,060
but I'm not afraid of anyone.

306
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,630
You can boast after you win.

307
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,510
Just wait.

308
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,780
Give me your hand.

309
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,350
What do you want?

310
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,390
I want to borrow some luck.

311
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,110
Liu Xu, give me your hand too.

312
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,540
Why are you grabbing my hand?

313
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,630
Can't I borrow some of your luck?

314
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,270
Sure.

315
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,390
Everyone should do it.

316
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,940
Mr. Ye,

317
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,510
hand.

318
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,180
What are you doing?

319
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,700
I just want to borrow some luck.

320
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,510
I know you don't believe in this

321
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,060
but there's no need to spoil the mood.

322
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,350
All right.

323
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,420
I'll give all my luck to you.

324
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,030
Stand up.

325
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,060
Let's do this together.

326
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:24,910
Together.

327
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,990
Let's hope I don't face Li Lian
in the first round

328
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,510
and hope I can get a high score.

329
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,230
Come.

330
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,710
All right.

331
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,190
One, two, three.

332
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,030
Victory!

333
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,620
Who does Shen Yurong think he is?

334
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,710
He was just acting mighty

335
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,710
due to His Majesty's appreciation.

336
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,750
How dare he reprimanded you in public.

337
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,300
I think in the capital...

338
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,060
I think he doesn't want
to stay in the capital anymore.

339
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,140
You mustn't touch Shen Yurong.

340
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,100
Think about it.

341
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,860
He is from a poor family

342
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,860
and he doesn't swear loyalty
to the Li and Jiang families.

343
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,670
No one in his situation
can still become an official.

344
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,990
He is alone yet his career is stable.

345
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,230
He even gets
His Majesty's attention easily.

346
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,910
Why?

347
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,270
Don't you find it weird?

348
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,340
Brother,

349
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,430
who is the one
supporting him from behind?

350
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,910
Even if someone does anything to him,

351
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,950
it won't be us.

352
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,340
The most important thing now

353
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,910
is to get first place in the Entry Exam.

354
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,990
In the Go exam,

355
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,670
you must get first place.

356
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,710
Don't worry.

357
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,430
I've told everyone.

358
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,580
No one dares to win
against me at this time.

359
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,820
Jiang Li

360
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,950
will be returning to Zhennyu Hall soon.

361
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,230
Brother!

362
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,180
[Academic Exam,  Second, Jiang Li,
Jiang Jingrui, Ye Shijie, Liu Xu, 11 points]

363
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,460
[Jiang Li]

364
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,060
Brother, I have a Go puzzle
that I can't solve.

365
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
Help me take a look.

366
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,510
Go and look for your sister-in-law.

367
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,860
Sister-in-law?

368
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,670
Brother, are you all right?

369
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,820
I'm busy.

370
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,860
Talk later.

371
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,100
Why did I think about her?

372
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,950
How could I

373
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,990
think about her?

374
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,100
The night in Qingcheng Mountain
is freezing.

375
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,860
It's so cold
that it makes people see things clearly.

376
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:54,190
Why would the person
whom I love most be so cruel

377
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,670
and send me to Qingcheng Mountain
for ten years?

378
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,220
You lose.

379
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,940
I told you you'd be fine.

380
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,700
Your Go skills

381
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,500
aren't bad.

382
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,940
You lose to me on purpose.

383
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,890
You are playing a guiding game.

384
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,570
It seemed as if I won

385
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,820
but you were the one
who controlled the whole game.

386
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,340
You were deciding
who would win the game.

387
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,710
Since you realized my intention,

388
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,750
it means your skill
is up to a certain standard.

389
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,030
Of course.

390
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,470
Even if I don't read my father's Go notes
more than 100 times,

391
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,380
I've still read everything.

392
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,780
Your playing style is similar to mine.

393
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,670
However, your idea of being cautious

394
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,750
has given me a new understanding.

395
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,750
Speaking of which,

396
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,670
who did you learn your skills from?

397
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,910
I studied Go notes in secret

398
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,470
in Zhennyu Hall.

399
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,860
In that case,

400
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,820
we are both prodigies!

401
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,750
I heard there are many good players
in the Imperial Academy.

402
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,190
Have you played against them before?

403
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,620
I don't need to play
against them to know

404
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,230
that the Imperial Academy
is playing by relying on connections.

405
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,860
Even Li Lian can get first place.

406
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,980
That means no one dares
to win against him.

407
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,220
If you meet them next time,

408
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,330
you must teach them a lesson.

409
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,610
Of course.

Jiang Li,

412
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,740
don't just talk about me.

413
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,740
You should think about

414
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,260
your Guqin Exam.

415
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,700
Ji Shuran spent a lot of money

416
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,460
to make Jiang Ruoyao win.

417
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,330
Madam Ji,

418
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,780
Ruoyao's skills have been improving
by leaps and bounds recently.

419
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,370
She will surely get the top three
in the Entry Exam.

420
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,570
Thank you, Fairy.

421
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,540
However, I want the first place.

422
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,300
I hope you can help me.

Fairy Jinghong?

424
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,410
She's extraordinary.

425
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,650
She's the best Guqin player
at Wangxian Pavilion.

426
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,810
She is even one of the main invigilators
of this exam.

427
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,810
Yesterday's exam was really exciting.

428
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,090
I wonder what will happen
in today's Go exam.

429
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,740
Yes.

The losing student
will be eliminated directly.

The winner will go through.

Why don't I see Mr. Shen today?

434

Isn't Shen Ruyun his sister?

435
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,410
I think he didn't participate

436
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,780
to avoid any suspicions.

437
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,940

Can you not speak your mind?

441
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,700
If I don't speak up,

442
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,170
how will God hear me?

443
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,330

Why did you make her angry again?

454
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,460

[Mingyi Hall]

00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,170
Jiang Jingrui, you can surrender
if you don't want to compete.

00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,740
You can't win against me anyway.

463
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:49,650
In my opinion,

464
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,850
you should think about

465
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,780
where you should go to cry.

466
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:54,890

The situation is dire

473
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,850
so why does Jiang Jingrui
look so relaxed?

474
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,700
He is doing it on purpose.

He is setting up a trap.

Is that so?

477
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,130
The more you attack,

478
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,330
the more flaws you have.

was just a bumpkin.

Jiang Jingrui's playing style

- Nourishing Soup.
- Leave it here.

555
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,570
Take a look and see what it is.

556
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,050
Turtle Soup.

557

[Delayed Farewell]

558
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,260
Brother.

559
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,900
I was terrified.

560
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,940
I thought Jiang Li was Xue Fangfei.

561
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,220
Don't speak nonsense.

562
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,770
Why would someone resemble her so much
in this world?

563
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,130
I've heard enough of this.

564
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,900
Don't mention it again in the future.

565
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,610
When I was playing today,

566
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,660
I felt

567
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,050
as if I was playing against Xue Fangfei.

568
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,090
Stop.

569
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,330
It felt scary.

570
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,530
I'm sure Xue Fangfei isn't dead.

571
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,330
Do you think Jiang Li

572
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,180
was killed by Xue Fangfei?

573
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,090
I asked you to stop!

574
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,900
I buried her

575
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,770
with my own hands.

576
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,900
Jiang Li is Jiang Li.

577
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,050
No matter how much she resembles her,
she is not Xue Fangfei.

578
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,900
Do you feel afraid now?

579
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,850
When you and Mother took Wanning's gift

580
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,370
to harm her,

581
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,330
weren't you happy?

582
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,900
After you killed her,

583
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,660
you are afraid of seeing ghosts now.

584
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,220
Mother forced me to do it.

585
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,020
I didn't want to do that.

586
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,220
If I didn't obey Mother,

587
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,660
she would force me
by committing suicide.

588
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,370
Stop showing me your face of guilt!

589
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,020
I'm telling you.

590
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,660
Xue Fangfei is dead.

591
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,460
She's dead!

592
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,370
She died on Qingcheng Mountain.

593
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,420
Do you remember it now?

594
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,940
I remember.

595
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,810
Louder!

596
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,770
I remember!

597
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,500

598
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,290

00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,180
After the Guqin exam
on the day after tomorrow,

601
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,500
I'll get back the money

602
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,570
from my previous bet.

603
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,420
Don't show a long face.

604
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,090
Well,

605
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,130
I'll treat you.

606
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,770
When I collect the money,
I'll buy you many drinks.

607
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,550
I don't think so.

608
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,550
My Lord,

609
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,900
what do you think?

610
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,510
Are you waiting for me
to reward you with money for drinking?

611
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,860
No. My Lord.

612
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,180
Forgive me for saying this.

613
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,710
Why did you place your bet on Jiang Li?

614
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,660
She will never win.

615
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,790
Ye Shijie and the Li family tied.

616
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,420
Li Lian got first place in the Go Exam.

617
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,790
Jiang Jingrui only got fifth place.

618
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,750
Only Liu Xu and Jiang Li are left.

619
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,270
Forget about Meng Hongjin

620
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,270
who has always been the top three
in the academy horseback archery exams.

621
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,510
Even if Liu Xu
wins against Meng Hongjin,

622
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,230
he only closes the gap

623
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,310
left by Jiang Jingrui's loss.

624
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,860
In the last Guqin exam,

625
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,380
Jiang Li must get first place.

626
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,230
The Li family's team sent Wang Qingqing.

627
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,270
She has been a disciple
of the palace musician for many years.

628
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,140
Jiang Li will never win against her.

629
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,140
Even if Jiang Li
wins against Wang Qingqing,

630
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:37,820
don't forget

631
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,820
that she's betting on
getting first place in the Entry Exam.

632
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,750
That means

633
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,470
she must win against Jiang Ruoyao
who has been getting first place

634
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,100
in the Guqin exam
for many years consecutively.

635
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,990
I'm afraid
the Second Lady of the Jiang family

636
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,380
will soon return to Zhennyu Hall.

637
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,310

639
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,340
Yes.

640
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,230

00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,710
Why did this man fall into the jar?

643
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,230
Have I

644
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,660
rushed this?

645
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,030

[Be Brave and Persevere

648
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,620
In this archery competition,

649
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,660
candidates will be assessed
with the Heaven's Bow Technique

650
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,430
founded by the late emperor.

651
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,100
What is the Heaven's Bow Technique?

652
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,510
Candidates will shoot at balls

653
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,070
launched at them with a ball launcher
by using their bow.

654
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,030
The more balls they shoot,
the more points they get.

655
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,390
The exam has always been doing
horseback archery.

656
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,750
Why did they change the format suddenly?

657
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,190
The archery competition format
always changes.

658
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,950
They shoot jars, targets and balls.

659
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,180
You are required
to shoot while riding a horse sometimes

660
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,660
and you are required
to shoot while running sometimes.

661
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,780
Since we are competing as a team,

662
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,140
we will be shooting
while suspended in the air.

663
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,070
The core is still the same.

00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,580

Liu Xu is a fierce lady.

What's wrong with her today?

708
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,960
Perhaps she has a fear of heights.

Yes.

How do you know that?

00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
When I was young, my family wanted me
to excel in academics and martial arts

but they found out

719
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,740
someone with a fear of heights
couldn't practice Qinggong.
