Master Xiao had a falling out
with General Xiao Senior.

186
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,850
Master Xiao wanted to investigate it

187
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,060
like what the Vice General did

188
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,220
to seek justice for his father,

189
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,370
but he was stopped
by General Xiao Senior

190
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,180
and was confined
in the Duke's Residence for five years.

191
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,650
During that five years,

192
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,700
he had nothing to do
apart from gardening

193
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,610
and listening to tunes.

194
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,300
His character changed suddenly.

195
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,060
I see.

196
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,300
I want to meet General Xiao Senior.

197
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,370
Are you here to talk about Xiao Heng?

198
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,890
General Xiao Senior.

199
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,180
Is that Duke Su?

200
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,580
That is

201
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,130
General Xiao Minghan.

202
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,890
Then, that person...

203
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,180
This person is Heng's mother,

204
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,180
Yu Hongye.

205
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
She was a musician at the academy.

206
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,490
She accompanied Minghan
at the Southern border.

207
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,420
She was very good at singing.

208
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,890
The whole family
was protecting the Southern border.

209
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,420
I didn't get to see them once a year.

210
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,890
So, I hired a painter

211
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
to draw this painting

212
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,460
as a memorabilia.

213
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,370
These are...

214
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,770
The helmet my son used.

215
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,530
That is

216
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,220
the fan used by his mother.

217
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,490
This one.

218
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,340
This is Heng's favourite toy.

219
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,250
He wouldn't let it go
after he picked it up.

220
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,250
The wine

221
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,100
is Heng's father's favourite.

222
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,870
I would send them to the camp
as soon as they were brewed.

223
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,370
But now...

224
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,130
General Xiao Senior, are you
looking at these things every day?

225
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,040
I look at these things to remember them.

226
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,580
I can see how much

227
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,130
you love Duke Su in your heart.

228
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,530
I heard about what happened in the past.

229
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,420
I wonder if I can hear about it

230
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,490
from your mouth.

231
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,730
With what identity are you asking this?

232
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,250
Xiao Heng's

233
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,420
lover.

234
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,770
He is also my lover.

235
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,890
You are much more straightforward
than Tortoise Jiang.

236
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,460
Can I hear you talk about the past?

237
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,460
It's fine to not talk about the past.

238
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,730
However, you can ask someone about it.

239
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,420
Keep it a secret.

240
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,890
Don't tell Xiao Heng.

241
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,700
It's bad if he finds out.

242
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,700
General Xiao Senior,

243
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,100
I think Duke Su

244
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,130
should be the one to judge
whether it's good or bad.

245
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,060
I'm not supposed
to eat cold food recently.

246
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,610
It's too greasy.

247
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,420
It disgusts me.

248
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,890
Don't you know that I don't eat shrimp?

249
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,530
Why did you give this to me?

250
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,220
Here.

251
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,220
Eat it.

252
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,700
My hand is numb.

253
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,700
I grabbed the shrimp for you.

254
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,770
Are you going to let it go to waste
on the floor?

255
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,820
Eat it.

256
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,460
What?

257
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,010
Eat it.

258
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,100
Eldest Princess.

259
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,420
You are going overboard.

260
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,980
How so?

261
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,730
Can't you

262
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,980
understand

263
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,610
how a pregnant woman

264
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,220
has no strength in her hands?

265
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,370
It's easy.

266
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,130
If you don't want
to eat the shrimp on the floor,

267
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,700
just kneel and apologise.

268
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,060
Say you will listen to everything I say

269
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,010
and I won't care what you are wasting.

270
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,130
Eldest Princess,

271
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,300
I respect your identity.

272
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,180
But remember,

273
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,980
that doesn't mean
I can endure everything.

274
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,700
I can kneel and apologise to you,

275
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,850
but I'm not Shen Yurong

276
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,220
who will wag my tail and beg!

277
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,460
How dare you!

278
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,770
Shen Yurong is your dog,

279
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,460
but I'm not!

280
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,520
My father is the Imperial Secretariat

281
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,730
and the Chancellor
of the Central Secretariat!

282
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,650
Please know your place!

283
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,730
Who do you think you are?

284
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:18,980
Are you worthy

285
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,370
to speak badly about Yurong?

286
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,370
Let me tell you.

287
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,980
You are nothing compared to him!

288
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,730
Do you know that?

289
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,700
In that case,

290
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,820
I, Li Jin,

291
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,420
won't be an eyesore to you anymore.

292
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,300
You can go and find your Yurong.

293
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,180
Both of you,

294
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,290
I'm here to deliver food for Duke Su.

295
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,220
This is Duke Su's distant relative.

296
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,090
It has been a long time
since they last met.

297
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,530
Please let them meet each other.

298
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,420
We won't trouble both of you.

299
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,050
Make it quick.

300
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,940
We need to chase you out
if you take too long.

301
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

302
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,010
You've grown up.

303
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,620
Young Master.

304
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,330
Ms. Wang.

305
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,080
Why are you here?

306
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,530
After so many years,

307
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,980
you still remember me.

308
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,620
Of course,

309
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,460
after my parents passed away,

310
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,860
you were the one who took care of me.

311
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,900
However, I didn't know
why you left suddenly.

312
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,140
I...

313
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,050
Young Master.

314
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,860
What are you doing? Stand up.

315
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,330
Young Master,

316
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,530
do you remember you were seriously ill

317
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,290
when you were young and
had a high fever? You vomited

318
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,180
and had diarrhea.

319
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,530
I remember.

320
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,420
The old man was busy with work

321
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
and locked me up in the residence.

322
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,620
You were the one who took care of me.

323
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,220
Actually,

324
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,250
I poisoned you back then.

325
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,730
What?

326
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,420
Thankfully, it was discovered early.

327
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,810
The physician gave him medicine.

328
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,460
Young Master is asleep now.

329
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,940
The child is very naughty

330
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,010
and causes you a lot of trouble.

331
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,050
Not at all.

332
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,290
Young Master has always been good.

333
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,620
Why did you harm him?

334
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,050
I found half a sachet of this poison
in your room.

335
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,050
You weren't trying to kill him.

336
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,050
Tell me.

337
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,810
I can help you.

338
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,810
General Xiao Senior,

339
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,900
I'm sorry for what I did to Young Master

340
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,660
but I had no choice.

341
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,010
My child is in their hands.

342
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,420
General Xiao Senior, I...

343
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,290
General Xiao Senior knew
I was forced to do that

344
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,010
and didn't blame me.

345
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,900
He even protected me out of the capital

346
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,090
and gave me some money.

347
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,620
He hoped that I could become a witness

348
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,530
when he gets a chance
to overturn the case

349
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,570
of General Xiao.

350
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,420
However, I've been waiting
but he never came to find me

351
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,290
until yesterday
when this lady came to find me.

352
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,810
Did he really say he would
help overturn Father's case?

353
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,010
Yes.

354
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,660
General Xiao Senior has been
taking care of me for all these years.

355
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,940
He told me many stories

356
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,380
between him and General Xiao.

357
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,290
General Xiao Senior
misses General Xiao a lot.

358
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,050
I think Lord Cheng

359
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,220
used your poisoning

360
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,810
to blackmail General Xiao Senior.

361
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,460
He wanted to protect you badly
back then.

362
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,140
How do you know

363
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,250
it wasn't an act?

364
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,050
You just need to see it for yourself

365
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,010
to know whether it is an act or not.

366
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,540
After all these years,

367
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,250
I'm sure
you haven't been to his residence.

368
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,320
When your confinement is over tomorrow,

369
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,380
you should go with me.

370
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,180
No matter what,

371
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,290
just think of going for my sake.

372
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:41,810
All right?

373
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,420
Imperial Physician Chu.

374
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,290
Is the child fine?

375
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,460
Calm down, Eldest Princess.

376
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,490
I'll tell you
when I complete my diagnosis.

377
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,010
Nothing must happen.

378
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,060
[Li's Residence]

379
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
Father.

380
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,420
What's going on?

381
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,620
The child...

382
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,380
The child is no more.

383
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,090
This is serious.

384
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,220
To be safe,

385
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,490
please ask other imperial physicians
to do another diagnosis.

386
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,530
You are the best physician
at the Imperial Medical Institute.

387
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,050
Who else can I go to?

388
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,180
Please think of another method.

389
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,050
I've prescribed a calming medicine.

390
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,730
Please take care
of Eldest Princess's emotions.

391
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,480
Take your time to chat.

392
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,180
Heng is here!

393
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,980
Shut up.

394
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:03,940
This is...

395
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,300
That is a painting painted
by a painter I hired back then.

396
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,670
I didn't expect you to still keep it.

397
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,060
For me,

398
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,020
all of you are the people
I treasure most.

399
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,260
People you treasure most?

400
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,020
When Uncle Peng told you

401
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,780
the truth about my father's death,

402
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,860
how did you treat the people
whom you treasure most?

403
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,260
Didn't you collude with Lord Cheng

404
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,540
to take control of the imperial army?

405
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,910
Nonsense.

406
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,780
How would I

407
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,910
collude with a murderer
who murdered my son?

408
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,980
You only knew Lord Cheng
caused harm to your father,

409
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,860
but do you know

410
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,340
how he caused his death?

411
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,860
[Wang City, Border of Great Yan]

412
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,540
Why?

413
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,170
Why did we retreat?

414
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,650
We were not in that situation.

415
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,440
If we held on for another few days,

416
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,540
we will be able to protect Wang City

417
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,300
when the reinforcements arrive.

418
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,020
Falling rocks have blocked the path.

419
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,130
Reinforcements couldn't be here.

420
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,300
We don't have enough ration now.

421
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,410
If this city can't supply us with food,

422
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,740
there's no need to protect it.

423
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,260
What we should do now
is to retreat back to Mao City

424
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,330
and meet with the reinforcements

425
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,090
before coming back,

426
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,610
and recapture Wang City.

427
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,370
Are you afraid of death?

428
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,330
I'm not afraid of death.

429
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,130
I don't want
to make any unnecessary sacrifices.

430
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,700
What about the people of Wang City?

431
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,060
Are their lives not important?

432
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,850
Once we retreat,

433
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,850
the enemy will enter an empty city.

434
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,740
Once they capture it,
they will kill and rob everyone.

435
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,020
All the people of the city
will be massacred

436
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,020
in a bloodbath.

437
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,090
As soldiers,

438
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,220
should we protect the peace here?

439
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,900
We can die in battle,

440
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,460
but we cannot abandon a city.

441
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,050
Master, enough.

442
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,980
I am the commander.

443
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,420
I've made my decision.

444
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,770
After today,

445
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,940
the whole army
must retreat from Wang City.

446
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,370
The Longwu Army will not leave.

447
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,460
A military order is absolute.

448
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,370
Master, do you want
to see them punished by military law?

449
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,330
[Wang City]

450
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:40,900
General,

451
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,290
according to your orders,

452
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,940
the Longwu Army and Lord Cheng
have retreated to Mao City.

453
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:45,940
Right now,

454
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,420
we only have
fewer than 200 soldiers left.

455
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,330
Our scouts reported

456
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,530
that the enemy was less than 30 li away.

457
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:54,850
General.

458
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,180
Leave 100 soldiers

459
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,940
to protect and evacuate the people.

460
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,460
[Wang City]
It's too late, General.

461
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,660
There's a valley up ahead.

462
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,290
It's a place that will be blocked
if a person stands guard.

463
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,370
The remaining 100 soldiers
will follow me

464
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,500
and guard that path

465
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,180
until dusk tomorrow.

466
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,420
Then, the people

467
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,330
will be able to evacuate safely.

468
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,500
What about you?

469
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,260
There won't be reinforcements
to save you.

470
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,530
It's all right.

471
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,330
[Wang City]

472
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,290
My fate is sealed.

473
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,610
General!

474
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,020
All the people of Wang City
have evacuated.

475
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,130
We should retreat as well.

476
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,290
General,

477
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,940
the enemies are rushing again.

478
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,050
General,

479
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,700
we can retreat to Wang City
if we take the northern river valley.

480
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,180
The gates of Wang City are closed.

481
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,940
We can't go back anymore.

482
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,660
What?

483
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,460
Why did they close the gates?

484
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,050
It was Lord Cheng's decision.

485
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,220
Lord Cheng wants us to die!

486
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,530
If I knew,

487
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,090
I shouldn't have let him live.

488
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,420
General.

489
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,180
Comrades,

490
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,810
this is a battle to the death.

491
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,660
In that case,

492
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,090
there's no need
to have any hope to stay alive.

493
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,180
Peng Fei!

494
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,290
Yes!

495
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,130
I want you to remember all the names

496
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,180
of the 100 soldiers of the Longwu Army.

497
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,220
Go back and tell General Xiao Senior

498
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,460
that we have not
let the people of Wang City,

499
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,570
His Majesty,

500
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,370
and Great Yan down!

501
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,330
No, General! I won't leave!

502
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,180
I want to fight with you!

503
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,900
You are the only one who can go back.

504
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,500
Leave!

505
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,370
I'm not leaving, General!

506
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:41,940
General!

507
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,290
- Vice General Peng, you should leave!
- I'm not leaving!

508
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,130
Vice General Peng!

509
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,530
General!

510
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,500
Vice General Peng!

511
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,090
General!

512
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,050
Longwu Army! Obey my command!

513
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,180
Yes!

514
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,020
Don't expect
to stay alive in this battle!

515
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:17,770
Charge!

516
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,500
Fire!

517
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,130
To not let everyone know

518
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,420
he abandoned the people of Wang City,

519
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,900
he blocked Father's escape

520
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,180
and forced him to die.

521
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,180
Father did not die in battle.

522
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,330
He was abandoned and killed.

523
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,850
You knew that.

524
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,220
Why didn't you investigate it?

525
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,290
Lord Cheng turned you into my weakness

526
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,180
to control me.

527
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,370
If I was even slightly careless,

528
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,220
someone like Ms. Wang

529
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,610
would kill you.

530
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,530
They need me to admit

531
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,810
the illusion that Minghan died in battle

532
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,500
to cover their lies.

533
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,700
So, they didn't get rid

534
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,460
of the Xiao family.

535
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,900
You were young

536
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,850
and only saw
how I took control of the imperial army.

537
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,570
You knew nothing
about what was going on behind.

538
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,980
Now that you've grown up,

539
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,610
you are still hung up on this.

540
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,130
Why didn't you let me investigate
the Imperial Guard Office?

541
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,020
You want to protect
the subordinate you promoted, right?

542
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,850
Do you know

543
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,290
that he has colluded with Lord Cheng?

544
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,370
How can I not know?

545
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,850
Why did I ask you to release Xu Zhi?

546
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,130
He told me a year ago.

547
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,980
Zhang Wei is communicating
with the northern border.

548
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,700
I told him not to make it public.

549
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,180
Observe it silently.

550
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,020
He is the spy

551
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,130
that I planted
in the Imperial Guard Office.

552
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,370
I must protect him.

553
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,770
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

554
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,220
Did you give me a chance?

555
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,660
Since Uncle Peng left,

556
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,900
I confined you in Duke's Residence.

557
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,290
You wouldn't listen to anything I say.

558
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,020
I couldn't bear to see you
experience the evil of the human heart

559
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,220
at such a young age.

560
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,900
I wanted to tell you why

561
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,530
when you grow older.

562
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,220
Unexpectedly,

563
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,330
the grudge is very difficult to resolve.

564
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,900
It was tough.

565
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,220
It's good that you know that.

566
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,570
I told you so much

567
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,530
not because I want you
to understand and forgive me.

568
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,940
I just want to tell you

569
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,050
that Xu Zhi

570
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,940
is not working for Lord Cheng.

571
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,500
Understand?

572
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,660
I don't understand.

573
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,570
You can explain all of these
in a few sentences,

574
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,570
but you dragged on for so many years.

575
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:12,260
Do you still remember
the names of the 100 soldiers?

576
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,980
I remember every one of them.

577
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,180
I remember them clearly.

578
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,370
Good.

579
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,180
What do you want?

580
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,460
Seek justice for them.

581
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,810
It's not that easy.

582
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,460
If Jiang Li can seek justice
for Xue Huaiyuan,

583
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,980
why can't I prove my Father's innocence?

584
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,980
Am I worse than a woman?

585
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,660
This grandson of mine

586
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,850
has good taste.

587
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,850
The girl is not bad.

588
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,180
She is a good match for you.

589
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,700
You...

590
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,460
Come home with me.

591
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,940
Lord Cheng will soon enter the capital.

592
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,180
Stay in the Duke's Residence with me
during this period.

593
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:11,940
Don't misunderstand.

594
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,330
I just don't want
to collect your dead body.

595
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,420
This grandson of mine has good taste.

596
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,090
Go home.

597
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,530
What are you saying?

598
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,700
Say it again.

599
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,740
Go home.

600
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,570
Yes.

601
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,500
Go home.

602
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,700
Go home.

603
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Go home.

604
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:51,220
[Shen's Residence]

605
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,060
[Painting Skills Producing Winds]

606
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:57,850
Mr. Shen,

607
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,850
I found the medicine
you asked me to find previously.

608
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,850
Is it the kind I want?

609
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,130
Yes.

610
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,370
This medicine only exists in Great Zhao.

611
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,570
In the past,

612
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,730
it was commonly used to treat colds.

613
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,090
However, overdosing on this

614
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,500
makes it accumulate in the stomach.

615
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,380
Accumulate?

616
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,050
Will it cause a bloated stomach

617
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:21,900
and nausea?

618
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,090
That's right.

619
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,730
Someone who takes this medicine

620
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,860
will have a similar pulse to pregnancy.

621
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,900
In the end, there will even be
a sign of miscarriage.

622
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,050
I've asked many village physicians

623
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,820
in the city.

624
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,500
In the past, this medicine

625
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,940
caused many misunderstandings
in the villages.

626
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,240
That is why
its harm outweighs the benefits.

627
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:46,420
So, fewer people are using it

628
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,690
to the point where
not many people know about it.

629
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,980
I asked someone

630
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,980
to buy this herb from Great Zhao,

631
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,730
so it took some time.

632
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,900
How long will the effect go away?

633
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,730
About a month.

634
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,570
I kept telling you

635
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,130
to be nicer to the Eldest Princess

636
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,420
and give yourself a way out.

637
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,050
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

638
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,210
Father,

639
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,730
I've already

640
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,210
followed all of her orders.

641
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,860
You didn't see it that day.

642
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:29,860
She purposely...

643
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,090
Endure it.

644
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,210
Didn't I ask you to endure it?

645
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,900
How could I endure it any longer?

646
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:43,500
I've endured her arrogance
in front of me.

647
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,500
Should I

648
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,980
become her dog instead?

649
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,420
Woof! Woof!

650
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,420
Are you only satisfied

651
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,130
when I lie on the ground to please her?

652
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,250
The Li family
is prestigious in the city.

653
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,500
I don't mind being humiliated,

654
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,780
but can you be humiliated too, Father?

655
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,530
Useless son!

656
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,730
What should we do?

657
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,340
What should we do?

658
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,900
The child is no more.

659
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,690
The child is lost

660
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,420
after you argue with her.

661
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,690
No one can save us.

662
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,730
All of us have to die.

663
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,500
Father.

664
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,090
In that case,

665
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,420
I'll go and apologize
to the Eldest Princess.

666
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,570
Yes.

667
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,210
I'll ask her to execute me at most.

668
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:54,820
Don't worry, Father.

669
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,530
I will never get you involved.

670
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,050
What did you say?

671
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,730
Li Jin!

672
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,210
Not bad.

673
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,340
You dare come alone.

674
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,130
You can pay for my child's life
with yours.

675
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,860
The Li family

676
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,420
cost me my child's life.

677
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,460
You can die with him.

678
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,340
Eldest Princess.

679
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,130
Hold it.

680
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,500
Eldest Princess,

681
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,210
none of us want this to happen,

682
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:28,860
right?

683
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,420
This is just a misunderstanding.

684
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,250
A misunderstanding?

685
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,250
Are you using this

686
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,570
to pay for my child's life?

687
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,650
If this rascal offended you,

688
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,380
I will punish him.

689
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,020
I will whip him 20 times.

690
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,570
What do you think?

691
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,380
Li Zhongnan,

692
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,300
what if I insist
on taking his life today?

693
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,460
What can you do?

694
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,170
Eldest Princess,

695
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,170
my youngest son is in the temple.

696
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,610
He is my only son left.

697
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,210
Eldest Princess,

698
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,780
please be lenient.

699
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,860
Eldest Princess, you must be lenient.

700
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:12,820
Father.

701
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,570
You feel bad for your son?

702
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,860
Why didn't you think about

703
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,340
my child who was yet to be born?

704
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,820
Both of you!

705
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,860
I will kill you today!

706
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,500
Move!

707
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,730
Eldest Princess.

708
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,210
Eldest Princess!

709
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,460
Even if I have to go to Lord Cheng,

710
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,380
I won't stand by and watch you

711
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,860
kill my son!

712
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:31,780
Someone!

713
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:33,650
Don't move!

714
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,020
Li Zhongnan, are you going against me?

715
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,250
Stop!

716
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:40,980
Why are you here?

717
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,570
Shen Yurong?

718
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,820
You dare come to my residence?

719
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,050
You are too arrogant.

720
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,610
All of us fell for her trap.

721
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,090
Trap?

722
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,860
What trap?

723
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,820
Please ask your guards to leave.

724
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,300
Stand down!

725
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:01,980
Get out!

726
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,130
This is a herb from Great Zhao.

727
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,210
No one is using it in Great Yan now.

728
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,690
I asked a physician to find it
and he had a hard time finding it.

729
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,730
The physician said
ingesting this medicine

730
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,380
will cause someone to seem
like she is pregnant within a month.

731
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
Your Highness, if you don't believe it,

732
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,250
you can find someone to test it.

733
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,090
No way.

734
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,860
I had people test all my food.

735
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,460
It is impossible.

736
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,820
What about Consort Li's birthday?

737
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,460
Let's drink.

738
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,900
Princess Wanning
seldom visits our palace.

739
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,020
This cup of wine
is prepared especially for you.

740
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,130
This medicine only exists
in the Great Zhao.

741
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,570
I'm sure you still remember.

742

excel in medicine,

744
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,650
but she is also on friendly terms
with Xiao Heng and Xue Fangfei.

745
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,210
Consort Li.

746
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,340
Situ Jiuyue.

747
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,420
How dare

748
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,820
they help Xue Fangfei trap me?

749
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,860
All of us were fooled by her.

750
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,250
Eldest Princess.

751
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,340
Please forgive me
for being rude just now.

752
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:25,980
Get lost.

753
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,820
Both of you, get lost!

754
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,300
Yes.

755
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,250

757
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,050
Yes.

758
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,570
Send a message to Lord Cheng.

759
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,530
Ask him to prepare the troops.

760
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,530
Yes.

761
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,730
No matter what,

762
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,650
your health has been harmed.

763
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,020
Don't be angry.

If they dare attack again,

792
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,900
I will kill all of them.

Lord Cheng!

794
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,500
Your Highness, you gave all the assets
we seized from Dai Country

795
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,340
to the people.

796
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,420
The military provisions
haven't been distributed yet.

797
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,650
Since Grand Chancellor Li's gold mine
was sealed,

798
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,900
there was no more news.

799
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,380
The military rations

800
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,840
will run out soon.

801
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,460
What are you afraid of?

802
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,090
The Eldest Princess

803
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,250
asked Xiao Heng

804
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,860
to hand over the fish talisman
to command the Longwu Army?

805
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,340
Longwu Army.

806
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,780
Good job, Wanning.

807
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,980
If Xiao Minghan
didn't lead the Longwu Army back then,

808
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,900
I wouldn't be suffering

809
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,340
at the Northern borders for so long.

810
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,170
You shouldn't have come here.

811
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:07,380
Master.

812
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,340
Do you want me to see Father
hand over the throne

813
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,690
to Zhao Ye?

814
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,980
I've fought for Father
in battles for many years

815
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,050
and got injuries all over me.

816
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,610
He is just a child,

817
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,690
yet he can sit on the throne so easily?

818
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,610
If you assassinate Zhao Ye now,

819
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,860
we will bear the crime
of killing the emperor.

820
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,380
The imperial court will be a mess

821
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,530
if the incident cannot be suppressed.

822
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,610
It might even bring harm to the people.

823
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,780
Who will you choose
between Zhao Ye and I?

824
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,610
The Longwu Army is outside.

825
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,050
You can't win.

826
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,500
If you give up now, I'll let you go.

827
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,650
This day is finally here.

828
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,290
Without the Longwu Army,

829
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,940
I'll see how the Xiao family stop me.

830
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,170
But Your Highness returns to the capital
to pay respect to the ancestors.

831
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,380
You can't lead an army back

832
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,860
and you can't station the army
outside the capital.

833
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:07,900
Someone has already
come up with a plan for us.

834
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:16,500
Congratulations, Your Highness,

835
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,250
Your ambition will soon be achieved.

836
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:21,940
Comrades,

837
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:26,460
we have been stationed here
at this bitter place for years.

838
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,570
Thousands of soldiers perished in the battle,

839
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,610
but what has
the imperial court given us?

840
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,900
Land? Money and jewellery?

841
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:34,940
I requested a few times,

842
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,690
but we only received a little reward.

843
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,340
However,

844
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,290
I, Zhao Sheng, promise all of you

845
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,540
to one day reward all of you

846
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,380
with positions, high salaries,
and a luxurious lifestyle.

847
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,210
Destiny has come today.

848
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,500
When I pay my respect
to my ancestors in the capital,

849
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,860
it will be the best time

850
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,060
to change the situation

851
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,610
by heading south for a surprise attack
on the imperial capital.

852
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,570
Generals, obey my command!

853
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,380
Yes!

854
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,130
Get the troops ready.

855
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,610
Once I capture the capital,

856
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,210
send troops immediately to attack.

857
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,290
We will stand with you, Lord Cheng!

858
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:25,770
My Lord,

859
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,730
after Shen Yurong
went to the Li's Residence,

860
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:28,820
there was no news after that.

861
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,130
Later, Eldest Princess's Residence
sent a letter to the Northern Border.

862
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,090
I think Second Lady Jiang's plan

863
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,610
has been found out.

864
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,570
In that case,

865
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,900
we need to be ready
to fight them head-on.

866
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,540
Yes. I will prepare it now.

867
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,090
Let's see if you dare
take any medicine recklessly.

868
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,460
Jiuyue told me
there were no side effects.

869
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,020
How could you believe what she said?

870
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,210
What a pity.

871
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,690
We didn't get to see them
turn against each other.

872
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,380
I didn't get to help you.

873
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,980
Avoiding bloodshed is just a hope.

874
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,460
Sometimes, a fight is still necessary.

875
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
Will you get hurt?

876
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,980
You should ask me

877
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:26,610
if I will die or not.

878
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:33,570
Don't worry.

879
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:34,940
This time,

880
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,500
I will become your pawn.

881
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,570
Sit in a high position

882
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,860
and watch me help you win this battle.

883
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,380
No matter what,

884
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,690
don't die.

885
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,940
There's a storm recently.

886
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,770
Don't leave the Jiang's Residence
for no good reason.

887
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:55,170
Find Zhao He if you need anything.

888
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,060
I will take care
of your father and your brother.

889
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,090
What about you...

890
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,060
As long as you are fine,

891
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:04,980
