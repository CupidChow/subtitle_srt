00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,820
But now there are rumors
everywhere saying

543
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,380
that Mr. Zhou wants to break off

544
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,690
the engagement with her.

545
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,340
Leave now.

546
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,130
Yes.

547
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,570
Where did you hear that?

548
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:26,420
It has been spread
among the female nobles.

549
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,780
They say
after the qin competition ended,

550
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,610
Mr. Zhou approached Jiang Li

551
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,340
to set up a new engagement.

552
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,090
Ridiculous! You can't just change
an engagement like that.

553
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,340
Why didn't you advise her?

554
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,250
Can't she be more mature?

555
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,780
She made such a huge commotion

556
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,530
over some baseless rumors.

557
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,020
Where is her manner?

558
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,500
She's been studying music
for so many years.

559
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,130
But she loses to a wild girl
from Zhennyu Hall.

560
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,860
Something's not right.

561
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,570
She spent so many years at Zhennyu Hall.

562
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,780
Put aside practicing calligraphy,

563
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,530
those people
won't let her learn the qin

564
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,020
and to the point being so good at it.

565
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,130
It's indeed fishy.

566
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,380
Go and find out

567
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,610
where the former Zhennyu Hall's mistress

568
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,460
is locked at now.

569
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,300
Is this about finding out
who Jiang Li learned the qin from?

570
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,050
Since she returned,
something has felt off to me.

571
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,780
Maybe

572
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,530
she isn't Jiang Li at all.
