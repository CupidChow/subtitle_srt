183
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,080
All right.

184
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,040
I'll tell you honestly then.

185
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,200
One, I must borrow your troops.

186
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,920
Two, I can't agree to the marriage.

187
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Three, if you won't promise
my first two conditions,

188
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,590
I will await my death in Great Yan.

189
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,680
You said it would all depend on me.

190
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,110
I want you to reject your brother.

191
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,830
Bah!

192
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,350
No wonder you came
to accompany me today.

193
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,200
Turns out you have an ulterior motive.

194
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,750
I'm disappointed.

195
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,830
Why would I fall
for a scoundrel like you?

196
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,510
Flattery is what a scoundrel does.

197
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,040
Isn't it good to tell you honestly?

198
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,830
Forget it if you won't save us.
I'll await my death in Great Yan.

199
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,920
Come back!

200
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,280
This is the final time.

201
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,400
After this,

202
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,870
I don't care where you will die.

203
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,080
Go away! All of you!

204
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,400
Prince Consort.

205
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,470
What's wrong?

206
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Eldest Princess said
breakfast made her feel disgusted.

207
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,960
Leave.

208
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,230
Yes.

209
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,960
Your Highness, I heard them say

210
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,560
the food did not suit your tastebuds.

211
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,350
I find them disgusting.

212
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,990
The food

213
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,870
was prepared by my mother
especially for you

214
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,110
after she asked the physician.

215
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,710
There's a lot of variety.

216
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,080
It's normal
if you don't like some of them,

217
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,830
but I don't think

218
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,200
you will hate all of them.

219
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,830
Every person has a different taste.

220
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,440
I find it disgusting.

221
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,070
Are you going to force me to eat it?

222
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,400
I dare not.

223
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,190
I'll ask the kitchen

224
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,470
to prepare some new dishes
with various flavours

225
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,360
and send them to Your Highness.

226
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,680
Haitang, how is it?

227
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,230
- Lady Jiang.
- Sister.

228
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,680
Zhao?

229
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,120
Sit.

230
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,840
Why did you come out?

231
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,790
Duke Su is coming back.

232
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,160
I want to welcome him too.

233
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
I feel bad for being taken care of
at the Duke's Residence

234
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,160
for so long.

235
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,160
How is Father doing today?

236
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,510
He is asleep.

237
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,510
Father's condition is getting better.

238
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,160
He looked at me

239
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,030
and called my name.

240
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,710
I felt so emotional that I almost cried.

241
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,790
I think it won't be too long

242
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,600
until Magistrate Xue wakes up.

243
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,270
What's wrong?

244
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,310
Where are you going?

245
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,710
The meat has been roasted.
It can be served after slicing.

246
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,360
We won't disturb you and Brother-in-law.

247
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,030
He's coming.

248
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,030
You...

249
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,200
Who are you?

250
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,310
Who are you?

251
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,030
I'm asking who you are.

252
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,790
I'm Jiang Li, Second Lady Jiang.

253
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,400
The Jiang family.

254
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,230
Tortoise Jiang, right?

255
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,960
Tortoise Jiang?

256
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,840
Yes. He does things like a coward.

257
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,510
Isn't he Tortoise Jiang?

258
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,440
But his daughter

259
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,510
is quite energetic.

260
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,960
General, I was going to pick you up.

261
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,230
Why didn't you wait for me?

262
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,160
You don't want me here
at the Duke's Residence, right?

263
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,790
Can't I visit my grandson's place?

264
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,510
General, you misunderstand.

265
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,560
The lord hasn't returned yet.

266
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,750
I wanted

267
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,400
to inform you when he arrived.

268
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,360
Inform me?

269
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,270
My hair is grey from waiting.
Is he back yet?

270
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,400
He doesn't want to meet me, right?

271
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,120
I don't want to meet him as well.

272
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,360
I brewed two extra jars.

273
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,840
Keep it for yourself.

274
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,680
I'm leaving.

275
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,640
Are you the person who helped
build the late emperor's kingdom

276
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,680
with impressive contributions,
Xiao Dachuan,

277
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,920
General Xiao Senior?

278
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,840
Do you hear that?

279
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,960
She is honey-tongued.
She's saying some nice things.

280
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,750
I like that.

281
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,840
I'm going back home.

282
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,030
Let me send you off!

283
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,400
[Duke Su's Residence]

284
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,440
My Lord, you're back?

285
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,070
Wen Ji, go and get flogged ten times.

286
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,550
I said not to let anyone
enter the residence.

287
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,400
That's...

288
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,120
Both of you came back at the right time.

289
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Leave them.

290
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,510
I'll ask someone
to throw them away later.

291
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,310
- This is from General Xiao Senior...
- I know.

292
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,400
He sends them every year
and I throw them away every year.

293
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,920
Why?

294
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
Are you sure my relationship
with the wine sender

295
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,310
is the first thing we want to talk about

296
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,750
after we've not met for so long?

297
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,400
What's that fragrant smell
from the yard?

298
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,160
Xue Zhao and Haitang prepared roast meat

299
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,440
to welcome you, Duke Su.

300
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,310
Is Great Zhao not willing
to lend us troops?

301
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,200
They are willing to do it but...

302
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,990
They want me to marry to Great Zhao
as a matrilocal son-in-law.

303
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,270
Is that so?

304
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Just go.

305
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,440
Yes. Then...

306
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,270
I think it's still not too late
to agree to it.

307
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,030
Haven't you agreed to it?

308
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,070
I'll find a fast horse for you.

309
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,640
Li, do you hope I become

310
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,230
someone else's prince consort badly?

311
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,640
Duke Su, you must be joking.

312
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,640
I dare not manipulate your choices.

313
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,990
If I agree to it,

314
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,880
you won't forgive me easily.

315
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,790
How so?

316
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,750
I know that.

317
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,360
Do you also know

318
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,070
that Wanning has married Li Jin?

319
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,680
Is this different from your plan?

320
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,470
There are some changes

321
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,990
but it is an unexpected gain.

322
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,470
Li Jin is arrogant.

323
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,920
I'm sure he won't feel comfortable

324
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,400
to see Wanning every day.

325
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,790
The Li family seems calm on the surface,

326
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,920
but there's a storm brewing within.

327
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,600
Let's see who will take the blame

328
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
when the drug loses its effect.

329
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
It's a nice move.

330
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,400
I learned it from you, Duke Su.

331
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,710
What about Great Zhao?
Are you confident now?

332
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,470
I used another method
to let them lend us the troops.

333
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,270
There are no worries now.

334
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,360
When the time comes,

335
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,070
the fish will swim
into the trap on their own.

336
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,710
[Setting an Example for Ages]

337
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,600
Mr. Shen, I've found

338
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,020
the ancient books
with rare herbs recorded on it

339
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,600
you want.

340
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,750
I've added bookmarks to the records.

341
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,300
All right. I understand.

342
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,710
Order me again if you need me.

343
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,990
My Lord, the remaining soldiers
of the Capital Security Office

344
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,060
have been banished to the borders
according to your orders.

345
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,430
However, one of them wanted to live

346
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,820
and provided us with information.

347
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,820
He is in charge of guarding

348
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,910
the Capital Security Office armory.

349
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,020
He heard someone saying

350
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,300
that the Capital Security Office

351
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,170
obtained extra weapons exceeding
the applied numbers three months ago.

352
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,780
However, the extra weapons

353
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,230
did not pass through his hands.

354
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,540
The weapons are distributed uniformly.

355
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,630
They are reported by each unit

356
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,580
and verified by the Armour Office

357
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,150
before a document is sent to the armory.

358
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,390
They'll distribute the number
according to the document.

359
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,430
If extra weapons were obtained
and they weren't stored back,

360
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,300
that means the extra weapons...

361
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,150
Lord Cheng took them.

362
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,990
Lord Cheng is
indeed hiring troops recently.

363
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,150
Weapons are controlled items.

364
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,390
In that case,

365
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,300
not only did the Capital Security Office
not control the distribution of weapons,

366
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,260
but it also
let Lord Cheng obtain weapons.

367
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,820
That means there is even a traitor
in the Armour Office.

368
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,100
I investigated it.

369
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,580
The person in charge
of verifying the weapons

370
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,500
used by the Capital Security Office
at the Armour Office was Cao Bin.

371
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,870
My Lord, do you want to go
to the Armour Department?

372
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,820
Go to Cao Bin's residence
and arrest him directly.

373
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,260
Yes.

374
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,430
Dear, wake up!

375
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
Dear!

376
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,340
Dear, wake up!

377
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,100
Dear!

378
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,020
We are late again.

379
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,780
They are using this trick
of covering up a murder

380
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
with suicide again and again.

381
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,470
Dear!

382
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,100
There are traces of paper burning here.

383
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,300
What was Cao Bin burning
before he committed suicide?

384
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
Cao Bin's will.

385
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,950
He admitted to colluding
with the Capital Security Office

386
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,630
by going against the law
and verifying extra weapons.

387
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,740
However, he didn't mention
where the weapons went.

388
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,260
They are lies forged meticulously.

389
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,820
Duke Su.

390
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,710
My Lord, he is Official Huang
from the Armour Office.

391
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,630
Official Huang,

392
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,060
you are quite well-informed.

393
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,470
Are you here

394
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,340
to protect your subordinate?

395
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,260
[Huang Xiansong]
Duke Su, please don't speak nonsense.

396
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,630
I just found out

397
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,670
and rushed here.

398
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,580
Your subordinate sold weapons privately
by colluding with the Capital Security Office.

399
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,990
Do you know about that?

400
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,470
Of course, I don't.

401
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,820
The verification of weapons
is carried out by the deputy official.

402
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,580
The person who verified the weapons
for the Capital Security Office

403
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,470
was Cao Bin.

404
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,230
I never expected

405
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,540
the Capital Security Office
to bribe him.

406
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,150
Apart from verifying
the Capital Security Office, which unit

407
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,820
did he verify weapons for recently?

408
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,300
I think
it was the Imperial Guard Office.

409
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,740
In that case,

410
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,820
there's also a problem
with the use of weapons

411
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,740
at the Imperial Guard Office.

412
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,500
I just found out

413
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,020
that Cao Bin
took all the documents in the office

414
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,500
related to the Imperial Guard Office
and the Capital Security Office.

415
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,910
He said there was a problem
and wanted to verify them one by one.

416
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,390
I think the documents were the items

417
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,910
burned in the fire bucket.

418
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,390
When the Imperial Guard Office
went to obtain weapons from the armory,

419
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,820
was there any proof left?

420
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,540
Yes. Every time
weapons were distributed,

421
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,430
the armory would record it.

422
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,340
Wen Ji, go with Official Huang

423
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,820
and retrieve the records
for the Imperial Guard Office.

424
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,230
Yes. Official Huang, let's go.

425
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,710
My Lord, are you suspecting
that the Imperial Guard Office is also...

426
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,060
Since there's a problem with Cao Bin,

427
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,300
we need to check every place
related to eliminate all future troubles.

428
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,190
Should we inform the old general?

429
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,500
After all, he was the one

430
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,300
who promoted the commander
of the Imperial Guard Office, Zhang Wei.

431
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,820
I don't even inform His Majesty
when I investigate someone.

432
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,190
Why should I inform him?

433
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,300
Yes.

434
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,740
[Li's Residence]

435
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,300
Your Highness.

436
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,300
Where are you going?

437
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,990
Do I need to inform you
about where I'm going?

438
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,190
I'll accompany you.

439
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,740
Are you going to keep an eye on me?

440
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,740
I dare not.
If Your Highness goes out,

441
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,670
Neither of us
can't bear the responsibility

442
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,630
if something happens to the child.

443
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,020
How dare you curse me?

444
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,260
Your Highness, if you insist
on refusing my company,

445
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,950
I won't force you.

446
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,950
I hope you return soon, Eldest Princess.

447
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,260
I searched the ancient books,
but I found nothing.

448
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,780
I heard you were

449
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,540
the most knowledgeable person
in the capital, Physician Wang.

450
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,540
I want to trouble you
to help me find out

451
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,710
whether this herb exists.

452
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,780
If you can find it,
I'll reward you handsomely.

453
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,670
Don't worry, Mr. Shen.

454
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,470
- I will do my best.
- Brother.

455
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,630
The Eldest Princess is here.

456
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,820
Your Highness, if you need something,
just ask Yurong to find you.

457
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,470
Why did you come here in person?

458
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,260
This is such an honor
for the Shen family.

459
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

460
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,870
Madam Shen,

461
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,470
I have something to discuss
with Mr. Shen.

462
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,710
I don't want anyone to disturb us.

463
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:54,950
Yes.

464
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,950
I also hope no one finds out

465
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,630
about my visit to the Shen's Residence.

466
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,910
The Eldest Princess
has never visited the Shen's Residence.

467

[Conceal the talent
and draw no attention]

468
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,580
Let's go, Mr. Shen.

469
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,670
This way, please.

[Painting Skills Producing Winds]

471
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,190
You came here as soon as
you married into the Li family.

472
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,340
People might spread rumors about this.

473
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,580
Rumors?

474
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,100
I'm already following your plans.

475
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,950
Are you still afraid of rumors?

476
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,470
I'm just afraid that Mr. Li
will have a grudge against me

477
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,870
if he finds out.

478
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,780
Let's see if he dares to do that.

479
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,740
Forget him. You, on the other hand,

480
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,990
are traveling around
when you are pregnant.

481
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,950
If something goes wrong,

482
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,710
what will I do?

483
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,470
Don't worry.

484
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,500
I'm fine now, right?

485
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,340
However, if I continue
to stay at the Li's Residence,

486
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,060
it'll be dangerous.

487
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,580
Were you bullied at the Li's Residence?

488
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,500
He dare not bully me.

489
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,100
However, I fail to do anything there.

490
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,190
I'm so annoyed.

491
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,020

with a gloomy face.

Who does he think he is?

succeeds in his ambition

But I want to remind you, Wanning.

501
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,300
No one will treat you like I do.

502

Don't act bossy towards Li Jin.

a golden spoon after all.

505

He has never experienced
such a grievance before.

506

you must see the bigger picture.

544
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,780
and sold them privately.

545
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,060
Did something like that happen?

546
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,630
Apart from

547
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,230
verifying the weapons
for the Capital Security Office,

548
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,990
which unit do you think Cao Bin

549
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,710
was in charge of verifying as well,
Commander Zhang?

550
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,870
Duke Su, don't worry.

551
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,910
We obtained the weapons
according to the regulations.

552
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,710
We store as many weapons as we obtain.

553
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,150
We will never go against the law!

554
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,060
I requested the records
of the Imperial Guard Office

555
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,910
from the official at the Armour Office.

556
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,300
If there are no problems,

557
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,580
I want to verify it

558
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,230
for the sake of fairness.

559
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,230
Of course.

560
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,740
Xu Zhi!

561
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,340
Yes.

562
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,020
This is Xu Zhi,
our deputy military officer

563
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,230
[Xu Zhi]
in charge of weapons.

564
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,710
Greetings, Duke Su.

565
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,990
There's a problem at the Armour Office.

566
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,020
He wants to investigate
the weapons of our unit.

567
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,500
You must work well with him.

568
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,670
Yes.

569
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,390
Duke Su. This way, please.

570
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,740
Someone,

571
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,910
send a message to General Xiao Senior

572
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,740
and tell him I want to meet him.

573
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:06,670
Yes.

574
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,660
Duke Su, please take a look.

575
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,430
This is the letter of request
when we want to request weapons

576
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,100
from the Armour Office.

577
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,540
This is the receipt

578
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,540
after we obtained the weapons.

579
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,540
Lu Ji.

580
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:18,470
Yes.

581
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,060
There are two copies for every document.

582
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,700
One copy will be sent
to the Armour Office

583
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,540
and the other copy will be kept by us.

584
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,020
The numbers match

585
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,020
the records from the armory.

586
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,540
Can I keep these documents?

587
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:32,910
Just take them.

588
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,830
However, please return them
when you're done using them.

589
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,620
My Lord,

590
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
[Imperial Guard Office]
it seems perfect on the surface

591
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,990
as if they've practiced for it.

592
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,270
Cao Bin burned the documents in a hurry.

593
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,460
The suspicion
of the Imperial Guard Office

594
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,180
obtaining extra weapons
cannot be eliminated.

595
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,950
However, the records match.

596
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,270
That means

597
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,390
extra weapons were brought out

598
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,750
but the records were tampered with.

599
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,220
My Lord.

600
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,060
Official Huang
from the Armour Office found out

601
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,020
the number of weapons produced
by the Weapons Manufacturing Bureau

602
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,580
exceeds the number of weapons
distributed by the armory.

603
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,500
That means Cao Bin did collude
with the Imperial Guard Office

604
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,660
to tamper with the records

605
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,180
and distributed extra weapons.

606
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,140
Surround the place.

607
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,100
Arrest Xu Zhi.

608
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:22,790
Yes.

609
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,500
Why would Xiao Heng
investigate the Imperial Guard Office?

610
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,700
Isn't this
the Capital Security Office case?

611
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,020
It is found that the Armour Office

612
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,910
are smuggling weapons.

613
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,140
So, he suspects
that our unit is involved as well.

614
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,270
General.

615
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,500
I'm sure you know Duke Su's temper.

616
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,870
When he is sure of something,

617
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,020
he will do everything he can
to find out the truth.

618
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,220
Moreover, his interrogation methods
are incredible.

619
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,270
So, I...

620
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,620
Are you looking for me because
you don't want him to keep investigating?

621
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,500
No.

622
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,620
My unit is not afraid
of any investigation.

623
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,270
But he needs evidence

624
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,990
to investigate this.

625
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,660
If you arrest my subordinate

626
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,430
without evidence and punish him,

627
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,870
I won't give up easily.

628
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,390
You promoted me before,

629
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,950
so I thought about it

630
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,700
and figured I should inform you

631
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,390
to avoid any misunderstanding.

632
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,870
I won't tolerate him

633
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,580
if he simply does things.

634
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,390
I'm relieved to hear you say this.

635
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,990
Your Highness, you came back so late.
Where have you been?

636
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,060
I...

637
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,100
No one will treat you like I do.

638
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,580
So, you must control your temper.

639
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,390
Don't act bossy towards Li Jin.

640
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,580
He is born with
a golden spoon after all.

641
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,180
For the child,
you must see the bigger picture.

642
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,580
I went back to my residence
to pack up some things.

643
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,470
I remember your residence
and Shen Yurong's residence

644
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,790
are in two different directions.

645
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,540
You followed me?

646
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,950
Your Highness,
you are still my wife in name right now

647
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,430
yet you simply

648
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,830
went to another man's house.

649
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,620
If someone saw that
and asked me about it,

650
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,950
may I know

651
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,700
how should I explain that?

652
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:15,990
Li Jin,

653
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,420
don't speak to me

654
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,830
in a peculiar way.

655
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,100
It's a blessing for the Li family
that I marry you.

656
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,180
After all,

657
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,020
this is a collaboration.

658
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,870
If you sincerely help me,

659
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,390
I will reward you well in the future.

660
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,430
If you cause me trouble here,

661
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:34,870
sorry.

662
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,750
I will come for the Li family
to take revenge any time.

663
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,660
I dare not cause you trouble.

664
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,430
I just want to protect you

665
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,470
and your child.

666
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,990
After all,
if news of you and Shen Yurong

667
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,270
spreads to the public,

668
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,870
all of us will be embarrassed.

669
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,100
Who does he think he is?

670
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,460
I would've ripped your mouth

671
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,820
if it wasn't for my child!

672
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,540
Your Highness, please calm down.
Your child is more important.

673
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,790
If I don't deal with him,
he might end up bullying me.

674
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,020
Greetings, Xu Zhi.

675
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,390
It's you?

676
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,580
What do all of you want?

677
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,950
Didn't I give you

678
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,870
all the documents?

679
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,700
You can go and check the inventory

680
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,660
and verify the documents.

681
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,220
Do you think
after Cao Bin committed suicide

682
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,990
and burned the documents,

683
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,830
we won't be able to investigate

684
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,870
about the tampering
and forgery of records?

685
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,790
I didn't take any weapons.

686
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,350
I didn't collect any extra weapons.

687
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,140
We've investigated the Armour Office.

688
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,540
The Imperial Guard
distributed extra weapons.

689
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,060
Why didn't you say
they sold it privately?

690
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,140
Very good.

691
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,270
Being stubborn?

692
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,940
I won't be lenient with you then.

693
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,540
Stop!

694
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,390
My Lord,

695
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,100
how is the interrogation?

696
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,140
He's still stubborn.

697
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,220
Let's lock him up for a night.

698
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,420
I think he will confess tomorrow.

699
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,270
Keep interrogating him.

700
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,620
I can't wait until tomorrow.

701
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,180
Yes.

702
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,700
Reporting!

703
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,300
Commander of the Imperial Guard Office,
Zhang Wei,

704
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,700
is leading his men
to surround the Duke's Residence.

705
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:47,980
[Duke Su's Residence]

706
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,870
Commander Zhang,
what is the meaning of this?

707
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,470
If you want to visit,

708
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,700
you shouldn't bring so many men.

709
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,700
Visit?

710
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,580
I'm not that close with you, Duke Su.

711
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,390
You took my subordinate

712
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,870
without giving me an explanation.

713
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,430
I want you to hand him over in one hour.

714
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,910
What if I don't hand him over?

715
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,950
Try it.

716
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,270
Don't move!

717
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,830
What's wrong, Zhang Wei?

718
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,390
General,

719
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,180
I told you before this.

720
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,700
If he doesn't respect me,
I have no choice but to do this.

721
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,870
You must hand over my subordinate today.

722
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,350
Commander Zhang, you are so anxious.

723
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,140
Are you afraid that Xu Zhi
might expose you?

724
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,620
You...

725
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,540
All of you, don't move!

726
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,430
Zhang Wei,

727
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,950
show me some respect.

728
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,660
I'll return him to you within one day.

729
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:57,910
General,

730
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,430
thank you.

731
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:03,910
Retreat!

732
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,820
[Duke Su's Residence]

733
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:18,620
[Duke Su's Residence]

734
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,540
Release him.

735
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,830
Confining someone
from the Imperial Guard Office

736
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,060
and torturing him.

737
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,800
You've become lawless.

738
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,950
I'm doing things
according to His Majesty's orders.

739
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,350
You've overstepped your boundaries.

740
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:33,180
The Imperial Guard Office case
is trialed by the Three Offices.

741
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,870
I will send Xu Zhi
to the Three Offices to be trialed.

742
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,620
You can try him with them,

743
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,660
but you can't have a private trial
and torture him.

744
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:40,990
Is this

745
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,750
related to you?

746
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,700
Come. Let's talk inside.

747
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,060
You can speak here.

748
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,140
You've become lawless

749
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,950
after you left my tutelage.

750
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,020
Eight years ago,
my father died a bizarre death

751
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,870
but you didn't investigate.

752
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,390
Right now, I want to investigate
the person you promoted but you saved him.

753
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,960
Why do you do this?

754
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,220
Your father's death was an accident.

755
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,910
Release him

756
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:19,990
and come home with me to talk about it.

757
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,390
I no longer have a home.

758
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,790
Shut the door!

759
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:44,340
[Duke Su's Residence]

760
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,990
Arresting without approval, confinement,
and using punishment.

761
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,470
Can't you change your methods?

762
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,140
The Imperial Guard Office
is the imperial army.

763
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,990
They are not literary officials
who are scared of you.

764
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,350
This is the result
if you can suppress them.

765
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,560
Your Majesty, why didn't you say

766
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,310
that all of them only dared
complain to me behind my back?

767
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,470
Stop saying this.

768
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,470
The whole incident is clear.

769
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,870
The Armour Office
and the Imperial Guard Office

770
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:07,750
might have a problem.

771
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,310
Why won't you choose an easier method

772
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,430
and go for the hard way instead?

773
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,910
Can't you learn
from General Xiao Senior?

774
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,460
It seems like
his booklet is one of them.

775
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,380
His booklet is inside.

776
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,340
His booklet is the only one
that pleads for you.

777
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,900
The whole capital is spreading news

778
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,050
of Zhang Wei surrounding your residence.

779
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,250
Many people are complaining

780
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,570
that you force people to confess

781
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,690
without evidence and use torture.

782
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,730
Right now,

783
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,380
everyone is using
the Imperial Guard Office's reason

784
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,860
to bring up their hatred for you.

785
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,570
Every booklet is a complaint of you.

786
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,090
How can I protect you?

787
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,050
Isn't that great?

788
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,300
You can obviously see

789
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,460
how the parties are split
in the imperial court.

790
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,500
This is public opinion.

791
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,460
Release him first.

792
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,780
Go back and rest for a few days.

793
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,860
How can I rest at a time like this?

794
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,690
This is a time
when you should go back and rest!

795
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,570
There's a limit to everything.

796
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,380
It's time to cultivate your blessings.

797
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,090
I've sent the imperial edict

798
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,860
to confine you at home for two days.
