00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,390
then send her home when she's done.

190
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,360
Okay, sir.

191
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:53,870
Thank you.

192
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Let's go, pretty lady.

193
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,270
You're definitely Xue Li.

194
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,470
Dumb Madam.

195
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,420
No way, girl.

196
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,820
You have to leave.

197
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,540
Leave tonight.
Don't ever come back to Huaixiang.

198
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,470
Why?

199
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,390
Feng Yutang was able to

200
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,390
ruin Huaixiang.

201
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,390
He surely has someone backing him up.

202
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,420
He's afraid of nothing.
You can't defeat him.

203
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,110
My current identity

204
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,700
is the second daughter
of Secretariat Director Jiang Yuanbai.

205
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,750
Jiang family is powerful.

206
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,420
They won't dare to touch me.

207
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,150
The higher your status,
the more you'll harm Magistrate Xue.

208
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,630
As long as Feng Yutang

209
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,470
thinks Magistrate Xue is a threat,

210
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,060
he may kill him.

211
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,540
I won't let them see

212
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,180
that I'm here for Dad.

213
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,660
I need someone,

214
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,990
who can overturn Dad's verdict

215
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,420
and prove

216
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,820
that Feng Yutang framed Dad.

217
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,700
So I can redress for Dad

218
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,110
before he's executed.

219
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,990
But the people you want

220
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,470
can't save him.

221
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,940
Gu Da, Gu Er, Peng Xiao and He Jun,

222
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,990
all those who were loyal

223
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,540
to Magistrate Xue

224
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,940
were sent to

225
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,700
the sand mine in Dong Mountain.

226
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,820
Everyone there works for Feng Yutang.

227
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,270
No matter what,

228
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,390
I must give it a try.

229
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,110
Don't alert the enemy.

230
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,230
Or else Magistrate Xue will suffer more.

231
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,990
I know.

232
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,870
You're with Feng Yutang every day.

233
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,270
You may be in danger anytime.

234
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:51,900
Listen to me.

235
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,940
I'll find a way to send you out, okay?

236
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,270
If I disappear suddenly,

237
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,150
your identity will be exposed.

238
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,420
My life doesn't worth anything.

239
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,700
If Magistrate Xue hadn't save me,

240
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,660
I would have starved to death.

241
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,750
He's my savior. I can't leave.

242
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,510
That rotten Feng Yutang

243
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,780
thinks I'm a useless dumb person.

244
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,270
He didn't chase me out.

245
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,230
But he didn't expect

246
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,870
that I've been staying
by Magistrate Xue for a chance.

247
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,630
In a few days,

248
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
if they're really going
to execute Magistrate Xue,

249
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,060
I'll fight them with my life.

250
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,780
No.

251
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,300
Sacrificing your life to revenge

252
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,350
isn't worth it.

253
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,230
Since I'm back today,

254
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,300
I'll make sure
they get what they deserve.

255

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,140
Thank you, everyone.

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,990
Ginseng chicken soup.

259
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,510
Have some.

260
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,990
Why are you sitting there?

261
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,540
Drink it.
It has been stewed for a long time.

262
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,780
Don't be shy.

263
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,620
Drink while it's hot.

264
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,300
It's still hot.

265
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,860
Ma...

266
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,380
Come.

267
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,100
Drink.

268
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,510
Open your mouth.

269
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,710
Drink.

270
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,620
Magistrate Feng, have mercy!

271
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,300
I cooked this chicken soup
for an entire day.

272
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,710
If you don't drink it,

273
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,510
isn't it a waste of my effort?

274
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,470
Who did she meet?

275
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,510
Duke Su.

276
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,300
Why did Duke Su come to Huaixiang?

277
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,860
Get up.

278
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,300
Duke Su seems
to care about Jiang Li a lot.

279
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,190
He even sent her back himself.

280
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,620
I'm afraid it won't
be easy to take action.

281
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,540
From now on, be smarter.

282
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,380
If you're found again,

283
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,860
you won't have soup,

284
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,540
but death.

285
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,820
Leave, all of you!

286
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,580
Yes, sir.

287
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,910
Hold on.

[Sansheng Hall]

00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,300
Miss.

290
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,030
What took so long?

291
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,860
Did something happen?

292
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,580
I was being followed
by Feng Yutang's spies.

293
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,510
Luckily, I met Xiao Heng.

294
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,380
Who's Xiao Heng?

295
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,190
He's Duke Su.

296
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,540
Why is he here?

297
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,710
Did he come to see you?

298
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,540
Let's talk about him in the future.

299
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,580
Back to the important topic.

300
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,910
I found out about

301
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,510
the people
who knew about Xue family case.

302
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,540
Where are they?

303
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,780
At the sand mine of Dong Mountain.

304
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,300
However,

305
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,510
the sand mine is filled with
Feng Yutang's subordinates.

306
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,510
Third Uncle.

307
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,100
Can you find enough helpers?

308
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,100
I can get my buddies back in Luyang.

309
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,190
But Feng Yutang is having a close eye
on our people.

310
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,580
He knows

311
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,750
our every move.

312
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,670
Is there no other way?

313
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,380
Well...

314
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,060
There's one.

315
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,430
My Lord.

316
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,950
The topography
of the sand mine is studied.

317
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,430
There's a river between two mountains.

318
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,230
This part of the river is the sand mine.

319
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,670
Up the river,

320
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,670
right here is the official gold mine.

321
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,060
This gold mine is closed down
by the Imperial Court.

322
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,620
The office of Huaixiang
is in charge of guarding it.

323
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,670
Without a pass, no one can enter.

324
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,230
The rest

325
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,300
isn't investigated yet.

326
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,190
The sand mine is only founded
half a year ago.

327
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,540
But the official gold mine

328
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,750
had been in use for many years.

329
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,820
The mine tunnels are very complex.

330
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,510
In addition to the impact
of the land damages

331
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,470
the tunnels
must have been changed a lot.

332
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,470
Without a map, it's hard to get in.

333
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,670
You're good
in saying the right nonsense.

334
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,670
What idea do you have?

335
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,100
Let's attack forcefully.

336
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,060
Attack forcefully?

337
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:28,820
Yes.

338
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,620
I'll ask our people to charge.

339
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,470
And then?

340
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,580
Search.

341
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,710
In the name of?

342
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,710
With our status and identity,

343
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,270
can't we be overbearing and shameless?

344
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,990
We just have to.

345
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,140
What do you think?

346
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,750
Wrong nonsense.

347
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,910
Suggest something then.

348
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,270
Here you are.

349
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,300
You're expecting me?

350
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,340
You have no way to go,

351
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,470

352
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,580
I would like to borrow some manpower

353
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,230
to go to the sand mine
in Dong Mountain together.

354
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,270
Interesting.

355
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,990
You have the same idea.

356
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,340
This is the important thing.

357
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,470
You can have manpower.

358
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,860
But I can only help you after I settle

359
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,540
my affair.

360
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,620
This is urgent.

361
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,470
I can't wait.

362
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
Jiang Li.

363
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,670
Don't be too bossy with me.

364
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,190
Tell me

365
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,860
what do you need to do.

366
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,060
At the upper stream of the sand mine

367
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,300
there's a closed official gold mine.

368
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,510
Official gold mine?

369
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
You want to go in there?

370
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,140
There's no way in now.

371
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,910
We don't have the map.

372
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,620
The map?

373
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,060
Give me a moment.

374
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,950
My rule is,

375
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,750
I need to know the source of this map.

376
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,710
I can't tell.

377
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,540
But I can guarantee with my life

378
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,030
that this map is real.

379
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,910
I've heard this kind
of speeches many times.

380
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,100
Xiao Heng.

381
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
This map

382
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,820
was someone's life.

383
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,950
If you want it, take it.

384
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,510
Second Lady Jiang.

385
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,670
My Lord has always been careful.

386
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,820
You've gone too far.

387
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,030
That's enough.

388
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,300
I'll take the map.

389
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,300
Tell me your plan.

390
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,750
[Entrance. Upper tunnel. Mining area.]
I want you to help me to get

391
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,620
to the sand mine
to save the ex-subordinates of Magistrate Xue.

392
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,860
This sounds like saving lives
by sacrificing lives.

393
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,190
I don't really want
to have this losing deal with you.

394
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
The two of us

395
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,270
have never had a fair deal.

396
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,710
I'm just a chess piece in your hand.

397
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,380
I overestimated myself by saying that.

398
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,100
From beginning on,

399
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,860
I was probably not even a chess piece.

400
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,780
I made use of you
to get back to Jiang family.

401
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,270
And you've been observing me since then.

402
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,950
It was originally due to doubt.

403
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,380
Ever since the bet
between Li family and I started,

404
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,540
you've been fanning the flames.

405
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,100
You don't want Li family
to recruit Ye Shijie,

406
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,270
so you provoked them

407
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,140
by using me
to distance Ye and Li families.

408
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,060
That's why you treated
the wound on my hand twice

409
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,030
to help me pass the exam.

410
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,380
You've been observing

411
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,340
to see if I'm qualified
to be your chess piece.

412
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,060
Only when I came to Luyang

413
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,340
and fought Li family
to protect Ye family,

414
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,230
you started treating me
like your chess piece.

415
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,990
Is that right?

416
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,140
Why should I fight Li family?

417
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,030
From searching the stolen money
of the smuggled salt in Qingcheng Mountain

418
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,670
to entering the official gold mine,

419
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,380
what you're investigating
is clear even without saying.

420
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,620
In recent years, corruption cases
are frequent in the capital.

421
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,060
Those who died are insignificant people.

422
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,430
There must be someone
making money behind these people.

423
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,540
Do you know who these people are?

424
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,820
How could I have
such great ability alone?

425
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,820
But I can see it through your eyes.

426
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,820
From the capital to Luyang,

427
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,030
your eyes have been on Li family.

428
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,380
I can't help but to think about

429
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,710
what the relation is.

430
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,910
That's right.

431
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,300
The financial resources
in the capital are cut off.

432
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,860
So Li Jin came to Luyang.

433
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,190
What does Luyang have?

434
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,060
The wealthy Ye family.

435
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,910
Finance is the key to a country.

436
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,510
His Majesty must be worried.

437
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,340
And you're going from north to south

438
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,620
to take down Li family

439
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,860
under the emperor's order.

440
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,230
Jiang Li.

441
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,430
Don't you want to live anymore?

442
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,140
I want to live,

443
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,140
but I can't.

444
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,140
As for me,

445
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,230
if you didn't take me into your game,

446
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,990
I won't be able to live long.

447
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,670
A chess piece like you

448
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,300
should have been abandoned.

449
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,860
How would you know
that I can't be the killer move?

450
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,190
You're too presumptuous.

451
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,540
I give my life to you.

452
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,270
What did you say?

453
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,540
I said,

454
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,710
I give my life to you.

455
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,950
Keep using me as your chess piece.

456
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,910
I'm sorry, Jiang Li.

457
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,030
I'm not interested
in this chess game anymore.

Xiao Heng.

459
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,430
We have different paths
but the same destination.

460
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,990
You said that.

461
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,190
Different

462
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,950
paths

463
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:20,780
with the

464
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:22,780
same destination.

465
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,340
You said that.

466
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:29,990
Are you afraid?

467
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,990
What am I afraid of?

468
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,030
You're afraid to use my life

469

for the fate of the country.

470

Saving people from the sand mine
and going into the gold mine

471
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,510
can be done at the same time.

472

You don't have to go to Dong Mountain.

473
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,230
I must go.

474
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,140
Before going to Dong Mountain,

475
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,860
how can you

476

Why did they come?

485
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,030
They didn't come earlier nor later.

approved your execution,

What a coincidence.

490
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,510

561
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,990
Grain always come first.

562
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,910
I'm sure he'll panic

563
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,750
when we attack the granary.

564
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,990
It seems I also made the right bet.

565
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,950
I knew you would have a way.

566
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,580
Eight people.

567
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,060
Let's have a look at the sand mine.

568
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,380
The people you're looking for
are not at the sand mine.

569
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,950
That was just a cover.

570
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,820
They should be in this mine cave.

571
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,430
I know that there's an entrance

572
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,390
if we go south around this mountain.

573
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,470
My Lord.

574
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,220
I can do this.

575
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:17,700
Listen to her.

576
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,660
Let's go.

577
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,350
It should be this way.

578
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,540
Are you sure?

579
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,180
Yes.

580
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,730
This tunnel is narrow.

581
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,090
Perhaps because it's inconvenient
for transportation

582
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,940
it was abandoned.

583
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,430
Let me have a look first.

584
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,260
Go that way.

585
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,220
I remember there's
no such fork on the map.

586
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,580
I don't know which way to take either.

587
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
Let's split up.

588
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,430
You and I go this way.

589
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,470
So I'll go this way.

590
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,910
I think that way looks
more like the path on the map.

591
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,910
Let's go that way.

592
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,220
Then we'll switch. Let's go.

593
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,310
Duke Su, how is it down there?
Is there a path?

594
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:35,870
Come down.

595
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,060
Be careful.

596
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:45,830
Let's go.

597
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,950
What are you doing?

598
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,430
Be alert.

599
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,060
What are you afraid of?

600
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,830
They're all working at this time.

601
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,870
What could happen?

602
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,220
Hey,

603
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,660
can you stop being so careless?

604
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,180
Why are you looking at me?

605
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:48,830
Go.

606
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,470
You begged me to come here.

607
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,100
You have to do
the physical work yourself.

608
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,310
Should I serve you?

609
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,740
Good one.

610
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,510
Let me tell you, if anything happens,

611
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,990
both of us will be in trouble.

612
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,950
You're scaring me again.

613
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,580
You want me to massage you?

614
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,660
Dream on.

615
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,740
Okay. I think,

616
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,660
you're only doing useless things.

617
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,780
- You...
- Let me tell you.

618
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,180
Don't say useless things to me.

619
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,140
You...

620
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,070
Hey girl, do you want to dance with me?

621
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,260
Dance.

622
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,260
Are you lost?

623
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,830
Don't be afraid.

624
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,870
Have a drink with us.

625
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,660
We'll show you the way out.

626
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,220
Come on, girl.

627
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,580
Girl, you're strong.

628
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,580
Duke Su.

629
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,870
It's settled.

630
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:56,950
Well done.

631
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,430
No need. I can do the physical work.

632
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,180
Cut the crap.

633
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,620
Stay one foot away.

634
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,430
Put this on. Be quick.

635
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,620
Put it on.

636
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,550
Check.

637
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,940
[Chariot, soldier,
pawn, artillery, general]

638
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,550
Compared to your usual character,
this move seems to be

639
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,660
[Chariot, soldier, pawn, artillery, general]
quite radical.

640
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:50,140
There's low risk and high benefit.
I shouldn't be conservative.

641
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,300
Sometimes the risk may seem small,

642
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,070
[Soldier, pawn, general]
that's when you need to be more careful.

643
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:58,620
[Chariot]
Check again.

644
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:03,950
Mr. Ye.

645
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,580
[Duke Su is in Huaixiang.
Please instruct]

646
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:17,910
What happened?

647
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,260
Jiang Li and Xiao Heng are in Huaixiang.

648
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,390
The official gold mine

649
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,910
was discovered.

650
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,420
[Soldier, pawn, general]

651
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,300
How will you counter this move?

652
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,870
[Chariot, soldier, pawn, artillery, general]
I'm prepared.

653
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:42,740
Hurry up.

654
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,260
Work harder.

655
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,830
Don't slack off.

656
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,580
Hurry.

657
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,070
Hurry.

658
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:57,910
Hurry.

659
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,870
There was an earthquake
in Huaixiang three years ago.

660
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,030
Someone claimed

661
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:05,030
that it's harmful
to the mountain to mine here.

662
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,070
Hence this gold mine was closed down
by the Imperial Court.

663
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,660
But why...

664
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,070
What are you doing?

665
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:14,390
Get up.

666
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:15,870
You knew about this?

667
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,950
You came to Huaixiang
to investigate this gold mine.

668
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,740
But this is the gold mine
of the Imperial Court.

669
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,990
Unauthorized mining
is a crime of treason.

670
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,990
How would the local government
dare to do it?

671
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:30,580
Gold mine?

672
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:32,910
Hurry up.

673
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,510
Xue family of three.

674
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:40,390
Shen Yurong.

675
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:41,700
Eldest Princess.

676
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,430
Turns out all these are related.

677
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:45,700
Therefore,

678
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,300
