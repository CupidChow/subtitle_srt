to inform her in advance.

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,680
In my absence,

186
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,920
those from the Dai Country
may cause trouble.

187
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,920
I ask for Your Majesty's understanding.

188
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Sheng, you are truly a blessing
to our Great Yan.

189
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,400
Please come inside.

190
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,990
Your Majesty, after you.

191
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
It's been a long time.

192
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,230
You've lost weight.

193
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,230
I feel sorry for you.

194
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,440
During your absence from the capital,

195
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,280
I've been concerned about you.

196
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,870
But you always ignore me.

197
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,590
Don't you think it's unfair?

198
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,680
Wanning,

199
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,440
drop the act.

200
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,990
Sheng,

201
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,350
I've heard that His Majesty
has given you many rewards.

202
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,590
Leave us.

203
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,470
I want to talk
to the Eldest Princess alone.

204
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,630
Those worldly possessions

205
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,920
are just reminders
of His Majesty's grace,

206
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,040
urging me not to act recklessly.

207
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,110
I've endured in the north
for so many years,

208
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,660
not for those rewards.

209
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:10,830
Sheng,

210
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,950
are you planning to take action now?

211
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,660
You were easily deceived
with a fake pregnancy potion.

212
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,380
Having a child doesn't make one foolish.

213
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,740
If our relationship
with Li Zhongnan breaks,

214
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,190
how will our grand plan succeed?

215
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,740
Sheng, you are heroic
and exceptional now.

216
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,740
Now, you dare to blame me.

217
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,310
As if you've forgotten

218
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,500
how you fled the city in disgrace.

219
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,190
If it weren't for Xiao Minghan's
interference back then,

220
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,260
the one sitting on the throne today

221
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,070
wouldn't be Zhao Ye.

222
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,740
A remarkable figure like Xiao Minghan

223
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,380
has surprisingly raised
such a devoted son

224
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,620
who loves beautiful women but not power.

225
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,430
Let's go pay respects to Mother.

226
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,900
[Yong'an Pavilion]

227
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,340
[Tablet of Consort Li Yunxian]

228
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,620
Mother, wake up.

229
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,620
Mother, I will behave in the future.

230
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,710
[Consort Li]
Mother.

231
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,620
[Young Wanning. Young Lord Cheng]
Mother, you'll be fine.

232
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,430
I don't come from a prestigious family,

233
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,860
nor am I your father's favorite consort.

234
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,380
Although I was titled
as the Imperial Consort

235
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,350
since I gave birth to you,

236
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,710
I still had to be cautious

237
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,830
and vigilant.

238
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,710
I fear that a single misstep

239
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,660
would lead to being plotted against.

240
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,780
In this palace,

241
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,990
I've seen coldness and malice

242
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,990
[Tablet of Consort Li Yunxian]
and how heartless people can be.

243
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,140
After I'm gone,

244
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,950
you must support each other

245
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,380
and take care of yourselves.

246
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,740
Understand?

247
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,380
Understood.

248
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,430
Sheng. Jing.

249
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,500
Remember.

250
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,500
Survival in the palace
is about survival of the fittest.

251
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,780
Only through competition
can you survive.

252
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,070
[Tablet of Consort Li Yunxian]
Only supreme imperial power

253
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,110
can truly protect yourselves.

254
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,620
Grand Chancellor Li?

255
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
Lord Cheng,

256
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,190
Eldest Princess.

257
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,110
Tell me your plans.

258
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,070
The uprising will be
at tomorrow's evening banquet.

259
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,350
We need to divide our forces into four.

260
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,700
[Imperial Court]

261
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,950
You are wise, resourceful,
and give great contributions.

262
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,860
I will definitely reward you generously.

263
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,260
It's all thanks to the Eldest Princess's
strategic planning.

264
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,380
Official Li,
I don't understand these matters.

265
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,020
Sheng, let me introduce
someone to you.

266
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,900
You have a military advisor?

267
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,780
Sheng,

268
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,230
this is Shen Yurong,
whom I mentioned to you before.

269
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,100
Greetings, Lord Cheng.

270
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,100
Mr. Shen is wise and resourceful.

271
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,580
What position
are you currently ranked at?

272
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,910
A scholar at Hanlin Academy, Fifth Rank.

273
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,740
My younger brother really doesn't know
how to judge people.

274
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,300
Rest assured.

275
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,910
After this is done,
I will ensure your success.

276
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,230
Thank you, Your Majesty.

277
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,950
Long live Your Majesty.

278
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,860
[Imperial Court]

279
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,740
Is everything ready?

280
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,910
I have been waiting for eight years.

281
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,870
Finally, this day has come.

282
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,060
It feels somewhat surreal.

283
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,190
Li,

284
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,670
do you remember
the question you asked me

285
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,990
in the Court of Judicial Review prison?

286
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,670
I didn't answer that day.

287
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,340
Now, ask me again.

288
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,190
Duke Su,

289
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,020
do you have anyone who died unjustly?

290
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,190
Yes.

291
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,260
My father led the Longwu Army
all his life,

292
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,780
only to be abandoned outside the capital

293
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,260
by Lord Cheng for his own gain,

294
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,230
causing his death at the border.

295
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,430
I have also beaten the Dengwen Drum
outside the capital for him.

296
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,230
But I couldn't clear his name
at that time.

297
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,670
For these eight years,
I've been wondering.

298
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,670
What was my father thinking

299
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,020
before his unjust death?

300
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,470
Did he regret believing

301
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,740
in such ambitious
and treacherous people?

302
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,390
My father also loved the people
like his own children.

303
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,780
If General Xiao were still alive,

304
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,470
they would surely
share a drink and talk.

305
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:19,950
Xiao Heng,

306
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,740
you once told me

307
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,150
to look back at the cause,

308
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,740
seek justice and uphold righteousness.

309
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,820
I've done that.

310
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,710
The heavens are clear.

311
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,540
Karma will not be unjust.

312
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,230
I believe in the heavens.

313
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,820
General Xiao's spirit
in the heavens will bless you.

314
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,300
You've never believed in the heavens.

315
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,470
You only believe

316
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,390
in yourself.

317
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,500
No.

318
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,710
I also believe in you.

319
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,430
Please believe in me too.

320
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,430
Lord Cheng framed loyal ministers
and virtuous generals

321
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,100
for his own selfish gain.

322
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,580
Wanning tolerated corrupt officials

323
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,540
for the so-called power.

324
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,430
In their hearts,

325
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,300
it's not about the people,

326
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,630
but about power.

327
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,190
Regardless of whether it's divine will
or human nature,

328
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,390
it won't favor them.

329
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,780
Also,

330
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,260
I will not abandon you

331
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,950
no matter what.

332
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,540
[Jiang's Residence]

333
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,780
This morning, Ruoyao sent me a letter.

334
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,060
She said she's doing well in Yongzhou.

335
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,060
This child

336
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,230
also reminded me

337
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,910
not to overwork myself

338
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,100
and to delegate household matters to Li.

339
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,580
Unbelievable.

340
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,710
Mother,

341
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,470
I've been thinking a lot lately.

342
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,020
If I hadn't agreed
to be the Secretariat Director

343
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,390
for the late emperor back then,

344
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,580
would our Jiang family

345
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,990
be in a different situation now?

346
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,430
You are Ye's teacher.

347
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,300
All his knowledge comes from you.

348
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,300
His character
can truly benefit the people.

349
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,670
Now,

350
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,150
I'm about to place him

351
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,950
in the most dangerous position.

352
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,540
As for your position,

353
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,230
I

354
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,780
need to consider it too.

355
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,710
I will follow your edict.

356
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,060
I will appoint you
as the Secretariat Director.

357
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,340
After my death,

358
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,580
help him grow up

359
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,190
and help him stabilize

360
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,910
the imperial power.

361
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,580
Your Majesty,

362
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,990
I actually...

363
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,780
Accept it.

364
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,740
Old man,

365
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,150
continue your loyalty to him

366
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,670
as yours to me.

367
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,430
I am grateful

368
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,020
for your grace.

369
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,740
The higher the position,
the harsher it gets.

370
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,190
If I, as the Secretariat Director,

371
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,820
fail to protect the young emperor

372
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,630
and lead to a change in the throne,

373
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,500
it will bring disaster upon us.

374
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,100
If one becomes too domineering

375
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,780
and makes the monarch wary,

376
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,300
they will eventually have no place
to bury themselves.

377
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,060
So after the emperor
could handle state affairs himself,

378
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,260
I deliberately loosened my grip

379
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:59,260
and transferred power
to Li Zhongnan and others.

380
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,300
We target each other,

381
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,230
but also cover for each other.

382
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,470
It is all to stand firm and safely

383
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,540
in this capital.

384
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,710
I'm not blind

385
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,390
to what's happening in the family.

386
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,470
I just lack the ability

387
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,820
and time to manage it.

388
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,060
Leaving that aside,

389
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,540
even these younger generations at home,

390
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,540
with their losses

391
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,340
and injuries,

392
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,670
are ultimately my fault.

393
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,390
As long as you can understand that,
it's fine.

394
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,230
However,

395
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,910
you suddenly bring up the matters
of the court with me.

396
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,870
Does Lord Cheng return to the capital

397
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,540
with ill intentions?

398
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,630
What would you do

399
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,100
if

400
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,540
he rebelled?

401
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,870
I have long made a choice.

402
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,060
The late emperor entrusted me
with his legacy.

403
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,870
I won't let him down.

404
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,990
My visit today

405
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,870
is to let you prepare in advance.

406
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,260
In case

407
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,950
I am unable to withdraw from this.

408
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,710
Please take care
of the Jiang family for me.

409
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,820
With me here,

410
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,540
you can rest assured.

411
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,950
You've suffered

412
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,670
over the years.

413
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,060
Seeing you like this now,

414
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,870
I am reminded of someone.

415
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,870
Who's that?

416
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,740
My dear husband,

417
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,020
your son
has finally inherited your spirit.

418
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,870
Are you sure you heard it right?

419
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,540
There's going to be a rebellion.

420
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,990
How could I have misheard?

421
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,990
So

422
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,060
if Lord Cheng rebels,

423
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,020
whose side should we be on?

424
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,670
Lord Cheng's military achievements
in the northern regions are illustrious,

425
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,670
and he commands a strong army.

426
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,100
If a real conflict breaks out,

427
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,820
His Majesty stands no chance.

428
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,630
If His Majesty falls,

429
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,190
the first to suffer
will be our Jiang family.

430
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:23,870
No.

431
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,780
Quickly pack up

432
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,780
and go to your mother's house to hide.

433
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,500
Get rid of the Jiang family?

434
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,060
Excuse me.

435
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,300
Start packing!

436
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,630
Your Majesty,

437
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,020
Official Ye have arranged
all the preparations.

438
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,340
Tomorrow, Your Majesty will only need
to rise from sleep

439
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,870
and depart
from Taiji Hall at the hour of Yin.

440
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,950
[Govern the People, Serve Heaven]
Perform sacrificial rites at Wu hour,

441
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,260
review the troops at Wei hour,

442
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,580
and return to the palace
for the banquet at the hour of Xu.

443
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,060
Eunuch Su,

444
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,340
how many years have you been with me?

445
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,990
[Govern the People, Serve Heaven]
Since you ascended the throne,

446
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,260
it's been over ten years.

447
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,340
After tomorrow night,

448
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,260
I will reward you handsomely

449
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,870
if I'm still sitting in this chair.

450
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,910
[Govern the People, Serve Heaven]

451
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,950
I only wish
for Your Majesty's well-being and peace.

452
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,540
Your Majesty, Consort Li...

453
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,150
- Your Majesty.
- She...

454
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,340
I insist on coming back.

455
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,340
Eunuch Su, step back first.

456
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,950
Your Majesty,
don't hide anything from me.

457
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,820
Will Lord Cheng and others act tomorrow?

458
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,540
Or else why would you
suddenly want me to leave the palace?

459
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,430
That's not true.

460
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,580
Listen to me. You go first.

461
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,670
I won't leave.

462
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,630
I won't feel at ease if you don't go.

463
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,020
If even I am absent,

464
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,630
won't Lord Cheng become suspicious?

465
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,500
I must stay.

466
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,020
Do you know

467
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,950
what it means to stay
at tomorrow night's banquet?

468
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,390
It's precisely because I know

469
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,100
that I want to stay
by Your Majesty's side

470
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,300
and face it together.

471
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,780
I won't allow that.

472
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,260
Your Majesty.

473
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,500
Your Majesty,
if I fall into enemy hands,

474
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,820
I would rather die

475
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,820
than bring trouble to Your Majesty.

476
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,990
[Govern the People, Serve Heaven]
My dear.

477
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:27,220
[Govern the People, Serve Heaven]

478
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:37,420
[Tomb of the Great Emperor Xiao]

479
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,990
In the spring,

480
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,340
with solemn ceremonies,

481
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,500
we offer sacrifices and libations,

482
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,670
respectfully presenting offerings
at the ancestral temple

483
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,470
to express our admiration and longing.

484
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,430
We pay our respects,

485
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,390
perform ablution rituals,
offer incense, and honor the ancestors.

486
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,540
Since Father passed this throne to me,

487
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,340
at any time,

488
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,870
I will not allow anyone

489
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,820
to snatch this position away.

490
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,990
You old man,

491
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,020
you must carefully watch

492
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,670
who this world truly belongs to.

493
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,420
[Tomb of the Great Emperor Xiao]

494
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,230
It reads!

495
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,780
Establishing the way of heaven,
called Yin and Yang.

496
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,710
Establishing the way of earth,
called softness and firmness.

497
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,020
The teachings of saints and sages,
venerating heaven and earth.

498
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,100
A perpetual lamp in the long night.

499
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,990
Achieving great unity under heaven.

500
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,990
All of you, leave.

501
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,390
Yes, Your Highness.

502
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,540
[Late Emperor]

503
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,710
Father.

504
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,150
You've returned.

505
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,430
I'm glad.

506
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,500
Are you comforting me

507
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,670
or comforting yourself?

508
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,470
Do you know
what kind of days I experienced

509
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,710
when you sent me as a hostage
to the Dai Country?

510
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,990
Don't you know that?

511
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,260
I live in a sheep pen every day,

512
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,710
enduring humiliation,

513
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,260
going hungry, barely clothed.

514
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,390
Me?

515
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,150
A princess?

516
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,430
Father,

517
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,670
I'm not even worthy
of being called a human.

518
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,990
I'm just the dirt in the sheep pen.

519
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,260
My dear Jing,

520
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,230
you've suffered so much.

521
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,820
Actually, I think of you all the time.

522
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,540
I spent in the Dai Country.

523
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,230
I fantasized every day that one day,

524
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,230
you would come to the Dai Country
to take me home.

525
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,870
I fantasized every day

526
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,950
that you would love me,
cherish me, and hold me

527
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,540
like you did when I was little.

528
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,260
Your daughter has returned.

529
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,740
The Eldest Princess Wanning has returned.

530
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,340
I have

531
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,340
let you down.

532
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,340
Father, I also want to ask you this.

533
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,990
Besides loving yourself

534
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,580
and your son,

535
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,060
have you ever loved me
for a day in your life?

536
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,780
Jing, don't say anything anymore.

537
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,500
When they made such demands back then,

538
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,300
they put me in a difficult situation.

539
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,670
I had no choice.

540
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,340
Father, I asked

541
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,100
if you have ever loved me.

542
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,470
Father,

543
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,540
you should take your medicine.

544
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,260
After taking the medicine,

545
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,580
you will naturally recover.

546
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,020
The pillow is dirty.

547
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,670
Let me change it for you.

548
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,300
Here.

549
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,230
Jing. Please, Jing.

550
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:44,820
Father.

551
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,220
Father,

552
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,500
you were the one who wronged me first.

553
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,100
All of you owe me this.

554
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,700
I heard that your northern army
is incredibly brave

555
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,910
and renowned far and wide.

556
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,350
The people welcomed you on your way
into the capital.

557
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,030
With the northern army,

558
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,180
our Great Yan can continue
for generations.

559
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,100
Thanks to Your Majesty's protection.

560
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,430
We're one, be it the northern army
or the Zhongyuan army.

561
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,990
There is no distinction.

562
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,790
Sheng, go back and rest for a while.

563
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,990
Don't leave until you're not drunk
at the banquet tonight.

564
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,790
Duke Su.

565
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,510
It has been almost nine years
since we last met.

566
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,060
I can't believe you're this tall now.

567
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,470
I remember when I left the capital,

568
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,100
you were only this tall.

569
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,740
If your parents are still alive,

570
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,030
they would feel comforted

571
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,350
to see you now.

572
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,060
My father had bad luck

573
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,220
and couldn't survive on the battlefield.

574
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,470
If he could see your achievements now,

575
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,310
he would also be very pleased.

576
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,350
I have to thank General Xiao.

577
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,510
If he hadn't come to support
from the southern border back then,

578
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,260
I wouldn't have been able to make amends

579
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,390
and reclaim lost territory.

580
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,580
It's a pity.

581
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,310
He died with an arrow piercing his heart

582
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,870
in the valley.

583
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,430
I'm also

584
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,310
deeply saddened by it.

585
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,470
It's all old history.

586
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,950
There's no need to bring it up.

587
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,620
Master wouldn't listen to advice.

588
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,060
I always said not to pursue
the defeated enemy relentlessly.

589
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,390
He clearly had the chance to turn back.

590
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,470
But he insisted on going to the end.

591
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,220
It's truly regrettable.

592
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,700
I hope

593
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,910
you won't repeat

594
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,700
my master's mistakes.

595
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,990
I don't like taking risks.

596
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,030
Stability is the most important thing.

597
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,740
Why fight with oneself?

598
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,100
At the banquet,

599
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,100
I will humbly seek advice
from you again.

600
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,030
I hope to see you again later.

601
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,580
Of course.

602
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,830
Fate has never been kind to me
since I was young.

603
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,140
As they say, surviving a great calamity
brings great fortune.

604
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,390
I escaped death once before.

605
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,030
If there's good fortune to come,

606
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,030
please give that fortune to Xiao Heng.

607
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,860
[Duke Su's Residence]

608
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,830
I need some of you
to keep watch at the west court.

609
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,100
The rest keep watch at the east court.

610
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,830
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

611
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,580
Is something going to happen?

612
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,350
Why is the residence heavily guarded?

613
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,990
Mr. Xue, please rest assured.

614
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,470
It's just a regular drill
in the residence.

615
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,510
It's about preventing problems
before they occur.

616
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,180
Are my sister and the others doing well?

617
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,870
Don't keep it from me.

618
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,060
With your actions, you can't fool me.

619
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,870
You only need to stay in the residence.

620
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,910
We have made the arrangements
regarding Miss Xue.

621
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,870
There are secret guards both inside
and outside the residence

622
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,580
to ensure nothing unexpected happens.

623
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,310
Move out!

624
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,390
I'll be counting on you tonight.

625
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,660
Don't worry.

626
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,470
Duke Su has everything arranged.

627
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,350
The secret guards will keep watch
outside the Jiang's Residence.

628
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,390
Master.

629
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,220
I was just looking for you. Zhao Ke.

630
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,140
I was away from home
for a few days, right?

631
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,060
No one took care of the plants
in the garden.

632
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,180
I noticed one of the plants having
some issues earlier.

633
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,430
Can you go over and take a look?

634
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,260
Old Madam called for me
because she needed something.

635
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,060
I can't get you
to help me right now, can I?

636
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,220
I'll go with you.

637
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,870
Look at this.

638
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,140
How can this perfectly good plant
look so wilted?

639
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,140
It's such a shame.

640
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,470
This is the only memory
my mother left for me.

641
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,950
You must help me save it.

642
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,510
I think I smell something rotten.

643
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,220
Are the roots decaying inside?

644
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,220
Take a sniff.

645
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,660
Based on its appearance,

646
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,180
it's probably been exposed
to the sun for too long.

647
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,660
I'll move it to a shady spot,

648
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,470
water it regularly,
and add some fertilizer.

649
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,620
It should revive after a few days.

650
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,910
No, that's not it.

651
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,390
It must be the roots rotting.

652
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,430
Come closer and smell.

653
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,510
Come over and smell.

654
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,620
Sir, Old Madam is still waiting for me.

655
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,470
I need to take leave now.

656
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,310
Zhao Ke!

657
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,830
My Lady, a letter
from the Duke's Residence.

658
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,830
[Something important to discuss.
Make haste to the Duke's Residence.]

659
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,870
My Lady, could something have happened?

660
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,260
The Duke asked me to come
to his residence urgently.

661
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,700
He said there's something important
to discuss.

662
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,350
Why is he asking
to see you at this time?

663
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,430
Maybe you should go tomorrow instead.

664
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,910
At a critical moment like this,

665
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,870
he must have urgent matters

666
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,660
to share with me.

667
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,580
Bai Xue, leave for now.

668
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,510
Yes, My Lady.

669
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,220
Accompany me to the Duke's Residence.

670
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:31,790
Yes.

671
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,620
I wonder if this is
about my father or Zhao.

672
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,140
Zhao Ke, how long until we arrive?

673
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,140
My Lady, we'll arrive in a quarter-hour.

674
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,140
Second Lady Jiang?

675
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,910
My Lady, do you have any instructions?

676
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,260
My Lady.

677
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,830
Could it be this Zhao Ke...

678
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,140
Zhao Ke,

679
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,260
you usually deliver letters
from the Duke's Residence.

680
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,260
Why did you give one to Bai Xue today?

681
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,540
I was helping tidy the garden
in the afternoon.

682
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,950
Maybe the messenger couldn't find me.

683
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,470
He's indeed suspicious.

684
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:20,470
Stop the carriage.

685
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:29,580
Watch your steps.

686
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,060
Zhao Ke, wait here.

687
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,220
I need to buy something.

688
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,390
It looks like you've figured me out.

689
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,470
Let me go! Help!

690
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,660
Help!

691
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:53,950
Help!

692
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:56,660
Let me go!

693
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:58,830
Let me go!

694
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,540
How does it feel
to relive your past experience?

695
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,620
Who was he?

696
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,790
Nobody has been able

697
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,350
to see through his skills
in mimicking voices and disguising.

698
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,100
But you

699
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,990
are pretty impressive.

700
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,740
What do you want by catching me?

701
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,540
Of course, I need to settle the scores
of your plan

702
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,140
about faking my pregnancy.

703
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,660
But I can wait until Xiao Heng arrives.

704
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,220
So he can watch your end with me.

705
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:47,950
What do you think?

706
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,220
He even handed over the Longwu Army.

707
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,220
He's no longer a threat
to all of you anymore.

708
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,660
Why are you still not letting him go?

709
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,140
You're in a perilous situation yourself.

710
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,470
Yet, you're still worried about him.

711
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,100
Your genuine emotions

712
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,100
really make one want to shed tears.

713
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,310
Do you know
what it's like to lose a child?

714
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,060
Do you know how painful it is

715
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,470
to have one's hopes shattered?

716
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:16,220
I don't know.

717
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,430
But I do know what it feels like
to be buried alive

718
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:21,910
by someone I loved and trusted.

719
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,220
Sometimes,

720
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,910
I quite like you, Xue Fangfei.

721
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,510
If it weren't for Shen Yurong,

722
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,870
we could have been friends.

723
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,950
I'll never be friends

724
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,220
with someone as despicable as you.

725
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,740
I know you're trying to provoke me.

726
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,990
But before Xiao Heng arrives,

727
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,870
I won't lay a finger on you.

728
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,790
I only want to see both
of you suffer together.

729
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,030
You call me despicable?

730
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,510
If you were in my shoes,

731
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,030
you might be even more ruthless.

732
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,030
You and Shen Yurong
are truly a perfect match.

733
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:01,790
You use the same excuses
to justify yourselves.

734
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,700
That's why I like him.
