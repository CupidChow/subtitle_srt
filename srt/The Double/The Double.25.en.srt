leave those people to see me.

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,630
Mrs. Jiang.

190
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,590
Do you think
this Jiang Li is the real one?

191
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,830
Old Madam and Master Jiang said she is.

192
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,870
It means you recognized this daughter.

193
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,590
So I have to blame you,

194
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,080
the mistress of the family,

195
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,160
for my house arrest.

196
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,830
If our daughter was wrong,

197
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,710
it's of course our fault as her parents.

198
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,400
But Jiang Li
hasn't been with me since young,

199
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,160
and she isn't my biological daughter.

200
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,920
It's naturally harder to manage her.

201
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,200
If you want to blame me,

202
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,830
please also be considerate of me.

203
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,370
It must be hard

204
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,060
to be a stepmother.

205
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,610
Do you need my help?

206
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,490
She's the daughter
of Jiang family after all.

207
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,130
If she's not taught well,

208
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,370
her future doing is going to

209
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,730
harm the entire family.

210
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,770
I would be very thankful

211
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,730
for your advice.

212
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,610
There was a ghost in the palace.

213
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,370
Some people in the palace
were possessed and died tragically.

214
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,370
Everyone was panicking.

215
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,340
The Imperial Diviner
was asked to remove the impurities.

216
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,460
It was found that a concubine
was possessed by an evil spirit.

217
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,340
His Majesty sentenced her to death

218
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,100
to calm the chaos in the palace.

219
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,650
Do you think Jiang Li

220
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,650
is also possessed by an evil spirit?

221
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,890
After listening to what you said,

222
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,850
I also think it's odd.

223
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,460
Not just me,

224
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,340
even the elders at home

225
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,650
think Jiang Li became another person

226
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,770
after coming back from Zhennyu Hall.

227
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,420
When I think about it now,

228
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,370
it's just as you said.

229
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,220
Not to mention other matters,

230
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,460
since Jiang Li is back,

231
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,460
the third daughter of our family

232
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,370
who was a smart girl

233
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,180
is now behaving like she lost her mind.

234
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,250
I understand your hardship.

235
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,580
Your family can't stay restless.

236
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,010
I told the Imperial Diviner
what happened in Jiang family.

237
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,680
He likes to help

238
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,350
and is willing to exorcise
for Jiang family.

239
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,160
But having an exorcism
at home is a big matter.

240
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,710
Grand Chancellor Jiang
and Old Madam Jiang

241
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,110
need to agree with this.

242
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,400
Telling them the pros and cons

243
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,590
shouldn't be too hard for you, right?

244
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,400
It's for your family's sake after all.

245
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,990
Thank you for your advice,
Your Highness.

246
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,510
Have a cup of tea.

247
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,080
Imperial Diviner,

248
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,630
is your turn next.

249
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,420
[Imperial Diviner]

250
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,200
I'll be at Her Highness' service.

251
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,440
We shall wait for your good news.

252
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,590
Let's take action.

253
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,800
Yes, sir.

254
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,350
The Heaven's will is violated.
Great punishments will come.

255
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,110
The Heaven's will is violated.
Great punishments will come.

256
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,590
When did this happen?

257
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
It happened last night.

258
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,200
The cause of the fire
is yet to be determined.

259
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,220
People who passed by here
witnessed the whole process.

260
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,460
It's said that it was very strange.

261
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,580
Other than these three,
are there any other casualties?

262
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:16,730
No.

263
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,580
Only the three of them.

264
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,490
Heaven's will must have been violated.

265
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,700
- Clear this up.
- Yes, sir.

266
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,730
It must be relevant
to the house arrest of Eldest Princess.

267
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,300
It's said
that His Majesty is fear of Lord Cheng.

268
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,890
So he found an excuse to put her sister

269
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,100
in captivity.

270
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,890
Lord Cheng is stabilizing
the border in the north

271
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,730
and fighting off the enemy.

272
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,700
His sister should be treated well.

273
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,530
That's right.

274
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,220
This is

275
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,700
indeed not a benevolent policy.

276
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,650
My Lord.

277
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,130
The coroner took the corpses back.

278
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,060
The concrete situation

279
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,820
needs more time to be investigated.

280
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,730
Someone must have done it deliberately.

281
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,420
Find out the truth
soon to stop the rumors.

282
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,300
Yes, sir.

283
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,420
Someone is being restless.

284
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,370
It seems the capital is about to change.

285
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,580
Should I send a message
to Second Lady Jiang

286
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,820
so she'll go out less?

287
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,250
Let's go.

288
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,850
Do you think he meant

289
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,940
yes or no?

290
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,370
If he didn't want you to go,

291
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,850
he would send you back to lead the army.

292
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,770
That's right.

293
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,060
I bet

294
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,770
he's still angry with Second Lady Jiang.

295
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,300
Even when he thinks about her,

296
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,940
he doesn't want to say it out loud.

297
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,650
Miss, a stew.

298
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,730
Miss, Duke Su sent a letter saying

299
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,100
that it's not peaceful recently.

300
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,610
He told you not to go out so much.

301
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,700
No wonder they're getting restless

302
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,420
after the court discussion.

303
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,340
But fortunately,

304
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,940
Master Jiang and Old Madam Jiang

305
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,980
are on your side.

306
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,490
When you didn't come back
for the welcome banquet,

307
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,050
Ji Shuran wanted to take the opportunity

308
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,090
to degrade you.

309
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,570
I didn't expect
Master Jiang and Old Madam

310
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,730
to put in good words for you.

311
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,380
At the Imperial Court,

312
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,980
Eldest Princess forced Grand Chancellor Jiang
to open the coffin and examine the bones.

313
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,090
He refused and took the knife for me.

314
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,530
Right now

315
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,460
he isn't likely
to pursue my identity at the moment.

316
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,530
But he's starting to doubt

317
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,860
my identity.

318
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,860
To Ji Shuran,

319
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,860
this is the best time
for her to deal with me.

320
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,330
But even Eldest Princess
can't do anything to us,

321
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,530
we don't fear them.

322
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,700
Eldest Princess has made
a killing move against me.

323
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,330
Although we survived that,

324
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,530
she won't give up.

325
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,860
Despite being put under house arrest,

326
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,220
she'll still find a way to kill me.

327
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,330
Tong, in this situation

328
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,860
we're surrounded.

329
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,380
Are you afraid?

330
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,220
Miss, I'm not afraid.
I haven't been afraid since awhile.

331
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,220
I think we're fortunate enough

332
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,700
to come this far.

333
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,180
Not only that I'm not afraid,
I'm feeling excited.

334
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,570
Even if we can't make it to the end,

335
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,810
I would like to move forward more

336
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,050
to see more bad people get punished.

337
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,090
I think it's worth it.

338
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,570
We'll surely make it to the end.

Mrs. Jiang, you've come.

361
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,620
I came to see you
upon Eldest Princess' instruction.

362
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,490
I noticed that you're interested
in that painting.

363
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,570
I'm not interested.

364
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,660
But this painting

365
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,900
is very similar to a painting

366
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,290
of my previous painter.

367
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,250
Are you still
in contact with that painter?

368
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,330
He passed away in an accident.

369
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,290
Was it an accident
or was it caused by men?

00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,530
You...

373
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,940
You're Liu Wencai.

374
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,290
Impossible.

375
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,770
Impossible.

376
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,620
You thought that fire

377
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,460
can make me disappear in this world.

378
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,250
Wencai.

379
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,220
You're still painting me.

380
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,050
I can only paint with my left hand now.

381
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,770
How was your life

382
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,250
in the past years?

383
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,420
I used up all my savings

384
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,730
to open a little shop in my hometown.

385
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,330
I painted and I sold my paintings.

386
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,980
I thought the fellow villagers

387
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,290
would care for me.

388
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,010
I didn't expect them
to bully me even more

389
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,380
when they saw that I was disabled.

390
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,220
When someone
wanted to tear your painting,

391
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,380
I struggled to defend it.

392
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,140
I hit him out of anger

393
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,050
and got into a lawsuit because of that.

394
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,290
I couldn't stay in my hometown anymore.

395
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,570
So I could only come see you
in the capital with my paintings.

396
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,530
Since you knew that I'm Mrs. Jiang now,

397
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,620
you shouldn't have come to see me.

398
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,570
I thought you wouldn't come.

399
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,860
But you came.

400
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,380
Shuran.

401
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,660
You want to kill me?

402
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,860
You shouldn't have come to see me.

403
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,570
I don't owe you anything.

404
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,420
Shuran.

405
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,090
Shuran.

406
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,810
Shuran.

407
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,220
Shuran.

408
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,980
Shuran, come back.

409
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,180
Ji Shuran, come back.

410
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,980
Ji Shuran.

411
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,620
Let go of me.

412
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,900
Look at me.

413
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,290
Look at me.

414
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,770
I tried to protect my face
with my hands

415
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,660
in that fire.

416
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,220
I thought

417
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,980
if I could survive,

418
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,770
I needed to make sure
you can recognize me.

419
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,090
But that was good.

420
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,050
If you didn't intent to kill me,

421
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,980
I wouldn't have
the same experience as today.

422
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,460
You went to see Eldest Princess

423
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,380
to tell her about
the evil deeds in Jiang family.

424
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,810
You want revenge on me.

425
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,770
If I wanted revenge on you,

426
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,490
I wouldn't have waited until today.

427
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,810
It has been so many years.

428
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,940
Why do you only appear now?

429
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,770
Your life has been a smooth sail.

430
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,220
Even if I found you,

431
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,290
I couldn't have made you
do anything for me.

432
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,010
But right now

433
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,050
you finally need to beg me.

434
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,570
I can get rid of Jiang Li for you.

435
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,570
Let's see if you're willing.

436
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,730
Madam, you're back.

437
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,530
Madam.

438
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,530
What happened to you?

439
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,730
I'm fine. I would like to be alone.

440
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,050
Take a break.

441
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:04,900
Madam.

442
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,770
I'm fine. Leave.

443
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,530
Leave!

444
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,860
Leave now.

445
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,860
[Jiang's Residence]

446
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,330
My Lady.

447
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:10,340
[Jiang's Residence]

448
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,010
Didn't Mr. Zhou come?

449
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,220
No.

450
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,700
Serves her right.

451
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,700
Her husband didn't come back
to see his mother-in-law with her.

452
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,330
Does she think she's favored?

453
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,260
Has he sent anything over recently?

454
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,290
Mr. Zhou did send things for awhile.

455
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,810
But Madam Sun stopped it.

456
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,900
Since you didn't respond,

457
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,420
he stopped sending.

458
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:42,810
Yes, My Lady.

459
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,770
Fourth Lady is funny.

460
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,900
So what that she's back?

461
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,180
What is there to brag about?

462
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,660
Madam.

463
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:06,900
Is Zhou Yanbang
still sending things to Ruoyao?

464
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,180
Yes.

465
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,180
I'm on guard.

466
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,020
Have Mr. Qi propose marriage
as soon as possible.

467
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,770
If Ruoyao continues
to entangle with Zhou Yanbang,

468
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,180
sooner or later
something bad will happen.

469
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,220
Madam.

470
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,220
You look horrible.

471
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,850
I'm fine.

472
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,900
Let me get you a physician.

473
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,980
No need. I'm alright.

474
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,580
What a great daughter.

475
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,340
Put it there.

476
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,100
She brought back so many things.

477
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,060
Put them here.

478
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,460
Open them.

479
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,740
[Loyalty and Generosity]

480
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,660
Put them at the side.

481
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,020
Aren't these gifts

482
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,770
your dowry?

483
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,490
It must have been a mistake.

484
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,010
I got many presents in Zhou family.

485
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,420
Keep them first.

486
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,090
I'll bring them next time.

487
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,860
Yu'e, is Zhou family
really treating you well?

488
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,140
Didn't they mistreat you?

489
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,250
Don't worry, Mother. I'm well.

490
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,420
It's all because my rank is too low.

491
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,940
And I'm a concubine's son.

492
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,570
I've incriminated you.

493
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,380
If your in-laws
give you a cold shoulder,

494
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,290
you should...

495
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,090
What happened?

496
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:30,530
Nothing.

497
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:31,810
Let me see it.

498
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,140
Let me see it.

499
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,420
What happened?

500
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,770
Nothing. I fell.

501
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,490
This isn't an injury from a fall.

502
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,730
Mother, lower your voice.

503
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,900
Zhou Yanbang hit you?

504
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,460
My husband...

505
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:54,290
I'm going back to my parents' house
tomorrow. Can you...

506
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,250
Shut up!

507
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:01,460
I said I don't want to see you.

508
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,020
Jiang Li.

509
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,850
Jiang Li is back?

510
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:18,740
Yes.

511
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,770
Jiang Li is back.

512
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,500
Jiang Li is back.

513
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,020
What does it have to do with you?

514
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,740
Isn't Jiang Ruoyao enough?

515
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,420
Are you still thinking about Jiang Li?

516
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,220
Go away!

517
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,220
If you didn't get onto my bed,

518
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,050
Jiang Li and I

519
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,420
wouldn't end up like this.

520
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,060
Tramp!

521
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,300
How good do you think Jiang Li is?

522
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,470
The note you gave to Jiang Li

523
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,540
was given to me by her personally.

524
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,060
You thought she liked you? Dream on.

525
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,190
That was just your wishful thinking.

526
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,780
What do you mean?

527
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,870
What happened?

528
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,350
Make it clear to me.

529
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,180
It was she
who planned for me to see you.

530
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:18,100
I didn't tell you
because she's my sister.

531
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,500
She doesn't care for you at all.

532
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,660
That's why she pushed me to you.

533
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,170
Nice one, Jiang Li.

534
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,090
As long as I bear his child

535
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,940
and give birth to a boy,

536
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,380
I'll become the mistress of Zhou family.

537
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,500
Everything will be fine.

538
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,100
My Lady.

539
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,470
Mr. Zhou isn't treating Jiang Yu'e well.

540
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,910
Those presents weren't from Zhou family.

541
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,830
It was the dowry of Jiang Yu'e.

542
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,660
I knew it.

543
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,700
He would never fall for Jiang Yu'e.

544
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,700
Mr. Zhou seems to have mentioned
about Second Lady.

545
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,540
Jiang Yu'e also said,
for the palace banquet

546
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,750
- Mr. Zhou wanted to invite Second...
- Impossible.

547
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,750
He must still be thinking about me.

548
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,620
Madam.

549
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,660
Leave the room.

550
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,470
Yes, Madam.

551
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,750
Yao.

552
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,580
I've arranged a marriage

553
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,430
for you with Qi family.

554
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,910
Let's meet him together.

555
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,990
Mr. Qi is handsome.

556
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,470
You two would get along well.

557
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,990
I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?

558
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,020
I heard you.

559
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,220
Do you know

560
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,270
how many families
I was inquiring for you?

561
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,540
You just broke off
an engagement and have a bad name.

562
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,140
It wasn't easy
to find you another good partner.

563
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,790
Qi family has a high status.

564
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,470
That child is also a good person.

565
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,870
You should be more attentive.

566
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,430
Get yourself changed.

567
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,870
I'm tired today.
Let's do it another day.

568
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,390
What happened to you recently?

569
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,310
You're not dressed well.

570
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,950
You also haven't been eating well.

571
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,870
You look like you're half dead.

572
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,140
I can't go today.

573
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,540
I'm very tired.

574
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,660
Then we'll go in a few days.

575
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,100
You have to go anyway.

576
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,660
Does it matter if I go?

577
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,700
Isn't this all decided?

578
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,180
What is this?

579
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,180
[Flower in the Day and Moon at Night]
What are you doing, Mother?

580
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,030
Mother.

581
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,350
Mother.

582
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,700
Eternity may come to an end.

583
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,580
[Bang]
This hatred will never end.

584
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,390
You're still in touch
with Zhou Yanbang behind my back.

585
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,950
This is none of your business.

586
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:15,990
Madam Sun.

587
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,510
Yes, Madam?

588
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,260
Bring over the new clothes for Ruoyao.

589
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,580
You have to see Mr. Qi

590
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,260
in two days.

591
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,060
Mother.

592
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,700
Mother.

593
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,180
If you don't listen to me this time,

594
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,430
I'll assume
I've never given birth to you.

595
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,350
Li.

596
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,260
Yu'e.

597
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,990
Long time no see.

598
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,540
I was in a rush.

599
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,540
I haven't had time to thank you yet.

600
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,740
There's nothing to thank.

601
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,310
No reward without merit.

602
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,220
Why wouldn't you have merits?

603
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,390
Without you,

604
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,620
I wouldn't be married to Zhou family.

605
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,030
If in the future

606
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,740
I become the mistress of Zhou family,

607
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,310
I'll definitely come back to thank you.

608
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,030
I'm back.

609
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,990
Yu'e.

610
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,540
She's ignoring me.

611
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:22,950
Rui.

612
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,830
I'm back.

613
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,030
Let me tell you.

614
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,620
The disaster in Dingzhou is over.

615
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,310
Liu Xu and her father
are cleaning up the mess.

616
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,870
We're worshiping our ancestors,

617
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,540
so I came back.

618
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,580
I heard about it.

619
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,100
Your story was thrilling.

620
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,790
It was such a shame that I wasn't around

621
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,870
when this happened.

622
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,740
If you really wanted to witness it,
you wouldn't go to Dingzhou.

623
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,220
What are you talking about?
How is it possible?

624
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,740
You came back suddenly,

625
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,430
because you made Liu Xu mad

626
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,310
and was chased back.

627
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,910
What are you talking about?
How is it possible?

628
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,030
Am I that kind of person?

629
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,830
- Impossible.
- You're that kind of person.

630
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,990
Did Liu Xu tell you
something in a letter?

631
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,950
Tell me.

632
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,950
Jiang Jingrui, do you know?

633
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,310
Men and women
shouldn't touch each other.

634
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,620
Tell me.

635
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,390
No way.

636
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,620
No way.

637
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,430
I'm nervous.

638
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,700
- Tell me, hurry.
- No, I'm not telling.

639
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,660
Why

640
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,510
can't I even decide my lover?

641
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,310
My Lady.

642
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,060
A letter from Mr. Zhou.

643
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:37,580
Why would he...

644
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,140
Today at Hai hour,

645
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,700
please meet me at the back alley.

646
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,430
My Lady, don't be reckless.

647
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,060
Mrs. Jiang is trying
to match you up with Mr. Qi.

648
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,060
If it's found...

649
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,660
Besides,

650
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,580
Mr. Zhou hasn't written you for awhile.

651
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,260
He suddenly asked for you.

652
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,620
He didn't come officially,

653
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,660
yet he asked you out.

654
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,220
You don't get it.
He always thinks about me.

655
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,140
My Lady.

656
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,260
Did you touch the thing in my box?

657
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,100
No.

658
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,740
Has anyone been here today?

659
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,660
Madam Sun came
to send you these new clothes.

660
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,390
She said Madam Ji
especially tailor made them

661
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,140
for the meeting
with Qi family in three days.

662
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,830
She told you to keep them well.

663
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,510
She also told you
to carefully think about the meeting.

664
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,540
Don't think too much.

665
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,990
It's Mother.

666
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,740
She took my hairpin.

667
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,390
My Lady.

668
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,990
Do you think you can make me
stop thinking about it

669
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,950
by doing so?

670
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,390
Dream on.

671
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,580
Madam.

672
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,140
I saw Young Master
went out to see Jiang Ruoyao.

673
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,350
Madam.

674
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,540
If this gets out of hand,
no one will be benefited.

675
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,510
Besides, Young Master said

676
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,100
that he's sleeping in the study.

677
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,310
I get it. Leave.

678
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,220
It's time for me to sleep.

679
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:29,950
Yes, Madam.

680
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:49,990
Yao.

681
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,830
Honey.

682
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,140
I made an appointment
with the tailor from Ruixiang Store

683
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,350
to make you new clothes.

684
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,430
Or

685
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,510
should I get the tailor here

686
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,260
so you don't have to go there?

687
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,830
I told the cooks
to make this especially for you.

688
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,350
Here. Have another one.

689
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,180
Am I a pig? You're feeding me too much.

690
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,740
Honey, where are you going?

691
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,580
Don't bother me.

692
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,910
I knew that you went out last night.

693
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,220
What did you say?

694
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,580
Why don't I ask you

695
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,740
what you're up to?

696
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,180
You don't care about our relationship.

697
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,790
Why did you have to see Jiang Ruoyao?

698
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,870
Isn't it good to have a stable life

699
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:49,790
with me?

700
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,990
How dare you follow me?

701
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,140
I'm warning you,

702
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,470
don't tell anyone
what happened last night.

703
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,660
Otherwise I won't forgive you.

704
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:13,910
Honey.

705
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,470
You're learning medicine

706
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,950
to treat Magistrate Xue?

707
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,310
It's good to learn medicine.

708
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,740
By the way, let me tell you something.

709
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,870
Jiang Ruoyao went on a blind date today.

710
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,740
She went there
and came back with a long face.

711
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,060
It seems she has upset Qi family.

712
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,740
Ji Shuran went into her yard

713
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,260
and hasn't come out for hours.

714
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,390
She must be scolding her now.

715
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:46,620
I didn't expect Jiang Ruoyao to be...

716
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,260
Stupid.

717
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:48,700
What did you say?

718
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:52,260
It's normal to be blinded by love.

719
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,430
It's stupid when it's not worth it.

720
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,580
But Jiang Ruoyao is quite pitiful.

721
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,430
According to Ji Shuran's character,

722
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,910
even if it doesn't work out
with Qi family,

723
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:03,540
there'll be

724
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,790
Zhang family and Wang family to come.

725
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,030
If she doesn't know how to resist,

726
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,660
she can't blame anyone.

727
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,260
Do you think everyone is like you?

728
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,430
Acting recklessly.

729
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,030
But that's good.

730
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,620
When they're busy,

731
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,060
they don't have time to bother you.

732
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,870
The coroner has done the examination.

733
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:26,910
Nothing unusual is found.

734
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,620
The cause of ghost light
is unknown for now.

735
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,620
It's written
in "Records of Diverse Matters"

736
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,580
that at the site of wars and death

737
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,870
human and horses blood
turned into phosphorus.

738
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,620
Phosphorus is like dew
on the ground, grass and trees.

739
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:38,870
It's almost invisible.

740
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,700
When someone touches it,

741
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,660
his body will illuminate.

742
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,580
Rotting wood and corpses

743
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,870
may spontaneously combust

744
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,910
and produce a ghost light phenomenon.

745
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,100
The so-called supernatural

746
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,830
is just people playing tricks.

747
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,390
I see.

748
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,140
The ghost fire was man-made.

749
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,540
Those who were burned
to death must have been instructed.

750
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,430
Otherwise, they wouldn't say
those things.

751
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,540
Investigate the whereabouts
of the deceased before they died.

752
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,700
Find the similarities.

753
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:15,740
Yes, sir.

754
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,310
The ghost fire is just a trigger.

755
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,950
The real show is yet to come.
