[The Double]

16
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,020
[Episode 29]

17
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,000
What a useless fool she is.

18
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,750
After all my years of careful nurture,

19
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,270
she was pushed to the edge
by a young girl.

20
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,800
She even wanted to cut off my hand

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,720
and kneel to apologize to Liu Wencai.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,030
She must have gone mad.

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,360
You dare to speak of nurturing us?

24
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,910
Since we were young,

25
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,190
you've always treated my sister and me

26
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,830
as tools to gain power.

27
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,800
If not for your careful nurture,

28
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,390
would Shuran

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,480
have gone mad?

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,150
Do you even see me as your father?

31
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,240
Do you even remember
that you're a father?

32
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,640
Then you should do

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,920
what a father should do.

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,870
What do you mean?

35
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,200
Write a letter to the emperor
and resign from your position.

36
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,520
Say it's your fault
for not teaching your children well

37
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,080
and that you're willing to become a monk

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,800
and pray for the dead
to atone for your sins.

39
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,270
Are you crazy?

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,320
Why should I do that?

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,670
To save Shuran.

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
To save her,

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,390
you're willing to abandon your father?

44
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,430
You'll only stay
in the temple temporarily.

45
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,080
After the dust has settled,

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,710
I'll find a way to bring you back,

47
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,040
and you can continue
your luxurious life.

48
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,830
It's easy for you to say.

49
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,390
This incident has caused
such a commotion.

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,830
Who knows how long
I have to stay at the temple

51
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,480
before things settle down?

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,550
If you don't help her,

53
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,360
you'll lose more than just a daughter.

54
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,550
You...

55
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,040
Old Madam, the medicine is ready.

56
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,830
It will be delivered tonight
at the Hour of Xu.

57
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,920
Everything

58
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,360
is all my fault.

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,870
I thought

60
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,110
I managed the Jiang family well.

61
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,590
But I still let the Ye family fall
into the Ji family's trap.

62
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,550
Poor Zhenzhen left too early,

63
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,430
leaving Li behind
is already pitiful enough.

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,240
Yet, I didn't believe her.

65
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,270
The claims of matricide and fratricide

66
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,670
were thrown at her,

67
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,150
which filled her with despair
and disappointment.

68
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,960
Now that I think of it,

69
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,960
it was absolutely absurd.

70
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,830
Old Madam,
don't blame yourself too much.

71
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,000
Back when Madam Ye was alive,

72
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,560
Madam Ji was still an outsider.

73
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,560
No matter how careful you were,

74
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,390
you couldn't guard against outsiders.

75
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,200
Don't comfort me.

76
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,830
A mistake is a mistake.

77
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,830
Old Madam, Second Lady is here.

78
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,120
Li, you should get more rest.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,710
Grandmother,

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,590
I want to know

81
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,910
what will happen to Madam Ji?

82
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,470
Your father and I have discussed it.

83
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,320
We've prepared the medicine.

84
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,590
It will be given to her later.

85
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,680
All right.

86
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,200
I can go and see her off.

87
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,910
I have a few final words to say to her.

88
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,590
At the Hour of Xu tonight,

89
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,230
you can go then.

90
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,790
Thank you, Grandmother.

91
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,830
Li.

92
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,390
Li.

93
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,440
I've done you wrong.

94
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,520
I know you've been wronged
all these years.

95
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,120
Even though we found the real culprit,

96
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,590
we still can't clear your name.

97
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
But don't worry.

98
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,270
If you ever need anything,

99
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,350
the family will do its best to help you

100
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,390
so long it's within its means.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,960
It doesn't matter anymore.

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,640
Old Madam, Consort Li sent a message.

103
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,390
Today, Official Li stepped down
from his position as an apology.

104
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,880
He said that Ji Shuran's actions

105
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,350
were not her wishes

106
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,830
and that she was manipulated by others.

107
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,150
But he is aware of the severity
of her sins,

108
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,560
so he decides to become a monk
to pray for forgiveness.

109
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,590
Her Highness pities Madam Ji
for being manipulated.

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,030
Though her crimes are severe,
there are reasons behind them.

111
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,830
So she asks Grand Chancellor Jiang
to spare Mrs. Jiang's life.

112
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,320
Grand Chancellor Jiang,

113
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,000
do you not hear my words clearly?

114
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,590
I heard them clearly.

115
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,150
Li.

116
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,500
Where are you going?

117
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,550
It's such a good news.

118
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,420
I must quickly tell Mother.

119
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,670
Let her go.

120
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,060
We've wronged her.

121
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,710
We did do her wrong.

122
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,180
Consort Li,

123
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,620
the message has been delivered.

124
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,620
Grand Chancellor Jiang has agreed.

125
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,550
You may leave.

126
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:35,940
Yes, Your Highness.

127
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,550
Jiang Li.

128
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Ji Shuran,

129
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,350
it's time for you to pay for your sins.

130
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,500
Ji Shuran, you get what you deserve.

131
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,300
It's time to pay back for Yue's life.

132
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,740
Shuran, stop struggling.

133
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,670
Come down and join me.

134
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,670
Come down and join me.

135
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,420
Stop struggling.

136
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,740
Ji Shuran,

137
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,670
it's time for you to pay for your sins.

138
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,670
Pay back for my Yue's life.

139
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,860
Come down and join me.

140
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,260
- No!
- I've waited for you for so long.

141
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,790
Ji Shuran,

142
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,790
it's time for you to pay for your sins.

143
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,940
Pay back for my Yue's life.

144
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,470
Come down and join me.

145
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,660
You get what you deserve.

146
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,620
Come down and join me.

147
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,070
Pay back for my Yue's life.

148
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,310
What are you doing here?

149
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,230
I'm here to see you off
for the last time.

150
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,500
Don't try to scare me.

151
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,430
I am the Lady of the Jiang family.

152
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,020
My son, Jiang Bingji,
is Grand Chancellor Jiang's eldest son.

153
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,260
My sister is the current emperor's
favorite consort.

154
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,110
I still have the Ji family.

155
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,260
You can't touch me.

156
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,110
Lady of the Jiang family?

157
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,740
Have you forgotten

158
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,190
how you got your position

159
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,190
in the first place?

160
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,350
What do you mean?

161
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,020
Aunt Hu told me everything.

162
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,620
I heard Ji Shuran telling Ms. Sun

163
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,380
that the physician who treated Madam Ye

164
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,310
had returned to the capital

165
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,070
and needed to be silenced.

166
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:38,990
Silenced?

167
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,110
Are you saying my mother didn't die
from being weak

168
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,540
after giving birth to me?

169
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,140
Even if she was weak,
she could still recuperate slowly.

170
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,230
By the end of her confinement,

171
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,350
her health was improving.

172
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,620
Then suddenly, her condition worsened

173
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,260
and she didn't last six months.

174
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,590
Thinking back,

175
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,660
it's possible that Ji Shuran bribed

176
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,020
the physician who treated Madam Ye

177
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,540
to tamper with her medicine.

178
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,540
That wretched woman.

179
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,230
Despite being mad,
she can still expose me.

180
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,110
My husband
would never believe her words.

181
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,590
Once I get out of here,
I'll teach her a lesson.

182
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,350
If you want,

183
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,710
I can send you to meet her.

184
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,070
What?

185
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,950
Aunt Hu went to see her daughter.

186
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,230
Before leaving, she left me a letter

187
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,860
accusing you of poisoning my mother.

188
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,190
Do you want

189
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,660
to go to hell to settle this with her?

190
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,310
Someone! I want
to see Grand Chancellor Jiang!

191
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,350
Open this door!

192
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,780
No point shouting for help.

193
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,500
Ji Shuran,

194
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,110
Grandmother and Father used
to care for you

195
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,710
because you had lost a child.

196
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,740
But now it's clear

197
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,950
that your misery

198
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,430
was all part of a plot you orchestrated.

199
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,430
You're also aware

200
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,830
that sacrificing lives
allows you to gain trust.

201
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,900
Now, your retribution has arrived.

202
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,380
Those who died unjustly

203
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,310
are restless.

204
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,860
They want to seek justice.

205
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,860
Even in death, they won't let you off.

206
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,740
You can't beat them, Ji Shuran.

207
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,620
Remember this. From today,

208
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,020
no one in the Jiang family
will believe you again.

209
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,860
Jiang Li,

210
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,110
even if I become a ghost,
I won't let you off.

211
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,190
I won't let you off even
when I become a ghost.

212
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,350
Fine, go and find her then.

213
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,190
When you meet Jiang Li
in the underworld,

214
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,660
she'll be the first to come after you.

215
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,470
What... What did you say?

216
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,020
You...

217
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,350
You're not Jiang Li.

218
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
Do you know

219
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,860
how much Jiang Li suffered

220
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,990
in Zhennyu Hall over these ten years?

221
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,660
She was supposed
to be doted on by Father

222
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,830
and a carefree daughter
of a noble family.

223
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,380
But what happened?

224
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,190
You not only caused her mother's death,

225
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,830
but you also tarnished her reputation

226
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,660
and sent her away.

227
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,140
You handed her over to those people,

228
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,590
letting her be tortured to death,

229
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,190
tortured to death while still alive!

230
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,020
Ji Shuran,

231
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,110
do you understand that pain?

232
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,380
Do you?

233
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,190
Do you deserve forgiveness?

234
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,110
I... I was also forced.

235
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,020
I had no choice.

236
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,780
I was forced.

237
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,500
It's been ten years, Ji Shuran.

238
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,710
You had countless chances

239
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,540
to save her and yourself.

240
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,190
But you did nothing.

241
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,780
Your current fate

242
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,660
is your own doing.

243
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,020
From now on,

244
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,660
you must reflect on your evil deeds

245
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,990
every day of your life.

246
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,350
I was forced.

247
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,830
I was forced to do it.

248
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,380
Li.

249
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,020
Li, I was forced.

250
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,780
Li.

251
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,230
Li,

252
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,990
I was forced to do it.

253
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,620
Third Lady, be careful.

254
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,350
Third Lady.

255
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:21,860
Third Lady, you're not well.

256
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,230
I want to see my mother.

257
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,780
Third Lady, you must get proper rest.

258
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,190
I want to see my mother.

259
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:29,860
Third Lady.

260
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,660
Madam will be fine.

261
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,260
Consort Li has spoken.

262
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,380
So no one will harm her.

263
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,660
I only want to know

264
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,950
when she fed me poison,

265
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,990
did she feel even a bit
of reluctance and pity?

266
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,660
How is she now?

267
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,780
She has gone mad.

268
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,620
Are you sad, Father?

269
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,110
What do you plan to do with her?

270
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,070
Since she has gone mad,

271
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,470
let her guard the tomb.

272
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,710
Let her experience
what Aunt Hu suffered.

273
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,260
Li,

274
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,020
do you hate me?

275
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,860
I didn't know

276
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,350
she had such a malicious heart.

277
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,540
Back then,

278
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,310
when your mother's condition worsened
day by day,

279
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,620
I thought she was in poor health.

280
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,070
I never thought
she was being harmed by someone.

281
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,710
If I had known,

282
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,740
I would never have let Ji Shuran set foot

283
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,470
at the Jiang family's gates.

284
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,620
I shouldn't even have accused you
of matricide and fratricide,

285
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,380
neglecting you for ten years

286
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,380
and

287
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,660
almost causing you to lose your life.

288
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,620
Li, do you still resent me

289
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,380
about the evil spirit incident?

290
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,380
I don't hate you.

291
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,300
I've forgiven you.

292
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,710
Li.

293
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,670
Father.

294
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,100
If you want to hear

295
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,060
such words,

296
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,150
I can say them to you.

297
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,500
But do you think

298
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,710
it's possible?

299
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,820
You can't even imagine

300
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,100
what Li went through in Zhennyu Hall.

301
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,950
Over those ten years,

302
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,500
Li had to fetch water, cook,

303
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,820
do laundry, and mend clothes.

304
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,990
Li has endure hunger, cold,

305
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,150
falling down,

306
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,630
and live under constant scrutiny.

307
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,340
Every day, I hoped for my family
to come and fetch me.

308
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,190
Even just a letter.

309
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,190
But there was nothing,
absolutely nothing.

310
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,740
So I gradually lost hope

311
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,580
[Kindness Beyond Reproach]
and felt completely abandoned.

312
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,020
I wanted to return to the Jiang family

313
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,540
and tried hard for it.

314
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:25,060
But even that wish couldn't be fulfilled.

315
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,500
Li...

316
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,260
Father,

317
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,670
why don't you tell me?

318
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,990
Tell me

319
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,780
how to heal the scars left

320
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,470
over these ten years?

321
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,990
Only the wounds may heal.

322
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,870
But scars will always remain.

323
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,820
One's actions lead to consequences,
resulting in family discord.

324
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,260
Your Li

325
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,630
can't come back.

326
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,300
You... You're not attending
court anymore?

327
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,060
Ruoyao has been making a ruckus
on seeing her mother lately.

328
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,670
I want to take her away
from the capital for a few days

329
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,430
to ease things.

330
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,670
And what about Li?

331
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,910
Let her do as she wishes.

332
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,990
Let Ji Shuran guard the tomb.

333
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,300
Won't you stay in the capital?

334
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,300
Now is the best time for you and Li
to mend your relationship...

335
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,390
Mother, maybe if I distance myself a bit

336
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,470
and don't interfere with Li's affairs,

337
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,820
that's probably what she truly wants.

338
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,870
Fine.

339
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,470
Congratulations on your great victory,
Your Highness!

340
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,260
Our soldiers have achieved much
in this expedition.

341
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,150
We'll have a hearty celebration tonight!

342
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,060
- Hail to Lord Cheng!
- Hail to Lord Cheng!

343
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,990
- Hail to Lord Cheng!
- Hail to Lord Cheng!

344
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,820
Drink up!

345
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,100
All right. You can leave now.

346
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,710
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

347
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,820
My sister

348
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,430
is too useless.

349
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,870
Although we lost
the Office of Imperial Diviner,

350
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,910
there were unexpected gains.

351
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,540
The Ji family has fallen

352
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,430
and the Jiang family
has paid a heavy price.

353
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,230
Jiang Yuanbai was severely affected
by the setback

354
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,910
and took leave from court.

355
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,430
That means our people

356
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,300
are dominating my brother's court now.

357
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,780
[Prosperous Era]
Since there are no issues,

358
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,190
let's adjourn.

359
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,950
Your Majesty,

360
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,870
Lord Cheng

361
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,020
has reclaimed significant territory
in the north for Yan.

362
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,740
The emperor of Dai Country
has retreated ten li

363
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,190
beyond the northern border.

364
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,580
The people in the northern border town
are also settled.

365
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,540
Such great news
is worthy of celebration.

366
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,430
Let's reward Lord Cheng,

367
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,100
to boost the soldier's morale
who serve the country and the people.

368
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,470
What should I reward him, Official Li?

369
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,020
While Dai Country is retreating,

370
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,820
they still harbor ill intentions
toward Yan.

371
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,100
Add troops
and reinforce Lord Cheng's strength

372
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,740
to fortify our northern borders

373
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,260
and deter the Dai Country.

374
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,060
What do all of you think?

375
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,780
I agree.

376
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,580
I second the motion.

377
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,260
- I second the motion.
- I second the motion.

378
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,780
Such a hateful play!

379
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,230
Those ministers have become
Lord Cheng's supporters.

380
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,670
With Jiang Yuanbai absent,

381
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,340
only Li Zhongnan's supporters remain.

382
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,260
Your Majesty, calm down.

383
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,990
Lord Cheng's military achievements
are impressive

384
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,740
and the court is inevitably wary.

385
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,580
Your Majesty, you must not lose
your composure now,

386
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,230
or it will cause unrest
among the people.

387
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,780
I am well aware of this.

388
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,230
But it's hard not to be angry.

389
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,820
Lord Cheng has his own plans.

390
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,630
How do we know
we can't strategize as well?

391
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,230
I have just received intelligence

392
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,150
that the internal strife
in Great Zhao is about to end.

393
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,340
Has the prince
of Great Zhao taken control?

394
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,300
Yes.

395
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,340
The situation
in Great Zhao is stabilizing.

396
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,020
The prince of Great Zhao

397
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,820
has successfully ascended to the throne.

398
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,390
To prevent the remnants
of the rebel forces from rising again,

399
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,150
he now needs

400
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,020
a reliable ally.

401
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,430
If we have such an ally in the south,

402
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,390
the additional troops Lord Cheng
has gathered

403
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,230
are thus insignificant.

404
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,670
How can you ensure he will ally with us?

405
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,470
The young emperor
of Great Zhao has no heirs,

406
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,910
only a younger sister.

407
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,300
She fled to Great Yan during the chaos

408
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,780
and was saved by us in the south.

409
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,670
She has been in Great Yan since then.

410
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,820
Prepare for a rainy day?

411
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,150
Good.

412
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,100
Congratulate the new emperor
of Great Zhao on his ascension.

413
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,100
Also, invite the Great Zhao delegation

414
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,870
to Great Yan
to discuss forming an alliance.

415
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,780
This must be done grandly

416
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,710
to show the world our good relations
with Great Zhao.

417
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,670
I will handle it immediately.

418
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,540
By the way,

419
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,630
for such an important event,

420
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,950
it was usually managed
by Secretariat Director, Jiang Yuanbai

421
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,780
along with the Ministry of Rites
and the Court for Dependencies.

422
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,430
With Jiang on leave

423
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,580
and the Secretary of the Ministry
of Rites elevated by Li Zhongnan,

424
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,540
it might cause issues in the alliance
if we fully trust them.

425
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,150
Do you have
a suitable candidate in mind?

426
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,820
Since you asked,

427
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,470
you must have someone in mind already.

428
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,910
What do you think of Shen Yurong?

429
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,190
He is quite capable.

430
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,100
But you must be aware of his background.

431
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,020
So do you think

432
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,100
your pawn will give up

433
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,060
the chance to approach Shen Yurong?

434
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,740
Are you putting that pawn

435
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,500
in danger?

436
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,150
Are you worried she will be in danger?

437
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,670
If a pawn enters a perilous situation,

438
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,100
it becomes useless to us.

439
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,390
In the past,

440
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,630
you were the most ruthless at chess.

441
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,150
You taught me to sacrifice one piece

442
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,990
to save the game.

443
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,190
Why hesitate now?

444
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,820
Just want to use resources
to their fullest potential.

445
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:43,950
Xiao Heng,

446
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,670
are you getting
your emotions involved in this?

447
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,740
No, I am not.

448
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,820
You better not be.

449
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,630
Have you found Situ Jiuyue yet?

450
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,300
My Lord, why are you
so determined to find her?

451
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,300
Last time, she got angry with you
for no reason

452
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,340
and drank all the liquor
in the Duke's Residence.

453
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,260
My Lord,

454
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,990
I mean Situ Jiuyue likes to disappear

455
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,540
into the deep mountains and forests.

456
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,820
She won't come out
for ten days or even half a month

457
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,910
unless she finds
the medicinal herbs she's looking for.

458
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,950
Send more people.

459
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,500
We must find her
before the Great Zhao delegation arrives.

460
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,540
Yes, My Lord.

461
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,190
Your Highness,

462
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,060
our agents have received information

463
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,870
that the Great Zhao delegation
is coming to Great Yan.

464
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,340
Great Zhao
has accepted their invitation.

465
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,870
When the two nations form an alliance,

466
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,870
the emperor of Great Zhao
will personally lead the delegation.

467
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,780
The alliance between Great Zhao
and Great Yan

468
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,390
is a variable for us.

469
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,390
Any strategy?

470
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,300
The alliance is not unexpected.

471
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,260
But they are coming too quickly.

472
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,780
What do you mean?

473
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,430
During the previous internal strife
in Great Zhao,

474
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,020
the princess of Great Zhao fled
to Great Yan.

475
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,230
The main purpose

476
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,300
of the emperor coming personally

477
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,740
is to bring the princess back.

478
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,950
Zhao Ye has probably found
this princess.

479
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,430
That's why the emperor
of Great Zhao makes haste

480
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,670
to come with the delegation in person.

481
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,470
It's both a blessing and a curse.

482
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,340
If the princess of Great Zhao dies

483
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,950
in Great Yan,

484
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,710
that brother of mine will be in trouble.

485
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,190
Go and keep a close watch on Xiao Heng.

486
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,630
Investigate everyone he comes
into contact with.

487
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,580
Yes, Your Highness.

488
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,630
[Taiji Hall]
Mr. Shen, you've completed your duties.

489
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,870
This time, you are also
in charge of welcoming the delegation,

490
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,300
which shows
the emperor's deep trust in you.

491
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,020
Your future is indeed bright.

492
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,230
It is indeed worth celebrating.

493
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,670
My son is not very talented
but has some knowledge of music.

494
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,870
Could he play the flute and qin
at the banquet as a gift

495
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,190
for the alliance
between the two nations?

496
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,540
I am merely doing my duty for the court.

497
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,630
I cannot be compared to you all.

498
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,670
As for the talents needed
to receive the delegation,

499
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,670
I will compile a list according
to the specifications required

500
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,580
by the Ministry of Rites

501
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,260
and arrange everything accordingly.

502
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,670
Those who wish to contribute

503
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,500
are welcome to submit their names.

504
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,340
Thank you in advance, Mr. Shen.

505
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,860
- I shall take my leave.
- I shall get going.

506
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,910
I'll take my leave now.

507
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,540
Mr. Shen, the arrangements
for this grand alliance are extensive.

508
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Take care of yourself.

509
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,510
If you need anything,

510
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,510
I will do my best to help.

511
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,190
Thank you.

512
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,190
[Ye's Residence]

513
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:44,950
Eat more.

514
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:46,950
Eat more.

515
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,380
All you do is eat.

516
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,470
Is that all you do?

517
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,190
Li is already so thin.

518
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,190
As her brother, can't you advise her?

519
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
You know what Li's temper is like.

520
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,710
Besides, I'm not her only brother.

521
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,990
Why aren't you scolding Ye Shijie too?

522
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,510
The court is selecting people
to welcome the Great Zhao delegation

523
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,860
and perform at the banquet.

524
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,270
With Li's skills,
she will surely be chosen.

525
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,990
Maybe finding something for her to do

526
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,820
will help her feel better.

527
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,470
But I don't know
if she wants to participate.

528
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,270
I'll be counting on both of you

529
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,710
to persuade her.

530
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,540
Let's eat together.

531
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,820
What... What did you say?

532
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,620
He said he wants you to join him.

533
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,820
Here, eat some.

534
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:44,750
All right.

535
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,470
Everything will be fine.

536
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,430
Li.

537
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,820
The Great Zhao delegation will arrive
in a few days.

538
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,820
The court is selecting people
to welcome them.

539
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,580
Are you interested?

540
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,950
I just heard Jingrui and Liu Xu say

541
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,510
they will participate.

542
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,820
If you are chosen,

543
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,270
our team can be together again.

544
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,300
No, I just want to rest for now.

545
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,340
After this, I want you,

546
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,430
Liu Xu, and Jiang Jingrui

547
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,100
not to come and see me.

548
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,470
I want peace.

549
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,100
Zhao.

550
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,030
Father can eat and drink normally now.

551
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,990
[Tomb of Xue Zhao]
Although he still doesn't remember us.

552
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,380
But as long as he's alive,

553
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,990
there's hope.

554
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,230
When I first came to the capital,
I was alone.

555
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,780
But now I have Father

556
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,710
and a group of friends
who have shared hardships with me.

557
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:18,990
[Xue Zhao]
Zhao,

558
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,540
am I not fortunate?

559
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,990
But

560
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,580
I would rather be alone.

561
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,860
That way,

562
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,710
no one would be implicated
because of me.

563
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,270
Tong...

564
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,340
Zhao Ke has brought back the person

565
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,540
you asked him to find.

566
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,430
She doesn't trust others easily.

567
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,060
When you see her, be careful.

568
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,470
Haitang.

569
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,230
Haitang.

570
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,860
Haitang,

571
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,860
it's me.

572
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,380
Haitang, it's me.

573
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,710
Don't be afraid.

574
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,780
Don't touch me!

575
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,540
Don't touch me.

576
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,910
Don't touch me.

577
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,300
It's me, Haitang.

578
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,100
It's me.

579
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,470
I'm Xue Fangfei.

580
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,670
Haitang.

581
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,820
Madam.

582
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,060
It's me.

583
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,910
You're still alive.

584
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,430
I'm still alive.

585
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,780
Let me look at you.

586
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,380
What happened to your face?

587
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,190
It's... It's nothing.

588
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,430
I thought

589
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,910
I would never see you again.

590
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,100
Forgive me.

591
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,100
It's my fault.

592
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,310
I should have...

593
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,430
I should have taken you away back then.

594
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,830
I'm sorry.

595
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,470
What happened after you left?

596
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,620
After I delivered the message
for Master,

597
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,620
someone put a sack over my head
and knocked me unconscious.

598
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,220
Come. Throw her here.

599
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,350
Let's go.

600
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,540
When I faintly woke up,

601
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,390
I was already in a mass grave.

602
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,180
They left because they probably thought

603
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,310
I was dead.

604
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,540
After escaping death,
I didn't dare to show my face

605
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,350
or go home.

606
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,310
I was afraid they would catch me.

607
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,260
So I wandered in the neighboring county

608
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,990
for a few months,

609
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,830
eating leftover food.

610
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,910
After a few months,

611
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,100
I returned home to see my brother.

612
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,140
After asking around, I learned
about what happened to the Xue family.

613
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:34,990
Haitang,

614
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,700
you've suffered.

615
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
I failed you.

616
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,910
Madam, you didn't fail me.

617
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,430
It's those who harmed us

618
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,580
that should be sorry.

619
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,580
I should have fought
the Shen family back then.

620
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,430
I only want you to live well.

621
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,350
I just want you to live.

622
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,470
Get proper rest here.

623
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,430
I'll have someone take good care of you.

624
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,740
Duke Su,

625
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,140
I have a favor to ask.

626
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,100
Is it about the scars on her face?

627
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,430
Yes.

628
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,790
If Jiuyue comes to you,

629
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,620
please inform me.

630
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,950
I want to ask Jiuyue
to treat Magistrate Xue and Haitang.

631
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,950
You know she uses poison, right?

632
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,540
You're risking their lives for survival.

633
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:31,870
I trust her.

634
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,910
I'll send someone to notify you
when I find her.

635
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,510
Duke Su.

636
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:42,950
Please come.

637
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,260
Do you know

638
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,540
how to truly protect someone?

639
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,830
Don't push the person
you want to protect away

640
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,830
from you.

641
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,430
Keep her close,

642
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,580
within your sight.

643
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,870
Is that how you do it?

644
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,790
I don't need to.

645
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,620
Duke Su, you just can't stop the habit

646
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,430
of eavesdropping on others, huh?

647
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,790
It's because you speak so loudly.

648
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,790
So now it's my fault?

649
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,510
At least, you realize your mistake.

650
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,830
Are you going to participate
in the selection of the reception envoy

651
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,910
for the Great Zhao delegation?

652
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,430
Why are you bringing this up too?

653
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,030
Shen Yurong is in charge of this matter.

654
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:25,910
Duke Su,

655
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,700
you once told me

656
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,390
the story
of "Duke Huang of the East Sea."

657
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,180
Today, let me tell you

658
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,830
the story of "A Beauty's Return."

659
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,030
A young nobleman became infatuated

660
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,060
with a beautiful lady
during his travels.

661
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,620
He promised her a lifelong commitment.

662
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,030
But later,

663
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,100
he abandoned her
and returned to the capital.

664
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,620
Under his parents' order, he married
a noblewoman from a prestigious family.

665
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,620
Little did he know,

666
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,390
this woman bore a striking resemblance
to the abandoned lady,

667
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,140
not just in looks
but also in mannerisms.

668
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,700
The nobleman was convinced

669
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,700
that the noble family refused to marry
their real daughter to him.

670
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,580
So they found a substitute bride.

671
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,470
Ironically, the substitute bride
was the abandoned lady.

672
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Throughout their marriage,

673
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,950
the nobleman was consumed
with proving his suspicions.

674
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,950
In the end, guess what happened?

675
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,220
He killed the noblewoman.

676
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,790
Duke Su, why do you enjoy

677
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,990
stories full of bloodshed so much?

678
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,580
Could

679
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,470
they be lovebirds?

680
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,030
Let's wait and see.

681
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:57,830
I'll perform this show for you.

682
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,140
Why do you think
Jiang Li isn't participating?

683
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,950
Didn't she want to seek guidance

684
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,620
from Shen Yurong before?

685
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,580
Why did you hit me?

686
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,540
You fool. What else could it be?

687
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,310
She must be feeling down.

688
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,910
With so much going on
in your family lately

689
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,910
and Tong gone,

690
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,350
who would have the mood to study

691
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,620
or seek guidance?

692
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,740
People like them who love learning

693
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,220
find it therapeutic.

694
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,620
Don't believe me? Ask Ye Shijie.

695
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,310
Since Jiang Li doesn't want to join,

696
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,620
let's not bring it up anymore.

697
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,030
Let her be in peace.

698
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,790
We shouldn't disturb her either.

699
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,950
We can't do that.

700
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,910
We can't leave her alone either.

701
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,470
Are you discussing
the delegation matters?

702
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,180
What is wrong with you?

703
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,700
- You should've made some noise.
- Li.

704
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,540
Where are you going?

705
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,620
Ye, did His Majesty assign
the delegation matters

706
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,180
to Shen Yurong?

707
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:03,990
Yes.

708
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:08,870
I want to join.

709
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,500
[To Mr. Shen]

710
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,540
[Shen's Residence]

711
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,900
[Jiang Li from the School of Integrity
requests to join the reception envoy.]

712
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,300
[Jiang Li]

713
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,620
Yurong,

714
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,140
can I help

715
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,580
with welcoming
the Great Zhao delegation?

716
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,910
Just leave it there.

717
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,660
All right.

718
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,580
[To Mr. Shen]

719
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,100
[Jiang Li]

720
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,700
[Jiang Li]

721
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,540
Yurong,

722
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,660
how's the preparation
for the Great Zhao delegation lately?

723
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,310
It's alright.

724
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,830
I heard from your sister

725
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,100
that many from the School of Integrity

726
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,660
have submitted
their self-recommendation letters.

727
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,910
Did Second Lady Jiang also submit one?

728
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,790
Listen to me.

729
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,580
We're able

730
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,990
to enjoy fine food

731
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,220
and comfort life

732
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,430
all because of Eldest Princess.

733
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,350
Before you do anything,

734
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,540
remember not to provoke
Eldest Princess.

735
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,790
Do you hear me?

736
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,950
Eldest Princess. Eldest Princess.

737
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,740
It's always about Eldest Princess.

738
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,060
Is the Shen family
Eldest Princess's dog?

739
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,950
What are you saying?

740
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,990
Do you think
everything we have now is given

741
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,470
is given by Eldest Princess?

742
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,700
What about my years

743
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,740
of dedication to the court
and the emperor?

744
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,990
Our daily expenses at the Shen family

745
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,910
are from my hard work,

746
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,580
not from Eldest Princess's rewards!

747
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,620
Mother only cares about you.

748
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,830
She's afraid you might make
the wrong decisions

749
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:32,830
and make mistakes again.

750
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,430
You remind me day and night like this.

751
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,140
How can I dare to make mistakes?

752
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,660
Yurong will understand your intentions.

753
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,100
The reception envoy selection's
results are out.

754
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:58,910
It's already out.

755
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,260
Ye Shijie,

756
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,430
Liu Xu and I have received

757
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,310
our confirmation letters.

758
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,990
The four of us can be together again.

759
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,310
What's wrong?

760
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:06,430
Li didn't receive
her confirmation letter.

761
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,030
She didn't receive it?

762
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,060
She's the most outstanding among us.

763
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,950
It's impossible not to get selected.

764
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:11,830
Silly.

765
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,180
He said she didn't receive the letter.

766
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,950
Even if it wasn't confirmed,

767
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,510
the letter would be returned.

768
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,950
Could it be they've lost Li's letter?

769
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:22,620
No, it's not possible.

770
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,350
Mr. Shen is probably still deciding.

771
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,580
What do you mean?

772
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,740
I need a favor from you.

773
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,580
What do you need me to do?

774
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,430
I want him to come
to the Jiang's Residence

775
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,350
and personally invite me.

776
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,620
[Govern the People, Serve Heaven]

777
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,180
Your Majesty,

778
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,220
the schedule for the delegation's
reception has been completed.

779
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,510
As for the specific details,

780
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,740
I have requested Serving Officer, Ye Shijie
from the Ministry of Revenue to draft it

781
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:47,700
into a document.

782
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,220
Please review it, Your Majesty.

783
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,140
Then I'll take my leave now.

784
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:52,780
All right.

785
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:53,550
Your Majesty,

786
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,220
if I may be bold to suggest

787
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,140
Second Lady Jiang's performance

788
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,470
of "Spring Fading
into White Pear Blossoms."

789
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,390
This song is well-known
across the country.

790
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,390
If Second Lady Jiang is selected
to join the reception envoy

791
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,390
and perform this piece
at the alliance banquet

792
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,180
for the Great Zhao delegation,

793
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,990
it will surely impress them

794
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,030
and make their visit enjoyable.

795
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,300
I've heard Mianju mention
this several times.

796
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,740
He has always praised Jiang Li's

797
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,950
"Spring Fading
into White Pear Blossoms."

798
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,950
I wanted her to perform it

799
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,700
at a palace banquet before.

800
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,870
But I had state affairs to attend to

801
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,780
and left early.

802
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,220
During the Entry Exam,
you were also present.

803
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,550
What do you think?

804
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,510
Your Majesty,

805
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,660
it's indeed an excellent piece.

806
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,180
Second Lady Jiang is not among

807
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,220
the confirmed reception envoy.

808
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,700
Did she not submit
a recommendation letter herself?

809
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,870
She did submit one.

810
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,660
But considering

811
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,470
the recent events in the Jiang family,

812
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,910
it wasn't approved yet.

813
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,990
Do you also think an evil spirit
has possessed Second Lady Jiang?

814
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,870
I am aware
of the Jiang family's situation.

815
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,580
However, supernatural matters

816
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,300
are not appropriate for open discussion.

817
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,660
Official Shen,
you're being narrow-minded.

818
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,990
I apologize.

819
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:01,620
Official Ye,

820
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,220
I will approve Second Lady Jiang's
recommendation letter right away.

821
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,510
As her cousin,

822
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,780
you can pass the letter to her.

823
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:08,830
Mr. Shen,

824
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:11,740
this is an official matter.
It wouldn't be proper for me to do it.

825
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,180
Since you didn't approve
her invitation earlier,

826
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,070
Second Lady Jiang
might have misunderstood.

827
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,830
If you don't go,

828
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,910
how can I explain it clearly?

829
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,100
[Govern the People, Serve Heaven]

830
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,030
My Lady, you're truly insightful.

831
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,780
Mr. Shen has indeed come to see you.

832
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,070
He's outside right now.

833
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,260
With the alliance approaching,

834
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,430
[Abundance and Prosperity]
how do you have the time to visit me?

835
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,620
I have a request today.

836
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,550
During the court meeting
about the alliance banquet,

837
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,100
the emperor mentioned he wanted

838
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,180
to hear your "Spring Fading
into White Pear Blossoms."

839
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,830
I played it

840
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,870
at the School of Integrity's Entry Exam.

841
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,180
I didn't expect the emperor
to hold it in such high regard.

842
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,390
Your musical skills are renowned

843
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,220
throughout the capital.

844
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,660
With such fame,

845
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,870
people are bound to talk about it.

846
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,660
It might be best
for you to stay low-key.

847
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:20,140
"Spring Fading into White Pear Blossoms"
has a sorrowful melody.

848
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,870
With the Great Zhao delegation coming
for the alliance,

849
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,910
playing this might be inappropriate.

850
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:28,220
So I wish to ask you
to appeal to the emperor

851
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,510
to decline this performance.

852
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,660
[Abundance and Prosperity]
Move with emotion, convince with reason.

853
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,950
Those who don't know better

854
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,910
would think you're very considerate
of me and far-sighted.

855
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,350
I only think you will understand
the situation well,

856
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,740
which is why I came to seek your help.

857
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,380
If you're unwilling,

858
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,330
I will inform the emperor myself

859
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,610
and resign from this task.

860
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,380
Sorry for the trouble today.

861
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,250
I'll take my leave now.

862
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,540
[Abundance and Prosperity]

863
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,130
Mr. Shen, what are you afraid of?

864
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,250
Second Lady Jiang,
what do you mean by this?

865
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,330
If you didn't want me
to join the reception envoy,

866
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,940
you could have just rejected
my application.

867
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,730
But you didn't reject it nor approve it.

868
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,100
You hesitated.

869
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,950
You should know

870
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,740
why I am hesitating.

871
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:23,910
After all,
your intentions are too obvious.

872
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:24,950
My intentions?

873
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,180
Have you misunderstood something?

874
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:28,350
You can fool others.

875
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,740
But not me.

876
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,220
Oh, Mr. Shen.

877
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,140
Should I call you foolish

878
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,870
or self-deluded?

879
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,910
[Abundance and Prosperity]
It seems you still see me

880
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,990
as your late wife.

881
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,470
Since you're so certain,

882
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,220
why did you oppose Eldest Princess

883
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,740
before the emperor?

884
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,580
You should know best

885
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:57,550
that I am the Secretariat Director
and Grand Preceptor's daughter,

886
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,430
not your infamous late wife.

887
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,620
Even if I do look like her,

888
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,430
so what?

889
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:05,580
In that case,

890
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,740
why do you insist on joining
the reception envoy I manage?

891
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,580
My maid died protecting me.

892
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,990
She was like a sister to me.

893
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,470
I am sad and heartbroken.

894
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,910
I have been in despair for days.

895
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,070
I just want to enjoy

896
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,220
the lively atmosphere
of the alliance banquet.

897
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:23,910
Is that wrong?

898
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,300
If you insist
on rejecting my application,

899
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:30,070
please do not impose your feelings

900
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:31,220
for your late wife on me.

901
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,740
Instead,

902
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,180
find a more convincing reason.

903
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:36,260
Otherwise, people might think

904
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,510
you have a guilty conscience.

905
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,430
You should leave now, Mr. Shen.

906
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,140
Son,

907
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,220
listen to me.

908
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,140
Our family

909
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,390
can enjoy such fine food

910
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:50,620
and comfort life

911
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,660
all thanks to Eldest Princess.

912
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,220
The way you speak pains me.

913
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,430
But unfortunately,
I can't comfort you now.

914
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,580
My maid died protecting me.

915
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:03,700
She was like a sister to me.

916
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:04,950
I just want to enjoy

917
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,260
the lively atmosphere
