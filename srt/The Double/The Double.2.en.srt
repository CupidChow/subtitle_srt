The reason we can't go out at night

174

is because

187
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,750
The ghost was dressed like a nun,

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,940
A tall female ghost?

190
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,700
[Practice morality and virtue]

191
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,510
In three days,

192
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,030
Mrs. Liu will be dropping by Zhennv Hall

193
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,270
on her way to the Half Moon Ceremony.

194
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,660
It will be a long journey.

195
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,350
Mrs. Liu will be spending
the night here.

196
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,750
Give the orders.

197
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,060
Make sure Zhennv Hall
is clean as can be.

198
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,700
We want Mrs. Liu to feel comfortable.

199
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,700
As you wish.

200
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,390
One the day of Mrs. Liu's arrival,

201
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,470
make sure those two stay here.

202
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,030
Don't let them roam about

203
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,110
lest they offend our guest.

204
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,350
Yes.

205
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,540
The Secretary of Finance,
Liu Yuanfeng's wife.

206
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,150
Tong,

207
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
do you know her?

208
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,060
If memory serves,

209
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,110
she's a good friend of Mrs. Ye.

210
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,940
The hairpin you're wearing

211
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,820
was a gift from her to Mrs. Ye.

212
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,780
You must be tired, Mrs. Liu.

213
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,470
One is never too tired to give out alms.

214
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,510
Greetings, Mrs. Liu.

215
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,470
[Kindness beyond reproach]
Zhennv Hall is so well-kept.

216
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,540
I really appreciate it.

217
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,230
[Mrs. Liu]
Sorry for visiting on such short notice.

218
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,630
Not at all.

219
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,110
I'm grateful that you decided
to drop by.

220
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,900
We've prepared a room for you.

221
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,230
I hope it's to your liking.

222
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,510
After you.

223
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,630
Tong.

224
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,630
Tong.

225
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,110
Wake up.

226
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,390
Tonight

227
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,870
is our only chance to escape.

228
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,660
Escape? How?

229
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,180
Mrs. Liu.

230
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
But Mrs. Liu had always known

231
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,230
that my lady was staying here,

232
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,660
yet she never came to visit.

233
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,900
Without the Jiang family's instruction,

234
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,110
do you think she'll get us out of here?

235
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,180
Give this hairpin to Mrs. Liu.

236
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,660
Are you sure about this?

237
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,470
Tell Mrs. Liu Jiang Li is in trouble.

238
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,180
Once she sees this hairpin,
she'll follow you.

239
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
But this whole place is under

240
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,870
the Mistress' control.

241
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,180
Even if Mrs. Liu sympathizes with us,

242
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,700
the Mistress might deny our claims

243
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,420
and accuse us of lying.

244
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,470
What if Mrs. Liu

245
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,510
saw the Mistress committing
a disgraceful act?

246
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,870
Do you mean...

247
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,660
Did you notice the Mistress' scent?

248
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,150
She wears makeup every day.
What's so strange about that?

249
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,150
Every day or some days?

250
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,540
Come to think of it...

251
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,230
Now you're getting it.

252
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,780
While I was reading "Lessons for Women",

253
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,750
I noticed a scent on the Mistress' body.

254
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,900
It was no ordinary scent.

255
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,820
It was the scent of ylang-ylang.

256
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,300
Ylang-ylang?

257
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,030
It's a perfume of seduction.

258
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,150
How did you know?

259
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,390
My Lady,

260
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,230
[Haitang]
he has not visited you in days.

261
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,030
Here, take this.

262
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,940
What is this?

263
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,870
The scent of ylang-ylang.

264
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,390
Whenever the Mistress
smells of ylang-ylang,

265
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,030
the lanterns would be raised,
like tonight.

266
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,900
Whenever the Mistress doesn't smell
of ylang-ylang,

267
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,780
the lanterns would be lowered.

268
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,230
So there is hidden meaning
to the lanterns.

269
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,990
Isn't there a place
called Helin Temple nearby?

270
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,270
That's right, it's on top of the hill.

271
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,180
The other day,
while we were collecting wood,

272
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,750
I deliberately wandered
towards Helin Temple.

273
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,670
I noticed the lantern, when raised,

274
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,950
was visible from across the hill.

275
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,620
When lowered, it was obscured from view.

276
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,910
One time, I went to Helin Temple
to pray.

277
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,820
They hold a ritual every other night.

278
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,100
Whenever there was a ritual,

279
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,990
the Mistress would smell of ylang-ylang,

280
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,100
and you could see the lantern

281
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,190
raised above the hill.

282
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,470
Do you know what it means?

283
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,510
It means the lantern

284
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,060
is a signal to the
ritual's participants.

285
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,030
Exactly.

286
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,270
But what does it all mean?

287
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,580
Could it be that it's just
a coincidence?

288
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,430
Impossible.

289
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,750
One day, while everyone was out
collecting fruit,

290
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,780
I lowered the lantern.

291
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,100
Guess what happened?

292
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,100
That night,

293
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,670
I had a feeling something might happen.

294
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,270
So I sneaked out while you were asleep.

295
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,580
And I saw the tall female ghost

296
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,580
you told me about.

297
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,950
The curfews, the female ghost...

298
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,340
So it was all meant to restrict us

299
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,470
while she goes about her business.

300
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,860
If she gets caught,

301
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,470
she'll get thrown into prison.

302
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,580
Besides, there's a ceremony
at Helin Temple.

303
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,060
Why would the Mistress do such a thing
when Mrs. Liu is around?

304
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,470
The lantern.

305
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,340
I raised it.

306
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,950
You're a genius.

307
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,470
I'll go find Mrs. Liu.

308
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,030
Tong.

309
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,470
To see Mrs. Liu,

310
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,060
you need more than a hairpin.

311
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,710
You need a reason.

312
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:36,910
Do it.

313
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,470
Wait, don't you think
it's a little excessive?

314
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,510
This our only chance.

315
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,270
Unlike Jiang Li, I don't have any scars.

316
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,950
Our act must be convincing enough

317
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,100
to dispel any suspicion.

318
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,030
We have to do it for Jiang Li's sake.

319
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,940
[Mr. Qin]

320
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,380
My Lord,

321
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,230
Zhennv Hall is right ahead.

322
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,100
Zhennv Hall?

323
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,340
It's a refuge for women.

324
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,670
The perfect hideout.

325
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,470
Who goes there?

326
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,140
Come out.

327
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,780
Show yourself.

328
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,750
Show yourself.

329
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,950
Buddha, someone's after me.

330
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,270
Please help me.

331
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,060
This isn't a Buddhist temple,

332
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,710
and I'm no Buddha.

333
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,620
You'll get discovered eventually.

334
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,190
Houshan Forest lies
beyond those windows.

335
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,820
Go, hurry.

336
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,140
Thank you.

337
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,710
Come any closer, and I'll kill her.

338
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,950
Be my guest.

339
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,030
It'll only add to your sentence.

340
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,030
Duke Su.

341
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,910
Mr. Qin,

342
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,620
surrender while you can.

343
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,340
You've been convicted

344
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,340
of salt trafficking.

345
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,710
What are you talking about?

346
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,910
Tell us where you got the salt.

347
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,270
You made His Highness chase you

348
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,300
all the way from Helin Temple.

349
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,670
If you don't come clean,

350
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,710
not even God will be able

351
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,670
to save you.

352
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,820
You can't fool me.

353
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,820
I know you won't let me off that easily.

354
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,510
I know I'm going to die

355
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,270
no matter what,

356
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,750
so I may as well die here.

357
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,060
At least I get to die
with a beautiful woman.

358
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,470
I'm a kind person.

359
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,910
Since that is what you want,

360
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,510
I'll grant you your wish.

361
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,270
In a moment, you and her
will be reunited

362
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,100
in the netherworld.

363
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,990
Madam, my lady is dying.

364
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,620
Please save her.

365
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,580
This is Zhen's hairpin.

366
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,540
Could it be...

367
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:10,780
Li?

368
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,060
Yes.

369
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,780
Take me to her.

370
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,100
Sure, follow me.

371
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,430
My dear, let's surrender.

372
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,230
What are you talking about?

373
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,300
I said, let's surrender.

374
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,510
Duke Su has hunted us down

375
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,820
and captured both of us.

376
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,470
What choice do we have?

377
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,230
What are you talking about, you wench?

378
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,300
Why did the higher-ups do this to us?

379
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,060
Now we're forced into a corner.

380
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,580
Release me

381
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,670
and surrender to Duke Su.

382
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,780
He might just let us live.

383
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,190
Who are you?

384
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,100
I'm your wife and accomplice, silly.

385
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,270
Do it.

386
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,340
What?

387
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,100
So you two are partners.

388
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,620
Hurry up and kill her.

389
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,270
After that, I'll kill you.

390
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,910
I'd like to see

391
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,750
how you silence her.

392
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,510
I'll kill her.

393
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,510
I'm going to kill her, I mean it.

394
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,340
On your knees.

395
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,540
Get up.

396
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:56,820
My Lord,

397
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,140
look at her.

398
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,310
Doesn't she look familiar?

399
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,510
Check out this piece of cloth.

400
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,790
My Lady, someone is watching you
from the balcony.

401
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,380
You don't see this everywhere.

402
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,790
Garments.

403
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,100
Step right up.

404
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,030
It's the scholar's wife,

405
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,620
the most talented girl in Huaixiang.

406
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,900
Isn't she beautiful?

407
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,100
How do you know she's the most
talented girl in Huaixiang?

408
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,100
He asked his men to scout
for pretty girls.

409
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,180
Why, you...

410
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,140
It's Duke Su.

411
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,180
Yurong told me

412
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,580
he's an arrogant, cruel man.

413
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,550
We'd better not attract his attention.
Let's go.

414
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,140
[Wife of Academician, Ms. Xue's coffin]

415
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,230
Is your surname

416
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,070
Xue by any chance?

417
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,340
You got the wrong woman.

418
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,790
You're right. She's dead now.

419
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,230
She may be a ghost,

420
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,790
but a bandit? No way.

421
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,340
Let me go.

422
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,100
Don't listen to the shrew.

423
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,950
I'm innocent.

424
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,900
You got the wrong guy. Let me go.

425
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,310
Let me go.

426
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,860
How annoying.

427
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,420
Lock him up.

428
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,180
Guards.

429
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,030
I'll interrogate you right here and now.

430
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,510
Once I'm done,

431
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,860
I'll throw you back to your handler.

432
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,180
Get up.

433
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,270
Duke Su, are you underestimating me?

434
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,820
How disrespectful!

435
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,660
Do you think a nun

436
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,310
can't smuggle salt?

437
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,140
I know as much as that man,

438
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,790
yet you arrested him

439
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,790
but not me?

440
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,620
Begging to be arrested?

441
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,620
Interesting.

442
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,750
Here,

443
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,030
you can't use force in an interrogation.

444
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,620
Isn't it inconvenient?

445
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,900
Li, are you there?

446
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,070
Li.

447
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,710
If we hadn't barged in today,

448
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,660
you'd be singing a different tune.

449
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,710
And you said your surname wasn't Xue.

450
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,820
Take me back to the capital,

451
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,790
and it will all make sense.

452
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,990
May I know what you were

453
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,470
planning originally?

454
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,660
Wouldn't you like to know?

455
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,790
I may as well.

456
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,990
Tie me up and take me with you.

457
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,710
I'll tell you everything.

458
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,310
My Lady, why are you tied up?

459
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,550
Don't touch her.

460
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,550
She's a convicted criminal.

461
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,710
What's this all about?

462
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,340
Explain.

463
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,030
Mrs. Liu?

464
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,340
Duke Su.

465
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,510
I was pursuing an enemy of the Court

466
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,380
when I stumbled upon
this suspected accomplice.

467
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,510
I need to take her back
for interrogation.

468
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,100
There must be a misunderstanding,
Duke Su.

469
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,030
Tong, she is...

470
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:44,990
My Lady,

471
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,230
this is Mrs. Liu,

472
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,270
she used to visit you and your mother.

473
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,310
Aunt Liu? I'm so...

474
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,470
Help me, Aunt Liu.

475
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,230
I'm no accomplice.

476
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,030
I was set up. I tried to explain,
but to no avail.

477
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,860
I don't want to be taken to the capital
for trial.

478
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,580
Help me.

479
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,070
Okay, don't fret.

480
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,790
Duke Su, how can you simply arrest her?

481
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,310
This is Zhennv Hall.

482
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,310
Taking a nun

483
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,340
without informing the Mistress,

484
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,790
don't you think it's inappropriate?

485
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,470
Aunt Liu, please ask the Mistress

486
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,900
to plead on my behalf.

487
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,660
Don't worry.

488
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,030
I'll go get the Mistress.

489
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,750
She'll help you.

490
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,750
I'll be waiting here, Mrs. Liu.

491
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,550
What are you doing here?

492
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,710
I saw your lantern,

493
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,750
so here I am.

494
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,470
Lantern?

495
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,510
Not now, I have an important guest.

496
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,550
You need to leave.

497
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,790
Get off me. Leave now.

498
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,620
Since I'm here...

499
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,620
There's no one out there, I've checked.

500
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,710
Hands off.

501
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,580
Mrs. Liu!

502
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,900
Such indecency! Such obscenity!

503
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,380
Have you no shame?

504
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,550
Girls, take this scandalous couple away.

505
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,470
You two.

506
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,310
Take them away!

507
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,070
Mrs. Liu.

508
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,620
Keep walking.

509
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,860
Kneel.

510
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,100
This is my first time

511
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,070
seeing the Mistress apprehended.

512
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,230
Now I've seen everything.

513
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,340
Mrs. Liu, I was set up.

514
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,580
I saw it with my own eyes.

515
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,100
How dare you deny it
in front of Duke Su?

516
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,820
This is out of my jurisdiction.

517
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,900
Mrs. Liu, you decide.

518
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,860
Girls, wake up all the nuns.

519
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
Two of you stand guard.

520
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,180
Lock them up.

521
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,820
We'll bring them to trial tomorrow.

522
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,900
These filthy animals,

523
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,710
just looking at them makes me angry.

524
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,140
Lock them up.

525
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:32,990
Yes.

526
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,270
- Wait...
- Get up.

527
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,660
It's not what you think, Mrs. Liu.

528
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,620
- This is an injustice.
- Come on.

529
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,420
Mrs. Liu.

530
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,070
- Come on.
- Mrs. Liu.

531
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,420
Mrs. Liu.

532
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,950
Can I take my convict now?

533
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,310
My Lady.

534
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,660
My Lord,

535
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,620
she's wounded.

536
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,230
What should we do with her?

537
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,550
Let her rest.

538
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:10,910
And...

539
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:12,780
You.

540
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,660
Come here.

541
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,220
Interrogate her.

542
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,830
Yes.

543
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,910
You're finally awake.

544
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,260
Aunt Liu, sorry for the trouble.

545
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,350
What have you been through?

546
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,740
You're badly injured.

547
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,390
Don't move.

548
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,510
Still dizzy?

549
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,740
Lie down, then.

550
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,260
Where did those wounds come from?

551
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,030
There's no need to tell me.

552
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,180
That witch must have tortured you.

553
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,430
When your maid showed me this hairpin,

554
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,740
I knew you were in trouble.

555
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,180
If your mother knew

556
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,140
what you've endured here,

557
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,220
she'd be devastated.

558
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,390
Aunt Liu,

559
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,350
it's okay. It's all in the past.

560
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,430

of using force in an interrogation.

If I find even a scratch on her,

I'll report it immediately
to the Prime Minister.

Duke Su's memorial

745
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,140
makes total sense.

746
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,770
The nuns of Zhennv Hall

747
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,420
must be in cahoots

748
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,290
with the salt traffickers,

749
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,210
harboring criminals.

750
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,980
Unforgivable.

751
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,330
I've ordered Duke Su to get
to the bottom of this.

752
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,460
Whoever is behind it

753
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,250
will not be spared.

754
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:49,140
[Jiang's Residence]

755
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,210
The cold weather

756
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,330
calls for something warm.

757
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,210
A few simple dishes

758
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,250
for my husband and his mother.

759
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,650
Take a wild duck from the farm

760
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:12,290
and make a herbal soup with it.

761
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,500
No one knows Mr. Jiang
and his mother's palate

762
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,250
better than you, Madam.

763
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,730
I just want to make sure

764
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,100
they're taken care of.

765
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:22,250
Get to it.

766
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:23,290
Yes.

767
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:26,810
My Lord.

768
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:31,250
My dear.

769
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,810
You seem frustrated.

770
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,140
Fetch Jiang Li, right now.

771
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,460
Why...

772
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,100
Why do you bring this up?

773
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,980
His Majesty read two memorials today.

774
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,290
One from Liu Yuanfeng,

775
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,420
one from Duke Su.

776
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,290
You mean Mr. Liu

777
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:06,420
actually brought this issue
to His Majesty

778
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,540
in order to humiliate you?

779
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,500
Don't you know?

780
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,500
Back in the day, your father
hindered his career

781
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,460
by filling the court
with his supporters.

782
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,900
Did you think he'd pass up the chance
to expose us?

783
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,210
What timing!

784
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:26,580
The Queen Mother's mausoleum
is about to be completed.

785
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,580
His Majesty is big

786
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,170
on filial piety right now.

787
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,500
The Emperor lost his mother
at a young age,

788
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,540
and now the Queen Mother,

789
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,290
you know that.

790
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,210
With his memorial, Liu Yuanfeng

791
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,940
played to His Majesty's vulnerability

792
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,580
while putting pressure on me.

793
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,980
Li is a Jiang after all.

794
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,620
Now that Zhennv Hall is rife
with scandal,

795
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,060
even if His Majesty and Mr. Liu
didn't mention it,

796
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,690
we should bring Li home.

797
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,170
Aren't you angry at her?

798
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,020
Why should I be?

799
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:04,810
It's been so long.

800
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,060
I think she has repented.

801
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,850
Besides,

802
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,250
nothing is more important

803
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,170
than our reputation and innocence.

804
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,250
I leave the decision to you.

805
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,210
The problem is,

806
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:24,330
Li is still in Duke Su's custody.

807
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:25,730
Duke Su?

808
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,810
How?

809
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:32,170
I have no idea how he was able to

810
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,460
convict Li of harboring a criminal

811
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,210
and embezzlement.

812
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,420
If she's found guilty,

813
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,650
even without Li Zhongnan's incitement,

814
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,210
our reputation will be ruined forever.

815
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,810
I must talk to Duke Su.

816
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,730
If I manage to reclaim her,

817
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,770
we must make her return public,

818
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,370
lest we seem guilty.

819
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,580
I understand, my dear.

820
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,210
Once Duke Su agrees to let her go,

821
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,140
you can leave

822
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,980
everything to me.

823
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,250
We will celebrate our daughter's return

824
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,900
in a grand manner.

825
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,500
No one will be able
to criticize us, then.

826
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:17,940
My dear.

827
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,770
You are so kind

828
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,370
and forgiving.

829
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,420
I am moved.

830
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:27,980
You've endured so much

831
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,210
all these years.

832
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,580
What Li has done to you...

833
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,500
It's all in the past.

834
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,770
If you hadn't mentioned it, I...

835
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,100
I...

836
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,420
I might not even remember
our unborn child.

837
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:58,650
My dear.

838
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,580
I promise you,

839
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,540
if Li has not repented,

840
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,690
if she treats you with spite,

841
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,020
I won't forgive her.

842
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,210
Thank you, my dear.

843
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:49,620
I helped you.

844
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,850
Don't you owe me an explanation?

845
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,420
Duke Su, what would you like to know?

846
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,370
What is your surname?

847
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,620
You should know.

848
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:01,730
I ask the questions.

849
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:03,580
You answer.

850
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:06,850
My surname is Jiang.

851
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,250
My first name is Li.

852
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,140
I am the daughter
of the Chief Secretary.

853
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,980
Why did you collude
with the salt traffickers?

854
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:23,580
I lied.

855
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,770
You lied?

856
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,500
So it wasn't a collusion

857
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,460
but a tryst?

858
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,020
Watch your words, Duke.

859
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,770
I don't even know him.

860
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:46,330
I was waiting for Mrs. Liu.

861
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,810
I didn't

862
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,420
provoke you or your men.

863
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:52,290
You barged in on your own accord.

864
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,620
That's not the answer I'm looking for.

865
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:58,290
That's my answer.

866
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,620
No one leaves my interrogation room

867
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,810
without telling me the truth.

868
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:13,500
Perhaps

869
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,020
I'm an exception.

870
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:28,940
My Lord, Mr. Jiang is here.

871
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,940
He's waiting in the main hall.

872
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,900
Already?

873
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,810
He has a message for you.

874
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:34,690
What is it?

875
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,460
He says, if you try
to force a confession,

876
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,420
he will report it to His Majesty.

877
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:43,100
Fine. I guess she's not staying.

878
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,540
Did we just get tricked by her?

879
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,500
She made us arrest her,

880
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,460
yet refuses to talk

881
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,020
no matter what.

882
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,100
She's like a statue.

883
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,620
Think of it

884
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:57,810
as a charade.

885
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,170
What shall we do with her?

886
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,290
Take good care of her.

887
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,650
See that no harm comes to her
until the Jiang family arrives.

888
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,810
But we don't have any maids.

889
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,540
Go fetch her maid.

890
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,140
My Lord, she has a request.

891
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,020
Out with it.

892
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,210
She wants to speak to the nuns

893
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,810
in Zhennv Hall.

894
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,170
What makes her think I'd do that?

895
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,580
She said she'd starve herself
if you don't help her,

896
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,810
and see that you can't hand her over
to the Jiang family

897
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:31,620
in one piece.

898
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,060
Where's the Duke?

899
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,370
He has just finished the interrogation.

900
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,370
Where is my daughter?

901
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,100
I want to see her now.

902
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:51,140
Don't worry, Mr. Jiang.

903
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:52,900
The Duke has straightened things out

904
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,170
with your daughter.

905
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:54,900
It was all a misunderstanding.

906
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,330
No harm

907
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:58,290
came to Jiang Li.

908
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,770
It was just a little scare.

909
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,620
The Duke wants you to know

910
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,650
that you're free to take Jiang Li home.

911
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,330
Anything else?

912
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,460
Of course.

913
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,580
He said, no need to thank him,

914
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,650
thank His Majesty.

915
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,900
Second,

916
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,980
when you're ready to take Jiang Li home,

917
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,330
he will give her

918
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,020
half a banner of the house of Su

919
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:22,730
and escort her home

920
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,620
to prove her innocence.

921
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,500
What are you doing here?

922
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,140
I've come to help you.

923
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,650
I owe it all to you.

924
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,580
I'm going back to the Jiang family.

925
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,250
I'll make sure you get to live.

926
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,540
Is that all?

927
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:58,810
Of course.

928
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,060
However, all of you must keep
Jiang Li's secret

929
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,330
hidden forever.

930
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,140
It's for your own good.

931
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,980
The trial is coming up.

932
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,980
Your affair was merely

933
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,330
a crime of indecency.

934
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,900
It has nothing to do with them,

935
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,210
and you don't deserve to die.

936
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:20,620
Worst case, you spend
a few days in jail.

937
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,850
If you get pardoned,
you'll be released even earlier.

938
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:26,330
However, killing the daughter
of a Prime Minister

939
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,500
is a capital crime.

940
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,690
I may have stolen someone's identity
out of greed,

941
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:33,940
but I did not harm anyone.

942
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,900
But you, you took someone's life.

943
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,850
All of you.

944
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,540
Don't you ever think

945
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,540
of blackmailing me.

946
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,210
I won't die,

947
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,810
but you will.

948
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,250
