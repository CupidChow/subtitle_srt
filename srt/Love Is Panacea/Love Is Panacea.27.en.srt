18

Only the person on site

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,640
exposed three cases
of aneurysmal ruptures.

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,160
Yet Prof. Wen Yuliang in charge of R&D

21
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,440
failed to convince at the conference.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,440
Mr. Du,

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,240
is this intentional covering up

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,080
or poor management?

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,040
Let me answer that for you.

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,440
Hello, board members.

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,440
My name is Wen Ran.

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,680
I'm now in charge

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,360
of project HDQ39.

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,360
The Prof. Wen Yuliang you mentioned

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
is my father.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,240
I know his research

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,960
better than anyone.

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,440
From what I understand,

35
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,720
these three patients with ruptures

36
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,160
had already signed

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,200
voluntary withdrawal forms

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,680
before the ruptures.

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,640
In clinical trials,

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,520
these should be counted
as natural dropouts.

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,960
Clearly, it's used

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,880
by someone with an agenda

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,640
to smear our company

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,040
and HDQ39.

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
This just goes to show

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,720
the project's huge potential.

47
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,360
We've stepped on some toes.

48
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
Regardless,

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,560
we'll soon present

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,000
a crisis management plan.

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,960
Don't think a crisis management plan

52
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,200
will help you muddle through.

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,320
I suspect

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,000
there are serious flaws

55
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
in HDQ39's development,

56
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,880
and they have caught someone's eye.

57
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,440
If similar adverse events happen again,

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,240
this drug

59
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,840
will surely be halted
by the Ethics Committee.

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,960
All the billions invested

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,840
will go down the drain.

62
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,000
That's just speculation.

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,960
There's no evidence

64
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,160
linking HDQ39 to the ruptures.

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,960
Even with risks,

66
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,280
our job is

67
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,680
to exhaust our ability

68
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,680
to ensure the project's success

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,880
and its smooth market launch.

70
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,480
It's an "orphan drug".

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,000
Even if it hits the market,

72
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,800
how big can it get?

73
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,840
With such a negative impact now,

74
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,640
I suggest

75
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,280
cutting our losses.

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,360
Listen, everyone.

77
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,080
Authoritative data shows

78
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,720
China's orphan drug market

79
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
will exceed ten billion dollars

80
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,120
in the next five to ten years.

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,120
It has great promise.

82
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640
Our company, Jiehui,

83
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,760
is among the first in China

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,120
to plan and strategize it.

85
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,920
HDQ39 will be the vanguard

86
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,120
in orphan drug research.

87
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,480
And the eager acquisition interest

88
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
from the Maiteng

89
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,040
proves this point.

90
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,680
When I started this project,

91
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,480
you all resisted, just like now.

92
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,840
You want me to cut losses now?

93
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,480
Should we deduct it...

94
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,830
Mr. Wang,

95
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,360
from your bonus?

96
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:20,920
You...

97
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,000
Mr. Wang, stop it.

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,400
Everyone,

99
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,760
if HDQ39 launches smoothly,

100
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
it's good for all.

101
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,920
If it doesn't,

102
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,200
someone must pay

103
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,120
for this stubborn decision.

104
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,360
That's it.

105
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,920
Yuncheng,

106
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,720
those older men on the board

107
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,960
just talked nonsense.

108
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,360
Don't take it to heart.

109
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,720
Don't worry.

110
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,880
I'll do my best

111
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,320
to produce results

112
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,640
and shut them up.

113
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,520
Lots notice problems,

114
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,040
but few solve them.

115
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,960
The latter is who we need.

116
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,600
Are you referring to me?

117
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,480
Ran, step out, please.

118
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Alright.

119
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,800
Senior.

120
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,160
Wei'an, why are you here?

121
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,440
My aunt's sanatorium,

122
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,600
why did you arrange it?

123
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,720
Did you know she has depression?

124
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,720
She can be a heavy burden on your mom.

125
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
Not just house chores

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,920
like washing and cooking

127
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,480
but caring for her mood.

128
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,760
Caring for the sick can be exhausting.

129
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,080
That sanatorium must be pricey.

130
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
I'll transfer you the money.

131
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,920
Let's not talk cash between us.

132
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,880
I told your mom not to tell you.

133
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
You're too proud.

134
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
If you knew this,

135
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,480
you'd have wanted to settle accounts

136
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,920
or felt embarrassed.

137
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,920
But please tell me,

138
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,200
why was the video of my aunt

139
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
in Prof. Wen's report

140
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,440
and taken at the sanatorium?

141
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,480
About the video...

142
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,800
Hold on.

143
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,720
Assistant Lin, come in, please.

144
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,640
Mr. Du.

145
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,360
About the video

146
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,320
taken at the sanatorium

147
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,200
for Wei'an's aunt,

148
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,080
do you know that?

149
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,720
Here's the thing.

150
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,760
Before Prof. Wen's

151
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,360
neurology annual conference,

152
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,720
he needed supporting materials

153
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,480
to show clinical trial results.

154
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,960
I thought a video would be convincing,

155
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,880
so I got Ms. Su Yuan's consent

156
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,080
and sent a video of her to Prof. Wen.

157
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,600
For privacy protection,

158
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,480
I pixelated her face.

159
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,480
About Wei'an's aunt's matter,

160
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
why didn't you consult me first?

161
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,600
I thought

162
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,480
with the face blurred,

163
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
it'd be unrecognizable.

164
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,200
So I...

165
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,240
Sorry, Mr. Du.

166
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,000
I didn't think it through.

167
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,880
Such a thing can never happen again.

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,760
Got it.

169
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,680
Sorry, Wei'an,

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,560
for my poor management.

171
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,320
I'll personally apologize

172
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
to your aunt another day.

173
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
No need, senior.

174
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,240
Thanks for the care.

175
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,320
But we shouldn't trouble you.

176
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,320
I'll find another sanatorium

177
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,680
and move my aunt out soon.

178
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,240
Wei'an, I really wanted

179
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
to help you out.

180
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,560
We appreciate it.

181
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
There's something

182
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,760
I must tell you.

183
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,760
The result of the experiment
Gu Yunzheng and I made indicates that

184
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,880
HDQ39

185
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,600
may be linked to aneurysms.

186
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,440
Tomorrow, I'll talk to Prof. Wen.

187
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,520
I know

188
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,560
you're under pressure for the project.

189
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,880
But I remember you said

190
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,880
if there's any adverse event
with the drug,

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,640

198

199

to halt project HDQ39 myself.

200
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,080

With my dad's integrity,

210
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,840
he'll surely be convinced by her

211
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,080
and halt the trial.

212
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,480

380
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,040
you really disappoint me.

381
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,800
What should I do?

382
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,040
Senior.

383
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,040
Make it short.

384
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,040
I'm pressed for time.

385
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,520
This might take up some
of your time, Mr. Du.

386
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,440
We have many questions for you.

387
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,280
Why were those three aneurysm patients'

388
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,640
voluntary dropout forms

389
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,000
all signed

390
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,640
just before they fell ill?

391
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,040
Even if they fell ill
after dropping out,

392
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,560
you should still report

393
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,640
to the Ethics Committee.

394
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,640
Months have passed,

395
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,440
but we haven't seen

396
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,760
any report from the Ethics Committee.

397
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,440
I wonder why.

398
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,280
That's for the research team.

399
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,400
Jiehui just funds it.

400
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,440
You can ask Prof. Wen about it.

401
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,920
I've already spoken to Prof. Wen.

402
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,520
I've hoped
he'd report the adverse events,

403
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,680
but Yang Wenbin has been obstructing.

404
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,240
And before the neurology conference,

405
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,760
Prof. Wen knew nothing
of the three patients

406
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
with aneurysms.

407
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,280
Someone's covering it up.

408
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,640
Senior,

409
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,560
did you bribe Yang Wenbin?

410
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,440
Wei'an,

411
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,120
don't make accusations

412
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,000
without evidence.

413
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,760
Senior, please stop lying.

414
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,160
I learned from Prof. Wen.

415
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,440
You sent that video

416
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
of my aunt to him.

417
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,160
How many patients like my aunt

418
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
are confined
in your so-called sanatoriums,

419
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,280
under surveillance, at your mercy?

420
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,560
Also,

421
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,120
how did you persuade my mom

422
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,160
and my aunt

423
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,160
to sign the voluntary dropout forms?

424
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,040
Wei'an, it's not what you think.

425
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,440
I'll explain everything to you later.

426
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,400
But now,

427
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,400
I have urgent business.

428
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,160

Du Yuncheng.

430
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,360
If you don't explain everything today,

431
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,440
don't think about leaving.

432
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,400
Get out of my way!

433
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,120
Senior!

434
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,880
Du Yuncheng!

435
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,040
No matter if Prof. Wen

436
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,680
holds a press conference today,

437
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
we'll report our findings

438
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,400
to the Ethics Committee.

439
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,680
HDQ39 won't hit the market.

440
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,760
Senior!

441
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,280
- Gu Yunzheng!
- Senior!

442
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,000
Why do you oppose me on everything?

443
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
Is it because of Su Wei'an?

444
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,280
Don't you know

445
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,920
HDQ39 is her only hope

446
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,040
of survival?

447
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
What did you say?

448
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,640
How do you know?

449
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,840
I know. I've known for a long time.

450
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,920
I know everything.

451
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,640
Ever since you left school,

452
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,800
I've known it all.

453
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,640
You carry the gene
for Huntington's Disease.

You're

In a few years,

456

you're going to get sick.

457
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,400
Without a specific drug,

458
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,480
you're likely to die.

459
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,560
Do you think I wanted

460
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,800
to abandon being a doctor

461
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,640
to take over Grandpa's medicine company?

462
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,640
I've been under so much pressure
from the board

463
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,320
to invest in HDQ39.

464
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,400
Because it's the only mature project
on Huntington's

465
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,240
in our country.

466
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,160
If Wen Ran weren't Prof. Wen's daughter,

467
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,000
I wouldn't have given her a second look.

468
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,880
I've done all this for you!

469
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,240
A drug that could cause
aneurysmal ruptures

470
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
and even cause death.

471
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,920
You say it's for Wei'an?

472
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,400
Yes.

473
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,160
I've analyzed

474
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,000
the impact of hypertension

475
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,840

477
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,880
do you think you're the only clever one?

478
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,600
As long as Wei'an
doesn't have high blood pressure,

479
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,440
the drug is effective.

480
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't talk about the incidence
of adverse events

481
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,680
being four percent.

482
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,400
Even if it was forty percent,

483
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
I would overcome all difficulties
to make it to market.

484
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,600

485

486
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,360
No matter how you see me,

487
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,680
as long as I can save Wei'an,

488
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,080
I'll do whatever it takes.

489
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,480
But I don't need it, senior.

490
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,080
I need even less

491
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,680
for you to sacrifice others to save me.

492
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,120
Yes,

493
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,400
it's all wishful thinking on my part.

494
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,840
You rejected me before.

495
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
I thought it was because
of Huntington's.

496
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,400
I thought that if I developed a cure,

497
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,760
you would give me another chance

498
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,880
and consider me again.

499
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,080

500
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,200
be carefree and happy like before.

But

502
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,400
I was wrong.

You only have Gu Yunzheng
in your heart, like them.

No matter my achievements,

506
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,920

Remember the Hippocratic Oath

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,600
but not the ninety-nine percent
of patients

512
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
whose symptoms are delayed?

513
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,400
For that one percent,

of attack of Huntington's,

and death by choking

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,760
is that your rigor?

566
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,600
Enough.

567
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,920
Su Wei'an,

568
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,160
your so-called love for research,

569
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,560
and returning to the lab,

570
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,840
these are just for your survival, right?

571
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,520
Yes, what's wrong with it?

572
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,280
I want to find a chance to survive

573
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,800
for thirty thousand patients
with Huntington's

574
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,840
in my lifetime.

575
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,400
Is there anything wrong with it?

576
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,840
I'm telling you,

577
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,520
HDQ39 is your only chance to survive.

578
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,800
And today, you destroyed it
with your own hand.

579
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,840
When you fall ill with no cure,

580
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,160
you'll get what you deserve.

581
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,920
Wei'an.

582
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,480
Wen Ran,

583
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,080
you truly don't deserve
to be Prof. Wen's daughter.

584
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,880
[HDQ39-Mouse Aneurysm]
You've already known

585
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,040
[Association Study Report]
HDQ39 could lead to aneurysms.

586
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,600
Why didn't you report it
to the Medical Ethics Committee?

587
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,240
This research report,

588
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,800
he gave it to you, right?

589
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,640
You think you've done
nothing wrong, right?

590
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,760
Yunzheng gave me this report
to frame you up.

591
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,320
Do you mean that?

592
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,320
Prof. Wen has been rigorous
during his whole life.

593
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,600
He couldn't have made
such a stupid mistake.

594
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,240
If it's not his problem,

595
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,360
then it must be yours.

596
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,680
Dad,

597
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,400
if it wasn't me standing here today,

598
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,080
but Yunzheng,

599
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,440
would you believe him,

600
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,560
or would you believe Prof. Wen?

601
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,040
Jiehui was founded by me.

602
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,920
You've taken over it

603
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,920
just for three years
but caused such a scandal.

604
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,160
From now on,

605
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,360
don't come to this old house anymore.

606
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,760
Is coming to this old house

607
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,800
some great honor?

608
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,680
Do you think I want to come?

609
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,280
Grandpa,

610
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,400
since I was young,
you've only cared for Yunzheng.

611
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,280
You said I'm inferior
to him in every way

612
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,120
and you told me to give way to him.

613
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,040
He lost his mother,

614
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,120
but you gave him all the best things

615
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,360
in the world.

616
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,840
You favoured him and praised him.

617
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,600
Even though I was the one by your side,

618
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,080
you still wished to see him.

619
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,800
Clearly, I'm the eldest son
and grandson of this family.

620
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,280
Clearly, he has changed
his surname to Gu.

621
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,600
But in your heart,

622
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,400
I could never equal Gu Yunzheng.

623
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,920
And my mom,

624
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,520
she prepared so many gifts for you.

625
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,600
Have you ever appreciated them?

626
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,120
Have you ever cared about her feelings?

627
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,280
Today I just want
to ask you one question.

628
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,320
What did we do wrong?

629
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,160
Is our dignity worth nothing to you?

630
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,360
Shut up!

631
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,840
How can you speak
to your grandpa like this?

632
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,880
Grandpa,

633
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,280
dad,

634
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,840
I won't come

635
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,480
to this old house again.

636
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,400
Du Yuncheng!

637
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,680
We want the medicine!

638
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,000
Give us the medicine!

639
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,320
Call your president out!

640
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,680
Let him explain to us!

641
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,040
Why was the HDQ39 trial suspended?

642
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,280
Why can't it be marketed?

643
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,320
- We want the medicine!
- Give us the medicine!

644
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,640
Give us an explanation!

645
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,160
Quiet, quiet!

646
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,280
Listen to me.

647
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,040
We will surely give you an explanation.

648
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,360
But Mr. Du isn't here today,

649
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,120
please go back home for now, okay?

650
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,080
I'll give you an explanation.

651
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,890
Yes.

652
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,480
You want to know

653
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,320
who's stopping you
from getting your medicine?

654
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,560
I'll tell you now.

655
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,840
How could they let my son
stop his medication?

656
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,040
She's here.

657
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,620
- Quickly, quickly!
- It's them!

658
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,480
- It's your fault!
- What are you doing?

659
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,360
It's all because of you!

660
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,240
Miss, please,

661
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,360
announce that you were mistaken.

662
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,560
If this drug goes to market,

663
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,640
my wife can have a chance to survive!

664
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Right!

665
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,480
Your aunt's aneurysm was her bad luck.

666
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,360
But you're stopping us from medication.

667
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,880
That's your fault!

668
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,040
Yes, give us the medicine!

669
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,720
Enough.

670
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,400
Give us the medicine!

671
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,440
Enough.

672
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,960
Calm down.

673
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,720
Everyone disperse,
or we'll call the police.

674
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,760
Calm down!

675
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,840
Haven't you slept yet?

676
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,400
I was thinking

677
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,640
that although HDQ39 has side effects,

678
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,960
it's also the hope

679
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,040
of every person with Huntington's.

680
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,720
I destroyed that hope with my own hands,

681
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,560
but where is the next hope?

682
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,640
We are able

683
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,640
to create that hope together.

684
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,080
Since we met in Lacaya,

685
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
you seem to always be unlucky,

686
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,600
with endless trouble

687
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,160
and a series of misfortunes.

688
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,720
Maybe,

689
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,200
to meet you,

690
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,040
I've used up all my luck.

691
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,040
Come on, let's see

692
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,120
who received the NSFDYS

693
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,160
this time.

694
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,960
Of course, it's my Boss.

695
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,460
[Ji Lanjuan, Luo Qun'an,
Qi Changyong, Zhao Yanxin]

696
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,940
[Xu Zhiqi, Shen Jiaming, Xu Ting]

697
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,040
How come he's not there?

698
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
Director Wang said,

699
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,400
my Boss's project on glioma

700
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,360
had a great chance to get the NSFDYS.

701
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,680
Fan,

702
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,040
your Boss,

703
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,440
has changed the direction
of his research

704
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,960
from glioma to Huntington's.

705
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,880
Really? Why don't I know that?

706
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,360
Boss!

707
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,640
Director Wang.

708
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,920
What happened?

709
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
Why the rush?

710
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,520
Nothing.

711
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,080
Well, teacher,

712
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,240
I'm going to change clothes first,

713
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,520
and let's meet
at our usual place tonight.

714
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,960
Teacher,

715
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,640
here,

716
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,480
your favorite Spicy Rabbit Kidneys.

717
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,160
Try it.

718
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,080
I have no appetite.

719
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,240
Tell me,

720
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,760
why did you suddenly decide

721
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,520
to apply for a Huntington's project?

722
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,320
Our entire Neurosurgery Department

723
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,160
has no foundation in this area.

724
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,640
Even if you collaborate
with internal medicine

725
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,600
or collaborate with international teams

726
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,240
to apply for the project,

727
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,440
it'll be starting from scratch.

728
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,200
Are you aware of that?

729
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,040
Right.

730
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,040
You know it's a tough task,

731
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,200
so I have to move faster.

732
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,710
What about your glioma project?

733
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,960
Are you going

734
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,880
to abandon it halfway?

735
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,320
The glioma project

736
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,880
has concluded,

737
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,560
so it's not abandoned halfway.

738
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,880
What about the work

739
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,670
of your glioma research team?

740
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,320
Well,

741
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,400
I trust Director Wang,

742
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,630
you'll find the right person

743
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,960
to take over it.

744
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,230
Stop kidding around.

745
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,400
If you really took me, your director,

746
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,560
your teacher, seriously,

747
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,360
why wouldn't you discuss it with me

748
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,040
before making such a big decision?

749
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,400
Teacher,

750
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,840
One day a teacher, a lifetime a father.

751
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,000
You're even closer to me

752
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,230
than my own father.

753
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,920
Here,

754
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,280
try this also.

755
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,560
Try it.

756
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,320
You have limited funds and staff,

757
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,880
and it's hard to produce results.

758
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,680
Have you thought
about these difficulties?

759
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,560
Huntington's Disease

760
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,280
is a global challenge.

761
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,920
It might take

762
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,640
the rest of your life on this.

763
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,680
Have you considered that?

764
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,320
Teacher,

765
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,360
I didn't discuss it with you this time

766
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,440
because there was no room
for discussion.

767
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,960
I've made my decision.

768
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,560
I'm not being impulsive

769
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,760
or being emotional.

770
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,040
Every step I'm taking now

771
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,240
has been thought through.

772
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,400
I've even designed

773
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,240
a tentative cure mechanism.

774
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,680
My task now

775
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,400
is to wage a long battle

776
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,240
against this disease.

777
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,240
Look at you...

778
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,040
I think

779
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,960
it's because you fell in love

780
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,440
with Su Wei'an.

781
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,880
Just for her,

782
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,480
you changed your research direction,

783
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,760
didn't you?

784
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,640
Teacher,

785
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,280
do you remember

786
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
why you chose

787
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,720
to research glioma originally?

788
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,560
You told me your son's story.

789
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,640
He was fourteen

790
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,600
when he had stage III glioma.

791
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,080
Now,

792
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,080
it's been nearly ten years
since he left you.

793
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,320
I believe you would understand the most

794
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,400
the pain and despair

795
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,240
of being unable to do anything

796
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,320
for your loved ones

797
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,240
when they are sick.

798
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,720
Yes,

799
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,080
I'm dating Su Wei'an.

800
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,520
But it's also because of her

801
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,400
that I've understood better

802
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,480
patients with Huntington's
and their families.

803
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,360
And I understood their helplessness
and despair

804
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,960
in the face of illness.

805
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,400
It's for this reason

806
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,240
that I have the courage
to fight this disease

807
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,840
to the bitter end.

808
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,360
Maybe in our lifetime,

809
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,760
we'll never achieve anything.

810
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,200
But isn't it better

811
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,760
than doing nothing?

812
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,520
I knew before coming here

813
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,240
that talking to you would be pointless,

814
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,760
like casting pearls before swine.

815
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,280
Here, teacher,

816
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
have some of this.

817
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,160
In the future,

818
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,760
I will still need a lot

819
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,520
of support from you.

820
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,800
Understood.

821
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,640
What's wrong?

822
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,400
Anything goes down in the hospital?

823
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,520
It's not the hospital, it's Yunzheng.

824
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,600
Yunzheng?

825
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,920
What's wrong with him?

826
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,400
He was doing fine with glioma research,

827
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,280
but suddenly he wanted
to switch to Huntington's.

828
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,760
I don't know what he's up to.

829
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,040
Huntington's?

830
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,880
I've never even heard of it.

831
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,520
What's

832
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,840
in Yunzheng's mind?

833
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,000
Du, don't be anxious.

834
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,240
Yunzheng might just be on a whim.

835
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,040
He might switch back
in a couple of days.

836
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Switch what?

837
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,320
Do you think this is a game?

838
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,000
Academic research requires
wholehearted dedication.

839
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,520
Don't get angry with me.

840
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
In my opinion,

841
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,640
Yunzheng is an excellent child,

842
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,840
but you can't let him be all the time.

843
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,480
You still need to oversee things.

844
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,440
However,

845
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,320
whether he listens to you
is another question.

846
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,880
After all, Yunzheng is not Yuncheng.

847
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,520
He has had his own mind since childhood.

848
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,800
Speaking of Yuncheng,

849
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,640
I have been unable
to contact him recently.

850
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,720
- Enough.
- Now Jiehui...

851
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,680
Let's not bring up Yuncheng.

852
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,680
On Yunzheng,

853
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
I have my judgment.

854
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,520
Let's eat.

[To Selectively Degrade HD-Associated

857
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,520
Boss,

858
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,360
I didn't finish
what I wanted to say last time.

859
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,800
I heard you're switching
to Huntington's,

860
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,440
and I want to join you.

861
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,400
Fang Mingfan,

862
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,640
You don't need to switch with me.

863
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,880
The follow-up work for my former project

864
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,160
will be well managed
by Director Wang Huanzhong.

865
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,760
I just have one question for you:

866
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,600
Do you still need people
on your project team?

867
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,480
Then why do you hesitate?

868
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,280
I just want to follow you.

869
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,040
Moreover,

870
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,920
I don't have a specific research project

871
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,680
or the ambition
to achieve specific results.

872
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,880
You have to think it through.

873
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,840
What's in front of me now

874
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,040
is very likely a dead end,

875
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,680
or every path could be a dead end.

876
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,080
Even if ending up

877
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,480
with a disastrous defeat,

878
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,000
that could be possible.

879
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,560
Even so, do you still want to join?

880
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,600
I'm not afraid.
Even if there's a dead end ahead,

881
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
we can always find another way.

882
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,680
Let me tell you,

883
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,040
my current research team

884
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,880
only has me and Su Wei'an.

885
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,160
We're in need of staff,

886
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,680
in desperate need.

887
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,080
Yunzheng.

888
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,480
When will you bring
your favourite pupil home

889
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,160
to meet your grandpa?

890
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,880
Who has bewitched my grandson?

891
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,440
I just want to see the person.

892
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,160
Fang Mingfan,

893
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,280
there's only one condition
to join my team:

894
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,000
don't spy for my grandpa.

895
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,800
No, I didn't.

896
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,040
If it's not you, then who...

897
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,640
Don't distress Fang Mingfan.

898
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,280
I heard it from Wang.

899
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,160
Now, in the whole country,

900
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,280
probably only my grandpa

901
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,040
and no one else would dare

902
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,680
to call Director Wang Huanzhong

903
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,800
Wang.

904
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,680
Exactly!

905
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,000
Director Wang used
to be grandpa's subordinate.

906
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,360
It must have been him who did it.

907
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,200
Boss, I'm going to leave now.

908
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,880
Hello, director.

909
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,440
Why do you want
to change your research direction

910
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,080
to study a rare disease?

911
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,680
Though fewer patients
have rare diseases,

912
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,200
their lives are equally valuable,

913
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,840
and they also need to be seen.

914
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,840
But why is it specifically Huntington's?
