Transfer all liquidity abroad.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,360
We'll conduct R&D abroad.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,560
We can't move a single cent
from our account.

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,200
We'll be lucky
to get out of the country.

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,480
Don't even think about R&D.

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,640
Contact the person in charge
at the Tojerin Lab immediately.

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,440
Have them send people to China.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,320
We can sell them
the remaining patient serum

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,120
from the Jiehui Lab.

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,200

Don't you think I know?

Would I have risked everything

if I had a choice?

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,640
You were involved in everything.

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,640
Do you think you can get away with it?

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,760

Ran,

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,960
you heard us talking, didn't you?

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,480
Yuncheng,

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,480
take me with you.

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,440
I can give up everything here

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,240

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,960
Jiehui is already a mess now.

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,720
It's useless for you to waste time here.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,560
Ran,

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,720
once you are involved,

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,200
there's no turning back.

53
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,480
You have to make up your mind.

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,880
Dad.

55
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,240
What on earth is going on?

56
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,270
Yuncheng has been lying to me.

57
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,360
He said the new drug was developed

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,840
based on your achievements,

59
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,000
and it was an upgraded version of HQD39,

60
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,880
but in fact,

61
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,480
it's a copy of illegal drugs
from abroad.

62

Ran,

63
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,240
this is a huge deal.

64

You can't spread baseless news.

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,680
It's true.

66
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,080
I heard it with my own ears.

67
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,400
Before the Ethics Committee approved it,

68
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,560
he used it for underground testing.

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,520
The rumors of deaths from new drugs

70
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,320
seem to be true by now.

71
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,480
Ran,

72
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,560
once an obsessive person
goes down the wrong path,

73
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,360
there is no saving him.

74
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,560
There is no solid evidence
but only your testimony.

75
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,920
If we call the police now,

76
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,080
it's not enough to bring him to justice.

77
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,080
Dad,

78
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,920
I really regret this.

79
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
I wanted to achieve something
to show you,

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,200
but I never thought it would cost lives.

81
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,520
Yuncheng has become
especially scary now.

82
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,600

Ran,

86
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,240
don't be scared.

87
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,480
Since you made mistakes, just fix them.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,520
No matter what mistakes
you made in the past,

89
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
as long as you can find your way back,

90
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,600
you'll always be my good daughter.

91
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,640
OK.

92
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,840
Why did you call me out so late?

93
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,480
Wei'an,

94
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,400
I want to tell you

95
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,320
that the new drug developed by Jiehui,

96
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,400
which they claimed to be

97
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,200
an upgraded version of HQD39,

98
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,080
is actually a knockoff
of prohibited foreign drugs.

99
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,240
I know that.

100
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,680
We've analyzed the ingredients

101
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,680
of the drug he gave my aunt

102
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,800
and turned them over to the police.

103
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,920
Wei'an,

104
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,960
he wants to continue this abroad.

105
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,880
In order to raise funds,

106
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,920
he wants to sell the serum in our lab

107
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,720
to foreign laboratories.

108
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,360
Is he out of his mind?

109
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,880
The leakage of genetic information
of Chinese people

110
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,480
will seriously endanger
national security.

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,640
Only you can stop him.

112
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,680
He cares the most about you.

113
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,840
You should tell him to give up.

114
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,600
He wouldn't have killed my aunt

115
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,680
if he had any conscience.

116
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,880
Then...

117
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,360
What should we do now?

118
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,080
Give me your phone.

119
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,520
Why?

120
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,960
I want to read something on our way.

121

Where are we going?

124

Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

Let's go.

126
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,880

130
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,880
are here.

131
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,080
You can't even find them on the market.

looking for reasons to blame others,

never reflecting on yourself.

158
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
You are selling biological samples
of Chinese people

159
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,520
to foreigners,

160
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,160
which seriously endangers
national security.

161
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,720
It is a felony.

162
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,800
The serum of a bunch of
rare disease patients

163
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,920
would at least be sold
for a good price in my hands,

164
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,600
but it would just be trash
to anyone else.

165
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,520
Survival of the fittest.

166
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,400
Some people are not going to survive,

167
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,400
so there is no shame
in sacrificing some of them.

168
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,320
How can you say something like that?

169
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,440
Wei'an,

170
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
I will do anything for you,

171
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,600
even the things that you think

172
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,000
are dirty and evil.

173
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,360
I won't even care.

174
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,280
Because I know

175
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,200
that I only have one thing to do,

176
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,040
and that is to let you live on.

177

Gu Yunzheng,

178
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,560
are you happy now?

179
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,280
You stole my happy life,

180
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,400
my family,

181
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
and my childhood.

182
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,720
Wake up.

183
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,360
My mom didn't even know
about your existence

184
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,400
before marrying your dad.

185
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,000
When she went to Lacaya for relief work,

186
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,000
Cui Jie

187
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,000
sent her the photo
of your family of three.

188
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,200
Because my mom found out
about her husband's affair,

189
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
she became mentally disoriented

190
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,720
and had an accident.

191
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,880
It was Cui Jie
who caused my mom's death.

192
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,200
When she was pregnant with you,

193
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Du Yongsong was already engaged.

194
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,520
That's why Grandpa

195
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,200
always had that attitude towards you.

196
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,800
That's why Du Yongsong
is unwilling to pay attention to you.

197
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,080
Because you are just a tool

198
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,720
that Cui Jie meticulously plotted to
wreck my home.

199
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,040
In Du Yongsong's eyes,

200
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,360
you have always been a nuisance
from the start.

201
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,600
Get out of my home!

202
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,040
This is my home!

203
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,880
You are annoying. Get out!

204
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,520
You get out!

205
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,120
Yunzheng!

206
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
Let go!

207
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,320
What are you doing?

208
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,080
Honey, it's all Yuncheng's fault.

209
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,320
Don't blame Yunzheng.

210
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,320
Yuncheng, apologize to your brother.

211
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,320
Be good!

212
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,680
Yuncheng,

213
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,360
I apologize to you.

214
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,600
I shouldn't have spanked you.

215
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,720
Mom,

216
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,560
am I Daddy's son or not?

217
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,360
Is this my home?

218
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
Of course, you are, silly kid.

219
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,600
Why would you ask such a silly question?

220
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,880
Then why did Dad

221
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,840
marry Yunzheng's mom?

222
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,360
Yunzheng's mom

223
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,920
took Dad from us before,

224
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,480
but now he is back to us.

225
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,920
Adults' world is very complicated.

226
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,520
Just remember,

227
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,560
you are his son,

228
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,360
and we are the real family.

229
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,200
Got it?

230
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,360
Then

231
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,520
what if Yunzheng's mom comes back?

232
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,080
His mom went to another world,

233
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,360
and she won't ever come back.

234
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,800
(The defendant, Du Yuncheng,)

235
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,920
(illegally smuggled
human genetic resources,)

236
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,640
(illegally produced prohibited drugs,
and caused death,)

237
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,160
(and the circumstances
are particularly serious.)

238
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
(In accordance with
Article 141, Article 334 )

239
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,800
(of the Criminal Law of)

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,120
(the People's Republic of China,)

241
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,080
(this Court imposes)

242
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,800
(a sentence of 15 years imprisonment)

243
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,040
(and confiscation
of all personal property.)

244
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,760
Yuncheng, don't you worry!

245
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,160
I will find the best attorney

246
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,080
to help you appeal the verdict.

247
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,760
No need.

248
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,920
I broke the law

249
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
and should be brought to justice.

250
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,080
How can I live

251
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,880
without you?

252
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,200
Isn't it good to keep being
the director's wife,

253
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,720
Mrs. Du,

254
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,960
living a life

255
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,400
of abundance that others envy?

256
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,400
How can you think of me that way?

257
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,520
Didn't I do all of this for your sake?

258
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,360
Back then, sending the family portrait

259
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,360
to Gu Xingchen,

260
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,520
who was far away in Lacaya,
was that also for me?

261
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,160
How did you find out?

262
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,760
From childhood to adulthood,

263
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,120
I never understood why

264
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,400
Dad and Grandpa favored Gu Yunzheng.

265
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,400
No matter how hard I tried,

266
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,080
they never thought highly of me.

267
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,000
The harder I tried to prove myself,

268
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,360
the less they thought of me.

269
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,200
Now I understand

270
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,360
that my birth

271
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,160
was just a bargaining chip
for you to be Mrs. Du.

272
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,000
I was a child who wasn't blessed.

273
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,920
That's not true, Yuncheng.

274
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,560
Things are not like that.

275
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,720
You shouldn't think that way.

276
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,280
Back then,

277
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,160
when you reached school age,

278
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,240
you couldn't go to school
without household registration.

279
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,840
I was just taking back
what belonged to me.

280
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,720
I didn't do anything wrong!

281
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,200
Du Yongsong abandoned you

282
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,320
for a well-matched,

283
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,360
wealthy Gu Xingchen.

284
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,240
Why did you give birth to me?

285
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,040
Why did you let that selfish person

286
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
be my father?

287
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,310
Did you really do it out of love for me,

288
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,200
or to satisfy your own vanity

289
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,280
of marrying into a wealthy family?

290
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,160
Mom, is that tiring?

291
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,400
In order to become a Du,

292
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,200
have you ever had a good night's sleep?

293
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,720
You've carefully tried to please Dad,

294
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
to please Grandpa,

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,080
just because you're afraid
of making another mistake

296
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,520
and being kicked out
of that family, right?

297
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,160
Mom,

298
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,400
look at the way I've become today.

299
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,440
Isn't it caused by you

300
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
and Du Yongsong?

301
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,720
No, Yuncheng.

302
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,840
Let me explain!

303
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,440
Yuncheng!

304
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,360
Let me explain!

305
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,760
Yuncheng, that's not true!

306
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,720
Yuncheng, listen to me!

307
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,520
Yuncheng!

308
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,520
It's not like that!

309
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,240
Du Yuncheng!

310
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,080
What's going on with Du Yuncheng now?

311
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,040
Fifteen years in prison.

312
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,120
How could he do something so heinous?

313
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,400
Our Du family's reputation
built over generations

314
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,200
was ruined just like that by him!

315
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,400
A person like this
doesn't deserve to be my son.

316
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,320
It's not that he doesn't deserve you.

317
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,800
It's that you don't deserve
to be his father.

318
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,800
What nonsense are you talking about?

319
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,960
Yuncheng is right.

320
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,800
You are an extremely selfish person.

321
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,320
Your son is sentenced to jail,

322
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
yet you're still thinking about
the Du's reputation.

323
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,800
Clinging to what doesn't belong to me

324
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,080
will only lead to retribution.

325
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,200
Whether you believe it or not,

326
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,400
causing Gu Xingchen's death back then

327
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,760
was not my intention.

328
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,440
After the incident,

329
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,760
I also lived in self-blame and guilt
for years.

330
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,520
Yuncheng ending up like today

331
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,040
is all due to my own faults.

332
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,080
We all have to take responsibility
for our mistakes.

333
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,560
Starting today,

334
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,520
I will leave you

335
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,360
and this family.

336
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,360
Mr. Gu and Ms. Su,

337
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,560
thank you for choosing our company.

338
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,280
I'm Qi, your exclusive

339
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,400
wedding planner for this occasion.

340
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,560
In the past three years,
I've also designed

341
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,520
theme weddings for many couples.

342
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,840
So, this time,

343
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,160
you two will definitely have

344
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,480
an unforgettable experience in life.

345
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,360
So,

346
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,520
all the elements I envisioned

347
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,360
can be achieved by you, right?

348
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,760
Of course,

349
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,720
our job is

350
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
to turn the client's imagination
into reality.

351
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,040
Don't act so inexperienced.

352
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,480
It's my first time to get married,

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,360
so I certainly
don't have any experience.

354
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,920
What other experience have you had

355
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,880
that nobody knows about?

356
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,400
Stop that!

357
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,120
How did you two know each other?

358
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,720
Do you have any special stories

359
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,880
you can share with us?

360
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,520
She had

361
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,520
a crush on me for eight years.

362
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,920
Not eight years!

363
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,680
- No?
- Don't exaggerate.

364
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,440
Miss Su,

365
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,120
the point is the "crush"!

366
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,200
Secret love is very beautiful.

367
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,920
Are you doctors?

368
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,200
You can try our

369
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,400
hospital theme wedding.

370
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,880
No, thanks.

371
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,040
No.

Why doesn't he hand me this in person?

393
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,560
Mr. Gu said he's too shy
to say this face-to-face,

394
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,120

thicker than others.
