[Based on the novel "Healer"
by Ningmeng Yuyan]

18
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,980
Slowly.

19
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,500
Slow down, Fang Mingfan.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,220
It's a mountain road.

21
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,540
Are you scared?

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,660
No, I'm not.

23
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,300
You had to come.

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,620
What if something happens to us?

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,620
How are we going to save them two?

26
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,540
With this speed...

27
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,420
Careful.

28
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,620
We can hardly get there by daybreak.

29
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,660
What now?

30
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,860
Their phones must be dead.

31
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,860
I just called them,
but I couldn't get through.

32
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,060
This won't do.

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,980
Boss never gives up on me.

34
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,980
I can never leave him alone.

35
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,540
What do you mean to give up on you?

36
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,620
Why should he do that?

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,420
Didn't you ask me

38
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,180
about my operative mortality?

39
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,420
I said that I had no record.

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,300
Actually, in my first operation,

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,980
my patient died on the operating table.

42
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,540
That night,

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,580
the patient's vitals were unstable.

44
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,980
Blood pressure 82, 48.

45
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,980
Blood oxygen 70.

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,420
This is a blood blister-like aneurysm.

47
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,300
The hemorrhagic spots
must be taken care of now.

48
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,540
How long before Dr. He arrives?

49
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,740
Dr. He is still having the runs.

50
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,100
Director Zhang is in an operation now.

51
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,340
Blood oxygen is lower than 60 now.

52
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,820
Bleeding is over 1,000ml.

53
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,660
We can't wait.

54
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,660
Do the operation now.

55
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,780
Dr. He only told you

56
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,980
to maintain the patient's vitals.

57
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,100
If you do it now,

58
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,700
you'll be responsible for the result.

59
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,420
Blood blister-like aneurysms

60
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,500
are the most difficult and riskiest.

61
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,460
Can you do it?

62
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,460
If I don't try,

63
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,460
he'll be dead for sure.

64
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,340
The operation begins now.

65
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,580
Gelatin sponge.

66
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,660
The patient is in shock.
He needs a transfusion now.

67
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,700
The patient's having a cardiac arrest.

68
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,940
Give him CPR now.

69
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,420
Dr. He didn't show up.

70
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,220
The patient was dying.

71
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,180
What else can I do?

72
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,940
Watch him die?

73
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,020
You've only been an assistant before.

74
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,460
You have never dealt with aneurysms.

75
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,940
How can you act without permission?

76
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,300
Thankfully, his family are sensible
and won't hold you accountable.

77
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,940
Go reflect on yourself properly.

78
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,620
He can't even handle aneurysms,

79
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,340
but he dared to act
without the attending doctor.

80
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,620
Who does he think he is?

81
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,700
Dr. He said

82
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,340
that someone
isn't meant to be a surgeon.

83
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,980
I think no medical teams

84
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,620
in our department will accept him.

85
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,980
(He can't even handle aneurysms,)

86
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,700
(but he dared to act
without the attending doctor.)

87
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,220
(Who does he think he is?)

88
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,340
(Dr. He said)

89
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,980
(that someone
isn't meant to be a surgeon.)

90
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,620
(I think no medical teams)

91
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,260
(in our department will accept him.)

92
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,780
(You've only been an assistant before.)

93
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,220
(You have never dealt with aneurysms.)

94
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,700
(How can you act without permission?)

95
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,060
(Thankfully his family are sensible
and won't hold you accountable.)

96
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,620
(Go reflect on yourself properly.)

97
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,220
(He can't even handle aneurysms,)

98
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,940
(but he dared to act
without the attending doctor.)

99
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,460
(Who does he think he is?)

100
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,260
(How did the patient die?)

101
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,460
Everyone thought I was doomed,

102
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
including myself.

103
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,900
Then Dr. Gu helped you?

104
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,900
You know why I keep calling him Boss?

105
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,820
He's only two levels higher than me.

106
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,780
But he's the opposite of me.

107
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,180
He was famous after his first operation.

108
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,300
He performed a thalamic tumor operation
at a very young age

109
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,660
and became a legend
of Huaren's Neurosurgery Department.

110
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,260
But I didn't expect

111
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,660
that he would say

112
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,900
to a loser who was forsaken by all

113
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,780
and about to change profession,

114
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,380
"If you don't mind,

115
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,900
I need a first assistant".

116
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,580
Fang Mingfan?

117
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,580
Why are you back?

118
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:31,780
What?

119
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,500
I said since you've decided to give up,

120
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,780
why do you still come to the hospital?

121
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,060
A habit, I guess.

122
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,940
Could be an instinct, too.

123
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,440
Fang Mingfan.

124
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,720
How much do you know
about the transsphenoidal approach

125
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,640
of pituitary tumors?

126
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,120
I studied some videos

127
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,640
and watched some doctors do it.

128
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,880
Sorry for this.

129
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
But I need a first assistant.

130
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,600
I can be it.

131
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
Later, Boss came here for aid.

132
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,200
I didn't want to stay in China,

133
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,720
where people commented about me.

134
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,640
Then I followed him.

135
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,280
So, Dr. Gu

136
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,320
became your boss instead of your senior.

137
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,200
Then why did he favor you that much?

138
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,640
I asked him why he picked me.

139
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,560
He didn't favor me.

140
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,040
He said he just
didn't want to see a deserter.

141
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,360
He hated deserters.

142
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,360
And then?

143
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,120
When did you have

144
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,150
your second surgery?

145
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,840
I'm not ready yet.

146
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,120
I know I'm useless.

147
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Don't say that.

148
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,120
You can't be as useless as me, anyway.

149
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,560
If you're not ready,

150
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,840
take your time to get ready.

151
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,320
Life is long.
There's always a second chance.

152
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,360
Yes, there is.

153
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,360
The free clinic is right ahead, I think.

154
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,360
Let's stay here and wait for them.

155
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,600
Keep looking when it's light.

156
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,040
Come on.

157
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,320
Be careful.

158
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,640
Are you OK?

159
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,360
I'm OK.

Gu Yunzheng.

162
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,680
Gu Yunzheng, wake up.

163
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
You can't fall asleep.

164
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,120
Don't worry.

165
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I didn't go into shock.

166
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,040
I'm just too sleepy.

167
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,560
I served the medical mission all day

168
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,680
and walked such a long way.

169
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,320
I'm really exhausted.

170
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,880
If you feel uncomfortable,

171
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,400
you have to tell me.

172
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,640
Su Wei'an,

173
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,840
to be honest,

174
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,840
I quite enjoy
being taken care of by you.

175
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
So,

176
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,600
if I feel uncomfortable,

177
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,280
I won't keep it from you.

178
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,040
Take some rest.

179
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
We can't walk like this.

180
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,200
I'll go get helpers.

181
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,920
You wait here for me.

182
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,360
Be careful, Su Wei'an!

183
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,640
Hurry up.

184
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,640
Let's go.

185
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,720
There.

186
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,040
Gu Yunzheng.

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,760
Gu Yunzheng.

188
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,000
Gu Yunzheng.

189
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,760
Wake up.

190
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,680
Gu Yunzheng.

191
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,440
You freaked me out.

192
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,240
You're so strong.

193
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,120
Are you OK?

194
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,040
I really didn't want to wake up.

195
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,160
If you woke me up two seconds later,

196
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,720
I could kiss you.

197
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,400
Look at this occasion.

198
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,440
Don't involve me in this kind of dream.

199
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,400
What?

200
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,000
Whatever you want to interfere with,

201
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,040
you can't interfere with my dream.

202
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,720
Wei'an!

203
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:24,840
Hurry.

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,800
Get him in.

205
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,760
Boss, what happened?

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,760
What happened?

207
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,280
What's wrong?

208
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,660
[Friendship Hospital]

209
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
You're awake.

210
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,880
How do you feel now?

211
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,720
I'm thirsty.

212
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,160
Have some water.

213
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,040
It stimulates the body's metabolism.

214
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,760
Hungry.

215
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,240
Here's some porridge. Want some?

216
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,320
I can't get up.

217
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,160
Forget it, then.

218
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,280
Let me feed you.

219
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,720
Here.

220
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,720
Get me up.

221
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,160
Am I seeing this right?

222
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,640
Wei'an is feeding Dr. Gu.

223
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,400
That night,

224
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,480
what did they do in Labe Village?

225
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,240
Wei'an is like a different person now.

226
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
So is Dr. Gu.

227
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,240
Did they eat some fruits

228
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,760
in the village

229
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,480
and get poisoned?

230
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,760
Morning, Lan.

231
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,840
What are you calling me for?

232
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll be late for the square dance.

233
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,400
Square dance?

234
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,120
But it's eight in the morning

235
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,000
Beijing time, isn't it?

236
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
Even wage slaves don't work until nine.

237
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,200
Fine. I'll talk for a few minutes.

238
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Wait.

239
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,560
It's the weekend.

240
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
Why do you still stay in the hospital,

241
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,400
taking classes, doing experiments,

242
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,960
or reading in the library?

243
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,400
You waste your time in France.

244
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,720
You don't enjoy your life at all.

245
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,680
Who told you
I only stayed in the hospital?

246
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,920
Last week, I volunteered
for a medical mission in a village.

247
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,240
I enjoyed the French countryside

248
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,800
and experienced local customs.

249
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,440
What's the difference
between seeing patients

250
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
in a village and a hospital?

251
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,480
Look. You're tanned again.

252
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,400
Listen, a young girl must do skin care.

253
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,240
See?

254
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,480
Sunscreen.

255
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,960
It should be sprayed every two hours.

256
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,840
You know what? Don't be stingy on this.

257
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,400
Or you'll spend more
on whitening injections.

258
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,640
OK. I get it.

259
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
I don't go there every day.

260
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,040
Nor am I exposed to the sun.

261
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,280
Then why are you tanned?

262
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,040
Oh, no.

263
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,320
You must have a metabolism problem

264
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,760
because you're getting aged.

265
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,080
Metabolism?

266
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm not even 30.

267
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,480
What kind of mother talks like this?

268
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,960
You're no match for me.

269
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,000
I have great genes.

270
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
When we go out together, people say

271
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,480
we're sisters, huh?

272
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,280
Who has such poor eyesight?

273
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,440
Come on. What's your point?

274
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Nothing.

275
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
I just miss you.

276
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,160
Last week, when I gave treatments,

277
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,160
I saw a little girl and her mother

278
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,080
depending on each other to survive.

279
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,480
They reminded me of you.

280
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,320
You had time to think of me?

281
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,200
It means you're quite idle.

282
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,160
You don't even have a boyfriend, huh?

283
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,600
Why can you lead

284
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,280
every conversation to this?

285
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,680
Why didn't you ask

286
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
if I was suffering out here?

287
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
You suffered because you asked for that.

288
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,920
I didn't give you

289
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,800
such a pretty face

290
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,960
to face those lab instruments all day.

291
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,160
What are you doing?

292
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,960
Wasting your valuable time.

293
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Stop, stop.

294
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,760
You win.

295
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,520
I'm an open-minded mother.

296
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,520
I just want you to have a relationship.

297
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,200
A happy ending isn't that important.

298
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,640
What matters is the process.

299
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,960
You won't keep waiting

300
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,680
until you have a late-life love, huh?

301
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,440
I think it's you who wants a boyfriend.

302
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,800
Nonsense.

303
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,440
Lan,

304
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,400
don't ever worry about that.

305
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,160
I'm totally OK with it.

306
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,000
Don't be kidding. I'll hang up.

307
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,040
I'll really be late.

308
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,080
Boss,

309
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,400
our medical aid project will be over

310
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
in two weeks.

311
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,880
Fill the report sheets

312
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,040
as soon as you can.

313
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,040
The hospital official asked

314
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,400
whether we would apply

315
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,200
for medical aid for the following year

316
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,560
or go back to China.

317
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,320
Anything else?

318
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,320
The Medical Department
asked me to remind you.

319
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
Before you came to Lacaya,

320
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,400
your glioma project was suspended.

321
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,680
Since He Xiaoguang took it over,

322
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,040
no progress has been made.

323
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,880
If things go on like this,

324
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,040
it can't get
the research fund for next year.

325
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,960
And the Youth Talent Program.

326
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
It's held every four years.

327
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,440
If you don't return,

328
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,400
He Xiaoguang is very likely to have it.

329
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,000
So, are we or are we not going back?

330
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Boss,

331
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,280
if we go back to China,

332
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,760
what about you and Su Wei'an?

333
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Are you

334
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,400
in a relationship now?

335
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,920
If you return to China,

336
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,040
will she go with you?

337
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,880
Did Jiang Muying send you?

338
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,240
I... I just think

339
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,560
it's hard for you to keep pretending

340
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,120
your foot hasn't recovered.

341
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,920
Right?

342
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,800
Hasn't recovered?

343
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,880
Watch this, then.

344
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,160
Just kidding.

345
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,240
Your foot hasn't recovered. Do not move.

346
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,240
I'm OK.

347
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,640
Does it still hurt?

348
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,280
Yes. It hurts a lot.

349
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Wait.

350
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,920
These days,

351
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,600
you could even perform surgery.

352
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,560
Why is it still so serious?

353
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,880
I can sit during the surgery.

354
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,080
So, a foot injury doesn't interfere.

355
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
What are you laughing at?

356
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,160
Fang Mingfan,

357
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,680
don't you have an emergency treatment?

358
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,960
What emergency...?

359
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,920
Oh, yes.

360
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
I have one.

361
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,840
I'll leave Boss to you.

362
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,400
[Gu Yunzheng]

363
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,720
You can give surgery.

364
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,920
So, you don't have a big problem.

365
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,360
Rest for recuperation.

366
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,440
Wait.

367
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,920
Want to leave after taking my gown?

368
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,360
The lounge is too cold. So, I...

369
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,840
I took it casually.

370
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,440
Casually?

371
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,920
I had an injured foot because of you.

372
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,880
Are you going to leave me alone?

373
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,640
What do you want?

374
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,080

00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,840
I have no money.

562
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,000
If you want me, you can get it.

563
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,240
What did you say?

564
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,240
I can't hear you.

565
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,840
We're stopping here. Don't pretend.

566
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,960
You can't hear me?

567
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,080
Guess.

568
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,440
One more round.

569
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,440
Here we go!

570
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,800
We're in the middle of nowhere.

571
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,240
How did you get this?

572
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,680
When I was in the wild last time,

573
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,760
I was so hungry and thirsty,
and it scared me.

574
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,080
So, I've prepared more for this time.

575
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,240
Just in case.

576
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
All these things

577
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,640
are necessities for outdoor living.

578
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,880
So is this one?

579
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Don't underestimate this picnic blanket.

580
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,680
It resists moisture,
water, and abrasion.

581
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,360
It is a perfect thing

582
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,440
for home or travel.

583
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,760
Man,

584
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,160
we're in the desert.

585
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,520
Resist moisture and water?

586
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,520
Just in case.

587
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,800
What about this?

588
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,440
Don't you remember
when we were in the wild last time?

589
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,240
Our phones ran out of battery.

590
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,200
Lamps with battery work better. Look.

591
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,360
See?

592
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,720
Are you saying

593
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,600
we'll hang them on us

594
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,880
for lighting?

595
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,360
We can hang them somewhere high up.

596
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,120
Look. Like this, for example.

597
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,320
They'll look great on the tent.

598
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,640
Tent?

599
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,920
You even brought a tent?

600
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,600
Wei'an, are you thirsty?

601
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,190
I saw you drink up the water. Luckily...

602
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,760
What?

603
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,320
Where's my water?

604
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,360
Who replaced it with alcohol?

605
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Where's my water?

606
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,880
What?

607
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,600
(Wine makes cowards brave.)

608
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,840
(Two cowards,)

609
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,760
(this is all I can do for you.)

610
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,580
[Friendship Hospital]

611
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,240
Looks like

612
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,160
we only have some wine.

613
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,920
To quench our thirst.

614
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,360
Let's drink wine, then.

615
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,720
Feels so good.

616
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,000
I think

617
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,520
it's been a long time since I last

618
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,000
enjoyed such a quiet night comfortably.

619
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,400
I don't think of anything.

620
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,120
I only need to quietly enjoy

621
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,760
such a beautiful starry sky.

622
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,120
I feel the same.

623
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,600
Every day before,

624
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,560
I was as busy as a machine.

625
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,720
But I never stopped to think

626
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,600
about why I keep myself so busy.

627
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,320
Oh.

628
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,000
After we drink,
we can't drive back, huh?

629
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Don't worry.

630
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,520
When I'm around, you won't get hurt.

631
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,880
Why do I think

632
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,080
you're the biggest danger?

633
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,600
What do you think I am?

634
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,280
However much I adore you,

635
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,240
I will not take advantage of you.

636
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,920
But I will.

637
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,360
What did you say?

638
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,080
Nothing.

639
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,040
Done.

640
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,320
You cooked very well.

641
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,120
Of course.

642
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,040
Taste some.

643
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,080
Smells so good.

644
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,320
Put it on.

645
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
No, thanks. I'm not cold.

646
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,400
Wine keeps me warm.

647
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,840
Fine.

648
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,640
Taste some.

649
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,320
How about

650
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,480
we toast to the beautiful sky?

651
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,040
Mm.

652
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,360
Cheers.

653
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,320
How about we compete?

654
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,480
The winner can
ask the loser to do something.

655
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,600
Compete on what?

656
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,320
On finding the stars.

657
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,560
Who finds more will win.

658
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,040
What do you say?

659
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,600
In college, I was
a member of the Astronomical Club.

660
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,000
Are you sure you'll compete?

661
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
Are you really that awesome?

662
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,080
I once led a luxury tour in the desert.

663
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,640
The tourists taught me.
I can say them in Chinese and French.

664
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,240
Is such baseless knowledge reliable?

665
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,920
Let's compete, and we'll know.

666
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,400
What?

667
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,560
Or do you think losing to your student

668
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,920
would disgrace you?

669
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,280
Su,

670
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,280
you're so weirdly competitive.

671
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,760
Go. Let's get onto the roof of the car.

672
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,640
Orion!

673
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,240
See?

674
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,840
You know what?

675
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,000
Alpha Orionis is

676
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,560
a bright orange star
a thousand times bigger than the sun.

677
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,280
And Beta Orionis...

678
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Ursa Major! Ursa Minor!

679
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,760
Su Wei'an,

680
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,880
you really want this competition?

681
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,200
What if you lose and cry?

682
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,760
If you still don't start,

683
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,160
you're going to lose.

684
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,840
OK.

685
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,880
Since you found Ursa Major and Minor,

686
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,600
it would be easy to find...

687
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,800
Draco.

688
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:17,960
Cassiopeia!

689
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,080
Gemini. Auriga.

690
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,080
Auriga?

691
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,760
Mm.

692
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,640
You made it up, huh?

693
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,160
Why would I make it up?

694
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,840
A-U-R-I-G-A, Auriga.

695
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,120
Where is it? Show me.

696
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,120
There.

697
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,760
Can you see the brightest star?

698
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,720
It's Capella.

699
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,520
One of the major stars of Auriga.

700
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,000
It's all alone there.

701
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,200
Well, you're looking

702
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,760
at a couple of stars.

703
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,760
They're a pair of binary stars.

704
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,880
They orbit each other
around the same barycenter

705
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,800
on very close tracks.

706
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,640
So,

707
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,600
they're not alone.

708
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,440
I said four stars,

709
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,760
while you said three. I won.

710
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,360
You didn't win.

711
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,040
I'm not finished yet.

712
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,840
We made a deal.

713
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,680

It's dawn.

Did you sleep well last night?

737
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,240
Not really. I'd like to sleep some more.

738
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,040
Which part wasn't good?

739
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,840
I can do it again.

740

It's all good. You can get up now.

the hospital

745
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,680
