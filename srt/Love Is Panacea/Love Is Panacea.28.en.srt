00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,960
just a complicated experiment for me.

191
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,960
I admit that's true.

192
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,920
But I found deeper conviction

193
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,480
in every annotation

194
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
I wrote in the book,

195
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
every cell I cultivated,

196
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,600
and every fluorescence staining I made

197
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,320
because of you.

198
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,360
But it's not just because of you.

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,320
It's also because of every patient

200
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,000
suffering from Huntington's Disease.

201
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,200
Someone has to start it,

202
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,320
and someone has to pave the way.

203
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Su Wei'an.

204
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,400
Where has your faith gone?

205
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,520
Living every day with the belief
of curing Huntington's Disease

206
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
only makes me disappointed.

207
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,080
Then,

208
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,880
let me shoulder

209
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,960
all the disappointment.

210
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,560
All you need to do

211
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,880
is to believe in me.

212
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
I'm not afraid of anything.

213
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,320
I'm just afraid
that you'll suddenly give up.

214
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,120
Since I've returned to the lab,

215
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,920
I won't easily give up.

216
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,680
But this shouldn't

217
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,560
mix up our futures together.

218
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,480
I think we both need some time

219
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,400
to calmly think things through.

220
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,800
I'll stay at home tonight.

221
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,160
(Su Wei'an)

222
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
(Do you not believe
in my research ability)

223
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,080
(or my determination to do this?)

224
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,400
(Anyway,)

225
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,120
(I won't give up.)

226
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,860
[Experiment Supplies Procurement List]

227
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,720
Jiang, why are you here?

228
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,840
Look.

229
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,480
I lined up to buy this for you,

230
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,560
the internet-famous Napoleon Cake.

231
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,320
Thanks.

232
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,920
You've been working late these days.

233
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,560
I'm asleep when you get home.

234
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm awake, but you're gone.

235
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,480
I haven't seen my boyfriend
for a long time.

236
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,480
Now I'm here with you.

237
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Thanks.

238
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,320
Come back.

239
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,360
What's up?

240
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,160
Anything else?

241
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,960
Let's go to the cafeteria.

242
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,960
I'll leave after you finish eating.

243
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't.

244
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
The patients are waiting for me.

245
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,800
I have to hurry back.

246
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
I'll stay with you next time, Jiang.

247
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,920
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,400
Next time, I promise.

249
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,120
Come back.

250
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,280
Fang Mingfan!

251
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,880
I've found

252
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
that men are fickle creatures.

253
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,240
Forever

254
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,840
is just a lie.

255
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,800
What happened again?

256
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,600
Fang Mingfan hasn't been with me
for a long time,

257
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,440
leaving home early and returning late,

258
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,400
and he replies slowly to messages, too.

259
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,240
Moving into his place
has been nothing but lonely.

260
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,760
We see each other less
than roommates living together.

261
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,760
A surgeon is very busy.

262
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,200
You've been staring at that screen

263
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,960
since you arrived.

264
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,040
So?

265
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,760
Have I wasted your working time?

266
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,600
Alright.

267
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,560
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,720
I shouldn't have been on the computer

269
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,560
during our date.

270
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,840
Go ahead.

271
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,640
Wei'an.

272
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,320
You guys all have jobs.

273
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,040
Only I am unemployed.

274
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,160
You have no idea

275
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,400
how many people envy your life.

276
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,960
Enjoy a carefree life

277
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,640
without the pressure of making a living.

278
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,640
But for Fang Mingfan,

279
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,920
I bet

280
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,200
he definitely didn't mean to ignore you.

281
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,760
It's just that sometimes

282
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,200
he's really busy with work.

283
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,160
He's overwhelmed.

284
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,960
Don't you have a date with Dr. Gu today?

285
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,520
No need to work overtime in the lab?

286
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,240
What's wrong?

287
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Did you have a fight with him?

288
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,320
Did he make you angry?

289
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Wei'an.

290
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,720
Let's have fun this weekend.

291
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,920
Two days and one night.

292
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,720
I know of a nice inn.

293
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
But I have to read a few papers
this weekend.

294
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,880
Come on, it's the weekend.

295
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,400
Don't waste it to read papers.

296
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,320
And it's been a long time

297
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,080
since we went out together.

298
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,720
Please.

299
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,920
Okay.

300
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,680
Good.

301
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,920
Look at that mountain.

302
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,920
It's so beautiful.

303
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,070
Hey, puppy.

304
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,880
Let's go.

305
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,200
Bye.

306
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,720
Hello.

307
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,600
I've booked a mountain-view room
with a king-size bed.

308
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,320
You see.

309
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,440
Alright, little lady.

310
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,280
Wait a moment.

311
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,160
Hi.

312
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,120
What a small world.

313
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
What are you doing here?

314
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,040
Jiang.

315
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,640
I'm sorry

316
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,320
for ignoring you recently.

317
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,480
I'll be with you wholeheartedly
this weekend.

318
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,040
Don't be mad at me.

319
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,040
Thank you.

320
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,760
I'll leave her to you.

321
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,680
Take good care of her.

322
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,840
Yes, ma'am.

323
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,720
What are you doing here?

324
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
If I said it was a chance encounter,

325
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
would you believe me?

326
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,760
No.

327
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,160
I haven't seen you after work.

328
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,360
You didn't reply to my messages either,

329
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,960
so I followed you here.

330
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,680
Let me help you.

331
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,160
No need.

332
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,360
Su Wei'an.

333
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,920
You

334
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,600
look really beautiful today.

335
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,280
Go back to your room.

336
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,320
Jiang.

337
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,440
I've got a lot of surprises for you.

338
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,240
Why don't you come with me?

339
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,400
What surprises?

340
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
You'll find out when we get there.

341
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,000
Fang Mingfan.

342
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,880
This isn't your plan, is it?

343
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,880
I was trying to set you two up.

344
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,160
But you betrayed me pretty quickly.

345
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,640
Let me clarify.

346
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,400
I didn't conspire with Fang Mingfan.

347
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,600
He prepared the surprises
for Jiang Muying.

348
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,000
It has nothing to do with me.

349
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,440
That's right, Wei'an.

350
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,400
Why don't you join us?

351
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,200
I don't mind if you're the third wheel.

352
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,840
I do.

353
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,640
Fang Mingfan.

354
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,640
If you disappoint me this time,

355
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,800
you're done.

356
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,160
I won't.

357
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,720
Let's go.

358
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,200
Let's go and have a look.

359
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,560
Drink some water.

360
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Fang Mingfan.

361
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,120
Where are you taking me?

362
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,720
I read online

363
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,240
it's where we can see
the most beautiful sunset.

364
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,320
We'll just go there and wait.

365
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,240
Sitting there and waiting
for the sunset is enough.

366
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,880
How far is it?

367
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,240
We're almost there.

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,240
Come on, Jiang.

369
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,400
Jiang.

370
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Let's go there.

371
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Come on.

372
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Hurry up.

373
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
When will we get there?

374
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,160
We'll be there soon.

375
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
It must be here, right?

376
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
I can't walk anymore.

377
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,560
Jiang.

378
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Fang Mingfan.

379
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
There are so many trees
blocking the view.

380
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,200
How can we see the sunset?

381
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,080
Am I mistaken?

382
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,240
Jiang.

383
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,800
Do you have the strength
to walk a little more?

384
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,200
You...

385
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,480
Come on.

386
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,720
We're almost there.

387
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,680
Come on.

388
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,040
Fang Mingfan.

389
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,720
Slow down.

390
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,800
Slow down, Jiang.

391
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
We're finally here.

392
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
What's wrong with you?

393
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,640
Didn't we come to see the sunset?

394
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
Why did you bring me here?

395
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,200
Jiang.

396
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,040
Have you watched the movie
"My Sassy Girl"?

397
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,440
Let's bury a time capsule here, too.

398
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,200
We can dig it up when we get old.

399
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
It will definitely make us happy.

400
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,040
Dig deeper.

401
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,840
It's so big.

402
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,840
Okay.

403
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,920
Fang Mingfan.

404
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,800
What's this? Hurry up!

405
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Catch it!

406
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,080
Fang Mingfan.

407
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,720
You threw it at me.

408
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,800
It's okay.

409
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,000
Where is it?

410
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,200
It's gone.

411
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,000
It's just an earthworm.

412
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,680
You threw it at me, Fang Mingfan.

413
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,760
No, Jiang.

414
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,880
I threw it this way.

415
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,880
I didn't know you were going this way.

416
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,000
It wasn't intentional.

417
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,360
Dig it yourself.

418
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,720
Jiang.

419
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,040
Wei'an.

420
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,440
Where are you going?

421
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,600
Back to the inn.

422
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,400
Where's Fang Mingfan?

423
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,040
Where's Dr. Gu?

424
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,200
Why aren't you together?

425
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,600
I don't know what to say.

426
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,120
Wei'an.

427
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,320
Why can't you try to understand him?

428
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,960
How should I understand him?

429
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,560
You know Huntington's Disease

430
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,200
is a lifelong research challenge.

431
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,800
His life will be ruined because of me.

432
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,280
Why do you shoulder

433
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,760
all the responsibility on yourself?

434
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,960
Even if his life is ruined,

435
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,120
it's his own choice.

436
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,160
If it wasn't for me,

437
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,440
he wouldn't have researched
Huntington's Disease.

438
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,160
I can't be so selfish.

439
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,880
I can't let him ruin his life

440
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,600
and career because of me.

441
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,160
The way you are pushing him away now

442
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,440
is truly selfish.

443
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,160
Aren't you just afraid of being blamed?

444
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,640
Have you ever thought about

445
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
how difficult it is for Dr. Gu
to choose this path?

446
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,800
You're just going against him

447
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,040
like everyone else.

448
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,880
Hasn't he heard enough of that?

449
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,120
Jiang.

450
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,360
I finally found you.

451
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,560
Jiang.

452
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,360
There's another good place
I haven't taken you yet.

453
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,800
There definitely
won't be any earthworms.

454
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,080
Wei'an.

455
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,560
Could you give me a chance to explain?

456
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
Where are you taking me?

457
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,920
Come on, hurry up.

458
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,080
Wei'an.

459
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,480
I also want to take you somewhere.

460
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,200
Jiang.

461
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,240
I heard this bridge is magical.

462
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,240
As long as they write the names

463
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,880
of the couple on it and hang it up,

464
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,160
their love will last forever,
and they'll grow old together.

465
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,280
Who wants to grow old with you?

466
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,800
It's okay to hang it up for peace.

467
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,240
I'll put our card

468
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
right in the middle.

469
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
Anyone who passes by will see it,

470
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,560
and they'll give us their blessing.

471
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,480
Be careful.

472
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,280
Are you done?

473
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,440
Done.

474
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,440
Come down!

475
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Come down!

476
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,440
I love Jiang Muying.

477
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,960
Our love is the best in the world.

478
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,360
Who is it?

479
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,480
This is mine!

480
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,920
Who knocked it down?

481
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,360
It was you two, right?

482
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,760
You only care about your love?

483
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,040
I'm 40 years old and still not married.

484
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,200
Don't I deserve love?

485
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,920
Wait.

486
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,760
Run.

487
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,400
Run.

488
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,640
Stop.

489
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,760
Stop right there!

490
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,620
[Jiang Muying & Fang Mingfan:
Our love is the best in the world.]

491
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,760
Does he chase after us?

492
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,920
No.

493
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,520
Look at what you've done.

494
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,520
I'm exhausted.

495
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,760
I'm sorry, Jiang.

496
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,960
I actually planned a lot of surprises.

497
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,880
But I messed them all up.

498
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
You get wronged at home

499
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,920
and even when we travel.

500
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,120
I'm not a good boyfriend.

501
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,160
I'm useless.

502
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,320
Well, at least our love

503
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,360
is the best in the world now.

504
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,280
So, you've forgiven me?

505
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,800
I've got your heart.

506
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,600
That's great, Jiang.

507
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,560
You're so sweet.

508
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,680
Sure.

509
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,360
Wei'an.

510
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,200
Do you know the origin of Dujiangyan?

511
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,640
Over 2,000 years ago,

512
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,000
the Shu Plain

513
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,800
was suffering from drought in the east
and flood in the west

514
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,440
due to its narrow river channels.

515
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,400
But Li Bing and his son

516
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,600
created a miracle

517
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,000
and built
the Dujiangyan Irrigation System.

518
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,320
Did you bring me here

519
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,240
to tell me about this part
of history learned in middle school?

520
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,360
We all used to think that

521
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,920
"Yu Gong Moves Mountains" is a myth.

522
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,880
However,

523
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Li Bing and his son

524
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,920
used fire to burn the rocks,

525
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,000
then cooled them with water.

526
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,600
They used the principle
of thermal expansion and contraction

527
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,200
to bore through the mountains

528
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,440
and create the Baopingkou.

529
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,960
I know you're trying
to tell me something

530
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,160
about how people can overcome nature.

531
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,400
But how many Dujiangyans are there
in the history?

532
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,840
And how many Li Bings are there?

533
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,880
There are not so many miracles
in the world.

534
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,800
Even if no miracle happens,

535
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
I might fail

536
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,960
to develop an effective medicine

537
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,400
and be just an associate professor
in my lifetime.

538
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,560
You might leave me,

539
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,800
and I might grow old alone.

540
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,080
The worst scenario

541
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,240
could just be this.

542
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
Gu Yunzheng.

543
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,640
It's enough for me

544
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,640
to walk the tough road alone.

545
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,320
You don't have
to get involved in this mess.

546
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Since someone has to wade through it,

547
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,680
why can't I join?

548
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,440
As a doctor,

549
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,480
I know better than anyone

550
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,520
what it's really like to be
in this world.

551
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,760
All we can do

552
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,600
is to keep our own pace.

553
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,560
Every step we take

554
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,200
brings us closer to victory.

555
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,520
In the history of mankind,

556
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,120
those 2,000 years

557
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,120
are just a moment.

558
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,840
Joy

559
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,400
or sadness,

560
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,360
it all passes in the blink of an eye.

561
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,320
Wei'an.

562
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,600
Let's stop wasting our time

563
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,280
on neglecting each other,

564
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,400
okay?

565
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,040
Even though

566
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,600
it's kind of fun

567
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,400
watching you lose your temper.

568
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,360
What does this have to do
with Dujiangyan?

569
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,560
Split the water in sixty-forty,
the sand in twenty-eighty.

570
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,600
Even if your emotions erupt
like a flash flood,

571
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,440
they can be resolved

572
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,120
when they come to me,

573
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,720
turning danger into safety.

574
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,200
Who taught you that?

575
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,680
These corny pick-up lines
are too cheesy.

576
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,640
Corny? I think it's fine.

577
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,800
Don't be mad, okay?

578
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,680
Jiang, it must be here.

579
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,280
It's so beautiful.

580
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,200
Not as beautiful as you.

581
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,660
♪Your Secret♪

582
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,340

♪For us to dream again♪

590
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,800
Look, there are persimmons here.

591
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,960
Fake ones.

592
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,400
Real ones.

593
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,720
You bit my finger.

594
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,040
We've made up.

595
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,360
So do we.

596
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,000
Well, then, come and eat with us.

597
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,520
Sit down.

598
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,230
Don't worry.

599
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,800
I've arranged everything
for the hospital.

600
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,960
No more, I'm full.

601
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,320
I'm sleepy. I'm going back to bed.

602
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,670
Jiang.

603
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,190
How?

604
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
I'll sleep in the same room with Wei An,
of course.

605
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,040
Won't it spoil the mood?

606
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,560
Go away.

607
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,400
Wei'an.

608
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,640
Go back and get some rest early.

609
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,240
Come with me to meet someone tomorrow.

610
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,440
Meet whom?

611
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,160
You'll know when the time comes.

612
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,360
Okay, get some rest.

613
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
Bye.

614
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,440
Get some rest.

615
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,000
After I came back to China,

616
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,040
I called your home a few times.

617
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,040
A woman answered

618
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
and said I had the wrong number.

619
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,840
Now that I've finally found you,

620
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,040
I have to hand over these things to you.

621
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,160
These are all things your mother

622
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,000
saved when she was working at Lacaya.

623
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,120
I've always kept them.

624
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,200
I've always felt

625
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,120
it's what your mother left behind
when she was alive.

626
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,040
We shouldn't just throw them away.

627
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,200
So when I came back to China,

628
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,920
I brought them with me.

629
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,280
And now,

630
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,400
I'm giving them to you.

631
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,960
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

632
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,880
These things

633
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
are very important to me.

634
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,480
Uncle Wang,

635
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,760
this picture is...

636
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,520
This picture was found in her pocket

637
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,480
the day Engineer Gu had an accident.

638
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,980
[We are the real family.]

639
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,980
[We are the real family.]

640
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,560
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

641
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,480
No news of Yuncheng yet?

642
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,600
Du Yuncheng

643
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,920
didn't want to apologize
or make up for his mistakes

644
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,920
but just vanished,

645
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,000
leaving Jiehui with a mess.

646
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,480
With his kind of responsibility,

647
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,720
he still wants
to inherit the family business.

648
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,360
Why don't you say

649
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,880
how you and Dad

650
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,400
treated him all these years?

651
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,440
He has been hurt by you.

652
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,200
Ever since he was a child,

653
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,320
I've never neglected him in any way.

654
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,560
He's always comparing his living standard
with Yunzheng.

655
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,760
Why doesn't he compare achievements

656
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
to see who has achieved more
in academics

657
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,160
and who has brought honor
to the family?

658
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,440
Being belittled for over 30 years.

659
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,560
Yuncheng has never complained.

660
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,000
He doesn't demand fairness,

661
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,760
but you shouldn't treat them
so differently.

662
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,560
If it wasn't for being driven
to desperation this time,

663
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,360
Yuncheng wouldn't have
said those things.

664
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,000
Even if you don't care for him,

665
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,840
You shouldn't push him down a dead end.

666
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,680
What have I wrongly accused him of?

667
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,000
I don't criticize him
for not being a skilled doctor.

668
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,480
But it's his basic human traits

669
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,240
that are problematic now.

670
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,560
Yuncheng has already said

671
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,200
that is a legitimate business strategy.

672
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,920
You think it's a problem
with his character.

673
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,440
Business strategy?

674
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,640
I've seen it all.

675
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,400
With a mother like you who can't
distinguish between right and wrong,

676
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,320
he could only have been brought up
with moral corruption.

677
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,960
How am I wrong in distinguishing
between right and wrong?

678
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,480
I think you don't want Yuncheng
as your son anymore.

679
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,880
Fine.

680
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,120
Then I'll leave too.

681
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,480
No matter
how outstanding Gu Yunzheng is,

682
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,160
his surname is Gu, not Du.

683
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,040
He's a member of the Du family,

684
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,600
but he's dating a girl with chorea.

685
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,560
He can't leave any lineage
for the Du family.

686
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,920
What did you say?

687
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,680
Who is he dating?

688
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,480
Looks like you're so absorbed
in your hospital duties.

689
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,920
Go ask around yourself.

690
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,680
Tell me the truth!

691
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,440
You're out of your mind.

692
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,400
She has chorea.

693
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,840
And because of her,

694
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,720
you're changing your research topic?

695
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,880
Is this how you regard your career?

696
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,120
I'm not out of my mind.

697
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,160
I didn't do it
on the spur of the moment.

698
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,480
I have a detailed plan for my project.

699
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,120
I deliberate on every step I take.

700
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,840
Studying a disease

701
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,560
is not just for a single person

702
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
but for a group of patients

703
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,160
who have the disease
and carry the gene that causes it.

704
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,200
Don't use such kind of rhetoric

705
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,320
to fob me off.

706
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,000
The whole hospital knows

707
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,160
about how you got Su Wei'an

708
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,800
into the research lab.

709
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,840
Everyone is gossiping.

710
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,240
I let you off the hook.

711
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,080
But now you're going
to gamble the rest of your life

712
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,680
on such a woman.

713
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,200
I shall never agree.

714
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,760
Now,

715
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,760
you're taking an interest in my life.

716
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,360
I'm really surprised.

717
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,280
Huntington's Disease is a rare disease.

718
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,840
There are only a few target patients.

719
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,360
Where will you apply for funds
in the future?

720
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,360
The darker places

721
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,000
need people to explore.

722
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,600
Do the lives of patients
with rare diseases

723
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,240
not have value?

724
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,800
Don't they deserve to be seen?

725
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,800
Dozens of excellent teams
from around the world

726
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,960
have failed.

727
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,120
How are you so confident you'll succeed?

728
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,720
I don't think I can make a breakthrough,

729
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,440
and even in a lifetime,

730
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,160
maybe I won't achieve anything.

731
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,920
But I can't let that stop me

732
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,480
from trying.

733
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,600
I think, for Huntington's Disease,

734
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,360
even if I have to take many wrong turns
and detours,

735
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,760
it's worth it.

736
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,440
You're ridiculous.

737
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,680
What you're saying?

738
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,000
Yunzheng.

739
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,480
Can love pay the bills?

740
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,160
You're hot-headed because of emotions.

741
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,880
You're destroying your future,
can't you see?

742
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,240
In your eyes,

743
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,040
of course, there's no lasting love.

744
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,080
But I'm

745
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,320
different from you.

746
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,800
I tell you.

747
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,080
I won't allow you
