18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,660
Tonight, even if I work all night,

19
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,700
I'll have to complete

20
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,940
translating all the materials

21
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,820
and make a clean break with you.

22
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,060
Yuncheng? What are you doing here?

23
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,620
You're working overtime.

24
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,020
I guess you must be hungry.

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,060
I brought you some food.

26
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,700
Thank you, Yuncheng.

27
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,020
Oh, fried chicken.

28
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,580
Do you have to finish

29
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,860
all these documents tonight?

30
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,900
Yeah.

31
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,340
The earlier I finish,
the sooner I get rid of Gu.

32
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,260
Tonight, I must finish all this.

33
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,780
Let me help you.

34
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,580
No need.

35
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,100
I can't bother you
with such a small part-time job.

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,340
Oh, I see.

37
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,500
You think I can't help you

38
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,020
because I can't speak French, huh?

39
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,260
Is it so easy to read my mind?

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,780
I don't speak French,

41
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,860
but I can help you revise the sheets,

42
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,100
staple papers, or something.

43
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,940
We'll be faster than you do it alone.

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,020
Do you remember

45
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,700
when we did the experiment all night?

46
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,820
Speaking of which,
I quite miss the old days.

47
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,700
Rather than saying you bother me,

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,820
I would rather say

49
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,780
you'll take me back to college days

50
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,020
and make me feel young again.

51
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,140
OK. Thank you, then.

52
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,620
Don't stand on ceremony.

53
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,580
Come on. Let's see

54
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,540
if we can still work together

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,340
as perfectly as we did before.

56
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,140
This is what you asked me
to translate yesterday.

57
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,660
I've translated it all. Please review.

58
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,900
So soon?

59
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,300
Are you sure you didn't do a poor job?

60
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,740
Review as you wish.

61
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,140
How's this possible?

62
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,380
This isn't a task
you can finish in only one night.

63
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,180
Last night, Yuncheng stayed up with me

64
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,660
and helped me finish it.

65
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,580
Du Yuncheng?

66
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,380
You did the job with him?

67
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,940
So, you two

68
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,700
stayed in the lab all night?

69
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
Yeah. Any problem?

70
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,140
Su Wei'an, I got you back to the lab

71
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,860
because I wanted you to work

72
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,180
instead of dating in it.

73
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,700
Who allowed you

74
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,020
to take an outsider into my lab?

75
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,780
Who was dating in the lab?

76
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,140
Don't talk nonsense, OK?

77
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,420
I said

78
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,700
without my permission,

79
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,820
no one is allowed into my lab.

80
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,620
You chose not to listen, didn't you?

81
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,260
Come on, man.

82
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,540
Talk rationally, will you?

83
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,260
I did translations for you,
but you cursed me.

84
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,820
If Du Yuncheng was an outsider,

85
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,900
I would also be one.

86
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,580
If you're upset, scold someone else.

87
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
Someone who upsets you.

88
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,820
Why lose your temper with me?

89
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,860
I'm not losing my temper with you.

90
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,100
I don't care, though.

91
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,340
Anyway, my translation work is done.

92
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,500
Please review it now

93
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,020
and give me the final payment.

94
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,300
From this day on,

95
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,860
I don't need to work here.

96
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,100
Nor do I need

97
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,020
to be squeezed by you anymore.

98
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,020
No work in the lab tonight?

99
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,580
Yesterday, I worked all night there.

100
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,580
Want me to die from overwork?

101
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,140
Just asking.

102
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,860
What? Are you angry?

103
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,700
Having your period?

104
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,100
I think Gu Yunzheng is having a period.

[Gu Yunzheng: ￥80000.00, final payment]

108
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,620
I think he can have his period

109

more often.

110
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,340
Miss Su.

111
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,780
An?

112
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,100
What a surprise!

113
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,340
You... You two...

114
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,020
This is my boyfriend.

115
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,620
My only boyfriend.

116
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,140
He is your only boyfriend.

117
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,420
What about Gu Yunzheng?

118
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,180
Dr. Gu...

119
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,620
He isn't even an ex-boyfriend.

120
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,620
He's just a man I failed to get.

121
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,140
So, Dr. Gu turned you down?

122
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,020
Yeah. He really did.

123
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,540
He's kind of the first failure

124
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,140
I've ever met in my life.

125
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,820
Sweetheart, you're gorgeous.

126
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,080
We should go, then.

127
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,100
What's all this about?

128
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,380
So, Gu Yunzheng

129
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,380
didn't have anyone else.

130
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,780
He's been caring about you.

131
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,340
Then, has he been acting?

132
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,740
But why would he?

133
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,100
A medical diet restaurant
was opened near the hospital.

134
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,020
I just took my girlfriend there,

135
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,380
and I brought back some.

136
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,530
Would you like to try some soup?

137
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,180
Are you sure this is leftover food?

(I want to give it to my girlfriend.)

142
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,620
(Dr. Gu, I'm your translator)

143
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,860
(rather than a lab rat.)

144
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,380
(I'll pay you more.)

[The translations

146
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,180
He deliberately gave me more money

147
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,580
in case I didn't take it.

148
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,780
Oh, my tummy hurts.

149
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,780
Jiang...

150
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,940
Jiang Muying.

151
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,620
You're familiar with this surgery, huh?

152
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,900
You're done with the surgery, Boss.

153
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,140
Why did you choose this approach?

154
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,380
Any problem?

155
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,100
I still have time to change it.

156
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,820
I'm asking

157
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,660
why you choose an approach

158
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,380
that is seldom used

159
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,020
instead of the most reliable
pterional approach.

160
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,140
That girl is only 17 years old.

161
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,540
She told me she loved
singing and dancing.

162
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,300
And she wants
to major in performing arts.

163
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,260
Her tumor isn't very big.

164
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,500
To protect her hearing
and facial nerves,

165
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,580
I chose the approach
with the smallest cut.

166
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,100
The smallest cut

167
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,860
leads to the smallest surgical field.

168
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,580
You need complicated operations.

169
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,860
In this case, I'll keep peeling it

170
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,620
until it's all gone.

171
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,100
Aren't you scared?

172
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,100
I am.

173
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,620
But Su Wei'an reminded me.

174
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,380
She said

175
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,660
when a doctor gives the surgery,

176
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,620
he must attentively focus.

177
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,380
As he holds the scalpels,

178
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,900
he must give the best treatment.

179
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,940
Su Wei'an said that?

180
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,860
Mm.

181
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,620
That day, Dr. Li also told me

182
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,620
to pick the most secure approach

183
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,620
to break my mental barriers.

184
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,900
But I agree with Su Wei'an, actually.

185
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,340
She's awesome.

186
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,700
If she hadn't dropped out,

Mrs. Su.

373
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,220
Oh, Du. Here for Wei'an, huh?

374
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,140
No. I'm here for you.

375
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,100
Me?

376
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,780
Come in, then.

377
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,260
OK.

378
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,500
Come on. Get in here, Du.

379
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,340
OK.

380
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,980
Come on.

381
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,300
Sit here.

382
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,260
Mrs. Su, my...

383
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,500
My shoes.

384
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,900
Don't bother to change them.

385
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,100
I didn't mop the floor anyway.

386
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,340
Hurry. Get in there.

387
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,860
Sit there.

388
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,900
You're just in time.

389
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,620
Lately, I think

390
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,860
Wei'an has been exhausted.

391
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,340
I made her some sparerib soup.

392
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
Taste some.

393
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,820
Don't bother, Mrs. Su.

394
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,540
I'm not here for Wei'an.

395
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,820
I'm here for you especially.

396
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,220
I want to talk to you

397
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,340
about Wei'an's aunt.

398
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,900
She's asleep.

399
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,420
Come on. Move in.

400
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,500
Sit here.

401
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,980
Her aunt is asleep.

402
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,620
What would you say about her?

403
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,340
Here's the thing.

404
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,500
I've reported her case

405
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,820
to the R&D team of Zhang He Hospital.

406
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,180
We're not sure yet if her aneurysm

407
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,820
has something to do with the drug trial.

408
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,900
But she really had it

409
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,740
during the drug trial.

410
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,500
I feel kind of guilty.

411
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,700
Don't.

412
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,130
Du,

413
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,740
I believe your team started this drug

414
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,260
to cure patients.

415
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,420
Now, Yuan has an aneurysm.

416
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,500
That is

417
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,740
what none of us wants to see.

418
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,340
Don't blame yourself.

419
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,420
Mrs. Su,

420
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,980
I want to give you
corresponding financial compensation

421
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,900
on behalf of Jiehui.

422
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,420
The hospital expenses
and future nursing expenses

423
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,980
will be covered by us.

424
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,300
Oh, no.

425
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,610
Du, you're Wei'an's senior.

426
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,500
Since her aunt fell sick,

427
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,540
you've been helping us too much.

428
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,500
I'm serious.

429
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,130
We can't trouble you anymore.

430
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,260
Recently,

431
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,300
how's Ms. Su been recovering?

432
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,260
Since the drugs' withdrawal,

433
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,260
how has she been feeling?

434
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,020
Not very good, honestly.

435
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,620
Since the drugs' withdrawal,

436
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,700
I wonder if there is
a psychological problem,

437
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,060
but she's been
having worse body responses.

438
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,060
Correspondingly,

439
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,940
she's been feeling worse.

440
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,860
Sometimes, she loses her temper
and breaks things.

441
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,340
Mrs. Su,

442
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,620
you've been having hard days.

443
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,020
How about this?

444
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,020
I can arrange for Ms. Su
to go to a sanatorium.

445
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,180
In this way,

446
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,180
you won't be too exhausted.

447
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,620
You can get rid of some burdens, too.

448
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,900
No need. I've retired.

449
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,740
I don't have things to do at home.

450
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,740
I can take care of her.

451
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,620
Mrs. Su,

452
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,380
the sanatorium can give her
more professional treatments

453
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,820
in rehabilitation

454
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,380
and psychological counseling.

455
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,260
And it does good

456
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,540
to stave off

457
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,820
the disease progress of chorea.

458
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,820
Oh, I see.

459
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,180
The... The sanatorium...

460
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
Does it charge a lot?

461
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,820
This sanatorium and Jiehui

462
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,740
have an annual agreement.

463
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,740
Anyone arranged by us

464
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,820
doesn't need an extra charge.

465
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,540
We have quotas, anyway.

466
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,100
Don't worry about it.

467
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,380
That'd be great.

468
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,100
But, well,

469
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,180
I still need to discuss it with Wei'an.

470
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,900
Mrs. Su,

471
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,900
considering Wei'an's temper,

472
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,380
if you tell her about this,

473
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,380
she will not owe me this favor.

474
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,820
Besides,

475
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,460
to Ms. Su,

476
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,020
the sanatorium is the best option.

477
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,780
How about this, Mrs. Su?

478
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,740
In a couple of days,

479
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,460
you take Ms. Su to the sanatorium.

480
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,620
If she is satisfied,

481
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,900
you can then make a decision.

482
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,740
Right.

483
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,180
It's best that Yuan is satisfied.

484
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,900
And of course,

485
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,620
don't tell Wei'an that I recommended it.

486
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
I get it.

00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,260
Something seems to bother you.

747
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,740
There's a pestis patient
in the inpatient building.

748
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,260
Boss is trapped there.

749
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,180
I'm worried about him.

750
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,420
Hello, Jiang.

751
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,260
Hey, Wei'an.

752
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,380
Bad news.

753
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,900
Dr. Gu may be in danger.

754
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,500
What do you mean?

755
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,860
Let me talk to her.

756
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,780
Hey, Wei'an.

757
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,420
This morning, Boss went
to Respiratory Dept. for a consultation.

758
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,140
In a patient's sputum,

759
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,020
Yersinia pestis was detected.

760
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,220
The inpatient building

761
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,540
has been blockaded.

762
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,900
No one can get out.

763
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,020
Pneumonic pestis?

764
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,660
That's a Class A infectious disease.

765
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,660
Whoever is infected may die.

766
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,020
Throughout the building,

767
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,260
an epidemiological survey
and analysis is in progress.

768
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,980
It can be brought under control soon.

769
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,180
OK. So much for this.

770
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:31,900
I'll make a call.

771
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,180
Oh, Wei'an.

772
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,260
Don't bother to call.

773
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,140
Boss didn't take his phone
to the consultation.

774
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,500
His phone is with me now.

775
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,300
Let me get in.

776
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,350
- Can I get in?
- Excuse me.

777
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,100
Your shoes...

778
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,740
They're scattered.

779
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,020
Wei'an, are you home?

780
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,580
Mom.

781
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,300
What are you doing?

782
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,460
I... I'm going on a business trip.

783
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,260
Where are you going?

784
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,020
You didn't tell me that.

785
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,700
To Gui City.

786
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,940
It was scheduled a long time ago.

787
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,940
I just forgot to tell you.

788
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:37,820
Well,

789
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,100
let me make you some noodles.

790
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,340
Eat before you leave.

791
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,340
It's too late.

792
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,700
I have a plane to catch.

793
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,700
In such a hurry?

794
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,780
Be careful.

795
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,420
Mom.

796
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,540
Avoid crowded areas for now,

797
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,820
and pause your square dancing too.

798
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,220
Wash your hands as soon as you get home.

799
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,340
Always wear a mask when you go out.

800
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,020
Call me if anything happens.

801
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:57,820
OK.
