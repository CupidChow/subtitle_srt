I fully understand your feelings.

58
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,460
But clinical trials need

59

to follow strict specifications
and requirements.

188
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,260
If she came back,

189
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,420
she would definitely inform us.

190
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,700
I might have mistaken the person.

191
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,540
Right.

192
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,620
Yuncheng,

193
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,100
since I've dedicated myself

194
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,300
to preparing
this celebration party for you,

195
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,660
do me a favor

196
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,860
even if you don't like it.

197
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,020
Ran,

198
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,860
I don't want a celebration party now.

199
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,220
I'd better focus on my work.

200
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,380
Well,

201
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,660
let's sit and talk for a while,

202
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,780
and then we'll call it a day.

203
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220
Is that okay?

204
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,940
(Hasn't Yuncheng recovered
from the infatuation with her?)

205
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,860
My housekeeper, turn on the lights.

206
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,100
How come she's back?

207
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,100
[Wei'an: Last login is at Jinhai City.]

208
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,660
(Her last login is at Jinhai City.)

209
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,780
I didn't mistake her.

210
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,940
That was really Wei'an.

211
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,580
[Happy Today]

212
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,980
How did you find time
to have a video chat with me?

213
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,380
Don't you hang out
with Fang Mingfan on your day off?

214
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,100
Why should I hang out with him?

215
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,100
I don't know him well yet.

216
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,380
Do you have a fight again?

217
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,660
Could he have found another girl
to shift his love to?

218
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,980
Even if he wanted to,

219
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,220
he wouldn't have time.

220
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,020
He's been terribly busy

221
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,820
with surgeries recently.

222
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,780
And what about...

223
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,220
him...

224
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,820
Dr. Gu once mistook someone for you

225
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,300
and wanted after the person.

226
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,020
Jiang, are you there?

227
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,740
No, I'm not.

228
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,500
All right.

229
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,820
You can go out and meet him.

230
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,020
I'm going to bed.

231
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,940
Good night.

232
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,700
Jiang.

233
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,060
Jiang.

234
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,180
Jiang,

235
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,220
I'm about to return to China with Boss.

236
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,620
What are your plans?

237
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,580
I should have gone home earlier.

238
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,940
I've been on this job for too long.

239
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,500
But what about Flattie?

240
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,580
Who will feed you after I leave?

241
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,500
Flattie...

242
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,140
I'll take care of it.

243
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,500
We both live in Jinhai City.

244
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,340
You can come to my place

245
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,340
and visit Flattie whenever you want.

246
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,180
Will we meet again when we return home?

247
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:32,940
What's wrong with that?

248
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,300
Are you planning

249
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,660
to be irresponsible

250
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,780
and kick me away?

251
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,020
What are you talking about?

252
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,260
Watch your mouth.

253
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Besides,

254
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,980
we weren't that close.

255
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,620
We're just ordinary friends.

256
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,540
What ordinary friends?

257
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,140
Weren't we close?

258
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,500
Have you seen ordinary friends
who have kissed each other?

259
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,780
Why are you bringing that up?

260
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,780
Stop mentioning it.

261
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,020
I can take care of Flattie anyway.

262
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,700
Come here, Flattie.

263
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,820
I can bring Flattie back to China

264
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,980
and keep it at my house.

265
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,500
But there is a condition.

266
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,340
What condition?

267
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,500
You need to be
the other guardian of Flattie.

268
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,540
Do you want me to be a poop-scooper?

269
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,820
What poop-scooper?

270
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,420
I meant my girlfriend.

271
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,820
Jiang,

272
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,740
would you like to be my girlfriend?

273
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,420
Where are you going?

274
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,460
Please answer me.

275
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,340
Yes.

281
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,140
(Is that the Nero Bridge?)

282
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,660
(I heard there is a Light Festival
held on it every year.)

283
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,300
(Though I've been here for so long.)

295

Yunzheng,

296
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,660
your dad said

297
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,940
you didn't apply for an extension.

298
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,060
Why?

299
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,900
Did you have an argument
with your girlfriend?

300
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,900
She's gone.

301
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,060
She's not in Lacaya anymore.

302
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,860
Why?

303
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,620
Grandpa,

304
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,140
am I an unlucky guy?

305
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,300
In any close relationship,

306
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,100
I'm always the one

307
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,820

308
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,380
No, you're not.

309
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,540
Grandpa will never abandon you.

310
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
Listen,

311
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,740
come back if you're unhappy in Lacaya.

312
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,500
I'll always be waiting for you at home.

313
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,420
Okay.

314
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,900

315
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,940
I'm going to hand up now.

Hello, miss. Who are you here to meet?

331
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,060
Excuse me,

332
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,420
are you in charge of the HDQ39 project?

Yes, our CEO

334
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,060
is personally overseeing this project.

335
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,260
Why do you ask about the project?

336
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,860
I want to meet your CEO,

337
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,180
could you arrange a meeting for me?

338
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,620

for something extremely urgent.

I'm sorry, miss.

You're not permitted to enter.

You can't enter without an appointment.

354
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,340
Wei'an, when did you come back?

355
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,860
I saw someone at the bar the other day.

356
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,700
I thought it might be you,

357
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,980
but I wasn't sure then.

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,980
It's me.

359
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,140
I am the drummer
for a night band at the bar.

360
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,660
You just left all of a sudden before.

361
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,420
Why did you suddenly decide
to come back?

362
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,380
It's a long story.

363
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,020
Why did you give up your career
as a doctor?

364
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,460
As a doctor,

365
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,020
I can only make limited contributions
to medical science.

366
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,020
Compared to surgeries,

367
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,660
the development of a new drug

368
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,580
can benefit more patients.

369
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,660
And Jiehui is different
from other pharmaceutical companies,

370
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,340
as we prioritize social benefits.

371
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,780
For example, in developing HDQ39,

372
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
an "orphan drug,"

373
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,060
we bear immense pressure.

374
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,020
But I believe it is meaningful.

375
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
Yuncheng,

376
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,900
I need you to do me a favor.

377
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,820
I...

378
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,340
A distant relative of mine

379
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,580
was recently diagnosed
with Huntington's Disease.

380
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,260
I want to enroll her

381
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,740
in the HDQ39 drug trial.

382
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,020
But when I tried to register her
at the hospital,

383
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,140
they already had enough participants
for the Phase III trial.

384
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,020
And we can only be on the waiting list.

385
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,620
No problem.

386
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,340
Let me know if you need any help.

387
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,100
I will do everything I can
to assist you.

388
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,340
Wei'an?

389
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,180
It's you!

390
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,660
When did you return?

391
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,660
You mentioned Huntington's Disease
just now.

392
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,820
Who is suffering from that illness?

393
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,980
It's a distant relative of mine.

394
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,420
She was recently diagnosed with it.

395
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,580
I am here

396
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,500
to seek eligibility for the drug trial.

397
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,020
You should have asked me for help.

398
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,220
My dad is in charge
of the HDQ39 project.

399
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,340
What does this have to do with Yuncheng?

400
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,780
I left you a message,
but you didn't reply.

401
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,740
Really?

402
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,020
I have my message notifications
turned off.

403
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,340
I didn't notice it.

404
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,180
Ran,

405
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,540
don't forget to mention it to Prof. Wen.

406
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,700
Wei'an is in trouble,

407
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,900
and we need your attention and support.

408
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,460
Of course, I will.

409
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,140
Wei'an is my best friend, after all.

410
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,180
I'll definitely help you.

411
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,700
Prof. He, I hate to claim credit,

412
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,900
but in fact, I did most of the work

413
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,940
for the project design

414
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,620
and result discussion.

415
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,220
I'm usually busy with my duties
at the student union,

416
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,540
so I asked Wei'an to report to you.

417
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,620
I need this paper for a competition,

418
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,820
so I need to be listed
as the first author.

419
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,060
Is that the truth?

420
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,660
I remember

421
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,300
it's Su Wei'an

422
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,860
who usually works alone in the lab.

423
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,780
Oh, I'm always unlucky!

424
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,180
You always miss me

425
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,540
when I'm working in the lab.

426
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,980
The order of authorship

427
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,100
can be discussed privately

428
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,180
between the two of you.

429
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,780
Wei'an...

430
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,740
can be bad-tempered

431
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,700
and a bit possessive.

432
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,780
I'm not good at competing with others.

433
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,660
I used to give in

434
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,820
and let her have
all the authorship rights.

435
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,540
But things are different this time.

436
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,740
Prof. He, please help me.

437
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,220
I'm afraid I can't.

438
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,060
Oh, Prof. He, I have one more matter.

439
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,020
My dad is about to start a large-scale

440
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,980
and interdisciplinary clinical research.

441
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,540
He's looking for external doctors
to join the team.

442
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,020
He specifically asked me to ask you

443
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,780
if you're interested in participating.

444
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,460
Your father?

445
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,660
Mr. Wen... he knows about me?

446
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,420
He definitely knows about you.

447
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,060
You are my supervisor!

448
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,820
I used to praise

449
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,620
your academic level to my dad

450
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,740
every day.

451
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,260
Really?

452
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,540
Please send my regards to Mr. Wen.

453
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,100
(Wei'an...)

454
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,780
(can be bad-tempered)

455
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,540
(and a bit possessive.)

456
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,740
(Mr. Wen... he knows about me?)

457
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,580
(He definitely knows about you.)

458
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,220
(You are my supervisor!)

459
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,020
(Please send my regards to Mr. Wen.)

460
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,700
(Okay.)

461
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,420
Wei'an?

462
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,940
Wei'an?

463
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,260
Why are you silent?

464
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,100
What do you think?

465
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,700
About what?

466
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,980
Yuncheng suggested
that we take this opportunity

467
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,100
to grab a bite to eat together.

468
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,380
We can discuss
the enrollment details later.

469
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,260
Okay.

470
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,020
I'm so happy, Wei'an.

471
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,260
I didn't expect

472
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,980
that we would be sitting
at a table together again.

473
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,820
I thought this whole life

474
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,300
you would never even talk to me.

475
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Wei'an,

476
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,980
you can't imagine how much I envy you
for dropping out of school.

477
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,020
There's so much competition
in the medical field.

478
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,580
You used to be the most hardworking one.

479
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,160
But you just decided
to give up your career

480
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,320
and escape from the pressures of awards,

481
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,600
competition, and papers.

482
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,800
How's Lacaya? Is it fun there?

483
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,240
It's easy to make money there.

484
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,600
Making money?

485
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,880
Isn't that a poor place?

486
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,960
Can you really make money there?

487
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,960
Because it's underdeveloped,

488
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,080
I took advantage of the information gap

489
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,670
to find some earning chances.

490
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,960
I always knew

491
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,670
you're like a female Buffett
who is underappreciated by Huaren.

492
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,760
Honestly,

493
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,630
I really envy you

494
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,480
for your wonderful experiences.

495
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,960
As for me,

496
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,630
I've spent eight years

497
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,240
on exams and experiments in school.

498
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,000
What a poor guy I am.

499
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,800
But thankfully,

500
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,080
Yuncheng and I

501
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,800
come from medical families,

502
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,400
and we don't have that desire

503
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,190
to get rich overnight.

504
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,080
Wen Ran, watch your words.

505
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,400
How great it is to get rich overnight.

506
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,280
If you come across such opportunities,

507
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,560
please share them with me.

508
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,560
Wei'an,

509
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,760
who are you trying
to apply for the drug trial for?

510
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,680
It's a distant relative of mine
who was recently diagnosed.

511
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,680
When I tried to sign up,

512
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,480
they said they already had
all 300 participants.

513
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,880
Is that true?

514
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,520
Then we can't help you with that.

515
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,880
We can't increase the number

516
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,920
of participants to 301 just for you.

517
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,600
You're an upright and principled person

518
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,120
who always despises using connections.

519
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,840
If I don't understand
the proper boundaries,

520
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,960
I might annoy you again.

521
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,200
Allow me to help you
if you're uncomfortable asking.

522
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,400
Participating in the clinical trial

523
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,840
and receiving the specific drug early
is our only hope.

524
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,200
Wen Ran,

525
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,240
for the sake

526
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,960
of our past relationship as classmates,

527
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,400
please

528
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,560
do me this favor.

529
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,040
Don't say that.

530
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,360
I desperately pity you.

531
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,480
Since you're pleading so pitifully,

532
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,200
I'll definitely help you.

533
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,960
Otherwise,

534
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,680
Yuncheng won't agree.

535
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,560
Wei'an,

536
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,080
I'll try my best to help you.

537
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,800
But my father

538
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,680
always values the strictness
of scientific research.

539
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,760
His decisions are not easily changed.

540
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,120
So I'm not confident in succeeding.

541
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,200
Anyway, thank you.

542
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,800
I...

543
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,200
I'm going back to Huaren.

544
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,560
Where are you going, Wei'an?

545
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,560
Let's see her off.

546
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,600
No need. I'll take the subway.

547
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,720
Let me walk you out.

548
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,080
Yeah, Wei'an.

549
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Take a few extra steps.

550
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,480
And I can spend a little more time
with Yuncheng.

551
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,240
No, really. I'm leaving.

552
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,880
Bye-bye.

553
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,720
I didn't expect Su Wei'an
to be like this today.

554
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,920
She used to be so dignified.

555
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
I can't believe she's humbling herself

556
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,480
to beg my connections.

557
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,600
Ran,

558
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,800
you didn't even want to help her, right?

559
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,160
What?

560
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,560
How can you think that of me?

561
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,600
This is the first time
Wei'an has asked for my help.

562
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,000
I will definitely help her.

563
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,040
But it depends on my dad.

564
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,040
You know how he is.

565
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,600
Let me talk to him right now.

566
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,400
Mr. Du.

567
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,400
Help me contact Mr. Yang

568
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,880
to apply for an additional participant

569
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,640
to join the Phase III clinical trial

570
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,240
under Prof. Wen's HDQ39 project.

571
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,000
Figure it out.

572
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,200
Understood.

573
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Wait a minute.

574
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
It's a small matter.

575
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,600
We don't need to inform Prof. Wen.

576
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,720
Understood.

577
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
What are you doing?

578
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,000
- Mom.
- What?

579
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,680
Have you seen the stone

580
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,520
on my nightstand?

581
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,720
What stone?

582
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,720
I saw it was there this morning!

583
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,520
Is it the small stone

584
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,680
about this size?

585
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,400
Yes.

586
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,760
I thought you didn't need it anymore,

587
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,800
so I threw it in the trash can.

588
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,680
You throw it away?

589
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,320
Uh-huh.

590
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Is it valuable?

591
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,920
Is it from your boyfriend?

592
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,600
Uh-huh.

593
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,240
It might be in the kitchen trash can.

594
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,760
Wait.

595
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,360
Come here.

596
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,480
Come here.

597
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,760
Let me do a magic trick for you.

598
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,400
Blow into here.

599
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,000
Look.

600
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,720
Are you finding it?

601
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,560
Why is it here?

602
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,320
Is this the stone?

603
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,400
Well,

604
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,040
I noticed that you always place it
on your nightstand.

605
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,760
I can tell

606
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,080
that it's from someone important to you.

607
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,800
Isn't it?

608
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,680
How about my trick?

609
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,920
I managed to get your secret out.

610
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,960
Tell me about him.

611
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,840
What's his name?

612
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,120
How tall is he? What does he look like?

613
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,000
Where does he live?

614
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,760
I don't have a boyfriend!

615
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,400
I... I use the stone to make wishes.

616
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,960
It will bring me fortune.

617
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,720
Give it back to me.

618
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,880
I don't buy your story.

619
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,080
Take it.

620
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,600
If it's really as important as you say,

621
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,160
you should keep it safe.

622
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,640
Not many people
are as clever as your mom.

623
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,620
[Garbage bag]

624
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,760
Are you okay, miss?

625
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,560
I'm fine.

626
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,760
Excuse me.

627
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,560
Master, what do you think?

628
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,480
How should we decorate it?

629
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,080
In my opinion,

630
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,640
we don't need to decorate it.

631
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,240
Because no matter what we do,

632
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,680
it won't make it any prettier.

633
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,480
It's just a stone,

634
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,760
and it's this big.

635
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,280
After decorating it,

636
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,080
are you planning to wear it

637
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,160
as a necklace?

638
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,120
Beware of getting cervical spondylosis.

639
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,080
You're exaggerating.

640
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,720
It's not that heavy.

641
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,480
How could it possibly give me
cervical spondylosis?

642
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,680
Do you really like this stone?

643
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,960
What's the story behind it?

644
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
In my eyes,

645
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,720
it's a priceless treasure.

646
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,760
Young lady,

647
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,840
have you been deceived?

648
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,040
It's just an ordinary stone.

649
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,520
It's worthless.

650
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,640
The stone itself may be worthless,

651
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,920
but it carries

652
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,400
some unforgettable memories for me.

653
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,080
Then let me find a way

654
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,600
to redesign it

655
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,560
as a keychain accessory.

656
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,440
That way, you can carry it with you.

657
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,080
Great.

658
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,200
Will that damage the stone?

659
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,760
You can trust me.

660
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,160
I will polish it carefully.

661
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,560
It's your priceless treasure.

662
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,120
Tell the boy

663
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,360
who gave you this tone.

664
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,960
He should give you
some gold and silver jewelry,

665
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,480
like a gemstone,

666
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,240
a diamond ring...

667
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,120
Even if you break up,

668
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,880
they can be sold for money.

669
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,900
Happy birthday, uncle!

670
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,540
Thank you.

671
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,980
Happy birthday, teacher!

672
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,860
Thank you.

673
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,380
Dad, I wish you a healthy and long life.

674
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,940
This is wild ginseng

675
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,700
that Yuncheng put great effort
into getting

676
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,500
from the medicinal materials trade route
in Yunnan.

677
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,540
Isn't that right, Yuncheng?

678
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,500
Senior leader,

679
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,540
Happy birthday!

680
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,380
Why did the subject choose
to withdraw from the trial?

681
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,260
I don't have that information.

682
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,380
In any case, in a drug clinical trial,

683
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,180
the top priority

684
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,660
is the patient's
voluntary participation.

685
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,540
No one can intervene if they refuse.

686
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,260
I understand.

687
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,220
Ensure that Wei'an's aunt goes

688
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,940
through the legal process
to join the trial.

689
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,260
Don't worry.

690
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
Since a subject has withdrawn,

691
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,500
Mr. Yang will be happy

692
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,340
to accept her and fill the vacancy.

693
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,580
Now he must be grateful

694
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,100
to Su Wei'an's relative.

695
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,140
Great.

696
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,740
Mom.

697
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,540
It's grandpa's birthday today.

698
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,020
Wen Ran is not attending the party.

699
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,980
I asked her why,

700
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,180
but she hesitated
and told me to ask you.

701
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,260
Tell me,

702
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,660
are you bullying her again?

703
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,500
Prof. Wen is going
on a business trip today.

704
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,940
I sent her to see him off
at the airport.

705
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,940
What's wrong with that?

706
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,740
Why did she complain
about such a small matter?

707
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,100
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

708
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,660
I already told grandpa

709
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,980
that you would bring
your girlfriend here.

710
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,340
Now how should I save face

711
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,620
in front of so many people?

712
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,780
You're in your fifties.

713
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,180
You should know how to handle it
before boasting.

714
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,260
What do you mean by boasting?

715
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,980
Isn't Wen Ran your girlfriend?

716
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,540
Isn't her father the director
of Dept Neurology at Zhang He Hospital?

717
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,780
Aren't you two

718
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,140
planning to get married?

719
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,220
Du Yuncheng,

720
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,980
do you think highly of yourself

721
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,860
since you've taken charge
of the company?

722
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,180
Wen Ran is a good girl.

723
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,260
It's your luck to marry her.

724
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,460
My luck?

725
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
No, that's your luck.

726
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,820
At the present stage,

727
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,540
I haven't planned to marry her.

728
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,900
It's you who urgently wants her
to marry into this family,

729
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,900
and become the wife of Du's grandson.

730
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,300
Then who am I doing all of this for?

731
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,020
It's all for you

732
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,860
to become the rightful eldest son
of the Du family,

733
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,780
and to gain the favor of your grandpa.

734
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,180
Your grandpa's house

735
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,060
is worth at least tens of millions.

736
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,820
Even if you have to share with Yunzheng,
you'll inherit a significant amount.

737
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,460
Mom,

738
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,020
don't you understand?

739
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,900
Even if I were to marry the best girl
in the world.

740
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,620
Grandpa would still only value
Gu Yunzheng.

741
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,020
The grandson's wife whom grandpa expects

742
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,340
can only be Gu Yunzheng's wife.

743
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,020
What's so important about the house?

744
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,060
I have no interest in it at all.

745
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,700
No matter what you do,

746
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,740
grandpa won't change his will.

747
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,020
Stop wasting your time.

748
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,740
What are you talking about, boy?

749
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,700
Don't think you can talk to me like that

750
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,540
just because
you're the president of Jiehui.

751
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,540
What happened to him?

752
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,740
Why doesn't he go over there?

753
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,300
Nothing happened.

754
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,500
He hasn't been resting well
due to work stress.

755
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,660
He's in a bad mood.

756
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,260
He's not a doctor.

757
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,020
He doesn't have to work shifts
at the hospital.

758
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,540
Hasn't he been resting well?

759
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,340
You're kidding.

760
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,340
Du,

761
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,860
Yuncheng

762
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,380
may not be as talented
as Yunzheng in medicine,

763
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,340
but he has been working hard too.

764
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,780
Jiehui has achieved good results
under his leadership over the years,

765
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,700
but I haven't seen you or dad
praise him much.

766
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,300
From now on,

767
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,540
stop comparing your two sons.

768
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,340
Yuncheng lives in the shadow
of his younger brother every day,

769
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,180
he can't help worrying.

770
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,140
Yuncheng...

771
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,420
is looked down upon

772
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,820
all because of me.

773
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,020
How can you say that?

774
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,820
Who dares to look down on my son?

775
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,100
I am strict with him for his own good.

776
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,220
Is there anything wrong with it?

777
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,140
He only complains to me,

778
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,940
but he never disgraces you
in front of others.

779
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,460
Don't be too hard on him.

780
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,740
In this house, you are his dad,
not the director of the hospital.

781
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,700
Have I ever received good results
from being kind to him?

782
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,020
He gave up his career as a doctor.

783
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,020
Look at what he's pursuing now,

784
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,900
he's ruining himself.

785
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,420
As an old saying goes,

786
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,860
"An uncut gem does not sparkle."

787
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,900
But you shouldn't be too harsh on him.

788
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,940
Now, he's the only son
carrying your last name.

789
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,540
By this token,

790
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,140
he's your only son.

791
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,500
Stop.

792
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,620
Both of them are my sons,

793
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,580
regardless of what last name they carry.

794
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,540
Thank you.

795
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,340
So many good things.

796
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,620
Thanks for spending money on me.

797
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,260
Grandpa!

798
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,540
Yunzheng!

799
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,500
I'm back.

800
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,540
You're back!

801
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,140
I'm back to celebrate your birthday.

802
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,620
Yunzheng has just returned from Lacaya.

803
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,180
Grandpa,

804
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,940
I brought you
many wonderful gifts this time.

805
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,820
Look at this.

806
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,180
These are wild moringa seeds
from Lacaya.

807
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,300
They're good for diabetics.

808
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:25,900
Are they delicious?

809
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,860
Taste them yourself.

810
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,860
They have a sweet aftertaste.

811
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,580
You're so stingy.

812
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,140
You bring so little
from such a far distance.

813
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,780
It's not enough for me.

814
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,660
It's not melon seeds.

815
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,740
Two or three seeds at a time is enough.

816
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,940
If you like them,

817
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,260
I'll bring you more next time.

818
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,020
Okay.

819
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,490
Have your seats.

820
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,860
- Have your seat, grandpa.
- Come on.

821
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,260
Why did you come back so soon?

822
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,100
Weren't you planning
to stay for another year?

823
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,060
I just wanted to come back.

824
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,100
Do you know what day it is today?

825
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,340
Friendship Hospital is hosting
a commendation conference.

826
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,900
Many embassy officials are attending.

827
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,820
You should have come back

828
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,060
after attending the conference

829
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,740
and receiving your commendations.

830
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,020
I have completed my own tasks there.

831
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,700
The rest has nothing to do with me.

832
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,780
Your tasks may be done,
but your honor has been given up.

833
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,100
Who will remember you
if you keep on acting like this?

834
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,620
But you still have me.

835
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,340
I won't let your efforts go to waste.

836
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,020
The hospital has decided
to promote you to an associate chief.

837
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,220
We will make the announcement
on your first day back to work.

838
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,380
As if I owe you a favor.

839
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,940
Promotion is a comprehensive decision
made by department leaders.

840
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,740
I've performed over 800 surgeries,

841
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,580
and engaged in assistance for two years.

842
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,740
I have earned this associate chief
through my own efforts.

843
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,220
Grandpa,

844
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,020
this is palm candy.

845
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,940
I learned to make it
from a patient's family.

846
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,340
It's made from palm sap.

847
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,540
It's especially friendly to diabetics.

848
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,460
You can taste it whenever you want.

849
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,140
I want it now.

850
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,810
Just try it.

851
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,260
Yunzheng.

852
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,100
That's enough.

853
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,290
It's my birthday,

854
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,620
don't act like the hospital director
in front of me.

855
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,540
Even I can't bear to speak loudly
to my grandson.

856
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,060
What did he do wrong?

857
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,820
Why are you shouting at him
in front of everyone?

858
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,380
Dad,

859
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,780
stop spoiling him.

860
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,980
Look at what he has become.

861
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,420
Thanks to my spoiling,

862
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,660
he has become so excellent.

863
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,020
If he were even more excellent,

864
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,900
I think you might be jealous of him.

865
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:26,860
Yunzheng,

866
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,820
I heard

867
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,700
that you once performed the surgery

868
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,860
with a gun to your head, right?

869
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,300
You know all about it.

870
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,860
The person with the gun to my head

871
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,420
is General Kouyate.

872
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,420
When I was returning
to attend your birthday party,

873
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,420
he chased me to the airport

874
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,740
just to give me this,

875
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,620
his gift for you.

876
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,900
It's a pocket watch made in Germany
during World War II.

877
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,780
I've checked it already,

878
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,660
and it's very accurate.

879
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,940
It's just like you,
growing stronger with age.
