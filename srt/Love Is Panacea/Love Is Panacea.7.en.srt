00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,940
Boss,

189
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,820
how come you don't look tired at all?

190
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,220
I'm used to it.

191
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:02,900
I understand.

192
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,140
With Miss Su here,

193
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,660
you won't get tired anyhow.

194
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,980
You won't have many chances
to enjoy this.

195
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,660
If you are tired,

196
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,420
you don't need
to serve the next operation.

197
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,020
Call Jiang Muying to come on duty.

198
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,420
No need.

199
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,140
It's the last one anyway.

200
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,900
Okay.

201
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,740
[Friendship Hospital]

202
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,380
[In operation]

203
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,240
Boss,

204
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,520
here is the manual for our medical team.

205
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,800
Miss Su has finished the translation.

206
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,600
Since you assigned the task,

207
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,720
check it yourself.

208
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,040
I can't take it anymore.

209
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm going to bed.

210
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,960
Enjoy the proofreading

211
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,680
with Miss Su.

212
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,720
I'm leaving now.

213
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,280
Fang Mingfan.

214
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,240
You need to proofread it carefully.

215
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,400
I don't want to owe you anything.

216
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,080
Then we can't just stand here.

217
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,440
Let's go to the office.

218
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Are you sure this will work?

219
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,880
I'm sure.

220
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,400
Since they spent a night together
at the pharmacy last time,

221
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,040
their relationship has improved
really fast.

222
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,440
Now they're in the same room again.

223
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,720
Their love for each other

224
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,880
will surely be rekindled.

225
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,680
Why do I feel bad about it?

226
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,440
There's nothing else we can do now.

227
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,560
Shut off the power
after I count backward from 3.

228
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,240
Okay?

229
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,120
Okay.

230
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,900
[Content of the manual]

231
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,320
Not bad.

232
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,880
Thanks for your hardship.

233
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,720
This is my duty.

234
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,160
You've been at it a long time, right?

235
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,200
It's been a couple of nights.

236
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,680
Anybody there?

237
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,200
We're still here.

238
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,800
The power's out.

239
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,960
Anyone there? We're still here.

240

[Fang Mingfan]

241
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,080
(Boss, she's about to leave.)

242
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,760
(You won't have a further chance
to express your feelings.)

243
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,720
Anyone there?

244
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,040
(This is all I can do for you.)

245
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,680
(Good luck.)

246
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,770
Anyone there?

247
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,840
It's caused by Fang Mingfan.

248
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,840
He did this on purpose.

249
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,480
I have a flight this afternoon.

250
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,320
As for my duty,

251
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,040
I've handed it to Jiang.

252
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,080
If Jiang is not doing well,

253
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
please take care of her
and encourage her.

254
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,800
I lied to you.

255
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,840
What is my boss saying?

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,120
I want you to stay,

257
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,880
not because we need an interpreter

258
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,840
or because you are good
at French and medical science.

259
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,080
When I first met you in Lakaya,

260
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,000
I thought you were a money-grubber

261
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,840
who abandoned medicine to do business.

262
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,560
However,

263
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,080
you are so familiar with medical terms

264
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,400
and could do anything

265
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,120
to save Sa Kun.

266
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,600
And

267
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,280
you could protect me
from clubs and bullets.

268
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,360
Su Wei'an,

269
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,840
can you remember that night
at the pharmacy?

270
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,960
It was just as dark as it is now.

271
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,400
And you helped me combine
the letters on my bracelet.

272
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,680
Your makeup-free appearance

273
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,880
was really pretty

274
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
under that jacaranda tree.

275
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,000
Dr. Gu,

276
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,760
don't misunderstand it.

277
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,240
I did all those things unintentionally.

278
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,800
If it were anyone else there,

279
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
I would protect them too.

280
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,400
Wei'an,

281
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,920
That New Year kiss

282
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,990
wasn't out of custom.

283
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,600
I don't want to
be just friends with you.

284
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,320
Stop it.

285
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,080
I know what you're going to say.

286
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,080
I've known your feelings

287
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,720
since the New Year party.

288
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,680
I'm not an idiot.

289
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,520
I can read it in your eyes.

290
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,080
I can hear it in your words.

291
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,840
But I'm glad you didn't say it out.

292
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,990
In that case,

293
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,200
I can go on playing dumb.

294
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,520
I'm not a person of perseverance,

295
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
neither in medical study

296
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
nor in love affairs.

297
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,440
No matter what illusion
I gave you before,

298
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,120
I'm in love with Eliot now.

299
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,880
I'm going to Paris with him.

300
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,880
Do you understand?

301
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,320
You love Eliot?

302
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,240
Do you really mean it?

303
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,200
You can't make a horse drink.

304
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,880
I'm not worth what you did for me.

305
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,760
Stop wasting your time on me.

306
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,080
Jiang. Open the door.

307
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600

I prepare you
with a smart recording pen.

The terms with stickers
in the dictionary

312
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,040
are common terms of neurosurgery.

313
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
And the ointment.

314
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,240
It's for relieving itching.

315
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
They say it works well.

316
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,280
Jiang,

317
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,400
Fang Mingfan is so good to you.

318
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,120
You should cherish him.

319
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,800
(Jiang)

320
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,600
(I'm sorry)

321
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,240
(There's something
I don't know how to tell you.)

322
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,160
(I have to find a cure for my disease)

323
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,480
(before the onset.)

324
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,480
(So I have to go to France.)

Hemostatic gel.

329

Hemostatic gel.

330
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,280
The bleeding has been stopped.

331
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,360
Fang Mingfan,

332
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,200
suture the skull.

333
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,360
Okay.

334
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,600
Boss,

335
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,810
this is the last surgery today.

336
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,240
I'll take care of the rest.

337
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,880
You can go now.

338
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,880
Go where?

339
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,080
Wei'an should be on her way.

340
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,200
An, are you sick?

341
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,640
We'll arrive at the airport soon.

342
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,600
No, I'm just recalling.

343
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,840
In the materials you showed me,

344
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,720
those mice with cell transplantation

345
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,720
really show noticeable improvements.

346
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,960
Will Dr. Marta's research

347
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,520
go into clinical trials soon?

348
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,160
I think so.

349
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,600
What's going on?

350
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,000
Is there new progress?

351
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,680
Or

352
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,880
do you run into the bottleneck?

353
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,720
We have many world-class labs in Paris.

354
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,800
Dr. Marta's other research

355
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,720
about BCI is even more promising.

356
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,280
If you're interested,
I can introduce you to it.

357
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,840
What do you mean?

358
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
You know,

359
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,360
I just want to join the program
of Huntington's Disease.

360
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Our project team

361
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,600
is proceeding slowly
with Huntington's Disease.

362
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,880
You can join another group meanwhile

363
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,510
and wait for the research
of Huntington's Disease

364
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,970
to enter clinical trials.

365
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,000
Then you can switch
back to this program.

366
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,760
No,

367
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,800
I can't wait a minute.

368
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,080
Why not?

369
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,160
Why do you stick
to Huntington's Disease?

370
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Why are you following me?

371
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
Wei'an left this for you.

372
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,840

375
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,120
High possibility of high-grade glioma.

376
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,400
Tumors of the brain stem.

377
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,240
Multimodal MRI.

378
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,320
High possibility of high-grade glioma.

379
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,200
It's a smart recording pen.

380
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,720
Just say a keyword,

381
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,480
and it will play the French equivalent.

382
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Wei'an has summarized
your most common phrases

383
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,760
based on your manual.

384
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,400
And she's stayed up several nights
to record this.

385
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,600
The road to the airport
should be jammed now.

386
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,400
I think a motorbike
will get there faster.

387
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
What do you mean?

388
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,200
I mean,

389
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,600
you'll never catch up with her
if you don't set off right now.

390
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,520
She said she had to go to France
with Eliot.

391
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,000
Why should I catch up with her?

392
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Only you know the answer.

393
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,240
You know what, Dr. Gu?

394
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,680
We'an once wrote your name

395
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,080
all over a textbook.

396
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,040
When I found it, she explained

397
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,600
that she wanted to be a doctor like you.

398
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,600
But do you believe in that?

399
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,720
I've never seen any doctor

400
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,240
write Hippocrates's name
all over a book.

401
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,200
Although I...

402
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,040
Dr. Gu!

403
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,480
Although I don't know
why she goes to France,

404
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,960
it certainly isn't for Eliot.

An,

424
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,480
you pay an abnormal amount
of attention to chorea.

425
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,360
Is the person with chorea

426
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,520
really just your friend?

and Guanine amplification number

429
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,600
is over 40,

430
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,320
carrying the gene
for Huntington's Disease.

431
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,800
An,

432
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,800
it's you.

433
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,360
So you know why now.

434
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,800
This is the only reason
why I'm going to Paris.

435
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,800
I'm sorry, An.

436
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,320
I can't take you to Paris like this.

437
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,560
Why?

438
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,440
Eliot,

439
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,440
I just want
to participate in Dr. Marta's experiment.

440
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,280
I won't bother you.

441
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:41,840
You don't need to worry about me.

442
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,950
The experiment has failed again.

443
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,950
This project has been terminated.
I'm sorry.

444
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,120
Terminated?

445
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,600
Sorry, An. I lied to you.

446
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,400
But the materials you showed me

447
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,320
indicated the animal experiments
were going smoothly.

448
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,520
Why was it terminated?

449
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,880
The video I showed you

450
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,800
was three months after medication,

451
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,560
but actually, after six months,

452
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,800
the mortality rate in mice

453
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,120
exceeded 60%.

454
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,760
The experiment still failed.

455
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
I'm sorry, An.

456
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,520
I really wanted to take you to Paris.

457
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,560
I was so focused on
how the air of romance in Paris

458
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,240
would create beautiful chemistry
between us.

459
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,040
But I didn't expect...

460
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:37,960
I'm sorry.

461
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,640
It's okay.

462
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,000
I should be used to disappointment
by now.

463
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,440
This is the real script, I guess.

464
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Don't worry.

465
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,320
It's okay.

466
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,600
A genetic test report

467
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,720
won't change anything

468
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,680
if you are still willing
to go to Paris with me.

469
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,640
Boarding pass.

470
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,800
Please show your boarding pass.

471
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,800
Wei'an?

472
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,800
Wei'an!

473
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,800
Great!

474
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,440
I finally made it.

475
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,040
Wei'an,

476
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
don't go anymore,

477
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,800
Okay?

478
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,960
What's wrong, Wei'an?

479
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,440
Where is Eliot?

480
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,720
He left.

481
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,800
He did?

482
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,800
Why did he leave you alone here?

483
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
What happened?

484
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Nothing.

485
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,240
I just didn't want to go there
all of a sudden.

486
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
You don't?

487
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,000
That's good.

488
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,720
I'll take you back.

489
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,120
Go back?

490
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,040
Where else can I go?

491
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,080
Right,

492
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,680
I...

493
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,840
I found your motorcycle.

494
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,440
I searched all over Lakaya,

495
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,640
and when I found it,

496
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,840
it was so destroyed.

497
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,440
So I fixed it piece by piece.

498
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,280
Can you fix anything

499
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,800
that's broken?

500
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,400
I can!

501
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I can fix anything.

502
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,840
Can you fix me, then?

503
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,320
What?

504
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,800
Nothing.

505
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,160
Wei'an!

506
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,680
It's back to you again.

507
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:03,800
From now on,

508
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,350
don't lose it anymore.

509
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,800
Wait.

510
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,120
I replaced

511
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,200
most of the parts in this motorcycle.

512
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,160
So,

513
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,880
it's our joint property now.

514
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,800
You can have it for everyday use,

515
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,360
but from time to time,

516
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,800
you can also pick up

517
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,280
your busy leader.

518
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,800
Thanks.

519
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,800
Wei'an,

520
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,280
if you really want to go to France,

521
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,800
you have plenty of chances
in the future.

522
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,160
You can still make money here.

523
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,520
I'll help you
with anything you want to do.

524
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,440
You dropped this toy!

525
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,200
You can't hold a baby that tight!

526
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,800
What's wrong?

527
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,640
Wei'an!

528
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,520
I don't know what's going on here.

529
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,560
My baby.

530
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,840
Did you see my baby?

531
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,160
My baby is gone.

532
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,880
I lost my baby.

533
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,040
Is this toy

534
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,960
yours?

535
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,360
That human trafficker.

536
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,480
What?

537
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,480
Wei'an!

538
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,600
Wei'an!

539
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,800
Where are you going?

540
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,840
Human trafficker?

541
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,840
Wei'an said that man
was a human trafficker!

542
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,680
Call the police now!

543
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,960
There was a human trafficker
at Friendship Hospital.

544
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,120
Please send people to catch him now!

545
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,720
Hello?

546
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,680
Why did the cops hang up on me?

547
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,840
If the police in Lakaya were effective,

548
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,560
human traffickers
wouldn't be so rampant.

549
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,080
Then,

550
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,600
what should we do now?

551
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,320
Go, faster!

552
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,680
Sit tight!

553
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,800
Be safe!

554
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,680
Give us the child!

555
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,800
Who are you?

556
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,360
Give us the baby!

557
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Crazy woman!

558
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,440
Do you want to die?

559
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,840
Do you want to die?

560
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,280
How dare you yell at me on my turf?

652

Also, her wound is close to the spleen,

655
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,680

for any organ injuries.
