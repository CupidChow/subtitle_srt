what I prefer

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,800
is a plain and simple one.

Well, you don't have to
push yourself too hard.

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,480
Go on with your work, Dr. Gu.

145

I'm on duty today. I'll handle this.

146
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,560
Dr. He,

147
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
I was asking you what was the matter
with the patient.

148
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,200
Her chief complaint is
stiffness in her limbs.

149
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,120
Considering she has a medical history

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,760

and Huntington's Disease.

151
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,720
What did you say?

152
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,600
Huntington's Disease?

153
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,240
Yeah.

154
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,600
She's Babinski Sign positive.

155
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,360
Give her a head CT right now.

156
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,920
Quick.

157
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,960
A head CT won't help diagnose chorea.

158
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,920
But it can show cerebral hemorrhage.

159
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,880
Dr. Gu,

160
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,080
do you suspect that

161
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
I've misdiagnosed?

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,760
The patient thinks and speaks clearly.

163
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,800
Her face is symmetrical.

164
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,120
Her limb muscle forces are normal.

165
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,800
Even if she's Babinski Sign positive,

166
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,080
one who has Huntington's Disease

167
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,280
can still be pathologically positive.

168
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,840
These are the

169
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,520
typical fluctuations of chorea.

170
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,880
Why are we still wasting time?

171
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,200
Instead, the patient's family members

172
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,080
are here throwing a tantrum.

173
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,550
If the result of her head CT

174
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,320
shows no problem at all,

175
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,550
are they going to

176
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,840
sue us for overtreatment?

177
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,440
Dr. He,

178
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,880
What are the signs

179
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,920
of Huntington's Disease?

180
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Dancing movements.

181
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
Hold on, Dr. Gu,

182
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,800
Huntington's Disease is a rare one.

183
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,120
We've rarely seen such cases

184
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,600
in our hospital.

185
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,840
Besides, this isn't my specialty.

186
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,200
By asking about its details in public,

Dr. He,

189

the stiffness experienced by the patient

193
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,400
is caused by Huntington's Disease?

194
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,760
Shouldn't you exclude

more serious diseases first?

196
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,080
How long has she been like this?

197
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,800
Over three hours.

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,800

199
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,280

Afraid that they may know

366
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,000
you took a bat for me?

367
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Afraid that they may know

368
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,400
we saw the dark rainbow together?

369
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,640
Or afraid that they may know

370
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,840

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,760
We've been through so much

372
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,200
in Lacaya together.

373
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,240
Which one are you afraid of
letting them know the most?

374
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,080
None.

375
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,520
Dr. Gu,

376
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,880
I think you should stop badgering me.

377
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,600
What are you doing?

378
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,600
This is the hospital.

379
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,640
Thankfully it's the hospital.

380
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,280
If not, are you gonna run away again?

381
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,920
Su Wei'an,

382
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,720
from today on,

383
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,760
you can forget about running.

384
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,680
Rather than think about how to leave me,

385
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,680
you may as well think about
how you're gonna tell me honestly

386
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
why you left without saying goodbye.

387
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,200
There's nothing to tell.

388
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,200
You're lying.

389
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,280
It's just for Du Yuncheng, alright?

390
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,920
Auntie, relax. It's gonna be okay.

391
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,080
Okay.

392
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,440
Yuncheng.

393
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,040
Why are you here?

394
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,680
Back with the meal?

395
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,880
Thanks to Du.

396
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,760
He's here helping Yuan with things.

397
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,320
I don't know much about anything here.

398
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,880
Thank god he's here.

399
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,360
Say thanks to him for me.

400
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,760
Thank you, Yuncheng.

401
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Let's not be so polite.

402
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,160
What's up with you?

403
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,000
Feeling unwell?

404
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Come on, take a seat.

405
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,720
Here. Sit.

406
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,120
What's wrong?

407
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,880
Catching a cold?

408
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,120
I'm fine.

409
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
You still remember?

410
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,160
You bring candy with you everywhere?

411
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Wei'an has glycopenia.

412
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,280
After knowing her,

413
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,560
I'm used to carrying a piece of candy.

414
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,040
He's so thoughtful, huh?

415
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Why are you here?

416
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,040
Why can't I be here?

417
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,920
Shouldn't I ask you this?

418
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,480
You must be busy with your company.

419
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,400
Why are you here?

420
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,120
Ms. Su Yuan

421
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,960
is the trial subject of HDQ39.

422
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,000
She needs intensive care.

423
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,800
Is there a problem?

424
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,440
No problem.

425
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,520
I'm more than glad that

426
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,920
you can drop by to see me.

427
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,960
Auntie, hi.

428
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,560
Things happened too fast yesterday.

429
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,440
I didn't get the chance
to say hi to you.

430
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,240
Earlier I wasn't experienced enough.

431
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,600
I didn't know
Dr. He's diagnosis was off.

432
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,000
I didn't expect things to be so bad.

433
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,840
My apologies.

434
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,760
Mom, this is Wen Ran,
my college classmate.

435
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,600
Yeah, Auntie.

436
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,760
I'm Wei'an's best friend in college.

437
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,920
Now I'm also Yuncheng's girlfriend.

438
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,760
You two are good friends?

439
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,080
You look so pretty.

440
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,520
Like a gentlewoman.

441
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,640
Thank you, Auntie.

442
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,560
Nice to meet you.

443
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,480
Wei'an, previously you said that

444
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,600
your distant relative was diagnosed
with Huntington's Disease.

445
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,160
I didn't know she's your aunt.

446
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,880
This isn't a distant relative at all.

447
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,920
It's a close relative.

448
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,040
I remember that this disease

449
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,640
features dominant inheritance
within the family.

450
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,880
There's a 50% chance.

451
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,840
Wei'an, are you...?

452
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,920
Of course not.

453
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,720
For such a thing,

454
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,520
you gotta do a gene detection

455
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,880
to be certain of it.

456
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,280
Have you done that, Wei'an?

457
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,800
I have.

458
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
I'm negative.

459
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,520
There's no such gene in me.

460
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,960
Where did you do the detection?

461
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,920
A lot of institutions out
there are crooks.

462
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,400
Why don't you give me your report?

463
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,320
Let me check for you.

464
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,440
No need.

465
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,760
Thanks for your kindness.

466
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,160
Did you do it in our Huaren Hospital?

467
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,160
Now everything has a digital record.

468
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,040
I can look it up for you.

469
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,000
No need.

470
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,280
Knowing that she's fine will suffice.

471
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,240
No need to push her.

472
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,760
What do you mean I'm pushing her?

473
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,320
Wei'an is my best friend in college.

474
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,280
I'm worried about her, aren't I?

475
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,600
Auntie,

476
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,920
our Huaren Hospital

477
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,880
is the best gene detection institution.

478
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,200
What if you did it elsewhere

479
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,440
and their result isn't accurate?

480
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,440
I gotta see the report to feel assured.

481
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,280
Don't you say so, Auntie?

482
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,120
Yeah.

483
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,720
Wei'an,

484
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,080
shall we do another one sometime?

485
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,000
Ran, did you have breakfast?

486
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,840
Not yet.

487
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,880
Go buy a cup of coffee with me.

488
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,080
Okay.

489
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,560
Excuse me.

490
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,080
This girlfriend of his...

491
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,520
I told you.

492
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,040
Don't match people wishfully.

493
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,000
And she's good friends with you.

494
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,280
How naive of her.

495
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,760
She was easily tricked

496
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,000
by that incompetent Dr. He.

497
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,880
Actually, you're the naive one.

498
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,640
Fang Mingfan,

499
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,600
with your knowledge reserve,

500
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
you're ready for the job.

501
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,160
You're wasting your time

502
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
watching videos without practice.

503
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,640
Boss, a little preparation won't hurt.

504
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,200
I've spoken to Jiang.

505
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,280
I promised her that

506
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,880
I'd go see Dr. Li
for psychological guidance.

507
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Within this month,

508
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,840
I'll get rid of my phobia.

509
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,120
One month?

510
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,760
You really mean it?

511
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,160
One month, no more, no less.

512
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,360
Just trust me, Boss.

513
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,040
Okay.

514
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,920
I'll trust you another time.

515
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,440
Boss,

516
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,760
what are you doing in the office now?

517
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,160
I have an afternoon shift.

518
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,080
Where else should I be?

519
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,280
Su Wei'an's family is in the hospital.

520
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
It's your perfect chance to shine.

521
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,600
I heard that recently

522
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,120
someone from Jiehui

523
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,080
keeps coming here everyday.

524
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,680
Like super early in the morning.

525
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,360
Boss,

526
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,920
you're falling behind.

527
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,920
Who's this someone?

528
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,600
The guy who rarely came to our hospital

529
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,120
to see Dr. Wen.

530
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,400
He's quite driven lately.

531
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,160
You're quite driven too.

532
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,640
No wonder you showed up so early.

533
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,760
What?

534
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,320
In your mind,

535
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,120
am I the same type of person as him?

536
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,720
No, Boss.

537
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,880
You're the workaholic type.

538
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,560
(I doubt you can keep sitting here.)

539
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:03,760
(Five.)

540
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,720
(Four.)

541
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,640
(Three.)

542
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,800
(Two.)

543
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,040
Now you're getting the hang of it.

544
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,920
Mom,

545
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,040
go home to have some rest.

546
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,920
What if anything happens to Yuan?

547
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,760
I'm here.

548
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,240
I'll stay with my aunt.

549
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,960
Okay, I'll go home

550
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,840
to bring her stuff for hospitalization.

551
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,480
Du, thank you so much.

552
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,340
Not at all, Auntie.

553
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,100
Be careful on the road.

554
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,500
Okay, I'm leaving.

555
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,520
Wei'an,

556
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,920
there's a five-star hotel nearby

557
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
that has signed a cooperation agreement
with our company.

558
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,280
Shall I let Assistant Lin

559
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,720
arrange a room for you there?

560
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,800
No need.

561
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,000
I'll be staying here.

562
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,200
In case anything happens.

563
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,120
What could happen?

564
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,320
I'll tell Lin to come.

565
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,340
He'll keep you informed.

566
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,100
It's not far from here.

567
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,560
I have an apartment near the hospital.

568
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,600
I'll sleep in the hospital these days.

569
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,000
You can live at my place.

570
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,080
No need.

571
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,320
I'm fine to sleep here.

572
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,440
Sleep here?

573
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,080
In the corridor?

574
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
How can that do?

575
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,880
The hospital has rules that

576
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,520
no one must sleep in the corridor.

577
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,600
If you sleep here,

578
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,000
not only will you not rest well,

579
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,640
but you'll also affect other patients
and their families.

580
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,760
You should sleep in the hotel.

581
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,120
It'll be more comfortable in the night.

582
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,320
My community is very quiet.

583
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,240
There are no hooligans from outside.

584
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,280
It'll be safer for girls to live there.

585
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
There's really no need.

586
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,320
Just leave me alone for a while.

587
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,720
How about this, Wei'an?

588
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,280
When I'm on duty,

589
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,920
you can sleep in the lounge
for attending doctors.

590
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,040
I'll sleep in the office.

591
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,240
There's a shower and a bed.

592
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,320
You can also use my card
for breakfast in the morning.

593
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,920
It'll be more convenient for you

594
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,520
to look after your aunt.

595
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,480
Wei'an,

596
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,000
if you fall sick due to fatigue,

597
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,680
who's here to look after
your mom and your aunt?

598
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Thank you then.

599
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,260
I'll go buy some stuff.

600
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,640
Yuncheng,

601
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,100
you should also go back to rest.

602
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,600
Mr. Du,

603
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,000
does your girlfriend know that

604
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,720
you're so concerned about Wei'an?

605
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,560
I wish that you could control yourself

606
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,680
and your girlfriend too.

607
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,160
What do you mean?

608
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,280
I suggest that you go ask

609
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,640
the owner of ONE WAY Bar.

610
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,560
Ask him to show you
the surveillance footage.

611
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,040
So you know

612
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,560
what exactly happened

613
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,480
on the day Wei'an was harassed.

614
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,160
Dr. Gu,

615
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,920
what a coincidence to meet you

616
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,840
in the lounge

617
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,480
for attending doctors.

618
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,760
It's okay.

619
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,760
Dr. He,

620
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,600
the indications of operation

621
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,040
of the patient in bed No. 26

622
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,720
are clearly not fit
for a minimally invasive surgery.

623
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,800
Why don't you consider a craniotomy?

624
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,760
The patient's family insisted.

625
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,000
Who's the patient's attending doctor?

626
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,160
Dr. He, I think you should know

627
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,240
whether the doctor should listen
to the patient

628
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,040
or the patient should listen
to the doctor.

629
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,040
Mind your own business.

630
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,400
Come on, have some water.

631
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,920
Thanks.

632
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,760
You're welcome.

633
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,440
Thank you

634
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,480
for getting rid of He Xiaoguang for me.

635
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,320
Why don't you thank me

636
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,200
for getting rid of Du Yuncheng?

637
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Thanks for that too.

638
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,000
In public places like a hospital,

639
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,680
a man should better not
stay too close to a woman.

640
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,280
This may attract gossip.

641
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,880
If Du Yuncheng keeps badgering you,

642
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,280
just tell him directly:

643
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,280
don't cause unnecessary trouble for you.

644
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,720
You're right, Dr. Gu.

645
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,880
Is this how you treat your helper?

646
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,520
Did you say it yourself, Dr. Gu?

647
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,280
In public places like this,

648
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,320
us being together may attract gossip.

649
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,120
So in your mind,

650
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm the same as Du Yuncheng?

651
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,280
What's the difference?

652
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,800
What's the difference?

653
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,640
Do you want me to prove

654
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,760
how we're different?

655
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,400
Gu Yunzheng,

656
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,120
this is the hospital.

657
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,120
Get out now.

658
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,720
I'm busy.

659
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,200
Su Wei'an,

660
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,560
what's this?

661
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,560
Just a common stone.

662
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,800
Is it necessary

663
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,520
to mount a metal ring on it?

664
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,720
Indeed no.

665
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,120
Throw it away then.

666
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,120
How would I have the heart to?

667
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,600
Because this stone...

668
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,920
I know you can't forget the one

669
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,800
who gave you this stone.

670
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,920
You're overthinking, Dr. Gu.

671
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,640
This is just a souvenir

672
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,920
from Lacaya.

673
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,560
For you,

674
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,520
Lacaya is a place worth remembering.

675
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,760
Get out. I need to sleep.

676
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,800
Kai, to be honest,

677
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,920
there's something
I've been hiding from you.

678
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,880
I already have a boyfriend.

679
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,920
Kai,

680
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,680
actually I have a boyfriend.

681
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,920
My boyfriend is a doctor

682
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,320
who saves people's lives.

683
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,440
When he's working,

684
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,520
he's shining like an angel.

685
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,000
I think...

686
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,120
It's okay.

687
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,120
I can do this.

688
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,880
Ying.

689
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,360
Kai,

690
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,600
I have something to tell you.

691
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,440
Ying,

692
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,480
I'm sorry.

693
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,200
Thank you

694
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,720
for hanging out with me these days.

695
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,240
But the truth is,

696
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,920
I've always taken you

697
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,360
as a little sister I grew up with.

698
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,710
If this causes any misunderstanding,

699
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,080
I must say I'm sorry.

700
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,800
You're not chasing me?

701
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,360
You know,

702
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,640
my parents have been
pushing me to get married.

703
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,640
I really have no other way.

704
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,000
But now everything's okay.

705
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,750
They've gone back to America.

706
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,360
So every time you asked me out

707
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,230
was just a show for your parents?

708
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,360
Honestly, you're not my type.

709
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,840
Well, if there's nothing else,

710
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,600
I gotta go work out with a friend.

711
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,440
Excuse me.

712
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,960
I guess

713
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,800
I've been fooled.

714
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,560
Dr. Fang,

715
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,720
studying, huh?

716
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,760
You're reading reference books even.

717
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,920
After working clinically for years,

718
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,520
what, you've forgotten all the basics?

719
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,120
You're starting to practise

720
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,200
like in college?

721
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
Speaking of which,

722
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,400
Gu Yunzheng truly has the guts

723
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
to make you his first assistant.

724
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,920
I think one day

725
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,400
his zero percent operative death rate

726
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,840
may be ruined by you.

727
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,080
I was joking.

728
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,320
This is none of your concern.

729
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,160
I'll overcome these problems myself.

730
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,240
Fang,

731
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,760
hard work will get you somewhere,

732
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,880
but it won't promise you success.

733
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,040
So take my advice.

734
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,400
If you really can't do it,

735
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,480
stop torturing yourself.

736
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,000
Just give it up.

737
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,400
You can't give up.

738
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,720
Jiang?

739
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,680
I think Dr. Fang will do great things.

740
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,120
Because he knows what his problems are

741
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,520
and he's been searching
for solutions every day.

742
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,760
Unlike the doctor

743
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,960
who only envies others' capabilities

744
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,080
and gives up as soon as it gets hard.

745
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,240
Go read some celebrities' biographies.

746
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,120
Some people started as geniuses

747
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,360
but ended up achieving nothing.

748
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,240
While some didn't achieve much
until in their twilight years.

749
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,880
Dr. Fang is definitely the latter.

750
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,000
I wish you, Sir, are not the former.

751
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,280
Is she your friend?

752
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,920
What a sharp tongue.

753
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,840
Just ignore him.

754
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,680
Thank you, Jiang.

755
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,160
If anyone dares to stop you from trying,

756
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,320
I'll teach him a proper lesson.

757
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,360
Great.

758
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,200
Go on.

759
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,640
Come in, please.

760
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,120
Why are you here again?

761
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,840
You tell me.

762
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,360
What?

763
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,040
It's too stuffy in here.

764
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,080
Let's eat outside.

765
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,320
Eat outside?

766
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,000
Are you sure?

767
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,720
Yeah.

768
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,040
Here.

769
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,160
Have some more.

770
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,000
(Had I known that)

771
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,520
(I'd be watched like a panda outside.)

772
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,280
(I should have eaten in the room.)

773
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,680
Focus on your meal.

774
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,120
Just ignore them.

775
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,840
When you do that,

776
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,160
they'll scatter by themselves.

777
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,760
Is there anything on my face?

778
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,040
The way you eat

779
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,400
hasn't changed a bit.

780
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,080
Once you develop a habit,

781
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,840
it's tough to change it.

782
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,120
No matter how hard you try to hide it,

783
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,640
it won't work.

784
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Why do I get commented on
even when I'm eating?

785
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,040
I'm full.

786
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,240
Alright, I won't mention it.

787
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,440
You're tired from caregiving.

788
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,640
Eat more.

789
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,320
Su Wei'an,

790
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,560
why on earth would you...

791
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,840
If you keep asking questions,

792
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,320
I'm gonna be full again.

793
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,920
Alright, I'll stop.

794
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,880
I won't press you.

795
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,640
But if one day you feel like telling me,

796
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,640
I'm always ready.

797
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,540
(How did she know where I was?)

798
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,860
[We've been in love for 763 days]

799
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,020
[Lovers' Map]

800
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,560
(Wen Ran,)

801
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,800
(you're actually tracking me.)

802
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,800
Yuncheng,

803
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,320
you barely ask me out.

804
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,920
We haven't dated like this

805
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,240
for a long time, have we?

806
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,160
Let's break up.

807
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,400
Yuncheng,

808
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,000
you're joking, aren't you?

809
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,200
For so many years,

810
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,320
I've been trying to convince myself

811
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,960
that you're my best choice.

812
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,160
Although not a perfect match,

813
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,640
at least we were happy together.

814
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,120
But now I've realized that

815
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,560
we're not from the same world.

816
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,960
Don't we share a lot of interests?

817
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,400
Yuncheng,

818
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,840
if there's anything I didn't do well,

819
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,800
just tell me.

820
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,080
I can improve.

821
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,080
We're not fit for each other

822
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,960
from the very beginning.

823
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,200
I'm sorry.

824
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,080
Yuncheng,

825
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,360
it's because of Su Wei'an,

826
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,120
isn't it?

827
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,520
It has nothing to do with her.

828
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,000
Ever since we met Su Wei'an again,

829
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,480
you've changed.

830
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,120
Since you have to mention her,

831
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,640
fine.

832
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,320
Let me ask you.

833
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,280
That night at ONE WAY Bar,

834
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,880
why would that man find her?

835
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,360
How am I supposed to know?

836
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,960
You can deny it.

837
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,200
But the surveillance camera there

838
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,080
recorded everything.

839
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,680
Before Su Wei'an returned,

840
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,240
we were fine with each other.

841
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,520
As soon as she was back,
you tried to break up with me.

842
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,440
If not for her,

843
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,680
then for what?

844
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,160
You touched my phone, didn't you?

845
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

846
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,320
When did you install this thing

847
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,760
