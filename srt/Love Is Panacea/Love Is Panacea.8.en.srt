[Based on the novel "Healer"
by Ningmeng Yuyan]

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,980
Has Su Wei'an ever

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,020
had any sort of disease?

20
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,900
No.

21
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,340
How about her family?

22
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,700
Is there

23
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,500
any genetic disease in her family?

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,300
No.

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,460
Wei'an had a physical exam

26
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,020
with me before going to college,

27
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,300
and she was in very good health.

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,540
Her father died in a car accident,

29
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,180
but before that,
he ran marathons every year

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,300
and was very fit.

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,940
Her mother does square dancing every day

32
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
and is also very healthy.

33
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,140
Why did you ask?

34
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,220
Nothing.

35
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,580
Dr. Xu,

36
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,140
how is she?

37
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,740
How is she?

38
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,660
Don't worry.

39
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,180
No organs are injured.

40
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,260
However,

41
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,300
the wound is quite deep,
and she has lost a lot of blood.

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,300
We've transfused 800cc so far,

43
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,300
and she is still unconscious.

44
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,340
Let's transfer her
to the ward for observation first.

45
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,340
Can we go see her now?

46
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,300
It's so late already.

47
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,860
Let her have a good rest.

48
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,580
There are nurses on duty in the ward.

49
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,980
They will take good care of her.

50
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,860
By the way, Dr. Xu,

51
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,940
I need to trouble you to have her get

52
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,460
a full body CT scan

53
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,940
or MRI,

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,700
heart color ultrasound,
blood routine examination,

55
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,340
tumor markers,
and all other necessary tests -

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,660
a thorough physical examination.

57
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,260
Anything wrong?

58
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,540
Do you not trust my medical skills?

59
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,300
I don't mean that.

60
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,980
It's about something else

61
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,500
that I need to confirm.

62
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,580
Okay.

63
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,180
I'll get
the physical examination form ready.

64
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,940
Dr. Gu,

65
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,820
why do you want
to check Wei'an's health?

66
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,940
You've been with her all the time.

67
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,940
Has she shown
any unusual behavior lately?

68
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,340
No.

69
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,300
Dr. Gu, you're scaring me.

70
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,820
What is up with Wei'an?

71
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,100
Is she sick?

72
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,020
Let's hope not.

73
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,140

74
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,050

77
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,380
How do you feel?

78
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,820
Much better.

79
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,580
Thank you, Dr. Xu.

80
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,820
Your outstanding medical skills
saved my life again.

81
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,540
Don't thank me.

82
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,780
You should thank Dr. Gu.

83
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,900
He was so worried about you
after the incident.

84
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,700
As a neurosurgeon,

85
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,140
he has seen his fair share
of blood and gore.

86
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,100
Why did he panic
at the sight of just a little blood?

87
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,460
Well, he's not here to check on me.

88
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,900
Last night,

89
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,220
he waited until your surgery was done

90
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,660
and made sure you were okay
before he went back to sleep.

91
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,620
Where's my purse?

92
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,620
Have you seen it?

93
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,380
What purse?

94
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,060
The one I carry around every day.

95
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,180
All of my stuff...

96
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,220
Don't move!

97
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,220
You just got stitched up.

98
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,820
I'm telling you,

99
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,060
the wound will open easily
when you move like that.

100
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,180
The purse...

101
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,020
I remember Miss Jiang had it yesterday.

102
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,780
You won't lose it. Don't worry.

103
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,500
Have a good rest.

104
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,540
Thank you.

105
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,110
(All the results are normal
with Su Wei'an's health check.)

106
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,700

in the afternoon.)

Miss Su

115
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,980
woke up.

116
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,780
Are you not going to check on her?

117
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,820

admitted yesterday

118

been completed?

But, Boss,

121
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,900
Miss Su suffered such a bad injury

122
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,940
and bled so much.

123
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,780
You were so frantic last night,
like you lost your soul.

124
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,540
Why are you acting like
nothing happened?

125
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,660
I have made up my mind.

126
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,660
It severs her right
after what she has done.

127
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,340
I don't want to see her now.

128
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,980
(Wei'an, have you thought about)

129
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,100

Nope.

137
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,260

to care about her.

Take this medicine twice a day.

Don't look.

146

It's Wei'an's underwear inside.

147

Why would you give it to me?

148
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,740
It's inappropriate
for me to give it to her.

149
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,980
Just give it to her.

Someone said your lips were dry

161

Don't misunderstand.

why don't they just come and see me?

Are they too busy with work?

179
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,660
Or do they not want to see me at all?

180
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180

go ask them yourself.

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,140
Jiang, it's me!

190
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,500
It's me!

191
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,620
Fang Mingfan!

192
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,580
Are you out of your mind?

193
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,620
Breaking into the girls' dorm
in the middle of the night,

194
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,060
are you trying to scare me to death?

195
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,860
Someone is worried

196
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,020
that you will forget
to turn off the fan,

197
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,700
so she had me check on you

198
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,020
in case you catch a cold.

199
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,380
Someone?

200
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,620
Who is the "someone"?

201
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,380
Just someone.

202
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,200
[Friendship Hospital]

203
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
Fang Mingfan,

204
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,580
what is this you gave me?

205
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,500
I mean this black,

206
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,420
mud-like stuff. What is it?

207
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,380
I know

208
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,500
this is someone's stash
of rare coffee beans,

209
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,660
but I don't know
how to grind or brew them.

210
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,940
Feels like I've ruined them.

211
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,180
You guys are so annoying.

212
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,900
So hard to please, all of you.

213
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,020
Asking me, a surgeon,
to work as a servant

214
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,740
and keep secrets for you,

215
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,580
it's too much for me.

216
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,180
She probably had her stitches out
by now.

217
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,220
Congrats,

218
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,180
your servant career

219
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,860
should be over now.

220
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,860
Wei'an's report is out so fast.

221
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,540
All these indicators are pretty normal.

222
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,940
They are not just normal.

223
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,100
She's even healthier than me.

224
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,980
Dr. Gu.

225
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,220
Take your medicine.

226
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,060
Who gives medicine like that?

227
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,740
This

228
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,180
is your health check report.

229
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,420
Take a look at it.

230
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,700
When did I do a health check?

231
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,700
Su Wei'an,

232
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,020
I thought you had a terminal illness,

233
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,900
which is why you were
recklessly living life on the edge.

234
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,740
Looks like I was wrong.

235
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,940
You seem perfectly healthy.

236
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,660
I saw your insurance policy.

237
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,460
All humans are destined to die.

238
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,460
You may get 100 grand

239
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,860
or one million in payout.

240
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,220
I want to see how much I can get.

241
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,540
You won't get a single cent
in compensation.

242
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,420
Who said that?

243
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,940
Su Wei'an,

244
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,980
if you continue
to be so focused on dying,

245
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,660
I will definitely report you
to the insurance company

246
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,500
for insurance fraud.

247
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,620
I mean what I say.

248
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,940
What are you talking about?

249
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,380
Also,

250
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,780
I was not seeking death.

251
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,780
Well, what you did
was not for the right cause.

252
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,740
You did it to kill yourself.

253
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,500
From you dropping out of school
to coming to Lacaya

254
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,180
and to everything that happened

255
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,540
when I met you,

256
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,460
I've figured out

257
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,060
what you're really after.

258
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,780
Rather than watch you
try new ways to kill yourself every day,

259
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,180
let me use my professional expertise

260
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,810
to help you.

261
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,460
What do you want?

262
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,620
You want euthanasia, don't you?

263
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,140
You don't need
to plan to go to Switzerland anymore.

264
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,330
The medicine I gave you

265
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,620
can help you fulfill your wish.

266
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
What's the matter with you?

267
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,460
That's useless.

268
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,460
This medicine
will dissolve quickly when taken.

269
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,500
What did I do to offend you?

270
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,580
This medicine uses

271
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,940
Dracaena draco tree resin,

272
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,330
cactus juice,

273
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
rafflesia petals,

274
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,740
stems of water lilies,
and rooster's blood.

275
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,740
It was used by witch doctors in the past

276
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,260
to help terminally ill patients

277
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,340
escape the agony of their sickness.

278
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,300
As long as you take it,

279
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,100
you will die peacefully in your sleep,

280
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,980
free from pain and suffering.

281
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,060
So mystical

282
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,420
that it sounds like witchcraft,

283
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,740
not any real poison at all.

284
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,660
It's not poison, indeed.

285
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,100
It can help people who want euthanasia

286
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,900
find peace.

287
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,460
Are you feeling a heat sensation
throughout your body now?

288
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,620
And your mouth

289
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,740
is a little dry,

290
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
wanting to drink water?

291
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,380
It's working.

292
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,540
You are taking my life.

293
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,660
To a healthy person,

294
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,180
drugging her is taking her life,

295
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,540
but to you,

296
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,020
I am only

297
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,820
helping you as you wish.

298
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,100
You must be messing with me.

299
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,180
I'm not.

300
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,820
Su Wei'an,

301
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,900
before I thought,

302
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,900
you were throwing yourself out
to save me.

303
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,980
But now I understand

304
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,500
that you can sacrifice yourself

305
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,020
for a stranger baby or anything random

306
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,100
at any time.

307
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,700
Most importantly,

308
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,260
you are not doing this for any purpose

309
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,340
but solely trying to kill yourself.

310
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,420
Don't worry.

311
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,980
After you die,

312
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,220
I will dissect you

313
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,100
and sell your organs,
like heart and liver, etc.,

314
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,100
on black markets.

315
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,060
As we are close friends,

316
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,180
I will give all the money

317
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,340
to your mom.

318
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,260
Okay.

319
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,660
Anyway, if I die,

320
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,660
you won't escape the arm of the law.

321
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,540
Then I shall accompany you
on this journey,

322
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,380
fulfilling your wish.

323
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,860
What are you doing, Su Wei'an?

324
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,380
Don't be reckless.

325
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,100
Lie back down!

326
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,060
Lie back down!

327
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,940
You have six more hours to go.

328
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,860
Listen to me,

329
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,580
the best part about this medicine

330
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,260
is that after you take it,

331
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,060
it will shut down
your organs very quickly,

332
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,540
unless you drink a lot of water now

333
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,420
to dilute the toxins in your body.

334
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,380
You don't want to die now?

335
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,220
Say it out loud.

336
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,340
Say that you don't want to die anymore.

337
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:29,860
Say it!

338
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,340
Say it!

339
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,100
I don't want to die!

340
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,500
I want to live, okay?

341
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,380
Why do you want to live now?

342
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,660
Tell me the reason.

343
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,860
If you give me the reason,

344
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,660
I will give you the water

345
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,220
and the antidote.

346
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,260
I want to live as much as I can.

347
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,580
Wouldn't it be a waste to die so young?

348
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,980
My mom is still waiting for me at home.

349
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,780
Fine,

350
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,460
I admit that I'm a coward,
scared of death.

351
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,100
Is that okay?

352
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,540
The antidote.

353
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,000
[Ferrous Tablets]

354
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,140
Ferrous tablets.

355
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,460
Gu Yunzheng, is it fun to mess with me?

356
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,340
Su Wei'an,

357
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,620
you've been thinking about

358
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,020
what happens after death
all this time, haven't you?

359
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,820
The will,

360
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,100
bank cards, insurance policies,

361
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,580
everything was clearly arranged.

362
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
But if these really were

363
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,020
the last six hours

364
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,380
of your life,

365
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,780
what would you do?

366
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,140
But they're not.

367
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,580
Whether they are or not,

368
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,220
I want you to remember
what you said today:

369
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
you don't want to die;

370
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,540
you want to live.

371
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,380
I saved your life,

372
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,340
and I want you

373
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,220
to take good care of yourself
starting from today.

374
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,580
Stop trashing your life like this.

375
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,220
Remember to use an umbrella
when it's raining.

376
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,460
Remember

377
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,460
to wear more clothes when it's cold.

378
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,220
If you ever feel sick,

379
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,580
I'll hold you responsible.

380
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,780
Rest well.

381
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,660
Remember to take the ferrous tablets.

382
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,660
You're a little anemic.

383
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,100
Dr. Gu,

384
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,820
how is Wei'an now?

385
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,460
She looks fine to me.

386
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,060
I hope

387
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,340
she'll really listen to me.

388
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Jiang,

389
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,540
you're finally here to see me!

390
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,220
I missed you so much!

391
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,020
Does anywhere hurt now?

392
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,900
I have a big hole in my belly,

393
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,780
and I will only get better
after a pretty lady hugs me.

394
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,380
Do you know

395
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,540
what you told me that night?

396
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,460
Did...

397
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,540
Did I tell you the password
of my bank account?

398
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,340
Can you erase that from your mind?

399
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,340
Wei'an,

400
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,700
when we were in school,

401
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,460
you told me

402
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,820
that in the future, we'd go see
the Northern Lights in Iceland together,

403
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,140
go to all the milk tea shops in Jinhai,

404
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,580
be each other's bridesmaid

405
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,100
no matter who gets married first,

406
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,380
and be godmothers to each other's kids.

407
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,140
You told me that when we got old,

408
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,780
we'd retire together and live somewhere

409
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,540
with warm weather and blooming flowers
by the sea.

410
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,820
I took every word you said

411
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,740
very seriously.

412
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,220
But you,

413
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,100
You came to Lacaya without a word,

414
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,140
got into trouble and hurt,

415
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,500
and even wanted to elope with Eliot!

416
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,380
Jiang.

417
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,740
Don't interrupt. Listen to me first.

418
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,260
I just want to ask you.

419
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,060
Before you make a decision,

420
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,900
have you ever thought about my feelings?

421
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,100
Do you have me

422
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,220
as a friend in your heart?

423
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,700
Have you

424
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,740
ever thought about

425
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,220
what I would do

426
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,540
if you died?

427
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,100
How should I explain it to your mom?

428
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,020
Jiang.

429
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,540
I'm sorry.

430
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
I know I'm stupid,

431
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,220
useless,

432
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,740
and always following you around

433
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,900
without being of any help.

434
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,100
I'm a burden to you.

435
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,020
Jiang.

436
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
It's not like that.

437
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,780
Listen to me.

438
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,020
Don't say anything, Wei'an.

439
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,140
I've made up my mind.

440
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,220
I'll buy a ticket back home
in a few days.

441
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,540
We've both grown up.

442
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,100
I won't cling to you anymore.

443
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,780
Jiang.

444
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,860
[Friendship Hospital]

445
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,100
Knowing you've taken the poison,

446
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,340
so you're in fear that you won't wake up

447
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,100
if you fall asleep?

448
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,140
I've been lying down for too long.

449
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,500
I want to go out and get some fresh air.

450
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,740
Let's go.

451
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,020
I'll go with you.

452
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,220
No need.

453
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,220
It's not that serious.

454
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,740
I'm not handicapped or bedridden.

455
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,980
What are you doing?

456
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,780
Taking you on your way.

457
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,020
Where are we going?

458
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,460
You'll find out later.

459
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,460
Su Wei'an.

460
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
Do you know

461
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,340
what

462
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,140
a glioma specialist means to me?

463
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,740
So you pushed me here
in the middle of the night

464
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,500
just to have me

465
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,980
listen to your brilliant resume

466
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,740
as the youngest associate professor
of neurosurgery in China?

467
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,300
Every year,

468
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,340
among the glioma patients I treat,

469
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,620
most of them are stage III

470
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,620
and stage IV malignant tumor patients.

471
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,420
Their median survival

472
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,500
is 15 to 17 months.

473
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,620
I've seen

474
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,460
kids who just started school,

475
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,460
students about to graduate from college,

476
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,540
talented painters,

477
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,660
and retirees

478
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,740
ready to travel the world
with their partners.

479
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,340
Many of them

480
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,140
are really interesting.

481
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,500
I really want to be friends with them.

482
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,620
But I dare not.

483
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,380
Because there's always a voice
in my heart

484
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,620
reminding me

485
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,620
that they will leave this world soon.

486
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,220
I remember

487
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,620
a couple.

488
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,020
The husband

489
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,540
had a glioblastoma.

490
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,540
The cost of electric field therapy
for a year

491
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,660
is nearly one million.

492
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,020
His wife sold their house.

493
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,740
She took care of her sick husband

494
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,740
and their child, who was
preparing for college by herself.

495
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,620
She was very strong

496
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,860
and optimistic.

497
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,860
And there was a mother

498
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,540
whose MRI

499
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,740
showed a very poor prognosis.

500
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,140
She cried in the examination room

501
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,500
and begged me

502
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,260
to let her

503
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,020
live a few more years.

504
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,780
She wanted to teach

505
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,380
her child
who had just started kindergarten,

506
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,020
to dress and feed themselves.

507
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,620
Actually,

508
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,500
there are many examples

509
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,780
of people who refuse

510
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,380
to compromise with death.

511
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,660
Even in the most desperate situations,

512
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,620
some people never give up.

513
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,740
Su Wei'an.

514
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,700
I don't know

515
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,540
why you don't value your life.

516
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,340
I just want to tell you

517
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,100
that the people around you

518
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,860
care about you a lot.

519
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,260
Jiang Muying,

520
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,100
your mom,

521
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,980
and me.

522
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,380
Your life

523
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,860
is really important

524
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,860
to the people who love you.

525
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,860
We don't know what will happen tomorrow.

526
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,140
But moments like this,

527
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,260
where we can enjoy the moonlight

528
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,020
and smell the flowers,

529
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,500
are really precious.

530
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,460
I want to live, too.

531
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:29,850
Su.

532
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,140
Someone is looking for you.

533
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,490
How do you do?

534
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,100
Thank you for saving my child.

535
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,860
You're a lucky star.

536
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,220
Driving away my bad luck.

537
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,500
She said I'm a lucky star.

538
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,020
It's the first time
someone said that to me.

539
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,740
It's something we should do.

540
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,260
No need to thank us.

541
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,940
Next time, during the full moon,

542
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,460
I'll take him to the Dark Rainbow
to pray.

543
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,900
Dark Rainbow?

544
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,740
Tell me about it!

545
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,540
Be careful.

546
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,500
Just now, Isa told me

547
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,380
that the locals have a custom.

548
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,100
Mothers will take their children

549
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,020
to the Dark Rainbow to pray,

550
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,100
hoping to bring good luck
to the children.

551
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,420
The place where we can see
the dark rainbow recently

552
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,380
is in Labe Village.

553
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,660
Why are you looking at me like that?

554
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,260
Is there something on my face?

555
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,260
Labe Village is far away.

556
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
I'll give you a 20% discount
on my car ride.

557
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,820
You're still thinking
about doing business?

558
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,900
It seems

559
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,540
that you can live well now.

560
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,740
Are you willing

561
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,260
to accompany me to see the dark rainbow?

562
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,220
Sure.

563
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,580
Deal.

565
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,180
Don't go.

566
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,700
Don't leave, please.

567
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,700
Sit down and eat. I'm starving.

568
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,260
Come.

569
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,020
Sit down quickly.

570
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,740

571
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,540
Jiang, look.

572
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,980
This is your favorite hot pot.

573
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,180
Supplies in Lacaya are limited.

574
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,420
I bought everything I could.

575
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,380
You have to try it.

576
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,180
Have some beef tripes first.

577
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,140
We used to order beef tripes

578
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,140
when we had a spicy hot pot.

579
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,220
It's your favorite.

580
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,180
You can't shabu-shabu the tripe
for too long.

581
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,620
Otherwise,

582
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,580
it'll become unpalatable
and hard to chew.

583
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,900
You might as well throw it away.

584
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,860
I'll eat it myself.

585
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,180
Let's cook some fatty beef.

586
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,420
Fatty beef doesn't get tough. Here.

587
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,460
Sauce.

588
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,420
This is a special sauce I made for you.

589
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
Nobody else has it, only you.

590
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,180
Try it, it's delicious.

591
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,220
The spicy broth
is already complicated enough.

592
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,820
It's okay

593
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,540
to use simple sesame oil
and garlic for the sauce.

594
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,180
Isn't simple better?

595
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,940
I'll eat.

596
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,180
I love eating spicy broth
with sesame sauce.

597
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,860
Brown sugar rice cake, try it.

598
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,740
The rice cake

599
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,900
can be found everywhere in Lacaya,

600
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,660
but the brown sugar is not easy to find.

601
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,260
Eat it while it's hot.

602
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,700
Brown sugar rice cake

603
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,780
is too sweet.

604
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,100
It sticks to your teeth
and doesn't digest well.

605
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,420
I can't shake it off.

606
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,180
How about drinking cola?

607
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,420
Give me the cola.

608
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,740
Cola goes well with hot pot,
just like us.

609
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,900
The carbonation of cola
enhances the spiciness.

610
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
It's not a good match.

611
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,380

but she still prepared
such a feast for you.

615

And they're all your favorite dishes.

616
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,460
How could you suddenly change like this?

617
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,780
People always change,

618
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,260
don't they?

619
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,940
Jiang, don't say that.

620
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,020
I'm sorry, I know.

621
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,180
I know I made you angry.

624

to have a happy vacation.

625

Don't let me ruin your mood.

627

I'm impulsive and reckless

628

and always overlook your feelings.

629
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,180
If we have to say who is a burden,

630
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,620
it's definitely me.

631
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,740

If you really want to leave,

I won't dare to keep you.

634

the double-flavor hot pot.

00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,860
I haven't heard of this brand before.

750
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,740
I want the most expensive one.

751
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,500
Okay.

752
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,220
Another one.

753
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,180
[TEECN WT2]

754
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,140
This one is more expensive.

755
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,700
This one is okay.

756
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,740
How much is it?

757
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,180
It's 280 US dollars.

758
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,100
So cheap.

759
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,740
It's just over 1,000 yuan in RMB.

760
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,260
Is there anything more expensive?

761
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,020
No rush.

762
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,180
Take your time.

763
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,740
Pick one you like.

764
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,780
I'll pay for it anyway.

765
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,940
Don't worry.

766
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,220
Did you already know

767
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,620
there are no expensive mobile phones
in this shop?

768
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,700
How could I know?

769
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,860
You chose this shop.

770
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,940
Nothing caught your eye?

771
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,620
This one seems good.

772
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,940
Take a look at this one.

773
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,500
Thank you.

774
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,500
This model

775
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,780
is quad SIM and quad standby.

776
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,340
It's got a tanning function

777
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,620
and a very loud ringtone.

778
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,860
I've seen patients use it.

779
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,780
If it works so well,
keep it for yourself.

780
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,980
Give me back my original phone.

781
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,780
Alright.

782
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,540
You don't like it?

783
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,940
If you don't like it, we don't need it.

784
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,940
Anyway, nobody is looking for you.

785
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,020
Forget it.

786
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,940
If it's free, why not take it?

787
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,100
I want this one.

788
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,140
He pays.

789
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,340
Okay.

790
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,620
How much is it?

791
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,700
It's 280 US dollars.

792
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,620
Your boyfriend is really nice.

793
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,940
No, we're not like that.
