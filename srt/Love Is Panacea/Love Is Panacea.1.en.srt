was the direct impact point.

to make it to the hospital,

00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,760
If that were the case,

558
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,200
how would you take responsibility?

559
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,000
He's still alive, isn't he?

560
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,680
You're just lucky.

561
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
No wonder you dropped out.

562
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,000
I see you have no respect

563
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,600
for medicine or human life.

564
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,400
Don't worry!

565
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,360
If he died,
I would compensate him with my life.

566
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,880
Is your life not a life?

567
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,000
What exactly does human life

568
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,160
mean to you?

569
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,800
Is this how Huaren Medical University

570
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,080
teaches you to be responsible

571
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,160
for human lives?

572
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,160
Sign your name and you can go.

573
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,360
Are you that Gu Yunzheng from Huaren?

574
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,880
Thanks.

575
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,920
Wasn't Gu Yunzheng your teacher...

576
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,840
Su Wei'an.

577
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,240
What happened to that man?

578
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,200
Did he pass out?

579
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
He had a seizure.

580
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,080
He was lucky enough
that young Dr. Su was here.

581
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,560
He's being sent to the hospital now.

582
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,880
Dr. Su?

583
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,440
That's not accurate.

584
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,520
She's a student at
Huaren Medical University.

585
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,960
She forgot her book.

586
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
This is the last subject of her finals.

from Clinical Medicine Class of 2012.

596
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Mr. Gu,

597
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
you still remember me.

598
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,720
I have not met many students
who missed an exam

599
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,640
because of saving people.

600
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
Your name impressed me deeply
at that time.

601
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
Su Wei'an,

602
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,760
I thought you would be
an excellent doctor,

603
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,360
but I didn't expect you to drop out.

604
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,160
Why did you drop out?

605
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,760
It was too difficult to learn medicine
and I had no money,

606
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,400
so I gave up.

607
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,320
Pay the fine now.

608
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,200
Can you give me a discount?

609
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,800

00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,960

611
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,440
OK?

612
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
You are bargaining about the fine?

613
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,680
OK?

614
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
That won't work, right?

615
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,600
Five hundred dollars?

616
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,440

Where's my money?

619
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,280
Oh no, I don't have enough cash either.

620
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,360
Dr. Gu,

621
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,600
you must have money.

622
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,320
Please help her.

623
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,320
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

624
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,360
Thank you, my teacher, Mr. Gu.

625
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,400
Don't thank me

626
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,040
or call me your teacher.

Su Wei'an,

630
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,440

631
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,400
without permission again,

632
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,560
I will cooperate with the police
to bring you to justice.

633
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Keep that in mind.

634
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,600
Dr. Gu, we will pay you back.

635
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,840
Hello, Hong.

636
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

637
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,320
Hey, bud,

638
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,120
do you still have Moutai in your store?

639
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,920
Those bottles of Moutai
I booked for you last month,

640
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,230
can I buy them back?

641
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,040
You drank all three cartons?

642
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Only one bottle?

643
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,600
Two bottles? OK!

644
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,560
Fake..

645
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,230
No fake ones. I don't sell fake goods.

646
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,120
The General is an expert on China.
You know that.

647
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
He will know if he tastes it.

648
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,190
Give me an offer.

649
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,920
What a rip-off!

650
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,520
What a hassle to get some alcohol!

651
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,000
Su Wei'an,

652
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,240
do you still see me as your friend?

653
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,760
I flew halfway across the world

654
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,560
today to see you,

655
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,280
spent the whole day
running around for you,

656
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,120
even used my acting skills
to cry for you,

657
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,000
- yet you won't look at me in the eye?
- My bad.

658
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,880
My bad.

659
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,680
Come on, have some prawns.

660
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,560
Your favorite prawns.

661
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,000
Stop that.

662
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,360
Be honest. What's going on?

663
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,880
It's just...

664
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,640
I lost General Kouyate's alcohol

665
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,320
- and now I...
- Stop.

666
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,440
Did I ask you about that?

667
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,920
I'm talking about Gu Yunzheng.

668
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,520
Dr. Gu, your teacher Mr. Gu.

669
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,880
Spit it.

670
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,000
Do you have feelings for him?

671
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,000
Enough, Jiang Muying.

672
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,760
I'm in big trouble now.

673
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,080
How can I even think about that?

674
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,840
If the General gets mad,

675
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,960
things will get out of hand.

676
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,560
Fine.

677
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,840
I won't ask you about Dr. Gu anymore.

678
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,560
Let's talk about you.

679
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,280
What's wrong with me?

680
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,720
Don't you pretend!

681
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,640
You are in Lacaya

682
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,640
but why did you lie to us about Paris?

683
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,720
Also,

684
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
when did you drop out?

685
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,600
And why?

686
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,960
Didn't I make myself clear

687
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,200
at the police station?

688
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,760
It's hard and makes no money, right?

689
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,440
Yeah.

690
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,400
Only Gu Yunzheng would believe that.

691
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,600
Don't you lie to me!

692
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,840
You've wanted to be a doctor
since you were little.

693
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,320
Now you're telling me

694
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,640
you think there's no money in medicine,

695
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
so you want to give up.

696
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,480
Do you really think I'd believe that,
Su Wei'an?

697
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,600
And you, Su Wei'an,

698
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,280
have never been the kind of person
who loves money.

699
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,440
I do love money,

700
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,760
very much.

701
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,520
You came all the way to Lacaya

702
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
to earn dangerous money
that risks your life.

703
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,920
Is it because of what happened
with your essay back then?

704
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,360
Of course not.

705
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,720
Or because of your father's accident?

706
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Jiang,

707
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,440
people change.

708
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,720
I just want to make money now.

709
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,000
I want to enjoy life.

710
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,520
I don't want to suffer every day
in that medical school,

711
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,200
and work hard
without earning much money.

712
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,320
You don't have to

713
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,880
struggle so hard here. Alright?

714
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,000
Go back to China with me.

715
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,120
Jiang, I know

716
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,400
that you care a lot about me.

717
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,840
But

718
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,280
I need so much money right now,

719
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,520
the more the better.

720
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,840
Alright, I'll make money with you.

721
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Since I was a kid,
I've loved following you around.

722
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,320
This time is no different.

723
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,400
I bought a one-way ticket.

724
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,640
Either you go back with me

725
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,760
or I stay here with you.

726
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,920
I won't leave without you.

727
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,160
You won't leave without me?

728
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
Are you kidding?

729
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Can your company
grant you such long leave?

730
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
Well,

731
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,280
I quit my job.

732
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Again?

733
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
Oh my god.

734
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,080
Our family's real estate income

735
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
from rent alone allows me to
earn easily without effort.

736
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,040
Why endure humiliation for a salary

737
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
of just a few thousand?

738
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
I don't want that,

739
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
so I quit.

740
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,440
In two days?

741
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,600
That won't do.

742
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,280
If I don't get it today,
I'm a dead person.

743
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,080
So what's wrong, Wei 'an?

744
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
Do you have to get enough Moutai
for the General?

745
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,760
You only got this many bottles
after all the effort tonight.

746
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,400
Did you ask the airport duty-free shops?

747
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,040
We can have someone go in and buy them.

748
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,560
It's not that easy.

749
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
He is an expert on China.

750
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,640
The ones in the duty-free shops
are exported goods.

751
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,040
He wants the original Moutai.

752
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
What can we do?

753
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
We are here.

754
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,640
Who's that?

755
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,320
I don't know. I don't dare to answer.

756
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
They've been calling me all night.

757
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
Jiang,

758
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,200
why don't you just buy a ticket
and go back?

759
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,040
I don't want to get you involved.

760
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,800
The General's men are scary.

761
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,400
I just got here. I won't leave.

762
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,040
Get out of the way. Get lost!

763
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,040
What's wrong?

764
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,720
Hurry!

765
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,440
No.

766
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,000
What's wrong?

767
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,880
Get out of the way!

768
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,760
Go there now!

769
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,680
Who are they?

770
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,480
The General's people.

771
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,520
Go there now!

772
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,600
There's a box here.

773
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
So many people!

774
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,640
Only one carton.

775
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,960
You! Carry this carton onto the car.

776
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,680
Catch that woman.

777
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,040
Hide yourself.

778
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Smash the door open!

779
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,440
No!

780
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,120
All my money is in there.

781
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,240
Is your money more important
than your life?

782
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,920
Where are you going?

783
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,200
My snacks and chili sauce!

784
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,520
Seriously? Chili sauce?

785
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,480
Your mom asked me to bring it to you.

786
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
You,

787
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,160
just stand there.

788
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,800
Yes.

789
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,280
Notify all locations

790
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,960
that if Su Wei'an is seen,
report to the General immediately.

791
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,160
Move!

792
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,360
Let's go.

793
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
My money! Oh, my shop!

794
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,280
This is too scary!

795
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,680
Jiang,

796
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,400
we won't be able to go back today.

797
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,720
The General's men just said

798
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,600
that I screwed up his banquet today,

799
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,880
and they will capture me.

800
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,000
Why are his men

801
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,440
acting like gangsters?

802
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
We can just pay him back.

803
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,160
How could they smash and rob your home?

804
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,200
I'll call the police.

805
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,880
What can the police do?

806
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,920
He's like an emperor here,

807
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
not scared of anyone.

808
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,720
Where are we going to

809
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,320
spend the night tonight?

810
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,240
We can only find a hotel.

811
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,040
The General has given the order

812
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,400
that no facilities can take me in.

813
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,160
They will capture me
the moment they see me.

814
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,840
Where can we go?

815
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,040
Hello!

816
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
Are you here to
apply for the interpreter job?

817
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,040
I know a safe place to go.

818
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,440
You do? It's your first day here.

819
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,040
Let's go.

820
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,520
Just come with me.

821
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,140
[Friendship Hospital]

822
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,040
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

823
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,720
I'd better go back
and make amends to the General.

824
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,240
He won't really take my life.

825
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,640
No.

826
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,480
You are not even scared of the General.

827
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,480
Are you afraid to come to the hospital?

828
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,040
Your shop is ruined
and your business is gone.

829
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,280
It is the safest and best place for you.

830
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,640
Aren't you all about making money now?

831
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,040
They pay you weekly

832
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,040
and the pay is good.

833
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,040
What could be better for you

834
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,840
than this French interpreter job?

835
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,040
No way.
