00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,480
What's the big deal?

375
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,040
I just wanted to take a look.

376
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,760
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

377
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,600
I'm really sorry.

378
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,370
Please don't be angry.

379
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,320
I was just

380
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,640
trying to scare you.

381
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,200
I won't get you into trouble.

382
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,400
Move aside.

383
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,880
That medicine isn't for me.

384
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,280
It's for someone
who needs it to stay alive.

385
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,720
Let go of your hand.

386
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
Let me help you put it back together.

387
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,840
Is this bracelet

388
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,200
important to you?

389
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,200
You broke my bracelet.

390
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
It can't be fixed anymore.

391
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,600
You're annoying,

392
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,200
and so is your mom.

393
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Leave my house.

394
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
It's my house.

395
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,200
You're annoying. Go away!

396
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,160
Go!

397
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,440
Yunzheng.

398
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,440
Let go.

399
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,720
What are you doing?

400
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,640
Honey.

401
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,200
It's all Yuncheng's fault.

402
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,640
Don't blame Yunzheng.

403
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,480
Yuncheng, apologize to your brother.

404
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,440
Yuncheng.

405
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Try to put it together on this paper.

406
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,640
It will be clearer this way.

407
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,960
We can't do it like this.

408
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,400
The letters are in the wrong order.

409
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,600
I've tried many combinations

410
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,400
but can't get a complete meaning
out of it.

411
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,760
Let me help you.

412
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,640
Okay?

413
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Okay, it's done.

414
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,360
Dark rainbow.

415
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,600
That's what

416
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,200
it means in French.

417
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,760
Dark rainbow.

418
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,200
Yeah.

419
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,440
Dark rainbow.

420
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,200
It's a rainbow in the night sky.

421
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,480
It's a super miracle.

422
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
The person who gave you this bracelet

423
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
probably wanted to bring you good luck.

424
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,200
Is it

425
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,440
from your first love?

426
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,560
Or from your girlfriend?

427
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,600
No.

428
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
I've figured it out for you.

429
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,600
You should be feeling better now, right?

430
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,880
You won't report me, will you?

431
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,280
It's another kettle of fish.

432
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
I know a lot of rumors

433
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,720
about the dark rainbow.

434
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,200
Would you like to hear them?

435
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,200
Like what?

436
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,200
Like...

437
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,680
Like the fact that the dark rainbow

438
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,600
only appears under specific conditions.

439
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,200
If you're

440
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,000
lucky enough

441
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,200
to see it,

442
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,920
it means

443
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,440
that somewhere in this world,

444
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,400
a miracle

445
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
is happening.

446
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,200
It's so romantic, right?

447
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,280
And I also know

448
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,200
where you can see it.

449
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,680
Do you?

450
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,200
Yes.

451
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
It's far away.

452
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
But it doesn't matter.

453
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,440
As long as you take my car.

454
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,440
For the sake of our friendship tonight.

455
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,200
Give you a 20% discount.

456
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,880
How about that?

457
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,960
No, thanks.

458
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,880
Why don't you push me away?

459
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,520
You're too heavy. I can't move.

460
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,200
You could have woken me up.

461
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,640
You've been pressing on me all night.

462
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,160
I fell asleep at dawn.

463
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,200
I just woke up.

464
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,600
How could I have been pressing
on you all night?

465
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,520
I'm not a mountain.

466
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,520
Are you sure you just woke up?

467
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,840
(How can you be so tidy
when you've just woken up?)

468
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,280
(You're so fresh and clean.)

469
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
(Suspicious.)

470
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,040
(He's)

471
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,240
(good-looking.)

472
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,520
Who is it for?

473
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,640
You said that medicine is
for extending someone's life.

474
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,680
For someone

475
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,880
who can't come to the hospital.

476
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,200
Why can't he come to the hospital?

477
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,040
Not everyone is like you

478
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,520
in this world,

479
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,920
with a stable income

480
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,200
and good health.

481
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,200
Many people can't afford
to come to the hospital.

482
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
What's worse,

483
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,240
even if they have money,

484
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,600
Some diseases can't be cured.

485
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,600
Dr. Gu.

486
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,720
We were here last night, and...

487
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,240
I understand.

488
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,400
She said she Understood.

489
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Understood?

490
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,600
I'm not finished yet.

491
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,440
Don't worry, I didn't see anything.

492
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Come with me.

493
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Last night...

494
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,440
Thank you

495
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,440
for helping me figure out the meaning

496
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,200
behind those letters.

497
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,400
I should be thanking you

498
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,960
for not reporting me.

499
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,200
You can't

500
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,200
take these medicine away.

501
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,840
Please.

502
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,960
I offer you more money, okay?

503
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,680
Double the amount?

504
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,480
No need.

505
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,320
You're so willing to spend money

506
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,720
like a money tree.

507
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,200
This person must be
very important to you.

508
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,520
How about this?

509
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,440
Can you give me a box first?

510
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,200
No, I can't.

511
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,760
Let me keep

512
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,200
these medicine for now.

513
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,840
Bring the patient to the hospital
within 24 hours.

514
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,280
No matter how difficult it is,

515
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,200
we can work it out together.

516
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,880
But you can't

517
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,200
take these prescription drugs so easily.

518
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,000
Shut up, you're making a lot of noise.

519
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,840
Your crying is giving me a headache.
Bear it.

520
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,360
Sakun, come on, get up.

521
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,160
How are you feeling?

522
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,280
I'm getting a headache.

523
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,600
Headache?

524
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,480
How dare you come back?

525
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,040
My house was destroyed because of you.

526
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,880
You have to pay me double.

527
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,040
I'll pay.

528
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,960
But you have to take him
to the hospital.

529
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,880
He can't stop taking his medicine,
don't you know that?

530
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,920
Are you kidding me?

531
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,200
We're poor, don't you know that?

532
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,160
We don't even have enough money to eat.

533
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,320
It's even more impossible
to get medicine.

534
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,960
Sakun.

535
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,160
You wretched child,
why don't you just die?

536
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,480
You're a waste of food.

537
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,320
Sakun.

538
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,920
Do you feel any discomfort anywhere?

539
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,760
Headache.

540
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,160
Oh no.

541
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,960
Let's go.

542
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,720
Put him down.

543
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,480
He needs to go to the hospital
right away.

544
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,600
Otherwise, his life will be in danger.

545
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,000
You caused my house to be destroyed.

546
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,640
Even triple the rent won't be enough
to compensate me.

547
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,160
Money!

548
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,120
You only care about money.

549
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,020
Hello?

550
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,560
You said if I tell you
where Su Wei'an is,

551
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,920
you'll give me money?

552
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
She went to the hospital.

553
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,420
[Friendship Hospital]

554
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,960
Dr. Gu, help him!

555
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,640
What happened?

556
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,720
The patient has a headache,

557
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,640
with projectile vomiting

558
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,200
and unsteady gait.

559
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,030
Fang Mingfan.

560
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,640
Take him for a CT scan
of his head immediately.

561
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,200
Hurry up!

562
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:34,800
Okay.

563
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:35,960
Be careful.

564
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
You're the surgeon
with a zero mortality rate.

565
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,360
Will he be okay?

566
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Don't worry.

567
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,120
Where are his parents?

568
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,640
He might need immediate surgery.

569
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,720
I'll sign it.

570
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
You?

571
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,280
Surgery fees and hospitalization fees.

572
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,960
I'll take care of all the expenses.

573
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
You'll take care of it?

574
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,760
Please, I'm begging you.

575
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,960
Please save him.

576
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,720
Boss.

577
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,040
There's a shadow
at the bottom of the third ventricle.

578
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,720
It's hydrocephalus caused
by obstruction.

579
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,280
I'm going to find the child's family

580
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,360
to sign the consent form.

581
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:13,960
I'll sign it.

582
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,960
I can't get in touch
with the patient's family at the moment.

583
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
Let her sign it.

584
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,380
[Su Wei'an]

585
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,680
Surgery now.

586
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,280
Yes.

587
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:22,920
By the way,

588
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,360
the patient is HIV positive.

589
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Take proper precautions.

590
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,240
The medicine you took last night
was for him.

591
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,440
Fang Mingfan,

592
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,640
notify the operating room
for level 1 protection.

593
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
Replace all the nurses with wounds.

594
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,280
Yes.

595
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,110
(What kind of girl is she?)

596
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
Miss Su.

597
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,550
You'll be the interpreter
for this surgery.

598
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,480
Is there a problem?

599
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
No problem.

600
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,510
Your posture is very standard.

601
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,840
You really look like a doctor.

602
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,360
(Just like a doctor)

603
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,200
(Su Wei'an, did you forget?)

604
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,030
(You can't be a doctor
for the rest of your life.)

605
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,400
Start the surgery.

606
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Increase the coagulation.

607
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,680
Increase the coagulation.

608
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
Increase the suction.

609
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,760
Increase the suction.

610
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,400
I...

611
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,360
I think I caught something.

612
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,200
Don't move.

613
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,960
It's a cysticercus.

614
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,000
Dr. Fang, keep your hand steady.

615
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,200
The cysticercus wall is adhering
to the basilar artery.

616
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,040
If there's a hemorrhage,
Sakun will die.

617
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,000
Miss Su.

618
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,920
Who is this child to you?

619
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
A neighbor.

620
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,760
You didn't have money to pay your fine

621
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,920
but had money to pay his medical bills.

622
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,980
Your neighbor is not ordinary.

623
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,920
Are you ready for the next surgery?

624
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,280
No problem.

625
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
As a dropout,

626
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,200
you know that the cysticercus wall
is adhering to the basilar artery.

627
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,720
I'm not a dropout.

628
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,920
I graduated with a bachelor's degree.

629
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,360
You were directly admitted
to a doctorate

630
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,280
but dropped out midway.
Aren't you a dropout?

631
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,640
Since you chose to drop out,

632
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,160
why are you still studying
these specialized terms?

633
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,360
Su Wei'an.

634
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,920
Why did you drop out?

635
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,360
Does it have anything to do with you?

636
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,560
Besides, in this world,

637
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,400
there aren't so many reasons.

638
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,920
Can you tell me

639
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,040
why a grown man like you

640
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,800
wears such a strange bracelet

641
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,200
daily?

642
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,920
Take her away!

643
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,960
Let go of me! Listen to me!

644
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,600
What are you guys doing?

645
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,680
I'll pay for the General's wine.

646
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,240
Can you afford it?

647
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
You've ruined the General's banquet.

648
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,720
He is furious.

649
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,760
Take her away.

650
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,680
Don't move.

651
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,760
Let her go.

652
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,920
Keep holding the knife if you can!

653
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,240
Gu Yunzheng, they have guns.

654
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,960
Don't be impulsive.

655
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
Tell him

656
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,010
that the Friendship Hospital
is protected.

657
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,000
Who dares to hurt Chinese citizens here?

658
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,820
And tell him to control himself.

659
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,480
If he accidentally touches my scalpel,

660
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,000
he'll get his clothes dirty.

661
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Don't move.

662
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,160
Or you'll die.

663
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,220
Friendship Hospital is protected.

664
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,200
I don't believe that.

665
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,120
Doctors save lives.

666
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,760
How can they kill people?

667
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,760
A surgeon's professional skill is

668
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,920
that even if I stab you a hundred times,

669
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,600
you won't die.

670
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,200
You'd better stay here forever.

671
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,640
[Doctor's Office]

672
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,200
Boss,

673
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,640
what happened just now?

674
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
Are you free now?

675
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,400
Have you finished
writing the medical records

676
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,000
and recording the course of the illness?

677
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,120
I just admire your heroic act.

678
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,000
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
hero-safe-beauty scene.

679
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,560
Oh no,

680
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,600
it's a hero saves the day scene.

681
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,680
Sakun hasn't been discharged yet.

682
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,840
His guardian can't be taken away.

683
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,560
Boss.

684
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,320
I heard you spent the night with Miss Su

685
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
at the pharmacy last night.

686
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,560
You spent the night with Dr. Gu?

687
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,720
No, I didn't.

688
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,000
He's talking nonsense.

689
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,320
Hey, why are you talking nonsense here?

690
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
You're just making things up.

691
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,720
I'm not lying!

692
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,040
The pharmacist saw you
with her own eyes.

693
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,320
The scene was a mess.

694
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Su Wei'an,

695
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,880
explain it to me.

696
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,320
She must have mistaken me
for someone else.

697
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,360
I'm new here.

698
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,720
How could she know me?

699
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,320
She wouldn't mistake the boss
for someone else, would she?

700
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,800
Wait. I don't mind you accusing me.

701
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,320
But how can you throw mud at Dr. Gu?

702
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,320
Go over all the plans
for tomorrow's surgery.

703
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,320
Memorize the approach and procedure.

704
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,320
I'll do a spot check later.

705
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,880
Hey, Fang Mingfan.

706
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,880
Are you here
to provide medical assistance

707
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,240
or to gossip?

708
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,320
There's no conflict between the two.

709
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,040
What did you say?

710
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,620
Two tablets at a time,
three times a day.

711
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,340
Dr. Fang.

712
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:47,580
Miss Jiang.

713
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,300
Dr. Fang.

714
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,020
Come over here.

715
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,860
Dr. Fang.

716
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,180
Can I ask you something?

717
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,820
Miss Jiang.

718
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,820
Just call me Mingfan.

719
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,500
No need to be so polite.

720
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Okay, Mingfan.

721
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,460
Let me ask you something.

722
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,460
Does your boss have a girlfriend?

723
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,540
Boss?

724
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,020
Yes.

725
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,660
He's in a relationship?

726
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,660
With whom?

727
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,980
Is she good-looking?

728
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,420
Well, she's not bad-looking.

729
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
But she's a medical expert.

730
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,000
God-like in my boss's eyes.

731
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,360
It's not just love.

732
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,360
If she is a medical expert,

733
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,360
wouldn't she already in her seventies?

734
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,360
Can she still be in a relationship
with Gu Yunzheng?

735
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,360
Who is she?

736
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,360
What's her name?

737
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:44,880
Cushing.

738
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,160
Cushing?

739
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,880
Is there any girl named Cushing?

740
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Cushing,
the father of modern neurosurgery.

741
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,880
Boss is obsessed with him.

742
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,080
You tricked me, Fang Mingfan.

743
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,360
My boss is not dating anyone.

744
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,240
But if you like him,

745
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,360
I advise you to give up.

746
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,440
He only cares about medicine.

747
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,640
(If it were possible
