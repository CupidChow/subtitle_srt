Don't.

Dr. Gu, can I ask you something?

101
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,240
My daughter went to

Huaren Medical University

103
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,820

Have you two met before?

105
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,380

106
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,940
Why do you ask?

107
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:09,940
Yeah, um,

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,340
Is that true?

111
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,060
It certainly is.

112
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,020
Why else would she drop out?

113
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,500
She shouldn't have

114
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,180

on Wen Ran's paper.

115
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,980
It was a matter of principle.

116
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,860
A grave mistake
that got her kicked out of school.

117
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,260
That's nonsense. I didn't do it.

118
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,300

121
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,540
Ma'am,

122
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,460
are you sure your daughter was studying

123
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,300
in France?

124
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,980
Because I heard she was in Lacaya

125
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,700
in the last few years.

126
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,700
Maybe it was a little white lie

127
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,220
she told.

128
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,460
It wasn't the only time

129
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,700
she lied,

130
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,220
was it?

131
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,260
That's impossible.

132
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,620
My daughter never lies to me.

133
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,500
Right?

134
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,220

137
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,580
Dr. Gu,

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,220
she grew up with an ambition

139
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,540
to get into Huaren Medical University.

140
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,860
She just wants to be a good doctor.

141
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,780
Tell me.

142
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,060
She was a good student, wasn't she?

143
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,340
That's right, Mrs. Su.

144
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,980
I remember

145
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,820
Wei'an being

146
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,580
the brightest student.

147
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,820
As far as I'm concerned,
she didn't do anything wrong.

148
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,620
Some, though, have a penchant

149
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,020

150
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,460

00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,060
Who are you referring to?

153
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,100

154
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,020
what I said personally.

155
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,420
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

156
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,780
Ah, I see what's going on.

157
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,140
You like Su Wei'an,

don't you?

159
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,500
That's why you're defending her.

160
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,660
And you're so protective of Wen Ran.

161
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,380
Does it mean you have feelings for her?

162
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,220
See?

163
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,740
I guessed it.

164
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,620
You're so quick to defend

165
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,020

166
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,060

168
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,020
Geez. Do something.

169
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,100
My daughter has strong moral principles.

170
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,700
I can vouch for her.

171
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,140
As her thesis adviser,

172
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,900
it was your fault
that the authorship went wrong!

173
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,380
But since it was in the past,

174
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,700
I'm willing to let it go.

175
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,340
Just remember this.

176
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,620
From this point forward,

177
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,980
you will not speak ill of my daughter.

178
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,180
Otherwise, as her mother,

179
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,740
I will sue you

180
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,100
for unethical behavior!

181
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,340
That's enough.

182
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,780
Being loud doesn't make you right.

183
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,580
Guessing the apple never falls far
from the tree.

184
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,220
This is a hospital.
I'd rather not stoop to your level.

188
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,980
You heard what those people said
in the hospital.

189
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,860
So, are you going to tell me about it?

190
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,580
Or do I have to ask around?

191
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,780
I did drop out.

192
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,100
What about the study abroad program
in France?

193
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,100
I never applied for it.

194
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,180
How could you have lied to me,

195
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,020
Miss Grown-Up?

196
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,420
So where were you instead?

197
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,660
Where did you go?

198
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,740
I thought med school was hard.

199
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,700
I couldn't take it anymore.

200
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,340
So I became a backpacker

201
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,260
and traveled around the world.

202
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,940
I took on some jobs while at it.

203
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,060
I've been to a lot of places,

204
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,540
such as Phuket,

205
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,780
Nice,

206
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,460
and, uh,

207
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,060
Morocco.

208
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,900
They're fun places to visit.

209
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,180
And with beautiful sights to see.

210
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,940
Traveling is so much more
enjoyable than studying.

211
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,140
Oh,

212
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,060
you could've told me sooner.

213
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,380
Mom, please don't start laying it on me.

214
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,300
No, I'm not.

215
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,940
I want you to live a more relaxed life

216
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,300
just as much as you do.

217
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,700
I know medical school is difficult,

218
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,620
but you made that choice yourself.

219
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,020
Wei'an,

220
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,380
since you were a kid,
I've been supporting

221
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,620
your decision-making.

222
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,340
Getting kicked out of school
was a big deal

223
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,700
and a great embarrassment to me.

224
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,620
I didn't want to disappoint you.

225
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,500
You couldn't have.

226
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,460
I blame myself

227
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,300
for not making enough money

228
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,260
to provide for you.

229
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,780
You love to travel.

230
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,780
I ought to support your passion.

231
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,060
It's a big world out there.

232
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,220
It would be a shame not to explore it.

233
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,860
But you should've told me
about your plans.

234
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,700
You shouldn't have kept me in the dark.

235
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,020
What am I in your eyes?

236
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,980
An unreasonable person?

237
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,140
No, of course not.

238
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,900
Mom,

239
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,980
those rumors about me in the hospital,

240
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,060
let's not take them personally.

241
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,300
Oh, I won't.

242
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,940
Dr. Gu

243
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
acknowledged publicly

244
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,660
that you were brilliant,

245
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,340
remember?

246
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,660
I call that a validation.

247
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,860
He's been really helpful.

248
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,700
And he's always sticking up for you.

249
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,220
Are you two...

250
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,180
No.

251
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,940
There's nothing going on between us.

252
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,700
Right.

253
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,740
He is too good

254
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,380
for you.

255
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,140
Can we talk about something else,
please?

256
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,380
[ICU]

257
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,940
Dr. Gu, how is she?

258
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,700
The patient is stable enough

259
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,300
to be transferred to the ward.

260
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,740
Oh, that's great. Thank you.

261
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,020
Mrs. Su, Wei'an.

262
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,060
What are you doing here?

263
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,220
I've got Miss Su Yuan

264
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,540
a VIP room
featuring the best medical equipment

265
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,580
and the most natural light.

266
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,260
My assistant here is going to help you
with the transfer process.

267
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,620
Go and get

268
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,220
the transfer paperwork done.

269
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,260
All right.

270
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,820
That's very thoughtful of you.

271
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,940
You've been a great help

272
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,180
to me and my family.

273
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,780
Wei'an,
you owe Yuncheng a big thank you.

274
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,900
Thank you, Yuncheng.

275
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,940
No problem.

276
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,900
You could buy me dinner
to express your appreciation.

277
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,220
Yeah, of course.

278
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,780
I'll leave you guys to it.

279
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,620
That's good.

280
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,220
Mommy, look.

281
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,900
The lady is rotating her wrists.

282
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,540
Are they making a video?

283
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,660
Like this.

284
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,700
Look how good I am.

285
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,140
Stop. It's rude.

286
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,540
I'm sorry

287
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,260
for my child's disrespectful behavior.

288
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,940
That's okay.

289
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,060
Why are you here?

290
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,460
Miss Su Yuan,

291
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,740
here.

292
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,740
Try this.

293
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,980
Let me show you.

294
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,780
Tuck the strap

295
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,500
through the hole

296
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,860
and then tuck it back.

297
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,500
It'll give your hand support.

298
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,620
There's one more.

299
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,620
Now, your other hand.

300
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,500
Repeat the same steps.

301
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,060
With the extra stability,
you'll feel more comfortable.

302
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,340
Do they fit your hand just right?

303
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,980
Thank you.

304
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,700
Just doing my job.

305
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,180
Thanks.

306
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,980
(Wei'an,)

307
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,940
(if you were in Aunt Yuan's shoes,)

308
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,500
(would you want to end your life?)

309
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,660
Life is tough.

310
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,180
Have something sweet.

311
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,740
What,

312
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,500
you're afraid
of being seen accepting the drink?

313
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,980
I'm just talking to the family

314
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,140
of my patient.

315
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,540
Thanks.

316
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,900
My aunt was studying music

317
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,580
in St. Petersburg until I was six.

318
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,540
My dad said

319
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,660
she was the only person

320
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,260
in their small town

321
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,020
who became a national-level violinist.

322
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,860
It's hard to imagine, right?

323
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,260
I'll never forget the first time
I saw her

324
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,580
at the airport.

325
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,620
She walked out of the gate
carrying a case.

326
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,420
She stood out from the crowd.

327
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,540
Slim figure.

328
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,260
High-bridged nose.

329
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,740
knee-length body-con dress.

330
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,500
Long, graceful neck.

331
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
She walked up to me

332
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,220
and gave me a chocolate.

333
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,580
I shrank and hid behind my dad.

334
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,540
Whispered that my aunt was a foreigner.

335
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,900
When I was a kid,

336
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,580
I'd follow her around

337
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,460
when she wasn't busy.

338
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,340
I'd ask her to play with me
or just watch her practice violin.

339
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,380
That sounds

340
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,220
nice.

341
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,940
At that age,

342
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,860
that was my idea of happiness.

343
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,380
I used to think

344
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,740
Aunt Yuan would stay the same.

345
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,300
That she would

346
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,660
age gracefully.

347
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,060
What's the point of living

348
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,610
when life is so cruel?

349
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,180
Is that her thought

350
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,820
or yours?

351
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,260
I'm sorry. I...

352
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,580
That was my foul mood talking.

353
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,900
Can you just promise me something?

354
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,180
No matter how hard

355
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,300
it gets,

356
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,020
don't lose hope in life.

357
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,540
All right?

358
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,300
Why are you saying this?

359
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,980
I've been out here too long.

360
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,020
I'd better go back inside
to be with my aunt.

361
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,860
Wei'an,

362
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,820
you said you wouldn't run away.

363
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,620
(I wish I hadn't lost the will to live.)

364
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,820
[Wilson's disease]

365
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,860
[Huntington's Disease]

366
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,180
(There's scarce medical literature)

367
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,700
(on Huntington's Disease.)

368
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,500
Hello.

369
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,580
Hello, Dr. Gu.

370
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,820
Here.

371
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,860
Can you search the index

372
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,780
for theses and dissertations

373
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,500
on the topic "Huntington's Disease"?

374
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,340
From all around the world, as well as

560
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,460
Wei'an,

561
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,140
you tested positive.

562
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,740
Aw, what are you going to do?

563
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,500
Ran!

564
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,340
Mom.

565
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,300
It can't be...

566
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,180
It's okay, Mom.

567
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,220
What she's saying is not true.

568
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,380
Why?

569
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,940
Wei'an's tests came back negative.

570
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,500
I have proof of that.

571
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,300
What is going on?

572
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,980
Why are there two reports?

573
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,780
Mrs. Su,

574
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,660
I presented Wei'an's ID for the pick-up.

575
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,340
Look, it says here that she's negative.

576
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,860
- She's all right.
- Yeah.

577
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,980
It says negative.

578
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,300
Negative.

579
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,060
Right?

580
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,180
You two saw this day coming

581
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,340
and had a fake result in place?

582
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,740
Wei'an,

583
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,500
you really shouldn't have tried
to fool your mom with a false report.

584
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,380
Wen Ran,

585
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,340
what is it that you want?

586
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,900
Wei'an,

587
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,140
I know it's a bitter pill to swallow.

588
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,700
But as medical students,

589
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,420
we're supposed to have faith
in medical science.

590
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,500
There may be no cure at this time,

591
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,660
but with preparation,

592
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,140
we may be able
to delay the onset of symptoms.

593
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,340
Wen Ran, that's enough.

594
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,420
Muying,

595
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,180
where did you get that report?

596
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,900
The report...

597
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,860
I brought Wei'an's ID to the lab

598
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,420
and collected the report there.

599
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,860
Wen Ran, what about you?

600
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,140
Did Wei'an send you

601
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,940
to pick this up too?

602
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,100
No.

603
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,140
I never asked her to do that.

604
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,140
That's odd.

605
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,700
The hospital regulations specify
that only the patient

606
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,940
or someone with their ID or a POA

607
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,300
can have access
to the patient's results.

608
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,020
Otherwise, it's a privacy violation.

609
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,540
The employee will receive a warning,

610
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,660
or worse, get fired.

611
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,540
Wen Ran,

612
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,340
you haven't forgotten about

613
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,060
basic medical ethics, have you?

614
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,980
I haven't.

615
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,900
Mrs. Su,

616
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,300
I've heard

617
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,860
the system at the laboratory department

618
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,300
is down today.

619
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,340
They're working on it.

620
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,060
All those invalid test results printed

621
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,660
have been chucked into a trashcan.

622
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,820
Don't tell me

623
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,500
you got this out of the trashcan.

624
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,260
But if you didn't,

625
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,100
that would mean

626
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,620
you connived with someone
in the department

627
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,980
to smuggle out a copy.

628
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,180
If that's the case,

629
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,580
it's a gross misconduct.

630
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,300
I am required to report it
to my superiors.

631
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,260
It was scavenged.

632
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,940
And you have the nerve to scare them?

633
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,180
Wen Ran,

634
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,580
you stay away from Wei'an.

635
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,780
Which means

636
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,780
Wei'an is all right.

637
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,820
It was a mix-up,

638
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,780
right?

639
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,820
That's right.

640
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,700
I'm so relieved.

641
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,940
I'm glad it turned out okay.

642
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,300
I'll leave you to it.

643
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,900
Wen Ran.

644
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,220
Yes, Dr. Gu?

645
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,220
Do not ever share anything with anyone

646
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,660
in the hospital without proof again.

647
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,460
This was a false alarm.

648
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,620
But if something like this

649
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,820
happens again,

650
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,060
you will be held accountable.

651
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,940
Got it.

652
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,180
Dr. Gu,

653
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,540
thank you so much.

654
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,020
No problem, Mrs. Su.

655
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,420
Wei'an is okay.

656
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,730
Muying!

657
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,100
Dr. Gu.

658
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,620
Let me ask you something.

659
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,290
Where exactly did you

660
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,250
get the report?

661
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,420
At the dispatch counter.

662
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,140
I showed them Wei'an's ID.

663
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,460
Okay.

664
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,940
Then what about Wen Ran?

665
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,770
Where did she get hers?

666
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,940
How would I know?

667
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,100
She must have made it up.

668
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,700
You know what she's like.

669
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,510
This wasn't the first time
she'd given Wei'an a hard time.

670
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,980
Why did you tell me you were there
to get checked out

671
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,620
instead of telling me the truth?

672
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,180
It is the truth.

673
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,820
I did get an exam.

674
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,900
If you don't believe me,
take a look at my medical exam results.

675
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,180
No...

676
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,220
Dr. Gu,

677
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,580
you don't wish harm on Wei'an
like Wen Ran does,

678
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,220
or do you?

679
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,740
Of course I don't.

680
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,260
Then why won't you believe Wei'an?

681
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,940
Let me ask you this.

682
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,380
Did someone come in here this morning

683
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,740
and ask you for a lab report?

684
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,140
No. Nobody came.

685
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,140
The neurosurgeon, Dr. Wen Ran?

686
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,460
Who?

687
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,980
I don't know her.

688
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,660
We'll never

689
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,500
release test results
to anyone without consent.

690
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,620
And they can only be picked up
at the dispatch counter.

691
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,860
Nobody came to me today
to collect a report.

692
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:55,980
Wei'an,

693
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,220
Dr. Gu talked to me earlier.

694
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,860
About the report.

695
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,380
I didn't tell him anything though.

696
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,060
I stuck to my story

697
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,300
and said I brought your ID
to pick up the report.

698
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,300
And that Wen Ran did that
to you out of jealousy.

699
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,860
He's too smart to buy it.

700
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,300
Even if he did suspect
that we faked the result,

701
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,060
he chose to play along.
Helped you cover your lie.

702
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,500
Maybe he doesn't care

703
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,740
if you have the disease.

704
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,980
It doesn't make any difference to me

705
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,780
what he thinks.

706
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,100
Wei'an,

707
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,540
aren't you tired of

708
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,060
acting tough?

709
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,340
You know,

710
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,340
I feel despair, knowing I have HD.

711
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,940
Even if he can accept me
for who I am now,

712
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,700
we don't know
what the future holds for us.

713
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,580
Hypothetical and actual situations

714
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,700
are very different.

715
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,860
I'm the 3rd generation in
my paternal family to have the disease.

716
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,140
At the very worst,

717
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,940
my memory will start to decline

718
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,420
before I turn 30.

719
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,220
And then I'll lose my mobility.

720
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,300
Move uncontrollably

721
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,580
until I die.

722
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,340
Stop it, Wei'an.

723
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,340
Which is why

724
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,340
I'd rather not

725
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,300
start a relationship.

726
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,060
I don't care what anyone thinks.

727
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,500
I will be there for you.

728
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,140
I won't leave your side

729
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,780
no matter what you become.

730
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,700
Let's go.

731
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,660
Wei'an,

732
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,580
get in the car.

733
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,900
What do you want?

734
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,220
Get in the car.

735
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,500
No.

736
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,500
What are you doing?

737
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,780
Get in the car.

738
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,060
Don't you have anything to say to me?

739
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,780
I never thought I'd live to see the day

740
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,220
when I saw you

741
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,940
acting like a child in public.

742
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,140
There's a more childish side of me.

743
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,940
Want me to show you?

744
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,060
So...

745
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,300
having Huntington's Disease

746
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,100
is the reason why you quit college
and left without saying goodbye?

747
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,700
Let me tell you something.

748
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,540
I don't care at all

749
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
if you faked your test result.

750
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,140
Are you still going to avoid me

751
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,300
like you did before?

752
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,300
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

753
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,940
My leaving

754
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,820
had nothing to do with the disease.

755
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,980
It felt like the spark was gone.

756
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,540
Gone?

757
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,300
Then what about all those things
we've been through together?

758
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,420
What we had?

759
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
What does it mean to you?

760
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,100
Was it all an act?

761
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:43,980
Yeah.

762
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,540
I acted on impulse.

763
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,540
There's nothing good about
being in a relationship.

764
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,860
You're always having

765
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,260
to tiptoe around them.

766
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,300
I enjoy making money.

767
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,300
Money

768
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,420
makes me happy.

769
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,540
Mr. Gu,

770
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,100
I don't need love in my life.

771
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,420
I don't want someone irrelevant
to care about me.

772
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,180
Someone irrelevant?

773
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,500
That's what I am to you?

774
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,500
Great, Wei'an.

775
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,060
Just great.

776
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,500
Guess I'll just update your family

777
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,180
on your condition.

778
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,260
Let those relevant to you
care about you.

779
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,100
Are you threatening me?

780
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:49,980
Stop the car.

781
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,740
I said stop the car.

782
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,180
Wei'an.

783
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,740
Wei'an.

784
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,340
Wei'an,

785
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,260
I didn't mean it like that.

786
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,420
I'm sorry.

787
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,860
Anyway,

788
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,980
thanks for taking care of my aunt.

789
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,500
You...

790
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,940
Can't you say something else?

791
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,180
I don't want to hear "thank you."

792
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,620
I think Dr. Li is a nice girl.

793
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,180
Yeah,

794
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,740
she is.

795
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,740
But it doesn't mean
I have to be with her.

796
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,940
I think you're nice too.

797
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,060
Why won't you be with me?

798
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,940
That's lame.

799
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,060
Wantong

800
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,260
is perfect.

801
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,380
Born rich. Well-educated.

802
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,420
Pretty.

803
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,180
She has it all.

804
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,740
And the best thing about her is that

805
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,180
she's not afraid
to tell me her feelings.

806
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,260
She doesn't hide them from me.

807
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,980
Unlike some escapist...

808
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,500
Will you leave this escapist alone?

809
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,820
Dr. Li is too good to be true.

810
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,540
It would be a happy ending
if you two got together.

811
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:46,940
Let go of me.

812
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,700
She may be a perfect girl,

813
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,100
but I don't care about her.

814
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,940
I don't care about you either.
