Sakun.

19
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,300
Is it cute?

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,260
Come on.

21
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,100
It's for you.

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,940
Dad.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,140
What did you call me?

24
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,780
Sakun.

25
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,500
Let go of Dr. Gu.

26
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,140
Do you have some "touch disorder"

27
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
and don't like being touched?

28
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,140
Please tell the kid,

29
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,780
I want to give him a checkup.

30
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,100
Dad, make money!

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,140
Make money?

32
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,980
You taught him that?

33
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700
He's so young.

34
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,500
How can he just call anyone mom or dad?

35
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,580
Do you teach him to defraud money?

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,100
Sakun grew up with no family.

38
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,260
No matter who treats him well,

39
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,100
he will call them mom or dad.

40
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,140
What a young kid,

41
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,060
but you've tainted him
with the stink of money.

42
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,940
What's wrong with making money?

43
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,100
He needs money to treat his illness.

44
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,260
Sakun, listen to me.

45
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,140
No.

46
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,100
It's okay.

47
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,700
He doesn't like
to take injections or medicine.

48

Young man!

49

Listen to me.

50
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,620
Now,

51
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,100
you must take medicine every day.

52
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,740
Although your illness

53
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,740
can't be cured yet,

54
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,620
maybe,

55
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,180
tomorrow or next year,

56
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,420
we'll have a new specific medicine

57
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,180
or a new way to cure it.

58
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,810
So,

59
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,500
you must insist

60
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,620
on the treatment.

61
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,500
(Is there some way to cure any illness?)

Cheer yourself up,

66
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,060

Cheer up!

68
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,500
Please translate for the kid

69
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,940
what I just said.

70
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,100
What's wrong?

71
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,380
Su Wei'an.

72
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,100
Translate my words for him.

73
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,100
Sakun.

74
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,100
Let Dr. Gu give you a checkup.

75
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,260
I'll take you out after that, okay?

76
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,660
I want a Coke.

77
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,420
No problem.

78
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,300
Lie down.

79
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,180
Since I said so much just now,

80
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,100
do you only translate such a few words?

81
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,100
You're too wordy. Do your checkup.

82
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,620
He's fine.

83
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,500
Sakun,

84
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,740
I'll buy you a Coke

85
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,500
when your headache is gone.

86
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,620
Give me five.

87
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,740
Mommy An, come on up.

88
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,940
Let's go.

89
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,940
Why are you dressing like this?

90
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
I don't want any gossip between us.

91
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,500
Neither do I.

92
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,300
Then why did you promise
to take Sakun out?

93
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,500
He's a good boy.

94
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
He's cooperating with the treatment.

95
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,100
I have to keep my word
to such a young kid.

96
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,740
There are so many kids
who don't cooperate,

97
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,740
will you satisfy

98
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,740
their every demand?

99
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,100
Since he had the surgery,

100
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,860
his mom has never come to see him.

101
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
But he's so young.

102
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,620
He must feel lonely

103
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,940
and sad.

104
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,420
So, you give him special treatment

105
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,180
because you feel sorry
for his mom's absence?

106
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,340
Why do we need a reason for that?

107
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,100
You also give him special treatment,

108
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
and what's your reason?

109
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,100
Why do we need a reason for that?

110
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,180
Sakun,

111
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,060
Dr. Gu is very busy,

112
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,500
but he'll spend the whole day with you.

113
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,660
You're going to get rich.

114
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Get rich!

115
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,540
Make money!

116
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:12,860
Let's go.

117
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,100
Is this the big meal

118
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,500
you've been talking about?

119
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,420
Yeah.

120
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,180
This is Lacaya's
most famous food street.

121
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,180
You can find everything here,

122
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,620
and all can be eaten.

123
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,420
Be careful.

124
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:06,940
Mommy An,

125
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,060
there's popcorn.

126
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,300
Do you want some?

127
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,500
Yes.

128
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,420
I'll pay for it.

129
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,140
Take care!

130
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,700
We're halfway through the exam,

131
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,820
and you missed it,

132
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,650
but you can take
the make-up exam next month.

133
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,940
I can't take the make-up exam.

134
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,220
I have to be in the top three
for eight consecutive years

135
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,530
to get into the Huaren Hospital.

136
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,860
I didn't mean to be late.

137
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,060
I was taking a patient to the hospital.

138
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,420
Have you taken a patient
to the hospital?

139
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,180
Yes.

140
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,540
Can anyone prove it?

141
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,140
I can.

142
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,460
She was there

143

to rescue a patient
with an epileptic seizure,

144
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,180

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,620
It's terrible.

192
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
He has poor blood clotting function,

193
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,980
so he can't stop the bleeding himself.

194
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,740
Wrap my clothes around him.

195
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,820
Don't touch his blood.

196
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,500
Don't worry, Sakun.

197
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,620
Come on.

198
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,500
Be careful.

199
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,940
We have an HIV-positive patient.

200
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,460
He needs a wound suture.

201
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,020
Get prepared.

202
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,940
Let me get sterilized.

203
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,260
Let me help you put it on.

204
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,820
You need an extra layer of protection.

205
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,860
Here we go.

206
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,540
[Help your best friend
win her prince charming]

207
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,940
The power's out.

208
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,460
Dr. Zhang?

209
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,220
You scared me!

210
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,380
Jiang, it's me.

211
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,020
Don't worry.

212
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,500
What are you doing here
in such a blackout?

213
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,580
I was writing my paper

214
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,820
while the power was off.

215
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,380
So I'm out to get some fresh air.

216
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,620
And you?

217
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Why are you out there alone?

218
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,940
Where is Su Wei'an?

219
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,940
I haven't seen her all day.

220
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,220
And she didn't want
to tell me anything on the phone.

221
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,620
I just don't know what she's doing.

222
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,300
She must be busy making money.

223
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,620
What else could she do?

224
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,740
It will be fine if she can get through.

225
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,740
Aren't you a Ph.D. graduate?

226
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Do you need to write any paper?

227
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,700
Academician Qiu Fazu once said,

228
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,500
"It's not enough to be skillful

229
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,340
in performing operations.

230
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,500
Both clinical practice
and scientific research are important."

231
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,100
Over the years,

232
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,140
I've increasingly agreed
with what Boss said,

233
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,620
"Research ability
will affect our clinical thinking,

234
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,460
and lifelong learning is essential
for achieving our doctor dream."

235
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,540
Why are you staring at me like that?

236
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,300
I envy you.

237
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,940
It's true.

238
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,260
A person with a dream can shine.

239
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,940
You are saying everyone can shine,

240
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,260
since everyone has a dream.

241
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,940
I don't have any dream.

242
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,180
I used to be a follower of Wei'an.

243
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,820
I would just follow her
wherever she went.

244
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,060
She was an excellent student,

245
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,500
and she pushed me to study every day.

246
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,500
So

247
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,420
I could get into a good college.

248
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,980
She chose to major in medical science,

249
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,940
and I followed her.

250
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,660
But my major is veterinary science.
I was much inferior to her.

251
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,740
That's not true.

252
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,260
I mean it.

253
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,780
And then,

254
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,220
she started to learn French,

255
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,380
and I followed her too.

256
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,980
But I couldn't learn it
as well as she could.

257
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,300
One day,

258
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,500
she suddenly told me

259
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,740
she wanted to study in France,

260
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,700
in Paris.

261
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,420
This time,

262
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,220
I couldn't follow her anymore.

263
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,300
When I found out

264
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,740
that Wei'an had not been in Paris,

265
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,220
and she had even dropped out of school

266
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,540
and given up her doctor dream,

267
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,740
I fell in panic.

268
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,260
If even Wei'an gave up her dream,

269
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,460
what should I do?

270
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,780
I'm quite terrible, right?

271
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,420
That's not true.

272
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,580
Life is a long journey.

273
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,500
One day, you'll stop
being a blind follower,

274
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,700
and you'll realize what you really want.

275
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,220
But the problem is

276
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,980
I don't know what I'm really good at.

277
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,100
Everyone can find an area

278
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,580
they are good at and interested in.

279
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,460
You just need time to discover it.

280
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,700
Although Su Wei'an is very smart,

281
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,300
I believe

282
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,300
you also possess qualities she doesn't.

283
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,260
What are these qualities?

284
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,220
Tell me more.

285
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,940
You're very nice to your friends.

286
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,540
Is that a merit?

287
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,940
I didn't expect it.

288
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,180
That's certainly a merit.

289
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,820
Many people are nice to their friends,

290
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,420
but very few

291
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,220
put their friends before themselves.

292
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,460
I remember that day
when your eyes were red,

293
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,740
and you stood up to Boss

294
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,300
and forced him

295
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,380
to save Su Wei'an
from the police station.

296
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,460
You were so cool.

297
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,420
And I think Su Wei'an is very lucky

298
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,540
to have a friend like you.

299
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,700
You almost moved me to tears.

300
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,900
All right,

301
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,940
from today onwards,

302
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,060
my friend list,

303
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,500
has a new male friend named Fang.

304
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,540
Lift it a little higher.

305
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,540
Move it a little to the right.

306
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,660
We make it.

307
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,180
Are...

308
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,060
Are you okay?

309
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,380
How can you fall on flat ground?

310
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,020
Do you get dystaxia?

311
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,460
No, I don't.

312
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,060
I have hypoglycemia.

313
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,460
Are you really okay?

314
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,580
What about you?

315
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
Check your body again for any cuts.

316
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,700
You're caring about me.

317
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,740
I'm not.

318
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,740
Don't worry.

319
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,580
I have no wounds.

320
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,260
And we need to take the blocking drugs.

321
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,180
I'm hungry.

322
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,060
Come on.

323
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,260
Let's have a meal together.

324
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,460
Come on.

325
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,140
Taste it.

326
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,260
It's too late now.

327
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,500
We can only find these food ingredients.

328
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,540
Su Wei'an,

329
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,060
what's wrong with you?

330
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,500
When my dad cooked noodles before,

331
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,580
he also liked

332
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,940
to put two pieces of fried egg on it.

333
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,500
Your dad?

334
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,260
Is he fine?

335
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,500
Three years ago,

336
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,940
he became a star in the sky.

337
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,100
Is that why you drop out?

338
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
Of course not.

339
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,980
It has nothing to do with my dad.

340
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,820
I just wanted to make money,

341
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,420
lots of money.

342
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,900
People can find many chances in Lacaya

343
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,180
and earn money faster.

344
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,500
There's gold everywhere.

345
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,500
Do you know that?

346
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,500
The Europeans

347
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,500
are very generous with tips.

348
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Su Wei'an,

349
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,220
is your family

350
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,940
short of money?

351
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,100
Who would mind earning more money?

352
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,460
If you really value money so much,

353
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,980
would you risk your final exam
to save someone's life?

354
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,540
Would you save someone

355
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,420
even if it made you look
like a murderer?

356
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,500
Can you believe it?

357
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,940
I don't believe it.

358
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,740
Anyway, I've given up my doctor dream

359
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,780
and choose to make money.

360
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,740
Su Wei'an,

361
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,460
have you made much money at Lacaya?

362
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,300
Is it enough to pay
for Sakun's medical bills?

363
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,900
Why are you so conflicted?

364
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,460
Mr. Gu.

365
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,460
Do you...

366
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,500
agree with Darwin's theory of evolution?

367
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,540
You mean...

368
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,460
Nature chooses the fittest

369
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,500
to survive.

370
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,380
Defective genes should
be eliminated by nature.

371
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,740
I only believe

372
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,940
in the Hippocratic oath.

373
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,780
I'll always maintain the utmost respect

374
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,460
for every life and provide treatment.

375
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,900
Then,

376
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,420
have you ever experienced the despair

377
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,020
caused by a patient never being cured?

378
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,700
We doctors have no right to despair.

379
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,900
We...

380
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,660
we must fight until the last moment

381
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,260
and never say die.

382
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,060
It's all your fault.

383
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,460
We've been chatting for so long.

384
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,260
And now the dining hall is closed,

385
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,220
who will make our night snack?

386
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,420
Su Wei'an,

387
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,260
what are you doing?

388
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,980
We can't be seen together.

389
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,260
Why can't we

390
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,020
be seen together?

391
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,420
Yes, why?

392
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,740
What are you afraid of?

393
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,260
I'm already hiding here.

394
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,460
It will be weird to go out now.

395
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,460
There's really no one around.

396
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,100
Look,

397
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,260
Boss is here.

398
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,460
Boss.

399
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,180
Dr. Gu, what are you doing here?

400
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,220
I'm... hungry.

401
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,900
Who's enjoying noodles with you?

402
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,500
Where's that guy?

403
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,620
No one.

404
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,620
Just me alone.

405
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,740
But why are there two bowls of noodles?

406
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,500
I need two bowls to fill myself.

407
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,900
What's wrong with it?

408
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,020
But both pairs of chopsticks
have been used.

409
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,260
I like

410
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,540
to use one pair per bowl.

411
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,460
Anything wrong?

412
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,460
Nothing wrong.

413
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,900
Boss,

414
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,260
where have you been today?

415
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,980
It seems like your first day off

416
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,260
since you've been here.

417
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,780
I haven't seen you all day,

418
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,820
and I'm not used to it.

419
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Me too.

420
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,220
I haven't seen Wei'an all day,

421
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,460
and I'm not used to it either.

422
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,260
Boss,

423
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,940
you two...

424
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,500
What's wrong with us two?

425
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,020
I wasn't with Su Wei'an today.

426
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,940
I have the afternoon off,

427
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,580
and I just hung around.

428
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,460
Boss, I didn't ask
about you and Miss Su.

429
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,460
I meant to ask
about you and Miss Jiang.

430
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,460
Do you want scallion pancakes
or dumplings?

431
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,460
I'm having noodles.

432
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,860
Have a seat, Jiang.

433
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,500
I'll get you some scallion pancakes.

434
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,500
Dr. Gu,

435
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,260
are you okay?

436
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,340
I feel like you're nervous.

437
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,220
I... I am not nervous.

438
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,780
Am I nervous?

439
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,740
I'm not.

440
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,460
It smells so good.

441
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,460
Taste it, Jiang Muying.

442
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,940
They're made by the chef.

443
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,740
Very delicious.

444
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,820
It's so late now.

445
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,940
Why isn't Wei'an back yet?

446
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,740
Why isn't she back yet?

447
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,460
Why don't you call her?

448
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,220
If you don't mind,

449
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,940
I'll go with you to pick her up.

450
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
What's that noise?

451
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,460
I... I received an SMS.

452
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,660
SMS.

453
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,420
Oops, it's hot!

454
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,620
I accidentally dropped it.

455
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,420
Let me pick it up!

456
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
Let me pick it up.

457
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,060
It isn't hot at all.

458
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,420
I have sensitive fingers.

459
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,100
Jiang Muying,

460
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,220
how dare Su Wei'an!

461
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,820
How dare she go out alone at night?

462
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,180
Has General Kouyate calmed down?

463
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,660
She...

464
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,220
Oh!

465
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,500
You couldn't reach her, right?

466
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,220
Could she have been caught
by General Kouyate?

467
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,460
I have to go look for her outside.

468
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,460
Fang Mingfan,

469
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,780
since Jiang Muying is out alone at night

470
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,820
searching for Su Wei'an.

471
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,500
Lacaya isn't safe,

472
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,460
aren't you worried about her?

473
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,500
Wait for me, Jiang.

474
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,260
Why did you scare Jiang?

475
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,500
She will really look for me outside.

476
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,180
If I didn't drive her away,

477
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,900
would you have a chance to blame me now?

478
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,660
You can call her right now

479
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,900
and ask her to come back.

480
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,500
That's right.

481
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,460
Hello, Jiang.

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:02,940
I'm fine.

00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,540
I just ran into an old client

on my way home,

486
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,260
so we had some night snacks.

487
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,700
I'm heading back now.

488
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,500
Wait for me in the room.

489
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,500
Bye-bye.

490
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,780
I'm leaving now.

491
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Take care.

496
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,780
I didn't know whose notebook it was.

497
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,940
Then you shouldn't have peeked at it.

498
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,300
Since I didn't know whose it was,

499
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,020
I needed to find out its owner

What have I read in it?

503
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,220
I've read someone's will of making money

504
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,180
and her ability of calculating.

505

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,500
I'm starting to believe

510
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,820
that you'd give up your doctor dream
to make money

511
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,500
But,

512
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,500

00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500

00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,220
you were one of us.

518
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,980
Su Wei'an, what are you thinking?

519
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,220
I still remember your words
while we were stargazing,

and devoting their whole power

528
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,020
to shine in the sky.

529
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,940
Just like each one of us,

if I didn't run into Dr. Gu
in the dining hall,

554
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,060

00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,380
No,

565
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,100

566
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,860
When I saw him tonight,

567
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,500
he looks so lonely and vulnerable.

568
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,700
It seems like he's longing for love.

569
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,300
Really.

570
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,460
Why didn't I...?

571
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,140
I mean,

572
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,380
how can you tell?

573
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,460
It's so obvious.

574
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,380
You know,

575
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,460
generally speaking,

576
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,980
he's a cool and serious man.

577
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,020
But in tonight's dining hall,

578
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,460
he cooked himself two bowls of noodles

579
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,020
and prepared two pairs of chopsticks.

580
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,620
It shows that

581
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,860
he's longing for someone
to share a meal with him.

582
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,980
Don't you think

583
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,780
it's especially touching?

584
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,500
Touching?

585
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,420
Why do I find it horrifying?

00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,380
is so excellent,

592
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,020
yet he remains single.

593
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,060
Do you think it's because

594
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,740
he lacks someone to share a meal with?

595
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,460
Well...

596

00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,220
he has nothing in his eyes

598
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,940
but medical science.

599
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,820
That's exactly what Fang Mingfan said.

600
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
He also said

601
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,060
that the one in Gu Yunzheng's heart

602
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,940
is Cushing.

603
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,460
What does it mean?

604
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,020
It means you know Gu Yunzheng too well,

611
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,020

612
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:07,980
What?

613
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,980

that you haven't instructed
the finance department

639
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,220
to release the project funds that
should have been in place this month.

640
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,300
We've funded the HDQ39 project

641

for more than two years,

642
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,620
but the progress has been very slow.

643
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,140
Our investment seems
like a waste of money.

00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,220

in our country

is released on the market,

Our target this year is

653
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,220
to make twice
as much profit as last year.

654
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,300
If HDQ39

655
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,620
is able to cure Huntington's Disease,

656
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,180
it will surely shake

will go more smoothly.

Last year,

671
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,380
Jiehui introduced 12 types
of medical devices.

676
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,260
clivia doesn't like water.

677
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,340
Watering once a week is enough,

678
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,380
that will facilitate
the flower bud differentiation.

679
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,060

680
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,500

00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,330
By the way,

751
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,770
your brother's assistance term
is ending.

752
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Have you contacted him?

753
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,040
Did he mention when he's coming back?

754
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,440
Both you and Yunzheng are my sons.

755
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,760
We're family.

756
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,560
You're supposed to take the initiative.

757
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,280
You're supposed to care about him.

758
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,920
You're the elder brother, aren't you?

759
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,960
Don't you know what Yunzheng's like?

760
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,360
There's no way

761
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,760
he'd tell Yuncheng
about his time of returning.

762
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,920
He even ignores your WeChat messages.

763
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,280
Wouldn't it be a waste of time

764
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,600
for Yuncheng to talk to him?

765
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,200
Dad, Mom,
I still have project files to read.

766
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,280
I'm going upstairs first.

767
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,040
Go to bed early. Don't stay up.

768
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
You too.

769
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,600
Wei'an,

770
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,880
I've been in love with you
for a long time.

771
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,010
Would you be together with me?

772
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,760
Be together!

773
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:29,100
Be together!

774
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,660
[Library]
Be together!

775
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,860
Why did she leave?

776
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,540
So awkward.
