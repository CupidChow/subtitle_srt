18
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,740
Hurry, something's happening.

19
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,660
General Kouyate is here!

20
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,980
He's got a team of armed soldiers.

21
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,860
What's the point?
Just two cases of alcohol?

22
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,500
Let's talk to the General.

23
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,540
General!

24
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,860
I lost the alcohol. I'll pay for it.

25
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,420
Please don't cause trouble
in the hospital.

26
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,300
What are you doing?

27
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,420
I'll take the responsibility
for my fault.

28
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,420
Little girl,

29
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,500
you've picked a good place

30
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,740

31
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,420
General.

32
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,180
You can speak Chinese?

33
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,420
The General attended military school
in Shijiazhuang before.

34
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,900
He even knows the local dialect.

35
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,020
You bad girl!

36
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,540
Do you know the consequences
of selling me fake alcohol?

37
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,620
Fake alcohol?

38
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,020
That's impossible.

39
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,100
I never sell fake alcohol.

40
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,620
Maybe you switched the alcohol yourself

41
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,660
and purposely claimed it was fake.

42
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,820
As an honorable General,

43
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,780
is it necessary for me to frame you?

44
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,140
You arrogant girl,

45
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,420

I'm not here for you

47
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,100
but for him.

48
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,140
Wait, General,

49
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,860
you already had the examination done.

50
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,820
No tumors, no bleeding spots.

51
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,420
How can you prove that you're sick?

52
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,900
My instincts are never wrong.

53
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,420
It's up to him to prove it.

54
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,140
General,

55
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,420
why are you so convinced
that you're sick?

56
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,980
In the past,

standing here,

58
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500

while you were standing downstairs.

60
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,740
But now I can't.

61
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,860
It might be due to your vision decline

62
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,140
or simply because you're getting old.

63
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,020

What I fear is dying

00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,460
If you don't help me

72
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,060
figure out what's wrong with my brain,

73
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,460
I will kill her.

74
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,900
Selling fake alcohol
is a serious crime in Lacaya,

75
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,860
and now I suspect

76
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,740
that it's her fake alcohol
causing my headaches.

77
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,020
I didn't sell fake alcohol.

with your life?

82
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,340
I'm not afraid of bullets.

83
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,740
Not to mention a scalpel.

84
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,500
Of course,

85
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,420

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,180
to make any move,

87
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,340
don't expect
to leave the operating table alive.

88
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,420
Fine.

89
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,860
I'll perform the surgery
for you in a month.

90
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,580
I will

91
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,420
definitely find your enemy.

92
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,740
Good. I got the right guy.

93
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,420
You're a good doctor.

94
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,780
Are you all right?

95
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,420
Yeah, I'm fine.

96
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,460
Why did you agree with him?

97
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,860
The hospital has already examined him,

98
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,940
and the medical records clearly state

99
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,420
that there's nothing wrong with him.

100
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,180
Or

101
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,700
did you agree to him

102
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,220
just to dispel his suspicions?

103
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,740
It's not because the general threatened

104
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,860
that if you don't do it,

105
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,860
he's going to kill me, right?

106
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,500
You can't be that foolish, right?

107
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,140
I can buy a ticket and leave the country
or go to another country,

108
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,340
and then he can do nothing to me.

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,260

if, after the surgery,

112
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,420
you still can't find anything?

113
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,220
It will be considered

114
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
a major medical accident,

115
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,420
and you might not even work
as a doctor anymore.

116
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,060

You're really worried about me, huh?

119
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,420
Absolutely not.

120
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,140
I...

121
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,420
I'm just worried
about getting involved in trouble.

122
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,740
If the surgery fails,

123
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,940
I won't be able to get away
as an interpreter.

124
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,460
Wait. Why do you

125
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,820
have to do this surgery?

126
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,220
Because someone will die
if I don't do it.

127
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,420
Do you know
what's wrong with the General?

128
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,540
I mean,

129
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,700
I'll die if I don't do it.

130
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,980
Do you think

131
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,060
we would have been able
to leave this room

132
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,420
if I hadn't agreed

133
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,580
to perform the surgery for him?

134
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,220
Either way.

135
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,420
Why don't you buy a ticket
back to China?

136
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,780
I'll help you stall for time.

137
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,580
The General can't go back to China.

138
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,820
Su Wei'an.

139
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,100
You don't trust me?

140
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,140
I trust science.

141
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,300
The CT scan

142
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,180
and MRI

143
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,420
have both confirmed
that there's nothing wrong.

144
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,900
General Kouyate is not sick!

145
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,860
You are...

You know Chinese?

150
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,220
My grandmother is from Beijing.

151
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,060
I learned a little from her.

152
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,420
I've heard about you.

153
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,900
Dr. Gu Yunzheng from Huaren Hospital.

154
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,420
You don't want the record
of zero-table fatality rate?

155
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
Zero table fatality rate.

156
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,460
What a proud record!

157
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,900
It shows that Dr. Gu is still too young

158
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,460
and has performed too few surgeries.

159
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,020
Newcomers are always eager
to prove themselves.

160
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,140
I can understand that, Dr. Gu.

161
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
But remember,
patients are not just tools

162
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,420
for doctors to gain fame and fortune.

163
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
You're talking nonsense!

164
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,820
In China, Dr. Gu's

165
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,420
weekly number
of outpatient visits and surgeries

166
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,860
is dozens of times more
than your French doctors'.

167
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,700
In terms of clinical experience,

168
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,260
you're not necessarily better than him.

169
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,420
Is that so?

170
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,460
How does a patient like you know
about clinical experience?

171
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,900
General Kouyate
has always been my patient.

172
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,420
The diagnosis was the result
of a remote consultation

173
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,060
with a French team of experts.

174
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,060
May I ask,

175
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,820
under the diagnosis result
of no mass found,

176
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,180
why does Dr. Gu insist
on performing this surgery?

177
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,900
Is it a provocation

178
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,740
against the French National Hospital?

179
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
Dr. Eliot.

180
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,060
Your hospital

181
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,420
is not that important to me.

182
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,980
I just want to provide

183
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,420
the best medical treatment
for this patient.

184
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,140
And now,

185
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,180
I'm the patient's attending doctor.

186
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,420
If you insist on performing the surgery,

187

Dr. Gu, I'm warning you:

190
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,900
if it's proven after the surgery

191
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,820
that you've performed a fake surgery,

What's the use of being handsome?

Department at the French National Hospital

at the University of Paris VI.

an authority in neurosurgery.

00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,580
and you can earn more money.

373
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,620
I don't want money.

374
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,980
I just want Dr. Gu to be safe.

375
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,180
Are you the money-obsessed Miss Su?

376
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,340
Dr. Gu is one

377
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,380
of the best neurosurgeons in China.

378
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,980
Are you sure you want

379
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,020
to ruin a doctor's career
for your stubbornness?

380
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,380
If he really is
as excellent as you claim,

381
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,460
why do you think he will lose?

382
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,540
Because you're not really sick.

383
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,980
Do you know that your condition

384
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,970
is called hypochondria in psychology?

385
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,370
Miss Su.

386
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,660
You should seek psychological help,

387
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,140
but not Dr. Gu.

388
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,340
How dare you?

389
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,930
Get her out of here.

390
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,700
General.

391
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,620
Let go of me.

392
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,140
General.

393
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,180
She's drunk.

394
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,340
She didn't mean to offend you.

395
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,930
Miss Su, please stop talking.

396
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,930
I'll take you home.

397
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,450
General!

398
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,970
Tell Dr. Gu
to take this crazy woman back.

399
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,970
Yes, sir.

400
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,620
Hello?

401
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,890
Come to the General's residence.

402
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,580
And take the crazy woman away.

403
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,260
She's drunk.

404
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,980
Alright, I got it.

405
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,580
That idiot.

406
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,780
That Dr. Gu,

407
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,220
who is he to you?

408
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,060
He...

409
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
he is my...

410
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,100
Boyfriend?

411
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,660
No.

412
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,660
He's over there,

413
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
and I'm here.

414
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,460
He is my teacher,

415
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,660
the person I admire the most,

416
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,100
and the one I used to want to be.

417
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,860
Why did you say "used to"?

418
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,580
I...

419
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
I didn't have such good luck.

420
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,820
The way you are now

421
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,700
reminds me of my mentor.

422
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,500
She often sighed like this

423
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,260
and complained to God.

424
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,980
She loved playing dice in her lab.

425
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,780
Did your mentor

426
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,660
also have trouble with her experiments?

427
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,100
Because she always chose

428
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,780
the less traveled path.

429
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,020
Though she often failed,

430
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,980
Dr. Marta was still
the most amazing doctor

431
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,820
I've ever known.

432
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,340
Dr. Marta?

433
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,980
The one

434
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,100
who first attempted cell transplantation

435
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,580
to treat Huntington's disease
in the world, right?

436
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,780
How would you know?

437
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,540
This was her experiment
on a rare disease over 20 years ago.

438
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,620
You probably weren't even born yet.

439
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,860
Su Wei'an.

440
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
Thank you.

441
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,780
Dr. Eliot.

442
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,180
It's getting late.

443
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,620
We should go back to the hospital. Bye.

444
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,300
Dr. Gu.

445
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,900
Dr. Gu.

446
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,340
Why are you so determined
to perform this surgery?

447
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,980
Because, as a doctor,

448
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,940
we should never ignore any signal

449
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,420
coming from the patient's body.

450
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,260
[Friendship Hospital]

451
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,460
Let's drink.

452
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,620
Either you or I

453
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,540
must get drunk.

454
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Enough!

455
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,420
Why did you

456
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,900
go to the General's house
to drink tonight?

457
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,620
It's all because of you, causing trouble

458
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,900
and giving me no peace of mind.

459
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,620
Who is causing trouble here?

460
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,340
It's midnight,

461
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,260
and I had to go
to the General's house to pick you up.

462
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,820
Eliot.

463
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,620
Please help me plead with the General.

464
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
Su Wei'an.

465
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,740
Can you please stay away from Eliot?

466
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,020
Why? He's a good person.

467
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,220
Because you're my interpreter,

468
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,620
not Eliot's.

469
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,660
Tonight, just rest here

470
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,300
and clear your head.

471
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,060
Don't leave.

472
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,940
(These features)

473
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,940
(are so)

474
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,220
(ordinary.)

475
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,340
Fang Mingfan.

476
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,860
What are you trying to do?

477
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,740
I didn't expect you to be like this.

478
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,620
What am I like?

479
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,780
Your face,

480
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,780
wipe it off.

481
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,940
Oh no!

482
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,780
I didn't remove my makeup all night.
This is a disaster.

483
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,820
Even a hundred face masks
won't make up for it.

484
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,100
Paper.

485
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,940
Fang Mingfan, I'm warning you,

486
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,260
don't tell anyone.

487
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,940
Tell anyone what?

488
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,300
Don't tell anyone
that my makeup is ruined,

489
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,460
as well as

490
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,620
that I spent the night at your place.

491
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,580
Who am I going to tell?

492
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,220
Well...

493
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,420
You can't tell anyone.

494
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,300
Did you hear me?

495
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,260
If you tell anyone,

496
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,460
I won't spare you.

497
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,780
Okay.

498
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,620
Stop laughing.

499
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,260
Jiang.

500
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,940
You're pretty,

501
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,620
even with your ruined makeup.

502
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
So early?

503
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,940
Why are you wearing yesterday's clothes?

504
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,220
Aren't you, too?

505
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,820
I woke up early in the morning

506
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,620
and went for a workout.

507
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,460
I...

508
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,500
I went to make some money,

509
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,420
talking business with a big client.

510
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,300
You've been drinking.

511
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
Who were you drinking with?

512
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,480
[Friendship Hospital]

513
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,260
Have you found the direction
for the surgery?

514
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Are you sober?

515
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,620
No more headaches?

516
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,700
Then let's go

517
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,780
for breakfast.

518
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,620
You still have the mood for breakfast?

519
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,620
You've drunk heavily,

520
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,300
why can't I eat?

521
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,420
I...

522
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,620
I know you did it for me.

523
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,760
You didn't want
my reputation to be stained.

524
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,760
But Su Wei'an,

525
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,640
let me ask you something.

526
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,920
Why do you think

527
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,040
I gave General Kouyate

528
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,360
the surgery?

529
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,640
How do I know?

530
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,120
Is it because the General put a gun
to you

531
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,720
or because you wanted to compete

532
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,880
with Eliot?

533
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,920
Su Wei'an,

534
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,600
I'm a doctor.

535
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,600
I have only one reason
to give the surgery.

536
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,480
The patient has surgical indications

537
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,600
and needs the surgery.

538
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,240
Why can't you believe me?

539
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,320
I believe you.

540
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,360
But I went through all the medical cases

541
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,840
with unclear images,

542
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,600
and none of them is similar
to the General's case.

543
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,600
So, you gave up?

544
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Did Huaren Medical University
only teach you

545
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,800
how you could give up?

546
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,760
What?

547
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,720
Silly girl, indeed.

548
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
No wonder you're an undergrad.

549
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,240
I'm not an undergrad.

550
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,560
I have a bachelor's degree.

551
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,600
Bachelor's degree?

552
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,120
In college classes,

553
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,680
Mr. Gu taught you something.

554
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,720
But you forgot it all, I guess.

555
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,160
I really don't know

556
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,240
how you got your bachelor's degree.

557
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
Everyone,

558
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,160
today,

559
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,280
we're going to learn
the diagnostic thinking of brain tumors

560
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,240
combined with practice.

561
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,480
It's very clear

562
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,080
that we can't see obvious lesions

563
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,280
from the patient's CT.

564
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Then, let's check the MRI.

565
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,720
We can clearly see some lesions

566
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,560
on the patient's brainstem, huh?

567
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Mr. Gu,

568
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,360
if lesions still can't be seen from MRI,

569
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,560
what should the doctor do?

570
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
He should do a clinical follow-up,

571
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,080
judge, by experience,
the growth of the disease,

572
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,160
and confirm the intervals of follow-ups.

573
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,040
Then what must a doctor trust,

574
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,560
clinical experience,
or precision instrument?

575
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,280
When a doctor cures diseases,

576
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,720
guidance is his criterion,

577
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,480
knowledge is his base,

578
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,040
and experience is his tool.

579
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,600
With rigorous examination results,

580
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,560
the doctor can figure out

581
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,080
detailed lesions quickly and precisely

582
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,280
without delay or misdiagnosis.

583
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,880
So, I want you guys to keep it in mind.

584
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,400
Only by using the instruments

585
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,040
and developing
your own clinical thinking

586
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,200
can you be
really responsible for patients.

587
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,560
You remember me.

588
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,200
So, you kept asking questions in class

589
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,120
just to make me remember you?

590
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,600
Of course not.

591
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,000
It's a question you asked,

592
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,560
but you forgot the answer.

593
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,480
Use the instruments.

594
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,560
But...

595
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,440
Why are you sure
abnormalities can be seen in a month?

596
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,560
What's the patient's walking problem?

597
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,040
He swaggered,

598
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,200
swayed,

599
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,560
and shuffled.

600
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,840
What diseases do such symptoms indicate?

601
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,720
A drunkard look,

602
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
leg weakness,

603
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,920
and cerebellar ataxia.

604
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,560
What's his speaking problem?

605
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
He lisped

606
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
and stuttered.

607
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,560
Dysarthria.

608
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,080
What did he complain about?

609
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
When you were downstairs,

610
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
I could shoot your head off.

611
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,670
But now, I can't.

612
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,560
His skill decreased.

613
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,440
Limb flexibility decreased.

614
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,040
So?

615
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,880
So, the lesion may be in...

616
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,560
In his brainstem.

617
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,760
Not too bad.

618
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,960
You haven't totally forgotten it.

619
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,560
The imaging technology
is so advanced now.

620
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,120
How come we can't see a lesion?

621
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,040
Maybe it's in an odd position.

622
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,120
Or maybe it's the initial phase.

623
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,670
But anyway,

624
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,440
doctors like us

625
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,230
can't neglect every tiny little signal

626
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,320
from a patient's body.

627
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,700
[Friendship Hospital]

628
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,340
[A month later]
General,

629
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,180
MRI indicates some abnormalities

630
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,060
in your brainstem.

631
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,500
Next,

632
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,760
count on Dr. Gu.

633
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
Please trust him.

634
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,740
Fight it off?

635
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
What are you guys doing here?

636
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,320
On behalf
of the local Health Commission,

637
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,620
I'll supervise throughout the surgery.

638
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,380
MRI indicates

639
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,140
some abnormalities in the brainstem.

640
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,900
Next,

641
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,900
Chinese doctors will present
outstanding medical skills.

642
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,200
Su.

643
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,320
Gu Yunzheng is so young.

644
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,520
How dare he give a brainstem surgery?

645
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,200
You're wrong.

646
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,560
We should trust Dr. Gu.

647
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,660
[Friendship Hospital]

648
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
General!

649
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
What are you doing?

650
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,560
I'll go get in there.
I'll be wherever the General is.

651
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,560
He said he stayed wherever General was.

652
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,560
Let him in.

653
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,520
The doctor said you could get in.

654
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,480
But you have to obey

655
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,200
the aseptic rule.

656
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,800
Come with me.

657
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,360
Boss,

658
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,680
wherever you go, I'll go.

659
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,360
I'll even die with you.

660
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,000
No one will die unless your hands shake.

661
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,400
You...

662
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,920
Die with you?

663
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,320
Then my life would be tragic.

664
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,800
It's been a long time.

665
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,560
Can he succeed?

666
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
I told you.

667
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,120
He can't do a brainstem surgery.

668
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,600
Dr. Gu

669
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,360
insisted on risking the General's life.

670
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,000
Before irreversible damage is done,

671
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,560
it's not too late to close his skull.

672
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,800
The surgery isn't over.

673
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,120
Don't jump to conclusions.

674
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,320
The blood pressure is dropping.

675
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,240
The blood pressure is dropping.

676
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,560
Dr. Gu,

677
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,080
put down your scalpel immediately.

678
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,960
Or I'll hold you responsible

679
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,000
on behalf of the Health Commission.

680
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,280
Leave everything to Dr. Eliot.

681
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,280
Get out of the way. Or I'll kill you.

682
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,720
Get out now!

683
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,960
You're not approaching Dr. Gu

684
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,160
unless I'm dead.

685
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,360
No one can stop Dr. Gu in his surgery.

686
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,920
Nobody shall disturb a surgeon.

687
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,920
Miss Su,

688
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,080
you're a mere interpreter.

689
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,160
You're unqualified
to comment on the surgery.

690
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,440
It's not too late to stop it now.

691
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,080
I graduated in clinical medicine

692
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,280
from Huaren Medical University.

693
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,560
I have a physician's certificate.

694
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,720
I answer for whatever I say.

695
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,280
If anything happens to General,

696
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,800
none of your guys can live.

697
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
The lesion is in his medulla.

698
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,640
The lesion is in his medulla.

699
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,040
This is unbelievable.

700
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,640
Did you guys catch that?

701
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,880
I think you should consider

702
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,120
how to apologize to Dr. Gu later.

703
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,640
Put down the values.

704
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,900
Why isn't General waking up?

705
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,060
The surgery has been over for so long.

706
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,020
You mustn't go!

707
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,620
You quack!

708
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,480
General wouldn't wake up so soon.

709
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,960
But the surgery was very successful.

710
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,240
Dr. Gu did a perfect job.

711
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,920
The lesion was perfectly removed, too.

712
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,200
I underestimated him.

713
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,160
You were wrong?

714
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,120
Dr. Eliot.

715
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Just now,

716
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,840
you promised.

717
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,360
As you said,

718
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,720
Dr. Gu is an excellent doctor.

719
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,800
I'll apologize to him

720
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,040
for all that I did.

721
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,680
Dr. Gu,

722
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,080
I'm sorry.

723
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,160
You were just worried about General.

724
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,040
When we have the biopsy result,

725
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,560
we'll keep you informed.

726
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,920
Thanks.

727
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
What shall I do?

728
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,560
What now?

729
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,720
In the operating room,

730
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,880
you risked your life
to protect me again.

731
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,360
Tell me.

732
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,000
When I owe a girl my life twice,

733
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,480
how shall I repay her?

734
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,120
I didn't. Don't overthink it.

735
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,840
You defended me in front of a gun.

736
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,560
I have to overthink it.

737
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,560
Just now,

738
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,720
you told the representative
of the Health Commission

739
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,040
that I was your idol

740
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,680
and you would die for me.

741
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,320
(Idol?)

742
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
I understood that.

743
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,840
And I was very moved.

744
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,080
When did I say something like that?

745
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Don't pretend you understand.

746
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,040
You didn't?

747
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,880
Maybe I heard what your heart said.

748
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,040
Su Wei'an.

749
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,160
Never

750
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,240
joke with your life again.

751
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,160
You can't risk your own life.

752
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,120
Not even for me.

753
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,160
When you're alive,

754
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,200
you can save more people.

755
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
It's worth it
to exchange my life for yours.

756
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,720
I told you.

757
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,560
Never say this again.

758
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,400
Nobody's life

759
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,240
can be more valuable
than someone else's.

760
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,560
Wait a minute.

761
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,120
What? Know you were wrong?

762
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,320
Didn't you just say

763
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,440
you didn't know how to repay me?

764
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Give me a pay rise.

765
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,920
Su Wei'an!

766
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,400
Money speaks louder than death, huh?

767
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,280
Do you know that man

768
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,160
didn't even thumb off the safety catch?
