Tastes great.

00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,460
It depends on the growth of the tumor.

Maybe...

71
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,580

108
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,500
can be ceremonial.

109
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,740
I heard about a custom in Lacaya.

110

113
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,060
What custom?

114
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,660
You must have read
too many romantic novels.

You have to believe it.

116
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,020
When in Lacaya, do as local people do.

117
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,580
Even if it's Dr. Gu
who stands beside me tonight,

118

You're way too handsome.

130
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,700
I have to stand far away from you.

131
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,300

132
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,940

164
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,180
Actually, this experiment

165

has secretly restarted recently.

166
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,260
Really?

167
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Has she solved the key problem

168
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,900
of increasing the survival rate?

169
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,220
Which cells are used for the experiment,

170
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,260
autologous or nurtured?

171
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,740
Is it in a clinical trial?

172
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,580
Has she started to recruit volunteers?

173
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,940
Easy, easy.

174
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,620
Your questions nearly blow my head up.

175
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,380
Su,

176
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,660
I guessed you would be interested.

177
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,380
But to my surprise,

178
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,020
you know so much
about the experimental details

179
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
of such a rare disease.

180
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,820
Su,

181
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,020
when talking seriously about medicine,

182
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,660
you're charming.

183
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,980
I adore you more.

184
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,340
Adore?

185
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,100
Don't be kidding.

186
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,580
I'm not kidding.

187
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,300
You're gorgeous,
but you don't know that.

384
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,440
I had my friends ask around

385
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
in medical schools in Paris.

386
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
There isn't a student named Su Wei'an.

387
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,680
Her mother said
she was studying in Paris.

388
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,040
Ask more around, please.

389
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Is it possible

390
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,720
that she's in a poor college?

391
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,840
No way.

392
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,880
She's a top student.

393
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,480
She must be in a first-rate college.

394
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,680
Fine. I'll try harder, then.

Hello, Prof. Wen.

I'm Du Yuncheng

You know me?

403
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
My daughter talked about you.

on behalf of Jiehui Medicines Company,

408
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,880
I want to talk
about restarting the research of HDQ39,

409
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,960
a new medicine for Huntington's Disease.

410
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,680

00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960

You have to know Huntington's Disease

413
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,120
is a very rare disease in the world.

Where's Su Wei'an? Why isn't she here?

453
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,160

00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,720
Last night?

457
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,920
Go get Su Wei'an here.

458
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,160
Get her to outpatient service.

459
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,960
But it's not her shift today.

Then go get Jiang Muying here.

00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,400
Hey, Su.

He came to Miss Su so soon.

What did he just say, chouchou?

00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Who's he calling?

482
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,520
In French, chouchou means

507
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,140
I'll go back to Paris next month.

508

Are you willing
to visit the Henri Mondor Lab?

509
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,340
You mean you will take me
to visit Dr. Marta?

00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,420
Not just to pay a visit,

511
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,740
I mean, are you willing

512
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,860
to work at the Henri Mondor Lab?

513
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,100
Really?

514
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,340
You can work for Dr. Marta.

to come to Paris with me?

from a medical university in China.

Am I eligible?

520

from Huaren Medical University.

522
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,980
Our lab once had a research assistant

523
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,020
with an undergraduate degree.

524
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,300

That's great.

526

But you have to be well-prepared.

527
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,780
Chorea is very rare,

528
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,380
and it will take much time
to develop new medicines for it.

529
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,620
Maybe

530
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,940
you'll have to be in Paris for years.

531
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,820
No problem.

532
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,100

during work hours?

536
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,740
Didn't I ever tell you

537
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,500
the consequence
of absence without leave?

540
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,420
And Jiang can handle it
all on her own now.

541
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,020
Well, she's not bad.

542

Except for interpreting
intracranial aneurysm

543
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,980
into skull base tumors

544
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,740
and cerebral AVM
into cerebral artery adhesion,

545
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,700
she's doing well.

546
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,420
At least,

547
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,260
she's more reliable than someone

548
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,780
who dates during work hours.

549
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,980
Who are you satirizing?

550
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,660
Who dates during work hours?

551
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,540

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,980
the French

553
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,100
are usually pursuing
romance and freshness.

554
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,420
They're always ready to say sweet words.

555
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,740
You can't take it seriously.

556
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,420
I just want to warn you:

557
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,260
don't rush into love affairs blindly,

558
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,140
or you may get disappointed
and ruin your work.

559
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,980
Don't worry, Mr. Gu.

560
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,260
I'm just a temporary interpreter

561
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,180
and won't create any bad influence

562
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,500
on your medical team.

563
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,860
I didn't mean it that way.

564
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,340
That's what I meant.

565
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,580
And it won't happen again.

566
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,980
I want to resign.

567
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
Resign?

568
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,260
Su Wei'an,

569
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,460
it's just a slight criticism.

570
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,340
You don't have
to resign out of ill temper.

571
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,700
I'm not showing an ill temper.

572
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,740
I've been thinking about it.

573
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,860
Is it because of that kiss?

574
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,180
I...

575
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,860
Don't take it too seriously.

576
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,740
That kiss

577
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,620
was just part
of a local New Year custom.

578
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,660
And at the time,

579
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,980
you were right next to me.

580
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,980
Don't take it seriously.

581
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,980
You don't need to explain it to me.

582
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,300
It was just a kiss.

583
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,300
I won't certainly take it seriously.

584
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,340
Then,

585
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,260
why do you have to quit your job?

586
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,700
Because of money.

587
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,740
I found a more profitable job.

588
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,740
I'm leaving for Paris.

589
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,740
So,

590
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,420
don't get in my way of making money.

591
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,680
♪It's okay if you forget it♪

592
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,200
♪It's you who gave me the courage♪

593
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,160
♪To enjoy the scenery
I will never reach♪

594
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,640
♪I'll bless you♪

595
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,240
♪It's okay if you forget it♪

596
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,800
♪It's me who saved myself♪

597
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,280
♪I've always loved you♪

598
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,760
♪And never gaven up♪

599
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,380
You're going to France?

600
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,060
It happened so suddenly.

601
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,580
I've got a big business chance recently,

602
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,660
so I have to

603
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,620
go to Paris.

604
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,220
It's okay.

605
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,980
Take me with you wherever you go,

606
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,740
will you?

607
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,660
Jiang,

608
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,180
there's nothing good to stay with me.

609
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,140
And you're not short of money, anyway.

610
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,860
Do me a favor and go home early.

611
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,500
No.

612
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,660
I've come all this way to find you.

613
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,340
You can't just leave me behind again.

614
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,700
Never ever.

615
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,740
And I've never been to Paris.

616
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,980
Why not just take me with you?

617
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,980
Are you going to leave without me again?

618
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,380
I'm telling you, that's impossible.

619
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,780
I didn't realize it three years ago,

620
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,700
but I won't let you go

621
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,660
without me this time.

622
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,500
Otherwise, tell me,

623
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,980
why are you leaving, where
and how long are you going?

624
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:52,860
And

625
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,980
why did you suddenly quit school?

626
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,100
Why did you give up your dream
to be a doctor?

627
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,700
Explain all this to me.

628
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,740
I...

629
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,980
I'm going to run off with Eliot.

630
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,260
Really?

631
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,980
Yes.

632
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,340
So, you can't come with me, Jiang.

633
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,060
You're going to run off with Eliot?

634
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,180
Su Wei'an,

635
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,340
you like Gu Yunzheng.

636
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,260
You can hide it from others,

637
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,300
but you can't hide it from me.

638
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,060
Haven't you been into him
since our schooldays?

639
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,060
And you kissed each other
at the New Year party.

640
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,740
Now you're telling me

641
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,700
you're going to run off

642
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,980
with a Frenchman
you've only met a few times?

643
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,700
Su Wei'an,

644
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,180
I'm not really stupid.

645
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,540
Jiang,

646
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,660
that kiss between me and Gu Yunzheng

647
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,100
was just part of the New Year custom.

648
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,900
It didn't have any special meaning.

649
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,100
But I fell in love
with Eliot at first sight.

650
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,780
He's my Mr. Right.

651
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,740
I'm going to France with him.

652
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,300
And you know,

653
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,260
love is unfair.

654
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,060
It doesn't care who came first.

655
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,540
What are you doing?

656
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,020
This.

657
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,340
Explain to me what this is.

658
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,700
Why are you learning about euthanasia?

659
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,180
It's a favor someone asked me to do.

660
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,020
And he promised
to give me a high reward.

661
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,340
It's really a high reward,

662
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,180
so I kept it till now.

663
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,260
I'm not going to seek euthanasia, okay?

664
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,660
I'm really fine.

665
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,820
Su Wei'an,

666
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,340
there's not a word of truth
out of your mouth.

667
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,100
Do you even consider me a friend?

668
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,260
Yes, I do.

669
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,780
Wei'an,

670
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,980
no matter what happened to you,

671
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,140
no matter what your secret sorrow is,

672
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,740
you can always share it with me.

673
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,860
I know you can't share everything
with your mom,

674
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,700
but you can share it with me.

675
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,100
I'll definitely keep your secret.

676
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,660
Really.

677
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,700
You know,

678
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,980
I've been in Lacaya for so long,

679
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,740
but I've never told Lan
anything about you.

680
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,940
I'm very reliable.

681
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,260
And we're such close friends,

682
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,380
just like family members.

683
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,980
I can share your burden.

684
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,060
But Jiang, I...

685
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,620
I really didn't lie to you.

686
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,380
I'm going to run off with Eliot.

687
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,540
Really.

688
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,380
Besides,

689
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,660
you also wish me to meet my love, right?

690
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,020
That rose crystal in my bag

691
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,300
is from you, right?

692
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,340
Trust me, Jiang.

693
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,540
Are you determined
to hide the truth from me

694
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,740
even though you're leaving for France?

695
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,500
Okay.

696
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,860
If you dare to leave this time,
I'll break up with you.

697
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,580
I don't have a sister like you.

698
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,460
Jiang.

699
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,860
I want to resign.

700
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,460
Resign?

701
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,100
Is it because of that kiss?

702
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,980
Don't take it too seriously.

703
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,820
That kiss

704
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,300
was just part
of a local New Year custom.

705
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,860
And at the time,
you were right next to me.

706
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,340
Don't take it seriously.

707
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,260
You don't need to explain it to me.

708
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,540
It was just a kiss.

709
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,340
French people regard a kiss

710
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,340
as normal as biting or supping.

711
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,060
I won't certainly take it seriously.

712
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,220
(Gu Yunzheng)

713
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,900
(You're a nice person,)

714
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,620
(but how could you say those words?)

715
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:26,360
[Friendship Hospital]

716
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:56,580
Su Wei'an,

717
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,500
have you had breakfast?

718
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,500
No, that's too stiff.

719
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,100
Su Wei'an,

720
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,540
here are small sweet dumplings
from the dining hall.

721
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,900
They're sweet and sticky.

722
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,500
I bought them for you.

723
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,540
Yesterday,

724
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,700
I didn't mean it.

725
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,820
In fact, I...

726
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:26,940
No,

727
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,860
I'm being too wordy.

728
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,220
Su Wei'an,

729
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,340
let's have breakfast together.

730
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,900
Dr. Gu has excellent medical skills.

731
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,380
You can totally trust him.

732
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,740
At Huaren Hospital in China,

733
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,340
he's the youngest
associate chief physician.

734
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,020
Although he looks quite serious

735
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,100
and gives you a sense of distance,

736
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,780
he takes every patient

737
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,100
to his heart.

738
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,100
So, don't worry,

739
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,220
we'll do the operation well.

740
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,860
Well, Su Wei'an.

741
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,740
You're so aggressive in front of me,

742
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,980
but you praise me behind my back.

743
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,180
That's how you are.

744
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,140
Su Wei'an.

745
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,460
Dr. Gu.

746
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,100
I was on my way to see you.

747
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,780
This...

748
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,340
[Resignation Letter]
This is my resignation letter.

749
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,740
Although it's just a temporary job,

750
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,260
I think it's better
to treat it formally.

751
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,420
Thanks for your caring all this time.

752
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,500
I hope you find a qualified interpreter

753
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,460
as soon as possible.

754
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,780
Su Wei'an,

755
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,100
you speak good French,

756
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,340
and you have a medical background.

757
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,980
To find an interpreter like you

758
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,340
in a short time,

759
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,860
that can't be an easy task.

760
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,620
If...

761
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,700
you just want to make more money,

762
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,100
you don't have to go to France,

763
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,100
and I can give you a raise.

764
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,420
I don't need that.

765
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,340
It's not all about money.

766
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,780
Then, give me a reason

767
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,340
that can satisfy me.

768
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,340
Why are you giving up once again?

769
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,780
Explain it to me.

770
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,060
If it's not about money,

771
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,700
then is it about a person?

772
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,090
Are you really fond of Eliot?

773
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,130
Are you leaving for him?

774
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,060
I'll be off if there's nothing else.

775
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,140
I have to visit the embassy
to get an expedited visa.

776
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,700
According to our contract,

777
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,660
you need to apply for resignation
one week in advance,

778
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,340
and you can't leave until one week
after the date of application.

779
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,140
During this period,

780
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,940
be on your duty as usual.

781
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,100
Absence from duty

782
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,020
will lead to a deduction of salary.
