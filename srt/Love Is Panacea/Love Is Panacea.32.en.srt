18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,840
Mom, look at my drawing, is it good?

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,280
Great job, Yunzheng!

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,960
Look, Mom, I also drew a giraffe,

21
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,840
a panda, and a monkey.

22
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,720
And the elephant I drew with you.

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,120
You almost drew an entire zoo.

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,880
Mr. Gu,

25
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,480
this house is so well-kept.

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,960
I'll get you a good price for sure.

27
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,360
I'd like to ask

28
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,720
about those decoration services

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,480

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,040
move the entire wall.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,880
Move the entire wall?

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,480
Mr. Du,

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,040
although Dr. He brought us

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,880
Gu Yunzheng's research scheme,

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,280
after all these years,

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,160
we've made no breakthrough

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,840
with the blood-brain barrier.

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,120
I pay him a million a year,

39
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,640
but he's produced nothing.

40
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,840
I'm out of patience with him.

41
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,720
What progress has Gu Yunzheng made?

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,280
I hear they're short on funds,

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,680
and their project hits a bottleneck.

44
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
So you don't need to worry.

45
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,840
We can't just sit around.

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,560
We must start clinical trials now.

47
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,840
I'll push Dr. He

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,920
to quicken the pace.

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,920
Tell him,

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,160
our company doesn't keep idlers.

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,800
If he keeps producing nothing,

52
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,160
we'll send him packing.

53
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,920
Got it.

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,120
I've revised your report data.

55
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,000
Prepare the new drug application

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,120
and apply for Phase I clinical trials.

57
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,520
Our HDQ40

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,240
still can't penetrate
the blood-brain barrier.

59
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,880
Now is really not the time

60
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,240
to go into clinical trials.

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,640
Just because you're incompetent

62
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,520
doesn't mean others are.

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,920
What do you mean by that?

64
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,720
The drug is ready.

65
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,720
Just copy this.

66
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,960
Copy?

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,560
I know this drug.

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,880
It's made
with banned genetic techniques.

69
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,880
It's prohibited for sale.

70
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,200
Where did you get this?

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,160
Just do what I tell you.

72
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,720
Stop asking questions.

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,360
Mr. Du, I must remind you,

74
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,280
such techniques can easily
cause off-target effects

75
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,480
and mutations.

76
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,800
What's more, copying a banned drug

77
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,720
is illegal.

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,640
We'll be prisoned.

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,270
You think I don't know that?

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,270
If you were any good,

81
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,040
would I have to step in?

82
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,880
I can understand you,

83
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,760
but trust me, give me more time...

84
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,960
Don't talk to me about trust.

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,840
I only ask you one question:

86
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,240
Can you do it or not?

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,160
If you can't,

88
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,760
leave my company right now.

89
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
Du Yuncheng,

90
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,960
don't forget
that I brought this project to you,

91
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
and I'm in charge of the project.

92
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,200
Asking me to leave?

93
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,760
Are you joking?

94
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,840
How dare you say

95
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,800
that you're in charge of the project?

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,600
The project was copied from Gu Yunzheng,

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
and the team was built by me.

98
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,840
What are you in charge of?

99
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,960
Your ability in this team

100
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,160
is insignificant.

101
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,360
Don't go too far!

102
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,040
I've been dedicated
to my job these years.

103
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,960
I at least deserve credit
for my efforts.

104
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,920
What are you up to?

105
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,800
Are you burning the bridge
after crossing it?

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,440
He Xiaoguang, stop talking nonsense.

107
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,600
You're just a hopeless case.

108
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,600
I shouldn't have taken you in.

109
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,280
If you weren't incompetent,

110
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,120
I wouldn't lose to Gu Yunzheng.

111
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,440
Teacher He,

112
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,200
what was happening?

113
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,560
All of a sudden,

114
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,680
why did Yuncheng fire you?

115
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,600
All of a sudden...

116
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,880
Wen Ran,

117
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Du Yuncheng's lost his mind.

118
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,480
All he wants is to beat Gu Yunzheng.

119
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,680
He even asked me

120
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,600
to copy an unlicensed foreign drug.

121
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,280
What?

122
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,440
Don't make accusations without proof.

123
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,760
Copying banned drugs
is risking a jail sentence.

124
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,240
Du Yuncheng isn't the senior

125
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,840
you knew at Huaren anymore.

126
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,560
He dared to take any risk now.

127
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,280
Yuncheng...

128
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
That's impossible.

129
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,000
There must be some misunderstanding.

130
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,920
Yuncheng told me

131
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
the new drug is an upgrade of HDQ39.

132
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,400
It can't be a copy.

133
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Child,

134
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,920
wake up.

135
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,120
Take my advice:

136
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,880
don't get involved,

137
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,760
or Du Yuncheng will drag you

138
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,120
down with him.

139
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,400
Got it?

140
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
While I was dining with Director Xu

141
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,760
and his wife today,

142
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,160
I saw her carrying

143
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,400
a Birkin bag of elephant grey.

144
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,360
I think it fits you well.

145
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,760
I've asked Assistant Lin
to order one for you.

146
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,440
Yuncheng, you're so nice to me.

147
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,480
You've been working hard lately.

148
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,560
Next week, take a trip
to Sanya with your parents.

149
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,720
I'll ask Assistant Lin

150
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,440
to book the hotel and flights.

151
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,240
You're so thoughtful.

152
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,120
I haven't taken my parents out
for quite a while.

153
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,840
Won't you come with us?

154
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,800
I have too much to handle
at the company.

155
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,360
I can't leave.

156
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,400
By the way, Yuncheng,

157
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,480
since the company
is in need of staffers,

158
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,360
why did you fire Teacher He?

159
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,880
That useless bum

160
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
has been freeloading for years

161
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,280
and produced nothing in animal testing.

162
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,640
I've been wanting to fire him.

163
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,040
Why don't we copy some foreign drug?

164
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,800
That's illegal.

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
Do you want me to end up in jail?

166
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,960
Sorry, Yuncheng.

167
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,360
I was just thinking

168
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,080
about how I could help with something.

169
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,320
Yuncheng,

170
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,440
it's late.

171
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,960
Let's go to bed.

172
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,550
Go ahead.

173
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,030
I still have work to do.

174
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,920
And the trip,

175
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,920
you can think about it.

176
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,320
We only need twenty participants
for the Phase I clinical trial.

177
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Why is it taking so long

178
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,040
to find just fifteen?

179
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,840
Mr. Du,

180
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,360
convincing patients
of clinical trials isn't easy.

181
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,960
Offer them a sum they can't refuse!

182
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,040
We've clearly got a cure,

183
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,880
why no volunteers?

184
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,520
All the patients participated

185
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,360
in the HDQ39 trial before,

186
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,720
except for those unfit for the trial,

187
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,880
most of the others

188
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,000
suffered negative effects from HDQ39.

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,360
They won't take more risks.

190
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,240
Risk?

191
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,720
What is the risk?

192
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,920
I'm saving them, not harming them!

193
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,880
Did you explain

194
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
the new drug's difference to them?

195
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,640
I did,

196
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,920
but they're still unwilling.

197
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,320
Then find someone else.

198
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,560
Should I teach you that?

199
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,640
Huntington's is a rare disease,

200
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,200
we have few patients.

201
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,480
No more excuses!

202
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,440
Search the whole planet

203
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,840
and get me twenty participants!

204
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,400
Go!

205
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,800
Hello?

206
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Are you Mr. Du?

207
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,120
I'm Jing, Su Yuan's carer.

208
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,000
Why have you restrained her?

209
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,920
It was Su Yuan's own request.

210
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,800
You said on the phone

211
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,360
she wants euthanasia in Switzerland?

212
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,560
Yes.

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Since Miss Su visited her

214
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,800
and stopped her from taking medication,

215
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,720
she's mentioned it several times.

216
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,640
This morning,
she compelled me to call you,

217
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,800
saying only you can help her.

218
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,000
About that,

219
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
Wei'an and her mother.

220
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It looks like they don't know yet,
right?

221
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,360
Yes, I know.

222
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,760
But I'm in urgent need of money.

223
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,280
Did you ask how soon
it can be withdrawn?

224
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,360
Will it take so long?

225
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,640
Alright.

226
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,920
Thank you.

227
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,920
Wei'an,

228
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,760
What's wrong?

229
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,640
Nothing.

230
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,640
Isn't there a financial product crisis?

231
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,360
I want to withdraw my money

232
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,280
to put in the bank.

233
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,000
Be honest with me,

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,880
you promised never to lie to me.

235
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,280
We're starting clinical trials

236
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,760
and urgently need funds.

237
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,520
We still have no investor.

238
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,120
Wait a moment.

239
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,520
Wei'an,

240
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,400
you own the house,

241
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,800
it's up to you.

242
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,640
Here are my savings certificates.

243
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,160
My savings book.

244
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,280
I don't need these,

245
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,160
take them.

246
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
[Balance: CNY 1,500,000.00]

247
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,920
But, mom,

248
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,640
how do you have so much money?

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,120
Because I have a capable daughter.

250
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,040
The money you gave me,

251
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
I never spent it.

252
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,360
And I saved it all for you.

253
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,280
That's not right.

254
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,040
You're usually a big spender:

255
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,680
new clothes, bags,

256
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,640
even travel.

257
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,680
My travel,

258
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,800
that's exploiting
travel sites' promotions.

259
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,120
Ninety-nine yuan for four places,

260
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,520
even with a pick-up service.
It's impressive, right?

261
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,840
And the clothes and bags are called...

262
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,280
high-end custom.

263
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,760
Are they fakes?

264
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
You couldn't tell,

265
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,640
did you?

266
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,400
It's all about the temperament, right?

267
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,480
Mom,

268
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,760
you don't have to be so frugal.

269
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,520
Silly girl,

270
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,280
we need to use the money
where it's needed,

271
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,000
right?

272
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,560
See, I've saved up all this money,

273
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,920
and it comes in handy now,

274
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Isn't that great?

275
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,240
No,

276
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
I can't take this money.

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,280
This money is for you.

278
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,520
If you didn't use it,

279
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,680
then keep it as retirement money.

280
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,160
Don't be silly.

281
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,800
The new drug is your hope,

282
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,160
and it's mine too.

283
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Once you get the drug to market,

284
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,440
I don't mind
even if I have to sleep on the streets.

285
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Take it.

286
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,640
Thank you, Mom.

287
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,920
With you here,

288
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,040
I fear nothing.

289
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,280
Right.

290
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,040
Take it.

291
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Eat more meat.

292
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,920
I spaced out just now.

293
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,040
My hands are still under control.

294
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,440
I knew

295
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,200
you couldn't have Parkinson's

296
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,520
in your early thirties.

297
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,280
Want to make a breakthrough

298
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,560
on Parkinson's as well?

299
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,440
I'm afraid
I can't give you that opportunity.

300
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,820
[Real Estate Agent]

301
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,000
Hello?

302
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,800
Sir, a buyer is interested
in your house,

303
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,040
but he's asking

304
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,520
for a discount of 300,000,

305
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,400
and he'll pay in full right away.

306
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,560
Okay.

307
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,680
No problem. Alright.

308
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,800
Who was on the phone?

309
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,640
That was Mr. Wang
from Lingxian Medicine Company.

310
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,280
He just told me

311
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,040
that our project

312
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,520
had been approved by them internally.

313
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,760
That's great.

314
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,280
Then we're going to have money.

315
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,400
You don't know.

316
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,680
I was considering cashing

317
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,040
out my insurance.

318
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,760
My mom is even more radical.

319
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,840
She even took out her savings

320
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,680
and property deeds.

321
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,560
Wei'an,

322
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,800
stop your mom from doing that.

323
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
Look,

324
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,080
we're going to have money.

325
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,560
To celebrate us having money,

326
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,760
I'll do the dishes tonight.

327
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,880
Just enjoy your meal.

328
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,680
Let me do the dishes.

329
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,920
Eat some meat.

330
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,440
Sun,

331
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,640
as usual,

332
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,800
make sure to clean thoroughly.

333
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,640
About the items,

334
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,520
don't move anything,

335
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,240
keep them where they are.

336
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,560
Got it, master.

337
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,400
Just rest assured.

338
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,680
You're so considerate.

339
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,920
Even without your son's wife here,

340
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,400
you keep the house tidy.

341
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,440
Why is the door open?

342
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,200
Yeah.

343
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,080
Who are you?

344
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,440
How do you have the keys to this house?

345
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,800
Hello, sir. Are you...

346
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,080
I'm the grandfather of the house owner.

347
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,760
You're Mr. Gu's grandfather?

348
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,760
Hello.

349
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,800
We've been entrusted by Mr. Gu

350
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,280
to sell this house.

351
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,040
These customers are here viewing it.

352
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,080
Sell it?

353
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,640
Why would he sell the house?

354
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,560
I'm not sure about the details.

355
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,400
I just know he's eager to sell it.

356
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,040
For a specific reason,

357
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,560
you'd better ask him directly.

358
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,280
Wang,

359
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,680
has Yunzheng been up to anything lately?

360
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,520
My precious grandson is

361
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,080
not as good as mine.

362
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
Such a big investor is here,

363
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,200
and he just doesn't notice.

364
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Master,

365
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,880
I've negotiated with the buyer.

366
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,000
Your potted plants

367
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,080
will be kept in the old house

368
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,440
until the countryside house is ready,

369
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,680
then they'll be moved there
along with the furniture.

370
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,070
Okay. Let's go.

371
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,800
Let my grandson and his girlfriend

372
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,000
see their investor grandpa.

373
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,560
Coming.

374
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,560
Please open the door.

375
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,040
Grandpa!

376
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,280
Auntie Sun!

377
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,920
Why are you here?

378
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,200
Are we not welcome, boy?

379
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,520
Welcome, welcome!

380
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,160
Give it to me, grandpa.

381
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,680
Master, your luggage is here.

382
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,560
I'll head back now.

383
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,080
Thank you.

384
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,680
My pleasure.

385
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,880
Hello, grandpa.

386
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,800
Grandpa, why did you bring your luggage?

387
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,160
Well,

388
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
I sold the old house

389
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,880
and bought a new one in the countryside.

390
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,280
Grandpa,

391
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,760
how could you sell the old house?

392
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,280
You've lived there for decades.

393
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,040
I solemnly announce

394
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,440
I am the biggest investor

395
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,800
in your project.

396
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,560
Since I'm investing in a big project,

397
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,800
selling a house isn't a big deal.

398
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
It's just an old house,

399
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,280
I can't take it with me.

400
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,280
Grandpa,

401
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,520
even if you are selling the house,

402
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
you should've discussed it
with me first.

403
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,440
What does that have to do with you?

404
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,800
I've given the money to Wang.

405
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,640
It should help you for several years.

406
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,800
You have to work hard

407
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,880
to get results,

408
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,520
so grandpa's money isn't wasted.

409
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,320
Got it?

410
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,280
Grandpa...

411
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
Don't be so formal.

412
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,880
Go get grandpa some hot tea.

413
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,160
Right away.

414
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,920
Zheng,

415
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
which room am I going to stay in?

416
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,640
Since you've moved here,

417
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,480
you have to stay in the main bedroom.

418
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,560
And clear a closet for me to hang suits.

419
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,320
No problem.

420
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,480
You're awake.

421
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,880
Why didn't you wake me?

422
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,520
I didn't want to disturb you.

423
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,640
It's just past six.

424
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,080
Did I squeeze you last night?

425
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,560
Yes.

426
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,480
I held on to you

427
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,040
so I didn't fall to the floor.

428
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,320
Yunzheng, Su, breakfast's ready!

429
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,800
Ignore him.

430
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,120
Hurry up.

431
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,880
I cooked it myself,

432
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,280
I'll let you replenish your bodies well.

433
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,200
Coming!

434
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,840
Here you are!

435
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,480
Nutritious breakfast.

436
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,520
Thank you, grandpa.

437
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,880
Here's brown rice porridge
with black soybeans,

438
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,040
this is

439
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,840
a soup with red dates and lotus nuts,

440
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,240
and this is a pigeon soup.

441
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,120
All is very nourishing.

442
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,120
Is this pigeon soup, grandpa?

443
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,360
What did you add

444
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,480
to this pigeon soup?

445
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,520
Why does it smell so strange?

446
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,480
I added lingzhi and wild ginseng.

447
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,880
They're very nutritious.

448
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,040
I learned this especially from Aunt Sun.

449
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,240
Taste it.

450
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,440
- Su, drink it.
- Thank you, grandpa.

451
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,720
Taste and see how it is.

452
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,840
Grandpa,

453
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,240
you don't have to do all this.

454
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,600
Usually, in the morning,

455
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,200
we simply eat some buns.

456
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,960
Exactly.

457
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,280
And we can eat at the hospital canteen.

458
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,000
How can the food there

459
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,640
be as nutritious as mine?

460
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,600
Grandpa,

461
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,040
we appreciate your kindness,

462
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,240
but

463
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,840
is this some sort

464
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,240
of "dark cuisine"?

465
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,560
I understand now.

466
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,040
Grandpa is getting old.

467
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,600
Although I woke up early

468
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,520
to make you a nutritious breakfast,

469
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,480
you don't like it at all.

470
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,600
No.

471
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
We didn't mean that. I'm drinking.

472
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,360
Does it taste good?

473
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,000
Good, very good.

474
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,240
Here, try this jujube cake.

475
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,040
Okay.

476
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,520
Grandpa,

477
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,880
look, I'm drinking too.

478
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,760
Drink it.

479
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,600
It tastes good.

480
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,320
That's great.

481
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,360
I'll make you
a nutritious breakfast every day.

482
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,000
Auntie, I'm here to see you.

483
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,600
Please leave for now.

484
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,520
Auntie,

485
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,960
this is a new drug

486
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,720
our company developed

487
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
for Huntington's Disease.

488
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,480
I want it.

489
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,520
But Auntie,

490
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,120
with your current health situation,

491
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,560
you can't continue trying new drugs.

492
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,240
I quite understand

493
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,600
that compared to losing control

494
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,320
of your body,

495
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,560
you want relief, right?

496
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,640
Currently, this new drug

497
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,280
is seeking trial participants,

498
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,040
and we still need a few.

499
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,840
Auntie,

500
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,600
I'm not compelling you.

501
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,760
It's up to you.

502
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,840
Eat it.

503
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,600
Eat it, quickly.

504
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,280
Wei'an,

505
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,560
come on.

506
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,800
It's tasty.

507
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,520
Wei'an!

508
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,840
You're getting a nosebleed.

509
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,040
Grandpa,

510
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,160
you don't need to prepare

511
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,200
those nutritious breakfasts

512
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,040
for Wei'an anymore.

513
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,200
She's getting inflamed.

514
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,320
I used the best
and most expensive ingredients.

515
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,280
I wanted to replenish both of you,

516
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,520
not just Wei'an.

517
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,760
But you didn't eat any.

518
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,280
Luckily I didn't,

519
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,480
or I'd be the one suffering

520
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,600
from gum pain and a sick mouth and nose.

521
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Is it that serious?

522
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,280
Yes.

523
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,040
Grandpa, I know,

524
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,800
you did all this for Wei'an's good,

525
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,560
but you couldn't go overboard.

526
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,640
Those things

527
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,280
like goji, ginseng, dates, and longan,

528
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,480
eating them for a month,

529
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,560
whose body can stand it?

530
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,800
I went a bit overboard
with the ingredients this morning.

531
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,520
I was worried
I wouldn't have enough time.

532
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,800
Grandpa,

533
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,600
Wei'an is still far from becoming ill.

534
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,880
But if you keep going overboard
like this,

535
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,640
she'll get sick soon because of you.

536
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,240
I was worried
I wouldn't have enough time.

537
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,080
I'm getting old.

538
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,880
Who knows how many days are left for me?

539
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,640
I don't expect

540
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,840
to see four generations under one roof,

541
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,280
but at least,

542
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,560
I want to see

543
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,080
your dating reach the finish line.

544
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,640
What are you talking about?

545
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,840
You're still vigorous enough.

546
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,240
Your great-grandchild will need you
to look after.

547
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,280
You must let me take care of them.

548
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,000
I promise to raise them
to be a doctor of medicine.

549
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,480
By the way, grandpa,

550
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,480
if you move to the new house

551
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
in the countryside all of a sudden,

552
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,360
will you adapt to it?

553
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Don't worry,

554
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,840
the air quality there is good,

555
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,360
and it's suitable for gardening.

556
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,240
Focus on your business

557
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,280
and don't worry about it.

558
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,120
Remember,

559
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,560
get the drug to market asap,

560
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,520
and don't waste

561
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,200
the coffin reserve
of your biggest investor.

562
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,520
Are you sure
what you bought are oranges?

563
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,480
Don't they look more like lemons?

564
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,080
I'm home.

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,520
Huntington's is a rare disease,

00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,600
doesn't exceed 30,000 in the country.

730

And the failure of HDQ39 before

731

732

to participate

733
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,320

We had a few,

735
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,560
but because of the negative rumor

736

causing participant deaths,

737
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,760

00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,400
Let me see. Are you burned?

750
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,000
Su Wei'an,

751
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,000
you're finally smiling.

752
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,400
Now I know

753
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,000
that your happiness

754
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,080
is built upon my suffering.

755
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,840
How could you grab it in hot?

756
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,280
A surgeon's hands can't be injured,

757
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,600
don't you know that?

758
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,480
The wontons in this restaurant

759
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,320
need to be slurped
while they're steaming hot.

760
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,200
Don't believe me? Try it.

761
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,400
Hurry,

762
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,000
before it gets cold,

763
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,160
or my burnt hand will be for nothing.

764
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,080
How is it?

765
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,640
Did I lie to you?

766
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,080
I've been eating

767
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,880
at this place since I was young.

768
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,560
Drink it slowly.

769
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,520
If you eat something too hot,

770
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,680
the epithelial cells
of your esophagus will peel off.

771
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,400
Just tell me,

772
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,480
after taking that bite,

773
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,600
did it instantly

774
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,880
remove your fatigue

775
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,200
and give you a sense

776
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,200
of warm happiness deep in your heart?

777
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,960
Wei'an,

778
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,960
I'm analyzing the ingredients
of the drug

779
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,120
your aunt took.

780
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,040
I'll get the results soon.

781
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,080
If there's something wrong
with the drug,

782
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,800
Du Yuncheng won't get away with it.

783
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,880
Don't worry.

784
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,240
Let me feed you one?

785
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,560
Okay.

786
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,040
You're alright.

787
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,040
Hello,

788
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
I'm Dr. Gu Yunzheng
from Huaren Hospital.

789
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,400
This is a pamphlet for inviting patients

790
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,560
to participate in our drug trials.

791
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,720
Please take a look.

792
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,840
We don't need that. Please leave.

793
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,320
- Ms, please take a look at it.
- No. Please leave.
