Dr. Li, are you done eating?

19
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,140
If you are, I'll pay the bill.

20
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,340

But at the same time she's rejecting you.

It's you again.

121
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,220
Why did you follow me to Shen'gang City?
I'm having a conference here.

122
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,620
I'm here to study

123
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,940
and look for an opportunity
to collaborate across disciplines.

124
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,300
How did you know the hotel
I'm staying at?

125
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,260
I don't.

126
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,580
The hospital booked this hotel
for everyone.

127
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,140
I just reminded them

128
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,620
that they can book a few rooms together
so that they get a discount.

129
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,460
That means
we're destined for each other.

130
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,780
And we share common interests

131
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,220
and career paths.

132
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,060

133
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,100
we should try to make this work?

134
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,300
There's no "we".

135
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,540

139
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,260
and then naturally have a child,

140
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:04,900
that's okay.

141
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,900
We can skip over these mundane steps.

142
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,500
We should directly create a child
with excellent genes.

143
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,900
Create a child?

144
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,860
True,

145
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,100
ordinary people may not be able to

146
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,340
accept this idea.

147
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,980
But Dr. Gu, you and I are both doctors.

148
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,660
We understand clearly in our hearts

149
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,340
that all species are the same.

150
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
Only excellent genes
should be passed down.

151
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,100
As for love,

152
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,220
it's just a fig leaf humans invented

153
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,500
for the sake of reproducing offspring.

154
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,660
So do you believe

155
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,460
humans and animals are no different?

156
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,060
Mating and reproduction are instinctive?

157
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,500
Of course not.

158
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,690
Animal instincts are random.

159
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,650
But you are my

160
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,620
carefully selected target.

161
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,060
What meaning is there in reproducing

162
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,410
without emotion and love?

163
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,780
How can you say there's no love?

164
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,260
I have love!

165
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,860
Listen, some people love money,
some love lust.

166
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,340
And I just happen to
love your genes very much.

167
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,930
Therefore,

168
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,260
our two excellent genes

169
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,380
should combine.

170
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,780
Otherwise, it would be a crime
against human evolution.

171
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,940
Li Wantong,

172
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,020
I can't listen to another word you say.

173
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,260
Let me tell you once again:

174
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,660
there is no possibility
between you and me.

175
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,300

176
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,260

178
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,460

179
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,580
I'm here for the conference.

180
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,500
Where is Su Wei'an?

181
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,660
She...

182
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,940
Our study shows

183
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,220
that the activation of the bone
morphogenetic protein signaling pathway

184
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,500
drives a subset
of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma

185
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,180
to exit the stem cell state,

186
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,980
promotes cell differentiation,

187
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,300
as well as induces cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis.

00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
can I ask you a favor?

373
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,960
Can you help investigate

374
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,890
whether HDQ39

375
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,120
really induces aneurysms?

376
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,800
Su Wei'an,

377
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,160
why don't you look into it yourself?

378
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,840
I'm...

379
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,080
You're also a medical student.

380
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,800
Anything I can do,

381
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,360
you can do as well.

382
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm just an undergraduate.

383
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,600
I can't.

384
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,720
You haven't even tried.

385
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,280
How do you know?

386
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,440
Professor Lu also said

387
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,160
you have excellent
medical talents and gifts.

388
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,680
Why do you want to waste them?

389
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,680
I really can't do it.

390
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,640
You are more likely than me
to uncover the truth.

391
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,360
You are Gu Yunzheng!

392
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,560
But I'm not you.

393
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,480
Su Wei'an,

394
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,800
only you can resolve

395
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,520
your inner obstacles.

396
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,600
I don't have time.

397
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,000
I still need to take care of
my mom and my aunt.

398
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I still need to make money.

399
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,960
I've got a lot to do.

400
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,800
No, Su Wei'an.

401
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,640
You are afraid.

402
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,120
Back then in Lacaya,

403
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,520
didn't you already try recklessly

404
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,160
to follow Eliot to France

405
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,840
to participate in
medical research experiments?

406
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,640
How did you know?

407
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,920
Why could you do it then, but not now?

408
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,480
Because...

409
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,280
Because I was stubborn
and got my aunt into trouble.

410
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,600
Even if there is only
the slightest chance,

411
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,280
we should still try our best.

412
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,680
It's every medical student's instinct.

413
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,760
Su Wei'an,
you're not doing this for yourself.

414
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,080
Participating in the drug trial

415
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,680
was not just for my aunt's illness.

416
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,560
I also carry the chorea gene.

417
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,480
That's why I'm extra hopeful
that the HDQ39 will go to the market.

418
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,800
I'm not trustworthy,

419
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,920
and I don't deserve to
participate in medical research.

420
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,080
Su Wei'an, you're right.

421
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,880
You were extremely selfish
and despicable.

422
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,240
You knew participating in the drug trial

423
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,840
could potentially lead to
a serious aneurysm rupture.

424
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
But you still treated your aunt
like a guinea pig

425
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,760
and forced her to participate.

426
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,600
Is that right?

427
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,000
If you didn't do that,

428
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,640
then what exactly did you do wrong

429
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,880
that you are
tormenting yourself like this?

430
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,800
If it's not my fault,

431
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,080
then whose fault is it?

432
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,640
Every time I have the tiniest hope,

433
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,040
what I end up with is despair.

434
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,040
Why does misfortune have to befall me?

435
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,240
Such a rare disease
with low probability,

436
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,920
why did it strike my family

437
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,680
with precision

438
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,400
like lightning?

439
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,120
Why do cursed people like us

440
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,320
exist in this world?

441
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,960
Hello, Wei'an.

442
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,280
Yuncheng,

443
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,680
I decided not to go to Jiehui.

444
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,320
Why? Does the salary not satisfy you?

445
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,400
Regarding my aunt's aneurysm rupture,

446
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,600
I think Gu Yunzheng's speculation
may be right.

447
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,480
It is very likely

448
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,720
related to HDQ39.

449
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,400
As a patient's family member,

450
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,800
I should not have more
conflicts of interest with Jiehui.

451
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,880
It does not comply with regulations.

452
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,160
Also,

453
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,880
I'd like to ask you to help confirm
whether the drug trial team

454
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,800
has reported the relevant situation

455
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,680
to the Drug Trial Supervisory Department

456
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,960
and Ethics Committee.

457
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,080
They can decide if the drug trial
needs to be suspended

458
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,920
and whether the trial team

459
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,480
can conduct some research

460
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,720
to clarify if HDQ39

461
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,360
is related to aneurysm formation.

462
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,840
I see.

463
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,120
I respect your decision.

464
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,400
If you need any help from me later on,

465
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,640
just let me know.

466
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,080
Thank you, Yuncheng.

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,480

(Dr. Gu, I have a new target now.)

468
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,040

(won't make you treasured.)

(When you stop being so pushy)

478
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,600
(and act indifferent
towards her instead,)

479
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,600
(she'll be the one chasing you.)

(if you refuse to let me get close,)

(then I'll just keep
orbiting around you.)

487
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,560
about Su Wei'an's situation,

488
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,880
whatever you know, I know too.

489
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,160
I love her,

490
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,120
no matter the circumstances.

491
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,880
From the moment I fell for her,

492
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,520
I never thought of giving up.

493
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,840
So,

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,360
as long as Su Wei'an does love me back.

495
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,680
As long as
you really want what's best for her,

496
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,920

Hi, this is Su Wei'an.

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,680
Please send me the schedule

for the French conversation classes.

00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,920
It's fine to schedule more classes.

513
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,720
The price is what we agreed before,

514
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,960

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,560

Stop that!

Why aren't you going to

518
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,440
the French translator job I recommended?

519
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
One hundred thousand a month?

520
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,400
There's no such good thing.

521
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,800
There must be a scam.

522
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,080
Is the recruiter

523
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,480
male or female?

524
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,480
Male.

525
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,480
What's wrong with a male?

526
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,080
You...

527
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,440
You are being sexist.

528
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,560
You only translate for women?

529
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,360
Free lunches don't exist.

530
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,280

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,520
Hello, Dr. Gu.

533
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,800
Wei'an

534
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,640
doesn't believe it's true whatsoever.

535
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,280
Your idea doesn't seem to work.

536
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,440
Should I really do that?

537
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,240
Yes.

538
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,680
Yes, okay.

539
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,120
Let me tell you the truth.

540
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,120
This job

541
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,080
comes with conditions.

542
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,960
See? What did I say?

543
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,200
Come on.
Did you think I was going to harm you?

544
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,240
This is serious translation work.

545
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,880
It's going to be published
in The Lancet.

546
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,600
The Lancet?

547
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,160
Yeah.

548
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,040
That doesn't make sense.

549
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,120
If they can already publish
in such an authoritative journal,

550
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,440
why would they need
to find another translator?

551
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,800
Because the important task is urgent,
and the requirements are high.

552
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,120
The content of this job

553
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,800
is strictly confidential.

554
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,320
Plus they need to interview first

555
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,400
before they can hire someone.

556
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,640
That's why the pay is so high.

557
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,720
I think making money is one thing.

558
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,360
But more importantly,
it's the opportunity

559
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,240
to translate articles at this level.

560
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,720
When is the interview?

561
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
They said

562
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,040
you must first sign
this non-disclosure agreement

563
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,240
before they can arrange an interview.

564
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,520
Alright.

00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,320
I'll take this job.

00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,240
OK.

[Huaren Medical University]
[Diligent, Adopt, Veracity]

Hello, what's wrong?

570
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,320
Don't just stand at the gate. Go in!

571
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,560
The interview is about to start.

572
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,560
Jiang Muying, are you spying on me?

573
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,440
I know you the best.

574
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,560
Su Wei'an.

575
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,720
You only dropped out of school.

576
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,080
It's not like you dropped out of life.

577
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,920
Walk back in there
with your head held high.

578
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,640
I'll be waiting for your good news!

579
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,240
Alright.

580
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,920
The treatment of gliomas

581
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,640
is mainly surgical.

582
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,340
However, due to
the infiltrative growth of the tumor

583
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,640
and the lack of clear boundaries
between brain tissues,

584
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,440
it is difficult to resect it completely.

585
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,760
(Jiang Muying, you are doomed!)

586
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,320
That student who arrived right
before class was about to end!

587
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,320
You'll answer my last question.

588
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,000
Sorry, Sir.

589
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,440
I'm not from your class.

590
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,840
Miss Su Wei'an,

591
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
I know you.

592
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,040
Your name is on the list.

593
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,200
If you don't have the books,
you can borrow your classmate's.

594
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,480
If you can't answer the question,

595
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,080
you can just say you don't know.

596
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,600
At most, this shows
your insufficient learning ability,

597
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,120
but deceiving the teacher

598
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,040
shows your improper attitude.

599
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,920
Alright, Sir.

600
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,040
Please repeat your question.

601
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,400
In what way do

602
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,920
mutations in IDH occur?

603
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,120
In most cases,

604
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,400
they occur in
a mutually exclusive manner.

605
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,560
In gliomas,

606
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,840
mutations in IDH

607
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,920
have what kind of effect

608
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,040
on patient prognosis?

609
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,240
Mutations in IDH

610
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,440
can significantly improve

611
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,640
the median overall survival

612
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,440
of high-grade gliomas

613
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
and may predict

614
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,400
chemotherapy sensitivity in low-grade

615
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,480
and secondary high-grade tumors.

616
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,400
It is associated with
improved patient survival.

617
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,040
Very good.

618
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,240
Miss Su, your answer is perfect.

619
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,880
However, given that you arrived late,

620

from your usual grades.

00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,100
(Dr. Su, Researcher Su...)

741
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,860
[Temporary Work Permit Name: Su Wei'an]

742
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,580
(I wish someone could
call me those names.)

743
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,740
(Su Wei'an,)

744
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,020
(this is just a temporary work permit.)

745
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,180
(What are you all excited about?)

746
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,500
(The doctors said)

747
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,340
(you have no fate
with medicine in this lifetime.)

748
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,900
Why do I have to rush like this

749
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,140
for merely a temporary job?

750
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,740
Su Wei'an,

751
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,020
are you not feeling well?

752
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,420
No.

753
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,220
Thanks for your concern.

754
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,820
(When you stop being so pushy)

755
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,180
(and act indifferent
towards her instead,)

756
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,060
(she'll be the one chasing you.)

757
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,740
Are you trying to think of some excuses

758
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,020
to slack on work?

759
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,580
What? Do you regret it now?

760
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,780
It's not too late.

761
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,780
I can accept to be fired.

762
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,500
The lab is not a place

763
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,100
where you can come and go at will.

764
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,180
I didn't want to come!

765
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,420
You were forcing this on me, alright?

766
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,300
Then hurry up

767
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,420
and read through
all these project materials.

768
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,300
They will be helpful
for your translation work.

769
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,700
So you can refer to them.

770
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,940
Don't make me remind you
over and over again:

771
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,900
you can't afford the penalty
for breach of contract.

772
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,100
There will be a fine of 100 yuan
for each translation mistake.

773
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,780
And double fines if there are
more than five mistakes.

774
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,460
Understood?

775
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,460
(You don't know French.)

776
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,140
(How would you know
if there are mistakes?)

777
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,820
Even though I don't know French,

778
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,860
don't try to fool me.

779
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,220
These are all first-hand

780
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,580
materials from French labs.

781
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,020
If you get it wrong,

782
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,260
that would be irresponsible
to medical professionals.

783
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,300
(Do you live in my head?)

784
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,820
Alrighty.

785
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,460
But you can't cut back one penny

786
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,780
of the translation fee we agreed on.

787
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,220
Let me remind you:

788
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,500
you must clock in and out

789
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,860
on your work schedule

790
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,900
when commuting every day.

791
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,020
A fine of 100 yuan
for arriving late or leaving early.

792
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,060
A fine of 500 yuan for a day's absence.

793
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,330
No eating or drinking
in the experimental operation area.

794
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,570
If I find out once,
you'll be fined 100 yuan.

795
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,180
Do not touch experimental equipment
or specimens randomly.

796
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,700
If you damage them,
you must compensate at full price.

797
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,540
For other violations,

798
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:37,140
further fines will be determined
based on the severity of circumstances.

799
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,740
Su Wei'an,

800
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,020
many people covet

801
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,780
your current position.

802
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,620
Do not embarrass me.

803
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,020
Stupid fines.

804
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,500
All you care about is money.

805
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,900
Cheapskate.
