00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,360
So I get reprimanded more than others.

189
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,280
Come on.

190
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
You should not sit

191
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,320
in front of the computer now.

192
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,200
Over-fatigue is not good for you.

193
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,880
Have a bath and sleep.

194
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,680
No, I haven't memorized the report yet.

195
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,880
You sleep.

196
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,520
Or don't blame me

197
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,720
when I fail the report.

198
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,880
What did you just say?

199
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,880
I sleep alone?

200
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,480
I don't know if you are a great student,

201
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,760
but absolutely a beloved one.

202
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,400
Come on, Wei'an.

203
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,160
Tomorrow,

204
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,480
I'll train you systematically.

205
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,680
Now,

206
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,920
have a bath and sleep.

207
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,120
Let's go.

209
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,080
For the champion
of the world public speaking tournament,

210
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,280
the secret is

211
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,600
to practice until it is perfect.

212
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,800
Su Wei'an,

213
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,600
let's start practising.

214
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,320
Take your notes.

215
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Gene therapy

216
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
can thoroughly cure

217
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,000
the genetic disease caused
by a single gene.

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,600
Or, by adjusting the malfunction...

219
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,320
Stop.

220
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,880
You can't just recite the speech

221
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,680
like a machine.

222
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,280
You should include your logic

223
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,480
and your ideas.

224
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,080
Give the speech with emotion and
passion.

Stop.

233
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,680
Too much body language.

234
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,160
This will only distract your listeners.

of the accumulation
of incorrect-folding protein

Stop.

00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
just speak Chinese.

246
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,720
Stop.

247
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,640
Stop.

248
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,880
Stop.

249
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,520
Stop.

250
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm tired.

251
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,400
Okay.

252
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,280
Half-time break.

253
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,160
Let me take you

254
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600

255
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,920
Where?

256
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,600
Why take me to the store?

257
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,080
I'd rather recite

258
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,960
some more words.

259
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,000
To attend such conferences,

260
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,680
formal clothes are needed.

261
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,960
Do you have formal clothes?

262
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,320
Your dress

263
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,800
reflects the image of our whole team.

264
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
You can't be too careful.

265
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,480
Good.

266
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,360
This is good. Take this one.

267
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,360
This is really good.

268
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,080
But as for the trousers,

269
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,880
aren't they a little short?

270
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
It's okay.

271
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,480
You'll stand behind the podium.

272
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,520
They won't see your legs.

273
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,120
That's even better
if they won't see my legs.

274
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,360
I think they're too short.

275
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,920
Shorts aren't that long.

276
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,320
This one it is.

277
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,520
Okay, take this one.

278
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,680

279
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,760
when we get married in the future,

280
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,720
I'll pick a long wedding dress.

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,080

the devil is willing to work for you.

285
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,560
What's wrong Wei'an?

286
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,800
When you cried to be my girlfriend,

287
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,400
didn't you wish to marry me?

288
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,280
Forget it.

289
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,560
I don't want you
to lose your wife early.

290
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,720
Su Wei'an,

291
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,280
are you not confident of me?

292
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,560
I'm very confident of you.

293
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,240
As excellent as you are,

294
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,440
you'll draw the attention of girls

00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,480
no matter how old you are.

296
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,560
What on earth are you thinking

297
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,480
inside your cute head?

298
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,720
What I mean is

299
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,880
that we'll succeed
in our drug research in the future.

307
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,280
My friend,

308
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,320
please share your experiences
with us first.

309
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,720
I bought a dumbbell for my mum

310
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,120
to help her exercise her muscles.

311
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,680
One day,

312
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,200
she swang wildly and even broke the TV.

313
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,280
I told her that it's okay.

314
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
We'll buy a new one.

315
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,760
My father said,

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,120
"She'll break the new one again."

317
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,360
From then on,

318
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,520
we've never watched TV.

319
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,480
Recently, my husband had difficulty
swallowing.

320
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,680
One day, he choked when eating a peach.

321
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,400
It scared me a lot.

322
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,360
Now, we are preparing

323
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,520

00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,840
Whether it's rice or meat,

325
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,800
we all make them
into paste for him to eat.

Let's applaud our friends.

329
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,280
So, next,

330
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,560
who would like to share?

331
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,320
My friend,

332
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,880
I've seen you come several times,

333
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,400
but you never spoke.

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,040
My girlfriend has been diagnosed
as carrying the pathogenic gene

of Huntington's Disease.

00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,840
But she hasn't suffered from it so far.

337
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,830
So,

338
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm unable to share my experiences

339
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,480
of caring for her.

340
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,880
I'm curious.

341
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,280
Since the disease
hasn't come to your girlfriend,

342
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,680
why do you come to this symposium?

343
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,590
My girlfriend,

344
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,880
she is
a three-generation patriarchal patient.

345
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,480
I don't know when the illness will come.

346
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,920
But,

347
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,560
I love her very much.

348
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,320
I hope

349
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,200
that I can be with her all the way.

350
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,080
And everybody here

351
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,160
is my predecessor.

352
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,760
Your experiences are really

353
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,400
precious to me.

354
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,680
So I came here

355
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,560
to learn in advance

356
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,280
so as to face the likely difficulties

357
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,920
in the future.

358
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,720
I'm here to prepare in advance.

359
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,680
I'm a doctor.

360
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,160
Recently, I've just begun my study

361
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,680
on the medicine for
Huntington's Disease.

362
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,680
I don't know

363
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,680
if I'm able to succeed

364
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,320
in finding the cure.

365
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,600
But I won't give up.

366
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,040
I'm going to work hard.

367
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,600
Applauses for him.

369
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,120
It's you who stuffed this.

370
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,600
So you want me to hear what you said?

371
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,360
Mrs. Su. I know

372
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,560
you must still be angry with me.

373
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,000
But everything I just said was

374
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,680
from the bottom of my heart.

375
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,560

let me introduce our topic,

467
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,960
which is the targeted clearance
of Huntington's protein

Huntington's Disease

471
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,280
is a neurodegenerative disease
of the nervous system

472
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,840
caused by gene mutation of
a Huntington protein.

so that it's unable to clear them.

480
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,040
Thus the transport of synaptic vesicles
is disturbed

481

is restrained.

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,520
of the Huntington's Disease gene.

564
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
Boss,

565
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,960
it's a suicide for Su Wei'an.

566
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,760
Three years ago,

567
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,280
my father passed away all of a sudden.

568
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,880
The doctor suggested
that I do genetic screening.

569
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,400
When I got the result, I was in despair.

570
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,240
It was no doubt

571
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,680
a huge strike for me,

572
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,920
a medical student.

573
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,280
Because the doctor told me that,

574
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,880
once the Huntington's Disease
comes to me,

575
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,000
I'll never be able to hold a scalpel.

576
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,320
So

577
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,160
I was forced to give up

578
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,520
my lifetime dream

579
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,520
of becoming a neurosurgeon.

580
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,520
At that time,

581
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,800
I lost my direction of life.

582
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,800
All I wanted to do then was to escape.

583
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,760
Later, I went abroad.

584
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,640
I went all out to make money,

585
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,200
hoping to find way out for my life.

586
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,640
She had the nerve to say that.

587
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
However, it's a pity

588
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,360
that there's just no such a way out.

589
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,800
So, for me,

590
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,000
I regret a lot for those 3 years
when all I did was escape.

591
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,080
It takes an hour
to extract cellular proteins,

592
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,080
two hours
to finish transmembrane closure

593
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,320
and twelve hours
to bind the primary antibody.

594
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,400
Why is there only 24 hours in a day?

595
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,200
I always ask myself,

596
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
"If I had returned
to scientific research sooner,

597
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,960
is it possible that his program

598
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,160
would have been pushed forward earlier?

599
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,520
Is it possible

600
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,080
that people with the same despair

601
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,000
can see the hope?"

602
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
I work harder

603
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,920
because

604
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,320
I can see the end of life.

605
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,400
Trust me.

606
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,840
I must be the one most desperate

607
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,080
to succeed in the research of medicines

608
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,120
to cure Huntington's Disease.

609
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,960
Though the road ahead is tough,

610
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,600
we must burn all our lives

611
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,560
to find that microlight.

612
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,120
Thank you.

613
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,160
Now, let's welcome the director

614
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,600
from Microlight Fund
to announce the result.

615
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,360
Welcome.

is Huaren Hospital.

621
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,560
The Huntington's Disease topic.

622
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,360
We did it.

623
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,120
Fantastic.

624
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,640
Boss, we got the money.

625
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,720
Why did Su Wei'an win again?

626
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,760
Does she deserve everything
because she's miserable?

627
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,520
I don't accept it.

628
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,720
Jiehui didn't need the funds at first.

629
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,320
Why did we come?

630
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,360
To tell our old friends,

631
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,960
"We are back."

632
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,360
Young lady,

633
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,960
you are brave and have good faith.

634
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,000
I've met many research teams.

635
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,360
Those who can make it to the end

636
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,280
are all like you.

637
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,920
They are all brave
and have a solitary character.

638
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,960
I'm optimistic about your project.

639
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,920
Hope you work harder

640
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,320
and make a breakthrough
as early as possible.

641
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,000
Thank you.

642
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,960
We did it.

643
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Yeah, Wei'an.

644
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,760
We did it.

645
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,920
Wei'an.

646
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,400
Next, we need to detail your program.

647
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,000
You too.

648
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,160
Wei'an, that was a wonderful speech.

649
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,160
You've earned it.

650
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,000
The Microlight Fund Committee

651
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,560
is too casual.

652
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,080
You won with your miserable story.

653
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,840
Miserable?
Can anyone be more miserable than me?

654
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,560
Again and again,

655
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,120
my results have been stolen by thieves.

656
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
You're saying

657
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,880
that we've plagiarized your project?

658
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,720
Plagiarism also requires skills.

659
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,600
The PPT you've just used,

660
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,840
is just a copy and paste.

661
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,080
Don't slander
if you don't have evidence.

662
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,640
That we had the same topic only means

663
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,600
that the main research directions
of Huntington's Disease cure

664
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,640
are only a few.

665
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,560
Okay.

666
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,120
For the coming research,

667
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,720
let's see who can win.

668
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,240
Then you need to hurry.

669
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Jiehui won't just wait there for you.

670
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,800
Ok.

671
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,520
Wei'an,

672
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,800
let's go.

00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,860

[Outpatient]

675
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,360
Wei'an,

676
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,480
where did you get the microplate reader?

677
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,920
I borrowed it from the neighboring team.

678
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,760
What about our own microplate reader?

679
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,800
It has been broken.

680
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,000
I don't know whether I can fix it.

681
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,040
Broken?

682
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,760
Yes.

683
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,960
Give it to me. I can fix it.

684
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,150
The experiment on animals
hasn't been fully prepared.

685
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,760
Don't waste time on the fixing.

686
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,000
Buy a new one then.

687
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,760
We can't use theirs all the time.

688
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,320
We need to use

689
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,840
the microplate reader every day.

690
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,760
It costs ten to twenty thousand.

691
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,160
We can't afford it.

692
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,920
The Microlight Fund we applied

693
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,200
has already been used

694
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,160
during the molecule period.

695
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,080
We need more money
for the experiments on animals.

696
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,680
Here comes Mr. Du.

697
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,760
What can I do for you?

698
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,200
It's Jiehui,

699
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,480
not Huaren Hospital.

700
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,920
Did I invite you here

701
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,880
just to drink tea?

702
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,840
I...

703
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,920
I understand your mood.

704
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,080
I know you're very anxious.

705
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,920
But to be honest,
I'm in more of a hurry than you are.

706
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,280
But in the experiment,

707
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,120
many things cannot be controlled.

708
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,280
What do you mean can't be controlled?

709
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,160
I've invested a lot of money for you

710
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,240
and hired that many foreign experts.

711
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,240
All the money spent is wasted?

712
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,320
Gu Yunzheng and Su Wei'an got nothing,

713
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,400
but they've already screened effective
compounds

714
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,360
and entered the animal research period.

715
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,840
If you are not capable of doing this,

716
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,360
what's the meaning of hiring you

717
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,600
with this high salary?

718
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,920
It's wrong of you saying that.

719
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,760
You see.

720
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,040
Before I came,

721
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,000
they did the framework.

722
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,280
So I got to have time to learn it.

723
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,440
And I've already had some compounds.

724
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,720
You've got to give me some time to
prove their effectiveness.

725
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,520
You just

726
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,600
tell me.

727
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,920
Can you do it, or not?

728
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,720
Of course I can.

729
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,720
Okay.

730
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,360
But what I want to remind you is this.

731
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,840
All I care about is the result.
I don't care about the process.

732
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,120
You're still too young.

733
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,720
Come and see.

734
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,200
Why my standard curve

735
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,320
is non-linearity?

736
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,840
Is the protein measurement accurate?

737
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,520
I've measured it many times.

738
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,000
And it has never happened before.

739
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,120
Then think,

740
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,040
is there anything changed,

741
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,280
or has the experiment condition changed?

742
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,600
I bought a ninety-six pore plate

743
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,040
online.

744
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,280
Is that a problem?

745
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,280
That's most likely the problem.

746
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,480
Wei'an,

747
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,240
don't worry

748
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
about the money.

749
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,960
Saving the money too much

750
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,200
will only waste more.

751
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,360
You

752
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,720
just do it your way.

753
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,640
I'll figure out the money.

754
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,920
Considering the progress,

755
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,040
we won't be able
to get off work on time.

756
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,520
Save it. I haven't seen my girlfriend

757
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,920
for a whole month.

758
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,040
If this goes on,
my girlfriend will fly away

759
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,920
before we get the result.

760
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
You're lucky to have a girlfriend.

761
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,480
I don't even have time to blind date.

762
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,000
Loneliness is the fate
of the researchers.

763
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,320
Xiaotong.

764
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,320
Sorry, I forgot it.

765
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,720
What's wrong?

766
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,240
I forgot my girlfriend asked me
to go to a movie.

767
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,880
She told me to show up at the movies
in half an hour.

768
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,120
Or she'll break up with me.

769
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,280
But the results for the
primary antibodies

770
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,680
can only come out in three hours.

771
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,640
I can't wait.

772
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,600
Let me help you.

773
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,160
That's so kind of you.

774
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,400
But you have to

775
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,320
borrow me some centrifuge tubes.

776
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,280
No problem.

777
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,600
As long as I can be with my girlfriend,

778
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,240
you can take centrifuge tubes
whenever you want.

779
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,680
Thank you.

780
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,880
Dr. Su,

781
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,680
then make an appointment
for your time tomorrow.

782
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,120
Sure, no problem.

783
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Count on me.

784
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,080
Let's go, Wei'an.

785
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,640
Let's get off work and go home.

786
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,760
No, I can't.

787
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,280
I haven't finished all these.

788
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,120
These seem not to be our experiment.

789
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,920
Yeah.

790
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,280
Here.

791
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,800
I haven't spent a single penny on them.

792
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,000
You've done it all day long?

793
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,880
Yes.

794
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,000
Sorry, Wei'an.

795
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,480
I didn't take care of you.

796
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,200
It doesn't matter.

797
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,440
I must be the champion of staying up

798
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,240
in our lab tonight.

799
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,240
I'll keep you company.

800
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,400
Good.

801
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,000
Everything is done.

802
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Now, I have to observe

803
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,120
and record the results

804
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,520
of these culture dishes.

805
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,480
That's done.

Teacher.

816
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,920
You win.

817
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,880
It's obvious that you let me win.

818
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,080
How?

819
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,000
Lose to me deliberately?

820
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,080
Teacher, you win with your own strength.

821
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,880
Cut the crap.

822
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,440
This move, obviously,

823
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,600
your odds are better if you put it here.

824
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,680
But you just hurl yourself willingly
into the net.

825
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,720
This move of mine

826
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,200
does have flaws.

827
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,200
But if you didn't detect it,

828
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,600
I can turn things around
by making this move.

829
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,680
So, you're superior in the stratagem.

830
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,200
I see.

831
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,680
That's why you agreed

832
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,840
to play Chinese chess with me
after your day off.

833
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,360
Name it.

834
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,080
What do you want?

835
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,160
Teacher,

836
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,880
I need funds.

837
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,400
Haven't you applied

838
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,920
for the Microlight Fund?

839
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,320
You've used it up
in such a short period?

840
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,080
We've already entered
the animal research period.

841
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,800
The transgenetic model mice

842
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,280
for Huntington's Disease are costly.

843
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,680
It's quite normal

844
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,360
that your project group

845
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,640
is in lack of money.

846
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,760
If you don't,

847
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,360
that would be abnormal.

848
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,880
It's still not too late

849
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,600
to come back and study glioma.

850
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,880
I won't change my mind.

851
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,240
I'm actually having a try here.

852
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,200
If I can't get it from you.

853
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,800
I'll try someone else.

854
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,720
Naughty.

855
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,200
I know your temper.

856
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,080
Let's do it this way.

857
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,600
When you go back,

858
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,120
you sort out

859
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,080
your experiment progress document
for me.

860
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,120
I'll help you recommend to people
in charge of pharmaceutical companies.

861
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,480
But to be frank,

862
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,120
I can't guarantee the result.

863
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,320
Teacher,

864
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,080
I just know

865
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,600
that you will also care for me.

866
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,800
It's still early.

867
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,880
Let's play one more time.

868
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,240
