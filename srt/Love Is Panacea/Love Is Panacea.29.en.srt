[Based on the novel "Healer"
by Ningmeng Yuyan]

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,960
Who are you?

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm Du Yongsong,

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Yunzheng's father

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,840
and the director of Huaren Hospital.

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,640
Hello.

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,440
Yunzheng's father?

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,600
Come in, please!

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,120
Is his surname Du or Gu?

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,400
Please take a seat!

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,720
Is it a little too distant

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,600
if I call you Director?

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,680
I'll just call you Yunzheng's dad.

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,160
The boy, Yunzheng,

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,360
is so low-key.

32
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,920
He didn't even tell me
that you are the director.

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,520
Looks like they've been dating
for a long time.

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,160
He has even met you.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,640
For sure! This boy, Yunzheng,

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,240
is such a good kid.

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,560
considerate and caring

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,400
for Wei'an.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,040
To me, he is also very thoughtful.

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,840
So I think

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,160
you taught him to be a great kid.

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
I'm not going to
beat around the bush today.

43
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,400
I disapprove of them dating.

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,200
But...

45
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,440
whoever kids date

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,160
is their own choice.

47
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,960
I think we, as parents,

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,640
shouldn't interfere.

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,200
My son certainly has choices,

50
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,480
but your daughter,

51
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
not so many.

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,760
You should know

53
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,920
Su Wei'an carries the pathogenic gene

54
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,480
for Huntington's Disease.

55
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
It is a hereditary family disease.

56
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
The offspring have
a 50 percent probability

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,720
of inheriting the pathogenic gene.

58
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,680
Enough.

59
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,200
I know

60
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,320
what my daughter has.

61
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
As long as you know.

62
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,680
You can't just sit back and watch

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,200
your own daughter become a burden

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
to others because of this, can you?

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
I really can't believe

66
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,040
that a hospital director

67
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,320
could say something like this.

68
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,520
Go back and get your facts straight.

69
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,120
It's your son who's been
pestering my daughter.

70
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,800
Yunzheng changed his research

71
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,840
focus to Huntington's Disease

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,040
for your daughter's sake.

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,880
He was originally doing research
in glioma

74
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,600
and had some early achievements.

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,480
What he's doing now
is ruining his own future.

76
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,040
Can you understand how I feel?

77
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,920
I don't care about your
"gamma" or "drama".

78
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,720
I only know Yunzheng is very smart.

79
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,280
My daughter was also a top student

80
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,320
when she was in medical school.

81
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,720
As long as the two of them work hard

82
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
and do their best,

83
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,800
they will definitely be able to research

84
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,280
the medicine for chorea.

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,440
They'll be able to develop it next year

86
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,120
and bring it to market the year after.

87
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,520
You are really ignorant.

88
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,400
If it were that easy,

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
Professor Wen from Zhang He Hospital

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,400
would not have retired with regret.

91
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,560
Chorea is a world-class challenge.

92
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,480
How many top medical experts

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,120
and laboratories have failed?

94
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,560
It's very likely that in the end,

95
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,840
even after dedicating their whole lives,

96
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,880
the two of them still won't find a cure.

97
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,760
I don't understand research,

98
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,760
but I understand love.

99
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,040
I also know to respect the choices

100
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,360
the children make.

101
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,440
What about you?

102
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,520
I'm really curious

103
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,920
if your last name is Du

104
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,080
or Gu.

105
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,800
Yunzheng has never mentioned you
to me before.

106
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,440
Why is that?

107
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,720
You two aren't very close, right?

108
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,160
Does Yunzheng know you came to my house

109
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,800
and made all these ridiculous comments?

110
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,800
The kids may impulsively do

111
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,600
some rash things
in the heat of the moment.

112
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
But as parents,

113
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,480
we can't follow along
and make foolish mistakes.

114
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,440
I came today

115
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
to make my stance clear.

116
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,600
I absolutely forbid them from dating.

117
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
If you are still a reasonable mother,

118
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,560
I hope you can
properly advise your daughter

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
to break up with him
while she still can.

120
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,400
You forbid them?

121
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,280
What's your place to do that?

122
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,040
Even if they're breaking up,
it's my call.

123
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,360
Having a father like you,

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,160
Yunzheng probably
has psychological problems,

125
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,600
even psychological illnesses.

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,440
If anyone should disapprove,

127
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,040
it should be me.

128
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,240
It's the best if you disapprove.

129
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,160
I hope you will do as you say.

130
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,880
What an unlucky day!

131
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,000
A dirty rat

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,440
came into my house today.

133
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,360
I have to sweep him out of my home.

134
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,240
What are you doing?

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,920
Sweep.

136
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,680
Sweep.

137
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Dirty rat.

138
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,520
Get out.

139
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,040
How ridiculous!

140
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,000
My house doesn't welcome you!

141
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,640
I'm home, Mom!

142
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
What's wrong, Lan?

143
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,240
Why are you ignoring me?

144
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,800
You should break up

145
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
with Yunzheng.

146
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
You change your opinion so fast!

147
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,560
This morning,
you asked me to make up with him.

148
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,480
What's wrong?

149
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,600
Yunzheng's father came today

150
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,880
and said some ridiculous things.

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,360
I don't care
if he's some hospital director.

152
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,720
I chased him out with a broom.

153
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,480
Which hospital? Do you know?

154
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,880
Huaren Hospital.

155
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,440
Something with "song", Yongsong?

156
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,840
Du Yongsong?

157
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,040
Yes!

158
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,920
Is Director Du his dad?

159
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,400
Wei'an,

160
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,240
it's already so late.

161
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,320
Why did you call me out here?

162
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,240
Why have you been hiding from me

163
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,280
that Director Du is your father?

164
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,080
Wei'an,

165
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,800
I...

166
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,920
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

167
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,560
I just think

168
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
the one dating you is me,

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,520
which has nothing to do with my dad.

170
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,360
But your dad

171
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,760
went to my home

172
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,920
and told my mom
that you're too good for me.

173
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,800
What?

174
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,720
Why did he go there?

175
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
Du Yongsong

176
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,920
is only my biological father.

177
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,400
He doesn't have a say

178
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,920
in whom I'm dating.

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,760
Then tell me,

180
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,160
why did you hide everything from me?

181
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,720
Change your research topic,

182
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,880
and keep a secret about your father.

183
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
Things the whole world knows,

184
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
but only I don't know.

185
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,160
Or do you feel

186
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,920
that I can't accept your family?

187
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,840
I didn't tell you

188
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,200
because I felt there was no need

189
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,480
for you to worry about

190
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,200
those trivial things in my family.

191
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,280
Wei'an, you should just focus

192
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,440
on your research,

193
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,120
and we can live happily together.

194
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,520
Isn't that good?

195
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
But your dad has gone to my home.

196
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,200
My mom has disapproved
of our relationship.

197
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,880
You tell me, what should I do?

198
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,760
I'm sorry, Wei'an,

199
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,720
I was wrong.

200
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,670
Okay,

201
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,280
I'll tell you about my family.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,120
When I was eight,

203
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,800
my mother passed away.

204
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,360
Du Yongsong remarried,

205
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,160
and Du Yuncheng and his mom

206
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,680
moved into our home.

207
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,000
I moved out

208
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,800
to live with my grandfather.

209
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,200
I had thought

210
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,120
my parents divorced

211
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,080
because they were

212
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,240
incompatible.

213
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,600
But then I found a photo

214
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,120
in my mom's belongings.

215
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,480
What photo?

216
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,920
A photo of Du Yongsong,
Du Yuncheng and his mom.

217
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,400
It turns out that before my mom died,

218
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,760
they were already

219
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,360
a loving family.

220
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,200
When my mom died,

221
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,120
she had that photo with her.

222
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
I think she must have known

223
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,160
about Du Yongsong's affair,

224
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,280
and that's why she was in a daze

225
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,120
when the accident happened.

226
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,520
Wei'an,

227
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
if one of us

228
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,480
is out of

229
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,440
the other's league,

230
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,800
it's you.

231
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
Other than my grandfather,

232
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,760
I have no other close family.

233
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,720
Before meeting you,

234
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,160
I didn't even know

235
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,720
how to love someone.

236
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,720
But

237
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,920
I was wrong

238
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,760
not to tell you earlier.

239
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
I upset you,

240
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,760
and I was wrong.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,120
But Su Wei'an,

242
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,760
now that I've chosen you,

243
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,760
I won't give up so easily.

244
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
No one can change my heart.

245
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,320
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,560
I didn't know
you've gone through so much.

247
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,960
Don't worry.

248
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,560
I will figure something out

249
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,440
about your mom.

250
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
She doesn't want to see you now.

251
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,120
She is against us being together.

252
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,600
Then I will use my sincerity and actions

253
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,400
to change her mind.

254
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,320
Honey,

255
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,920
they think I don't know

256
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,040
Wei'an's situation.

257
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,240
How's that possible?

258
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,400
Wei'an is my daughter.

259
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,360
How would I not know?

260
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,880
At that time,

261
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,040
you passed away not long ago.

262
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,440
That day,

263
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,360
Wei'an asked a bunch of questions.

264
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,320
I thought it was strange,

265
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,920
but she wouldn't tell me anything
when I asked her.

266
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,000
I knew she secretly did

267
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,040
some research behind my back.

268
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Wei'an, have some juice.

269
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,560
Mom, why didn't you knock?

270
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,720
Why do I need to knock in my own home?

271
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,680
I need to study.

272
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Please go out.

273
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,240
OK.

274
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,040
Don't stay up too late.

275
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,640
[Is Huntington's Disease curable?]

276
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,880
(How's the patient doing now?)

277
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,800
(Is there a sign of the disease?)

278
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,240
(Not yet.)

279
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,280
(So, Doctor,)

280
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,040
(is there medicine for this disease?)

281
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,640
(Currently, there is)

282
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,560
(no cure worldwide.)

283
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,080
Smile. Don't cry.

284
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,040
Here, wipe your tears.

285
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,600
Thank you.

286
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,320
Is it a terminal illness?

287
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,000
My son

288
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,520
has terminal meningeal cancer as well.

289
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,240
(The doctor said)

290
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,880
(he had at most six months left.)

291
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,680
(As a family,)

292
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,800
(we must steady our emotions)

293
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,280
(and not break down in front of them.)

294
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,360
(No matter how sad we are inside,
we have to smile.)

295
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,240
(If we can't smile,)

296
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,840
(we can tickle ourselves.)

297
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,320
(Even if it feels like)

298
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,240
(a knife in our hearts,)

299
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,400
(we can't let them see it.)

300
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,120
(Not only do we need to smile,)

301
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,480
(but we also need to smile out loud.)

302
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,640
(This way,)

303
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,000
(they won't feel hopeless
and just wait for death.)

304
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,560
[Moments]
(Even if we're only 60% happy,)

305
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,720
(we have to show 120% joy.)

306
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,840
(Am I right?)

307
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,320
Later, Yuan suddenly had an episode.

308
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,440
I was so shocked

309
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,800
I didn't know what to do.

310
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,760
I called Wei'an

311
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,120
and asked her to come back.

312
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,440
But right after I hung up,

313
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,520
I regretted it.

314
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,680
What good would it do
for her to come back?

315
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,560
Can I just let her watch

316
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,800
what she will become?

317
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,520
It was all my fault.

318
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,440
Later,

319
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
her friend

320
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,000
Wen Ran insisted she do
the genetic test.

321
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,520
At first, I didn't want her to do it,

322
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,120
but she said

323
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,880
other results might not be accurate.

324
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Auntie, our Huaren Hospital

325
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
is the most authoritative
for genetic testing.

326
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,600
If she does it at some small clinic

327
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,400
and gets inaccurate results,

328
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,360
you'd still worry
without seeing the report, right?

329
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,280
Don't you think so, Auntie?

330
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,080
Yes, you're right.

331
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,800
Honey,

332
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,200
how I wished Wei'an's first test result

333
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,400
was wrong

334
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,360
and a second test would give

335
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,280
a completely different result.

336
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,080
But heaven could not

337
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,040
grant me that surprise.

338
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,920
My good child...

339
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,320
Later,

340
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,400
Wen Ran and Jiang

341
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,830
each took a report...

342
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,400
Wei'an's test result is negative.

343
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,960
I have the report as proof.

344
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,920
I understood then that

345
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,680
Wei'an didn't want to tell me.

346
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,560
She wanted to keep hiding it from me.

347
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,350
OK.

348
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,480
If you don't want me to know,

349
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,800
I'll just pretend not to know.

350
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,480
Although I'm not a good actress,

351
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,480
as long as Wei'an wants to hide

352
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,080
and not tell me,

353
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,600
no one has the right to expose her.

354
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,000
My Su,

355
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,640
a few days ago,

356
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,920
that Du Yongsong came to our house.

357
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,160
He told me

358
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,920
about Wei'an having chorea.

359
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,800
He blabbed

360
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,240
a bunch of nonsense.

361
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,200
I was so mad!

362
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,840
How could he

363
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,840
expose all the white lies?

364
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,600
Can I still

365
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,280
pretend that I don't know

366
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,160
along with Wei'an?

367
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,800
Mom...

368
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,200
Wei'an!

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,120
You already knew.

370
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,240
Why didn't you tell me?

371
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
I know

372
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,800
that you don't want to tell me

373
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,120
because you don't want to
see me crying like this.

374
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,840
I didn't tell you

375
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,240
because I didn't want you
to know either.

376
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,280
I don't want us both to be
sobbing messes.

377
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,960
Actually, we're both overthinking.

378
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,040
Look, aren't we doing just fine?

379
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,680
Aren't we?

380
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,360
We don't cry every day.

381
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,440
You're working so hard

382
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,720
researching the medicine for HD.

383
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,880
And me, I've become the dancing queen.

384
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,320
Aren't we awesome?

385
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,360
Not scared by this illness, right?

386
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,160
Silly girl,

387
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,960
you know?

388
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,040
In this world,

389
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,800
the only one who has

390
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,880
shared heartbeats with me is you.

391
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,280
Back then,

392
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,520
when you were in my tummy,

393
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,920
it felt so magical

394
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,200
and sweet.

395
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,360
So from that moment on,

396
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,000
I knew

397
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,440
in this world,

398
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,000
there is nothing more important
than you.

399
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,560
Don't be afraid.

400
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,680
No matter what happens,

401
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
I will be by your side.

402
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,000
OK?

403
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,920
Don't be scared.

404
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,080
You are my good girl,

405
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,680
and I'm still your silly mom.

406
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,400
We will be fine.

407
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,080
Why did you go to Su Wei'an's mom?

408
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,720
Why did you say those things to her?

409
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,400
Now you are worried?

410
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,080
I was just being realistic

411
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,720
and saying things I should have said.

412
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,840
On what basis can you
interfere in my relationship?

413
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,720
How could you

414
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,840
go to someone else's home
and say such arrogant words?

415
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,080
Because I'm your dad.

416
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,880
Because I'm doing this
for your own good.

417
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,800
I can't tolerate

418
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,240
that woman with defective genes

419
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,720
ruining the rest of your life.

420
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,680
What right do you have
to call yourself my dad?

421
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,400
If it weren't for you,

422
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,640
my mom wouldn't have

423
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,960
stayed in Lacaya and not come back.

424
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,720
Would she have

425
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,040
died alone for no reason

426
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,160
in a foreign country?

427
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,720
What nonsense are you saying?

428
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,920
Take a look at this yourself.

429
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,580
[We are the real family]

430
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,240
When the accident happened to Mom,

431
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,440
it was found in her pocket.

432
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,080
"Ms. Cui from a divorced family."
All lies.

433
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,240
Du Yuncheng

434
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,480
is undoubtedly your biological son.

435
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,960
I...

436
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,400
You had been with Cui Jie

437
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,800
even before you met my mom.

438
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,200
If that was the case,

439
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,320
why did you still marry my mom?

440
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,920
If it weren't for this photo,

441
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,240
would my mom have had a mental lapse

442
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,520
or an accident
at the construction site?

443
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,240
You're saying it's not your fault.

444
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,080
Why did Xingchen have this photo?

445
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,080
It wasn't me. Not me.

446
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,320
When my mom passed away,

447
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,240
no one even went to
claim her belongings.

448
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,520
Her colleagues

449
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,160
made countless phone calls to our home,

450
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,640
but they couldn't reach anyone.

451
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,560
But what did you say to me?

452
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,240
You said she didn't want me anymore.
She was now in Lacaya.

453
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,280
She didn't love me.

454
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
How did you have the nerve to say that?

455
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,800
These deceptions and trauma

456
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,680
from my childhood,

457
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,720
how can you make amends for them?

458
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,360
Can you even calculate it?

459
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,960
Your own marriage and family

460
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,240
are a mess.

461
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,520
What right do you have

462
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,640
to meddle in my relationship?

463
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,160
Who I am dating

464
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,720
is my own business.

465
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,960
Su Wei'an,

466
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,200
whether or not she has
any genetic defects,

467
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,960
has nothing to do with you

468
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,120
because you simply don't know

469
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,200
what real love is.

470
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,920
You just don't deserve it.

471
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,320
Yunzheng,

472
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,720
listen to Dad.

473
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,160
I did make mistakes back then,

474
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,560
but now I'm doing this for your sake.

475
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,040
I can't sit back and watch you

476
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,440
ruining your future!

477
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,400
Don't keep insisting

478
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,480
that you're my father.

479
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,640
In this lifetime, we will never have

480
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,720
a father-son relationship.

481
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,040
Director Du,

482
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,640
you don't need to threaten me

483
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,600
with the transfer of
the research project anymore.

484
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,680
Regardless of whether you
approve it or not,

485
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,800
I believe

486
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,680
there will be other hospitals

487
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,880
and labs

488
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,200
that support my research.

489
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,680
I ask

490
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,520
that you stop harassing

491
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,080
Su Wei'an and her family,

492
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,080
and I also hope you

493
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,320
won't meddle in my own affairs.

494
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,240
Du, did you have dinner?

495
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,120
I ordered seafood paella takeout.

496
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,480
Should I warm it up for you?

497
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,800
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

498
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,680
Did you send her this picture?

499
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,320
Isn't this a picture of the three of us?

500
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,600
Where did you find it?

501
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,560
Did you send Gu Xingchen this picture?

502
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,640
It was me.

503
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,040
What's wrong?

504
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,960
She was volunteering
in Lacaya at that time.

505
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,800
She wouldn't come back to divorce you.

506
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Yuncheng was about to
start elementary school.

507
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,120
Without a father, he couldn't.

508
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,960
I couldn't just stand by and do nothing.

509
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,520
Do you know

510
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,560
when she died,

511
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,880
she had this photo in her pocket?

512
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,160
She probably found out
about our relationship,

513
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,560
so she had the accident.

514
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,280
You're the one who got her killed?

515
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,480
Me?

516
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,560
The one who got her killed
was not me, but you!

517
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,600
Back then,

518
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,440
we were fine in our relationship,

519
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,920
but you suddenly asked
to break up with me.

520
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,880
It was all because of this Gu Xingchen!

521
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,200
Remember what you said?

522
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,040
You said your families were from
the same class, a perfect match.

523
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,160
And we should break up peacefully.

524
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,080
But at that time,
I was pregnant with Yuncheng!

525
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,560
Don't bring Yuncheng into this!

526
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,240
You were secretly pregnant
and gave birth to him,

527
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,640
but I didn't even know!

528
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,080
Is that what a father should say?

529
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,560
If I didn't give birth to Yuncheng,

530
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,640
what could I do?

531
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,560
He was a part of me in my tummy!

532
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,120
If you wanted me
to abort him, I couldn't!

533
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,160
I asked you to wait, didn't I?

534
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,240
I asked you to wait for me.

535
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,320
Why did you take it upon yourself

536
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,560
to send her the photo?

537
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,680
Wait?

538
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,280
I waited a year after another.

539
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,880
I waited for seven years!

540
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,920
Gu Xingchen was out there
for so many years,

541
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,720
not willing to come back to divorce you.

542
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,480
Your marriage was dead,

543
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
but she still wouldn't let you go,

544
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,720
hogging the family!

545
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
But what about my Yuncheng?

546
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,120
My Yuncheng was bullied at school

547
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,800
just because he didn't have a father.

548
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,960
Why?

549
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,440
He is the eldest heir of the Du family!

550
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,240
Enough!

551
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,560
I won't shut up!

552
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,720
Your father has never
looked kindly upon Yuncheng.

553
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,640
Do you think he treats us differently

554
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,080
because Yuncheng is "not" your kid?

555
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,160
Yuncheng's eyebrows and eyes

556
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,800
look exactly like yours.

557
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,160
Everyone says he looks just like you!

558
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,160
Your father isn't stupid or blind!

559
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,600
You all look down on Yuncheng

560
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,840
simply because my background

561
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,080
is not as good as Gu Xingchen's.

562
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,840
My degree isn't as high as hers.

563
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,600
My family background
isn't as good as Gu Xingchen's.

564
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,800
I'm not worthy to be your wife.

565
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Don't think I don't know!

566
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,800
Your dad wouldn't
let me in the old house.

567
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,240
He says I'm snobbish,

568
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,120
but he's the most snobbish!

569
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,400
Wei'an,

570
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,200
your dad left you to me after he passed.

571
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,480
I won't allow anyone

572
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,840
to bully you or look down on you.

573
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,840
I know

574
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,920
that Yunzheng is
a kind and thoughtful kid.

575
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,480
But with his dad's character,

576
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,600
if you marry him,

577
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,320
you will suffer a lot.

578
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,320
Mom,

579
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,640
I don't have plans to get married yet.

580
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,200
No matter what your plans are,

581
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,000
you can't marry Gu Yunzheng.

582
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,560
Your hands are freezing.

583
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,600
They're fine.

584
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,440
Going out?

585
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,160
Zhang!

586
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,720
Uncle Zhang.

587
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,720
Auntie.

588
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,440
Wei'an.

589
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,400
I'm taking Wei'an to work.

590
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,400
Are you going out for groceries?

591
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,720
Wei'an, so, that job of yours...

592
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,720
If the place doesn't have a subway,

593
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,880
then don't go.

594
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,320
If you have to go,

595
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,680
get up early and get ready quickly.

596
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
You hear me?

597
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,840
OK.

598
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,680
I'm going to work then.

599
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,360
Wei'an!

600
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,320
What's wrong with the guards here?

601
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,640
Why do they let
random people come in here?

602
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,480
But Auntie...

603
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,800
Lan seems really mad at me this time.

604
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,160
She's not mad at you

605
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,920
but your dad.

606
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,960
He went to my home

607
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,480
and said a lot of unpleasant words,

608
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,000
including my sickness.

609
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
I'm sorry, Wei'an.

610
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,280
Lan must be really upset.

611
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,400
It turns out she found out
a long time ago,

612
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,120
but she's been pretending not to know.

613
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,560
I always thought Lan was insensitive,

614
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,440
but I didn't expect it to be like this.

615
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,480
Lan really loves you.

616
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,160
I will find a way to make amends.

617
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,080
You should probably avoid my mom
for now.

618
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,240
I don't think she'll be
very nice to you.

619
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,520
No way.

620
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,560
The more she pushes me away,

621
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,120
the more I have to

622
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,160
show my face in front of her.

623
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,280
I will prove with my actions

624
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,720
that I will cherish
her precious daughter

625
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,640
just like she does.

626
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,700
[Ding-dong]

627
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,240
Coming!

628
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,280
Morning, Auntie!

629
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,480
You again?

630
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,200
I got you breakfast.

631
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,800
Auntie.

632
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,000
This fish is tasty. It's good!

633
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,080
Auntie!

634
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,600
Let me carry them!

635
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,640
Auntie.

636
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,200
Listen to me...

637
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,080
Stop following me.

638
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,720
I won't approve of your relationship.

639
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,000
Give up.

640
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,640
No, Auntie.

641
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,600
If you say that,

642
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,520
it means I still haven't done enough.

643
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,160
You don't need to worry about me.

644
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,520
In any case, I'll accompany you
wherever you go,

645
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,400
okay?

646
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,400
Yunzheng,

647
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,920
I know you are a good kid,

648
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,120
and I really can't
find any flaws with you.

649
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,960
But

650
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,840
your dad sees my Wei'an

651
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,160
with discrimination.

652
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,640
Do you know,

653
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,720
to me, Wei'an

654
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,880
is the most important person
in this world?

655
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,280
So I cannot

656
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,360
Allow anyone to belittle her.

657
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
Don't waste your time here

658
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
or your efforts.

659
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,680
Auntie!

660
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,160
Dr. Gu,

661
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,720
how's the cold shoulder treating you?

662
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,400
It's great.

663
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,520
I got a lot of it these days.

664
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,080
Weren't you always treasuring time?

665
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,560
How come you're spending

666
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,000
so much time on Lan?

667
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,600
I have to make my mother-in-law like me.

668
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,200
In that case,

669
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,680
I can have a good girlfriend like you.

670
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
You're so gentle and considerate in life

671
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,480
and can work over

672
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,480
12 hours a day for me.

673
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,280
Doesn't that mean I've struck gold?

674
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,080
You old cunning fox.

675
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,670
What?

676
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,600
Old?

677
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,670
Aren't you?

678
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,670
You're six years older than me.

679
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,880
Say that again!

680
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,080
Old cunning...

681
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,560
Am I still old?

682
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,920
Yes.

683

Su Wei'an, don't run!

684
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,320
Being your girlfriend is too tiring.

685
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,080
Overuse of mental faculties
during work hours

686
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,400
and overuse of physical energy
after work hours.

687
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,520
How about this?

688
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,080
This weekend, I'll take you
on a road trip

689
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,720
and give you a break.

690
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,800
What do you think?

691
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,840
But this weekend,

692
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,400
we need to visit my aunt.

693
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
What's up with your aunt?

694
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,280
She refuses to see anyone recently.

695
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,000
When we are not there,

696
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,160
she will have the nurse
wheel her around,

697
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,000
but when we go visit,

698
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,080
she locks herself in the room alone.

699
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,360
It's fine.

700
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,240
I'll figure something out. Don't worry.

your favorite Tangyuan in rice wine!

705
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,720
I added a lot of osmanthus!

only stay in your room every day.

721
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,880

Look, the flowers over there,

you can take me with you.

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,080
Boss,

748
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,680
I heard our hospital
gave us very little funding,

749
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,400
not as much as
the popular research fields.

750
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,200
[Microlight Fund Project Application]
West China Rare Disease Welfare Program?

751
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,760
Microlight Fund?

752
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,480
Su Wei'an,

753
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,280
disposable gloves
should be thrown away after use.

754
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,880
These gloves can be disinfected

755
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,000
and reused.

756
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,880
Our funding is tight right now,

757
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,040
so we need to save where we can.

758
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,560
No way. Are we so poor now

759
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,400
that we can't even afford
disposable gloves?

760
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,280
I can tell you've never
suffered hardship.

761
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,640
Back when you researched gliomas,

762
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,200
you were used to spending freely, right?

763
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,480
Now, we still haven't gotten funding

764
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,080
for chorea research.

765
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,280
We're using leftover money
from the glioma research.

766
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,480
We don't know how long
we'll have to live like this.

767
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,600
Indeed,

768
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,880
I didn't suffer any hardships

769
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,640
in my previous research either.

770
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,920
Alright,

771
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,160
it's not time to show off now.

772
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,040
We need to save money from now on.

773
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,840
Use my money then.

774
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,360
Funding your own research?

775
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,760
Don't you know

776
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,560
doing research is like doing magic?

777
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,080
No matter how much money you have,

778
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,720
it'll be gone in minutes.

779
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,760
I know. I mean,

780
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,680
before Microlight Fund grants
our application,

781
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,720
use my money.

782
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,880
Microlight Fund?

783
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,520
Yes.

784
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,920
Microlight Fund

785
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,640
is a rare disease welfare program.

786
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,560
The founder, Cao Yong,

787
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,880
is a patient with ALS himself

788
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,440
and a vice president

789
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,160
at a Fortune 500 company.

790
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,960
Since being diagnosed,

791
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,640
he has been dedicated to

792
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,360
advancing rare disease research
in China.

793
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,000
This fund is specifically for

794
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,520
rare disease research projects.

795
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,920
Su Wei'an, you'll be in charge of
preparing the application

796
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,000
for the Microlight Fund this time.

797
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,880
Me?

798
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,640
Yes.

799
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,880
Although it won't be a lot of money,

800
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,760
it's enough for us to start the project.

801
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,840
Don't feel too stressed.

802
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,160
We'll be relying on you, Wei'an.

803
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,920
But I...

804
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,040
Yuncheng!

805
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,560
When did you come back?

806
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,080
Let's talk in the car.

807
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,280
Yuncheng!

808
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,760
Yuncheng!

809
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,680
You're finally back!

810
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,200
I've missed you so much these days!

811
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,760
Where on earth did you go?

812
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,480
How has the company been?

813
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,280
With you gone,
Jiehui was a group without a leader.

814
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,080
A few directors

815
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,880
have transferred their shares
to Maiteng.

816
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,000
Adverse news
was also spreading widely out there.

817
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,160
I've been struggling to support Jiehui.
