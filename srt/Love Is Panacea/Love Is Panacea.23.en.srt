00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,260
So you also like experiments?

190
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,260
Prof. Wang.

191
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,220
These are zebrafish, right?

192
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,020
I'm not a professor.

193
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,860
As the lowest-educated college student
in the whole institution,

194
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,060
I've never expected

195
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,060
to be a professor in my life.

196
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,220
Just call me Dr. Wang.

197
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,020
The genetic similarity
between zebrafish and humans

198
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,740
reaches up to 87%.

199
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,620
Their life cycle is short enough.

200
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,220
Go from embryo to adult

201
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,020
in a day.

202
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,180
These little creatures

203
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
can help me find

204
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,620
and screen life-saving drugs,

205
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,140
a disease-killing weapon,

206
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,300
in as fast as 48 hours.

207
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,220
48 hours?

208
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,380
Yes, two days.

209
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,660
Although

210
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,220
unexpected variables

211
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,980
may occur during the process,

212
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,660
and these little fish

213
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,220
may make more sacrifices,

214
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,940
most of the time,

215
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,460
those critically ill patients

216
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,380
only give me this much time.

217
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,300
Even if I have to work without sleep,

218
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,060
I will win this tough battle

219
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,500
with these fish soldiers.

220
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,140
Whenever I talk about these little fish,

221
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,260
I can't help but go on and on.

222
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,380
Sorry for wasting your time.

223
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,620
Not at all.

224
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,700
Dr. Wang.

225
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,740
Doing what you love is a great joy,
isn't it?

226
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,820
Of course.

227
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,700
Only passion can make us fearless

228
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,820
of the uncertainties of the world.

229
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,460
Which department are you from?

230
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,620
How should I address you?

231
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,820
I'm Su Wei'an.

232
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,980
I delivered samples for Dr. Gu Yunzheng.

233
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,780
Neurosurgery Department, huh?

234
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,020
Dr. Su, I'll take care of the rest.

235
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,860
I'm not a doctor.

236
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,460
Dr. Wang.

237
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,140
You're still here.

238
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,860
Mr. Wu.

239
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,180
The renowned expert in cardiology.

240
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,740
You've been in magazines, right?

241
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,980
Mr. Wu.

242
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,780
It's so late.

243
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,540
You are personally delivering samples.

244
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,980
Look, you're a big star now.

245
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,460
You have fans everywhere you go.

246
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,420
Dr. Wang is the star

247
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,620
in our Huaren Lab.

248
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,140
We're all your fans.

249
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,500
I just finished checking
some students' surgeries.

250
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,820
I knew you would

251
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,020
still be here at this time.

252
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,300
So I brought the samples to you.

253
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,820
You're flattering me.

254
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,460
Mainly,

255
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,020
I've got a couple of tough questions

256
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,020
to discuss with you,

257
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
the microbiology guru.

258
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,820
You're too polite.

259
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,020
What can I do for you?

260
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,180
Well.

261
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,300
I'll leave now.

262
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,420
When the results are out,

263
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,820
I'fll call Dr. Gu.

264
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,060
Thank you, Dr. Wang.

265
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,100
See you, Mr. Wu.

266
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,940
Alright.

267
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,500
Mr. Wu, please go ahead.

268
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,100
(Dr. Wang.)

269
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,890
(Doing what you love is a great joy,
isn't it?)

270
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,820
(Of course.)

271
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,700
(Only passion can make us fearless
of the uncertainties of the world.)

272
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,260
What happened?

273
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,820
Lost your soul?

274
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,220
I can't believe it.

275
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,500
In a place like Huaren,
where everyone has a Ph.D.,

276
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,860
there's a doctor with a college degree.

277
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,540
Do you know who I just met

278
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,540
at Dr. Wang's place?

279
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,780
A specialist in cardiology

280
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,420
or an authority
in hepatobiliary and pancreatic?

281
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,620
Academician Wu.

282
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
The doyen of cardiologists.

283
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,140
I'm not surprised
even if you see anyone at her place.

284
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,340
The famous doctor
who lives in the magazine

285
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,940
actually delivered the samples
in person.

286
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,300
What's more inconceivable is

287
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,220
that the eminent academician

288
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,420
respectfully sought advice
from a college student.

289
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,900
Speaking of Dr. Wang,

290
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,220
what kind of legendary figure is she?

291
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,620
She's

292
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,540
a microbiology guru

293
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,540
who stuck to her dream for two decades.

294
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,740
Dr. Wang

295
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,100
never directly interacts with patients.

296
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,020
No patient knows

297
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,820
who Dr. Wang Lijuan,

298
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,420
mentioned
in the pathological analysis report,

299
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,460
exactly is.

300
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,420
Although she stays behind the scenes,

301
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,820
she's

302
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,420
the hero in the hearts

303
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,660
of every Huaren doctor.

304
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,380
But she can never

305
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,020
become a researcher in the lab

306
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,420
or a professor.

307
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,620
So what?

308
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,260
She's still our treasure at Huaren.

309
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,500
Dr. Wang

310
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,060
never cares about that.

311
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,740
Medicine has long become her faith.

312
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,180
So, Miss Su.

Are you interested
in becoming the first undergraduate

317
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,660
in Huaren's history

318
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,900
to have a publication in The Lancet?

319
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,740
You intentionally sent me there.

320
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,220
Dr. Gu.

321
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,380
You're not giving up yet?

322
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,180
Still trying to create a Dr. Su?

323
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,980
I didn't say that.

The Neurology Annual Conference

350
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,840
will be held next week

351
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,400
to share the results
of the HDQ39 Phase III clinical trial.

352
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,160
Facing experts
from all over the country,

353
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,560
Prof. Wen Yuliang can't avoid it.

354
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,360
It's a perfect opportunity.

355
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,520
That's true.

356
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,480
But as an undergraduate student,

357
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,360
how can I get

358
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,520
into the top special lecture
in Neurology?

359
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,400
How?

360
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,440
I'll take you in.

361
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,200
You're a surgeon.

362
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,520
How can you get
into a special lecture in Neurology?

363
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Because your boyfriend is

364
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,720
the all-capable Gu Yunzheng.

365
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,080
I collaborated with my former colleague

366
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,800
from Hopkins

367
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,960
on a project about Huntington's Disease.

368
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,960
The project proposal

369
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,160
has just been submitted to

370

the National Natural Science Foundation
for a Sino-foreign cooperative Project.

371
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,360
That's why I'm qualified
to attend the conference.

372
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,880
Did you team up with foreigners

373
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,200
to cheat the NNSF?

374
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,200

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,600
in the application?

376
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,440
How can you call it cheating?

377
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,760
I don't see any problem with it.

378
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,760
Of course there's a problem.

379
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,520
You've been studying gliomas
for over nine years.

380
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,400
Whether it's high-impact papers

381
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,520
or special lectures,

382
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,880
they're all related to gliomas.

383
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,560
Your National Natural Science project

384
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,040
is close to producing results.

385
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,400
It's always been regarded

386
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,960
as one of the most promising studies
in the field of glioma.

387
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,400
How can you possibly have the energy
to work on two projects?

388
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,400
Let alone

389
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,240
starting from scratch
on Huntington's Disease?

390
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,520
How can anyone believe that?

391
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,400
You really know me well.

392
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,200
Su Wei'an.

393
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,360
I'm happy

394
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,120
that you care about me.

395
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,240
I...

396
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,600
I just casually looked into it.

397
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,200
The point is how did you do it?

398
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,200
I thought the main point was

399
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,800
being able to talk directly
with Prof. Wen.

400
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,680
Unfair.

401
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,640
I'm a scholar.

402
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,360
What does fairness have to do with me?

403
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,180
Besides,

404
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,960
I worked hard on the project proposal

405
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,240
for the conference qualification.

406
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,640
Even if I didn't contribute anything,

407
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,560
I still put in effort.
Shouldn't I be rewarded?

408
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,920
So you've been working so hard lately

409
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,240
just for this?

410
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,240
Well,

411
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,640
now I realize

412
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,760
that you only respond
to softness and not strength.

413
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,200
So only a trick works.

414
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,400
I used to do things
without saying anything

415
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,760
because I was afraid you'd be burdened.

416
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,880
Now I think it's good to have a burden.

417
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,760
What's good about it?

418
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
With a burden,

419
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,080
you won't leave without saying goodbye.

420
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,960
Never let it go, huh?

421
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,520
So that's what you're like, Mr. Gu.

422
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,880
I can't help it. I'm terrified.

423
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,480
I always feel that the more you owe me,

424
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,920
the more reluctant you are to leave me.

425
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,680
It's my fault.

426
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,240
I shouldn't have run away.

427
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,320
Wei'an.

428
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
My heart

429
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,400
is put together piece by piece.

430
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
You must take good care of it.

431
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,720
I promise

432
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,400
I'll never leave
without saying goodbye again.

433
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,320
Okay.

434
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,640
At least

435
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,560
leave a letter.

436
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,800
Su Wei'an.

437

[National Neurology Academic Conference]

438
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,840
Hello.

439
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,920
We're here for

440
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,840
National Neurology Academic Conference.

441
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,680
Okay.

442
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,030
Hello, ID, please.

443
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,200
Thank you.

444
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,680
Wait a moment.

445
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,240
Prof. Gu, your room key.

446
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,680
Thank you.

447
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,590
You're staying in Room 406.

448
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,720
It's our king-size room with a sea view.

449
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,030
Okay, thank you.

450
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,030
What about my room?

451
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,280
You're both staying in

452
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,960
Room 406 with a sea view.

453
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,030
One room?

454
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,240
Yes.

455
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,070
Can I have a separate room, please?

456
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,880
I'm sorry, Miss.

457
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,640
We don't have any available rooms now.

458
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,160
I have nothing to do with it.

459
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,600
Hello.

460
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,720
I'm Leo, the receptionist.

461
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,280
Any problems checking in?

462
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,160
I'm Gu Yun Zheng from Huaren Hospital.

463
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,160
We need another room now.

464
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,200
I'm so sorry.

465
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,800
Our hotel is full today.

466
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,320
Prof. Gu,

467
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,480
anything wrong with your room?

468
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,960
This is my companion,

469
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,040
Miss Su Wei'an.

470
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,680
I marked her gender

471
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,800
on the registration form.

472
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,120
But now

473
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,880
we've been put in a room together.

474
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,880
Let me check.

475
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,960
That's right.

476
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,360
Miss Su

477
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,440
was not on the list of delegates before.

478
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,920
As your companion,

479
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,720
we arranged her accommodations

480
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,840
as a member of your family.

481
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,160
So,

482
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,520
she's not your family member?

483
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,240
Well,

484
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,640
not exactly.

485
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,960
Then that's yes.

486
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,960
There are a lot of participants
in this Neurology Annual Conference.

487
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,760
The hotel rooms are quite limited.

488
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,520
It's difficult for us
to make arrangements.

489
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,600
So please, Prof. Gu.

490
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,920
Please understand.

491
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,640
Have you completely run out
of available rooms?

492
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,920
I'm sorry.

493
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,840
So?

494
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,120
Could you please check again?

495
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,960
Okay.

496
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,560
Hello?

497
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,800
Do you have

498
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,160
any rooms available tonight?

499
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,160
Aright. Thank you.

500
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Hello?

501
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,120
Do you have any rooms available tonight?

502
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,360
It's hard to book a room this late.

503
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,720
Thank you.

504
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,840
So?

505
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,680
Let's just make do for tonight.

506
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,920
I'm fine with that. It's up to you.

507
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,040
Thank you.

508
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,400
One bed, huh?

509
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,080
Whoever gets the bed first sleeps on it.

510
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,560
Don't.

511
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,480
Clearly, you just booked one less room.

512
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,760
And you're still saying
we can take our time.

513
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,960
I think you did it on purpose.

514
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,720
Dear Su.

515
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,280
You can't defame my character!

516
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,600
Dear Su.

517
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,440
This is called strategy.

518
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,520
Understood?

519
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,360
Why is it so hard?

520
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,040
Abdominal mass.

521
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,360
You need to get a CT scan.

522
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,440
Wei'an.

523
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,840
Stop it.

524
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,920
Is Dr. Gu ever shy?

525
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,440
Feel it more carefully.

526
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,560
Hmm.

527
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,560
Is it an abdominal muscle

528
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,640
or an abdominal mass?

529
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,680
I'm going to take a shower.

530
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,880
Shower?

531
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,240
I...

532
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,520
I mean, take a shower
before going to bed.

533
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,880
Don't get me wrong.

534
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,040
Miss Su.

535
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,440
Is it you or me?

536
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,240
You have an unhealthy mind.

537
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,480
You can't blame me.

538
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,440
You're the one with an unhealthy mind.

539
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

540
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,600
So, you really don't know
what I'm talking about?

541
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,440
No, I don't.

542
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Then let me tell you.

543
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,200
Didn't we say to take it slow?

544
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,680
It was just a kiss.

545
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,320
It's slow enough.

546
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
Alright.

547
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,520
Take a shower first.

548
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,120
Get some rest tonight.

549
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,920
Gu Yunzheng, you cunning fox.

550
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,480
You called me?

551
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,360
No.

00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,320
No.

Almost done.

558
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,200
based on the latest feedback.

559

What can I do to help?

560
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,680
Some experts pointed out

561
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,520
that the sample size is too large,

562
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,560
and it might be difficult to achieve.

00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,000
What about a crossover trial?

564
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,600
It'll make the calculations
more difficult.

565
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,880
How many experimental conditions?

566
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,960
Two.

567
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,920
Two.

568
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,600
Two is fine, right?

569
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,920
0.3%

570
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,920
multiplied by 164 and divided by 4.

571
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,480
No, wait, divided by 2 then.

572
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,560
Does that have to change too?

573
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,160
Which one?

574
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,920
This one.

575
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,840
Yes, it has to be changed.

576
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,440
Well, do it yourself.

577
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,760
What are you doing?

578
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,600
I'm giving you a better angle.

579
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,510

to sneak a peek at me

580
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,760
when you can't sleep.

581
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,640
I don't.

582
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,520
How much longer will you be?

583
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,360
Almost done.

584
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,320
Just a few more changes
to the project background.

585
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,120
Well.

586
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,240
You'd better not sleep on the sofa.

587
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,200
I don't feel comfortable on the sofa.

588
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,320
Sleep on the bed.

589
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,280
But first of all,

590
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,280
let's set some boundaries, okay?

591
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,680
Don't cross the line.

592
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,080
Okay, I won't cross the line.

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,760

even if you press me

616
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,880
and squeeze me all night,

617
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,480

While we're still sensible.

632
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,160
we should think more for others.

633
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,800
Yeah, of course.

The Huntington's Disease drug trial

637

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,960

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,520
like an impossible task.

But in practice,

641
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,480
we haven't worried

642
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,040
about the sample size.

643

The patients
who participated in the trial

644
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,520
were very proactive and enthusiastic.

645
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,320
As there is no cure
for Huntington's Disease.

646
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,880
Patients can only

00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,960

682
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,680
have you found any adverse events?

687
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,920
there are also some dizziness

695
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,720

697
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,240
You have to have a basis

If I'm not mistaken,

699
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,320

that the patient was arranged

you are not a medical professional.

721

of Neurosurgery Department

727
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,400

728

Neurosurgery doctors

729
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,240
rarely

730
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,360
attend Neurology conferences.

731
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,080
I'm here for the conference

732
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,640

have always had close collaboration.

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,800
But that's not the most important thing.

737
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,360
The important thing is

738
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,600
that one of the patients

739
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,720
with ruptured aneurysms
during the drug trial

740
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,880
happened to be under my care.

741
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,720
The other two were treated
at the second hospital.

742
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,120
Unfortunately, one of the patients
at the second hospital

743
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,880
passed away on the night

744
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,760
of the second aneurysm rupture.

745
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,400
We have detailed medical records
for all the patients

746
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,040
and synchronized them with your team

747
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120

748
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,360
But for some reason unknown,

749
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,160
it seems that you're

750
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,960
still unclear about the situation.

751
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,760
Prof. Wen.

752
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,080
Can you explain it to us?

753
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,080
I believe many factors

754
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,880
cause the occurrence of a disease.

755
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,520
But I have full confidence that my team

756
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,120
will analyze and evaluate

757
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,360
the three patients

758
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,200
in detail as soon as possible.

759
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,400
I'll personally follow up on their cases

760
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,120
and come to the conclusion.

761
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,960
Thank you both.

762
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,400
So, okay.

763
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,400
That's all for today.

764
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,440
Thank you, everyone.
