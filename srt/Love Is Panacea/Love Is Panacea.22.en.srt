00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,980
(If I hadn't played such tricks,)

189
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,420
Su Wei'an,

190
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,020
you wouldn't face

191
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,420
your true feelings.

192
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,980
I'm well aware of my own mind.

193
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,860
You don't need to remind me.

194
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,940
Hello, do you know Dr. Gu Yunzheng?

195
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,900
Sorry, I don't.

196
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,460
Hello, do you know Dr. Gu
from neurosurgery?

197
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,380
Sorry, I don't.

198
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,460
Miss, you should go home.

199
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,940
You've been here all day.

200
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,980
I'll just wait here.

201
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,100
I'm not getting in your way.

202
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,140
What's Dr. Gu's

203
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,340
relationship to you?

204
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,860
Wei'an?

205
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,980
Yuncheng.

206
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,940
What are you doing here?

207
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,380
Just personal matters.

208
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,500
Why are you here?

209
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,020
I want to help in the quarantine area,

210
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,220
but they're not letting me in.

211
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,340
Are you looking for Gu Yunzheng here?

212
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,100
I heard he's quarantined here.

213
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,260
Have you heard from him?

214
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
He should be fine.

215
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,420
I just left the director's office,

216
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,100
and I didn't hear any news

217
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,340
about medical staff getting infected.

218
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,100
That's great.

219
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,020
Are you worried about him?

220
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,820
No.

221
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,940
It's about my final payment.

222
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,100
He still owes me a final payment.

223
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,220
How about having a meal together?

224
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,620
I guess you haven't had dinner.

225
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,740
Watch out for low blood sugar.

226
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,700
Thanks, but I have no appetite.

227
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,180
You need to eat to have the strength

228
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,700
to collect your final payment.

229
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,100
Don't worry.

230
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,580
If anything goes down in the hospital,

231
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,100
I'll be informed right away.

232
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,260
All right,

233
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,100
stop worrying.

234
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,620
Let's go.

235
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,100
Sorry,

236
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,180
we're closing up.

237
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,620
Let's eat noodles elsewhere.

238
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,620
What about the lots of burgers here?

239
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,220
Won't you sell them?

240
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,980
Or are they only for delivery?

241
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,700
One of Huaren Hospital's buildings
is under lockdown.

242
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
The doctors, nurses,

243
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
patients and their families inside

244
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,260
have ordered these burgers.

245
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,980
They will be delivered later.

246
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,580
Can takeout be delivered inside?

247
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,580
Yes.

248
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,140
They aim to control the spread

249
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,420
of infections from the hospital.

250
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,700
We have agreed with the hospital

251
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,420
to leave the burgers at the gate.

252
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,380
And their staff

253
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,740
will bring them inside

254
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,980
to distribute across the departments.

255
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,180
Excuse me,

256
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,380
do you mind

257
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,020
if I write a message on the packages?

258
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,620
[Assistant Lin:
Su Yuan is causing a scene again.]

259
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,100
(Su Yuan is causing a scene again.)

260
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,100
[Du Yuncheng:
Comfort her. I'll be there soon.]

261
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,180
How much does Gu Yunzheng owe you

262
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,860
that you're collecting it
with burgers during lockdown?

263
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,100
A big amount.

264
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,220
He needs to seize the day to pay it.

265
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,380
You shouldn't owe a girl's money
these days.

266
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,820
What about I write it with you?

267
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,700
That way, it'll go faster.

268
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,820
No need.
He only recognizes my handwriting.

269
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,420
Then, let me drive you there later.

270
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,260
We can load more this way

271
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,580
and go faster too.

272
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,890
Thank you, Yuncheng.

273
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,140
Delivering takeout with a Benz!

274
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,450
Whoever you're looking for is lucky!

275
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,860
Quickly, over there.

276
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,860
Pack up the takeout.

277
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,700
You are delivering the burgers?

278
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,020
We really appreciate it.

279
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,980
Hello.

280
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,660
Do you know Dr. Gu Yunzheng?

281
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,220
Gu Yunzheng?

282
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,860
Which department? What floor?

283
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,740
Should I find him for you?

284
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,860
[Assistant Lin: When will you come?]

285
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,860
No need, thank you.

286
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,940
Thank you, too.

287
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,700
Wei'an, I'll take you home.

288
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,260
You've forgotten I'm on a trip?

289
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,860
Right, how'd I forget that?

290
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,380
I'll find you a place to stay.

291
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,380
No need, I'll stay at Jiang's tonight.

292
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,420
You go back first, Yuncheng.

293
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,420
Okay.

294
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,340
Send me a message
when you get to Jiang's.

295
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,580
Stay safe.

296
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,220
Get lost! Don't touch me!

297
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,340
- Get away!
- Manager Du.

298
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,660
Shall we give her a sedative?

299
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,340
Ms. Su!

300
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,980
Calm down.

301
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,220
Go get iodophor and gauze.

302
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,420
You all go out now.

303
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,900
Ms. Su.

304
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,220
Just bear with it.

305
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,180
I'll deal with it.

306
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,860
I can't even feel the pain.

307
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,860
Ms. Su.

308
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,860
If the caregivers or nurses did wrong,

309
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,260
directly tell me.

310
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,660
If you need extra staff,

311
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
I'll arrange it.

312
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,860
I want to keep taking the medicine.

313
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,980
What medicine?

314
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,220
You know what I'm talking about.

315
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,940
Today,

316
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,860
I suddenly couldn't control myself.

317
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,860
I was getting better recently.

318
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,500
Ms. Su,

319
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,180
I've invested in HDQ39 for three years,

320
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,700
and I know the effects best.

321
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,220
Your aneurysm isn't related
to the medicine.

322
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,340
But whatever the case,

323
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,340
your current condition

324
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,180
isn't suitable for continued medication.

325
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,660
You need to quit the drug trial.

326
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,980
The drug works well for me.

327
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,140
Du,

328
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,860
please talk to Prof. Wen for me.

329
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,660
I want to keep testing the drug.

330
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,500
But that's against the rules.

331
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,940
I can't do that.

332
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,940
Plus, you've had an adverse event.

333
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,580
Procedure-wise,

334
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,260
we need to report
to the ethics committee.

335
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,860
If you don't quit,

336
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,420
someone will come for a follow-up soon.

337
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,620
You might be forced
to stop the meds then.

338
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,860
Du, I'm begging you.

339
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,420
I want to keep testing the drug.

340
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,940
You must have a way, right?

341
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,220
Ms. Su,

342
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,620
I'll find a way

343
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,220
to get the meds for you.

344
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,980
But

345
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,940
this signature

346
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,020
is signed by you,

347
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,140
right?

348
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,180
Yes, I signed it.

349
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,100
I signed it.

350
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,500
Ms. Su,

351
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,940
only we two know about this.

352
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,050
Don't tell anyone.

353
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,570
I won't tell.

354
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
I won't tell.

355
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,980
This is for you guys.

356
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:31,940
Thank you.

357
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,500
This is for you.

358
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,460
Thanks a lot.

359
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,940
Make sure to keep the wound disinfected.

360
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,540
Dr., this is for you.

361
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,500
I don't need it, thanks.

362
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,980
So strange,

363
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,420
a girl was looking

364
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,900
for Dr. Gu at the door today.

365
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,020
She kept asking anyone there about him.

366
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,100
I can't remember what dept he is in.

367
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,860
We've got no Dr. Gu in our dept.

368
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,700
Mommy, who's Dr. Gu?

369
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,620
Isn't Dr. Gu him?

370
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,900
Dr. Gu, someone wants you to call back.

371
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,100
[Call me back, Dr. Gu]

372
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,780
That's Wei'an's handwriting.

373

I was at a consultation
in respiratory today

386

00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,760
What's wrong, Yang?

746
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,040
Nothing.

747
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,360
I heard there were
some medical disputes.

748
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,520
I don't want to cause trouble.

749
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,280
Prof. Wen!

750
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,360
I couldn't see Prof. Wen today.

751
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,920
Su Wei'an,

752
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,200
aren't you going
to verify it for yourself?

753
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,960
Why don't you join my lab?

754
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,720
I need a research assistant.

755
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,120
Together,

756
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,800
we will surely find the answer.

757
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,000
I won't join.

758
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,600
Why not?
