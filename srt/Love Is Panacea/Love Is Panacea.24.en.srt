18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,740
That's all for my lecture for today.

19
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,780
Thank you everyone.

20
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,340
Thank you, Prof. Wen.

21
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,420
Next, let's invite Prof. Tang Guochun

22
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,720
from Southeast Asia Medical University
to give his presentation.

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,600
- Please.
- Don't worry.

24
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,420
Su Wei'an, are you done with that?

25
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,260
What are you doing?

26
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,980
Do you hate me so much

27
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,660
that you have to ruin my father's speech

28
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,860
at such a high-level event?

29
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,660
Do you know this project

30
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,660
not only has my father's
decade of hard work

31
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,620
but also Yuncheng's
full financial backing?

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,420
I just don't get it.

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,260
You are also a chorea gene carrier.

34
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,300
If my father's drug
can successfully reach the market,

35
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,260
wouldn't that benefit you, too?

36
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,900
Or is it that just to oppose me,

37
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,820
you'd rather harm others
without benefiting yourself?

38
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,260
Wen Ran,

39
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,580
not everything in this world

40
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,580
is related to you.

41
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,540
I never target anyone,

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,140
but scientific research
must stay rigorous and constant...

43
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,140
Scientific research?

44
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,140
Does it have anything to do with you?

45
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,900
You are a dropout,
barely finishing your studies.

46
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
How much do you really know
about chorea?

47
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,460
What qualifications do you have
to question my father's results

48
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,260
from over a decade
of painstaking research?

49
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,900
Dr. Wen,

50
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,140
objectively existing adverse events

51
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,620
severely impact
patients' quality of life.

52
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,340
Although currently, in our country,

53
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,140
there are only 30,000 chorea patients,

54
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,340
however small the group may be,

55
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,140
they should not be neglected.

56
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,180
But do you know how much Yuncheng...

57
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,940
Su Wei'an!

58
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,820
I'm not finished yet!

59
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,900
Prof. Wen.

60
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,700
Dad.

61
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,100
Ran.

62
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,900
What are you trying to do?

63
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,900
Are you determined
to make those chorea patients

64
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,180
lose their only hope?

65
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,580
I look forward to this hope
more than anyone,

66
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,220
but first of all,
it should be a real hope.

67
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,620
Looks like you two
have more questions, right?

68
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,020
Go ahead.

69
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,340
I want to tell you, Prof. Wen,

70
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,980
that no matter when
and under what circumstances

71
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,980
those informed consent forms

72
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,660
to voluntarily withdraw were signed,

73
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,620
we have sufficient evidence to prove

74
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,940
that those three patients

75
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,980
suffered a rupture of aneurysms

76
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,620
during the period of the drug trial.

77
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,460
The drug trial protocol clearly states

78
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,900
that regardless of whether
an adverse event is caused by the drug,

79
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,460
any serious adverse event occurring

80
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,980
during the trial period

81
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,300
must be reported immediately.

82
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,620
But you should know

83
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,940
that the new drug can alleviate

84
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,220
30% to 50% of symptoms
for most patients.

85
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,900
No serious adverse events

86
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,580
were found in Phase I

87
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,100
or Phase II trials either.

88
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,180
The trial has reached
the stipulated 300 sample size,

89
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,740
and the probability of aneurysm rupture

90
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,820
did not even

91
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,100
exceed one percent, right?

92
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,140
So, the cases you mentioned

93
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,420
cannot prove anything.

94
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,820
So what you mean is,

95
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,860
we have to wait until another patient

96
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,180
experiences an aneurysm rupture

97
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,180
and wait
until this ridiculous probability

98
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,420
exceeds one percent

99
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,780
before we can prove the problem?

100
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,180
That's not what I meant.

101
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,780
How do you not understand?

102
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,780
What are your qualifications?

103
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,460
Who are you to question

104
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,460
a top-notch research team

105
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,820
and the scientific achievements

106
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,580
from their 15 years of hard work?

107
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,900
Questioning is fine,

108
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,060
but you need
to provide scientific evidence, right?

109
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
If scientific research were so easy,

110
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,620
then how could Huntington's Disease

111
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,420
still be
an unsolved medical problem worldwide?

112
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,420
Prof. Wen,

113
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
of course, I wouldn't dare question

114
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,020
your team's research capabilities.

115
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,740
What I'm questioning

116
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,540
is your scientific spirit

117
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,190
and ethical principles of drug trials.

118
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,140
If I find scientific evidence,

119
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,060
what will you do then?

120
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,420
If you do,

121
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,140
I will stop the trial immediately

122
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,660
and make a public apology.

123
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,100
It's a deal.

124
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,140
Dad!

125
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,860
Yeah, it's a deal.

126
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,220
Wenbin,

127
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,700
I'm waiting for your explanation.

128
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,100
Professor,

129
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,020
I assure you

130
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,540
that all of my actions

131
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,540
comply with the ethical principles
of drug trials.

132
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,090
They voluntarily signed
their informed consent forms.

133
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,050
Lawyers were present
throughout the entire process.

134
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,080
I did not coerce
or threaten them whatsoever.

135
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,250
Professor,

136
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,530
the deceased patient's remains

137
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,970
had already been cremated then,

138
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,320
so there's no way
to prove his cause of death

139
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,050
was an adverse event

140
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,560
due to the investigational drug.

141
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,610
When I get back,

142
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,850
I will personally conduct

143
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,770
exclusion research on the correlation
between aneurysms and the drug.

144
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,330
Wenbin,

145
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,210
notify everyone

146
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,210
to arrange comprehensive examinations

147
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,570
for all trial participants
as soon as possible.

148
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,450
Hello,

149
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,370
Mr. Du.

150
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,970
You... You asked me

151
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,530
to be a research assistant in your team.

152
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,130
Is the offer still valid?

153
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,370
What's wrong?

154
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,890
Prof. Wen asked me
to prove the direct relationship

155
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,570
between aneurysms and HDQ39.

156
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,730
I can only go back to the lab

157
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,530
to prove it to them.

158
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,210
Wei'an, you have
to think this through carefully.

159
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,090
This is not just applying for a job,

160
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,290
not just

161
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,170
staying with us for a while.

162
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,250
Because a lab

163
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,130
is not a place where you can just come

164
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,770
and go as you please.

165
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,370
I know.

166
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,890
It's not just because
of Prof. Wen either.

167
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,490
I'm just thinking back

168
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,130
to the past

169
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,330
when I would get upset
over contaminated culture dishes

170
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,570
or angry enough to smash the computer

171
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,930
over wrong data,

172
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,890
but as long as I saw my hard work

173
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,930
finally saved into a PDF file,

174
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,210
with the "final version"

175
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,930
added to the title,

176
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,170
that sense of accomplishment
was incomparable.

177
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,370
But later on...

178
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,450
Wei'an,

179
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,530
you made the right decision.

180
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,490
You don't need to hesitate

181
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,810
over chorea ruining your work

182
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,210
before you can make
any research discoveries,

183
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,010
because that's the worst-case scenario.

184
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,410
Nothing could be worse than that.

185
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,250
So, as long as you try,

186
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,530
you won't have any regrets.

187
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,250
But with a difficult problem

188
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,250
like Huntington's Disease,

189
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,210
every small step I take,

190
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,490
there's a voice reminding me

191
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,450
that I still have 99,999 steps

192
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,130
left to go.

193
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,490
Did you see Prof. Wen's

194
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,290
arrogant attitude?

195
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,170
Do you really want to put your hopes

196
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,530
in the hands of someone like him?

197
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,290
You're right.

198
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,490
More than the despair
of not accomplishing anything,

199
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,890
I'm more afraid
of not having tried at all.

200
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,730
I've decided.

201
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,970
I'm going to apply
to be a research assistant

202
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,170
and go back to the lab
to prove it to them.

203
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,370
Wei'an,

204
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,850
let's get this done

205
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,130
together, you and I.

206
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,170
No matter how long it can last,

207
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,690
let's just keep going.

208
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,410
Did you guys see this job posting?

209
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,850
The starting salary is 10,000 a month!

210
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,210
Prof. Gu's team is hiring.

211
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,170
Prof. Gu must have

212
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,570
some new research project
he's working on.

213
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,970
Let me tell you.

214
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,050
Prof. Gu's research on gliomas

215
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,610
is top-level nationally.

216
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,690
If we could get into his lab team,

217
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,450
we'd certainly publish
authoritative papers in the future.

218
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,770
Why, looking to share
in the fruits of victory?

219
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,450
Stop dreaming.

220
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,490
Take a closer look.
They're hiring a research assistant.

221
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,130
The position is so low.

222
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,890
It's obviously just a lab grunt
doing chores full-time.

223
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,850
No matter how high the salary,
there's no future in it.

224
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,170
In my opinion,

225
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,890
clinical practice
is still the way to go.

226
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,810
Yeah,

227
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,090
a research assistant has low prestige

228
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,290
and works long hours.

229
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,050
We doctors

230
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,850
are run ragged in the wards as it is.

231
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,850
We have no other energy
for anything else.

232
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,890
It is better
to leave these opportunities

233
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,330
to new master's graduates.

234
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,890
With Prof. Gu's reputation

235
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,010
and generous salary,

236
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,330
they'll have no trouble
attracting people.

237
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,850
Yeah. That makes sense.

and compete for the position
of a research assistant in the lab?

245
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,650
Su Wei'an,

246
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,610
let me give you a friendly reminder:

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,170
face reality.

248
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,690
With your bachelor's degree

249
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,530
and no relevant work experience,

250
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,130
what makes you dare dream
of joining Huaren Hospital?

251
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,970
Thanks for reminding me to work harder.

252
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,050
Can you give the book back to me?

253
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,610
Sorry,

254
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,650
I'm taking this book.

255
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,530
By the way,

256
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,690
I signed up

257
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,330
for the position
of research assistant, too.

258
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,010
I thought you got your PhD.

259
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,130
Why aren't you going to clinical...

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,050
You're doing this

261
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,770
just to compete with me?

262
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,290
How could that be?

263
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,050
You're just afraid of me, aren't you?

264
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,490
Afraid I'll outcompete you,

265
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,050
afraid no matter how hard you try,
it'll be in vain.

266
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,010
I'm not finished yet.

267
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,450
Su Wei'an, I really didn't expect

268
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,250
you to be such a flirt,
even in the academic field.

269
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,490
You stole my boyfriend,

270
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,010
yet you're still
ambiguous with Mr. Gu.

271
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,690
What?

272
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,290
Do you want to use Mr. Gu
to get into the lab?

273
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,450
You're so calculating.

274
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,930
Does Yuncheng know
what you're really like?

275
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,290
What's wrong with you?

276
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,730
This is the library.

277
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,730
Why are you in such a hurry to smear me?

278
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,050
Are you afraid you'll have no excuse
after losing to me?

279
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,290
Do you think I will lose to you?

280

00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,010

in recent years

This person was expelled from our school

288

to see if she has the qualifications

291
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,810
to enter our Huaren Library.

292
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,090

is your resume ready?

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,490
I can help you hand it in.

303
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,170
I've already submitted it

304
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,490
to the public recruitment email address.

305
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,410
I don't need you to do that for me.

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,810
with my own efforts.

308
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,890
How confident!

309
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,410
You're worthy to be my girlfriend.

310
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,500
Of course.

311
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,290
Now that I've made up my mind,

312
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,250
I should return to the lab

313
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,330
openly and honorably.

314
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,330
Actually, in such a short time,

315
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,970
it's unrealistic to systematically

316
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,530
improve your theoretical knowledge.

317
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,050
The research assistant position

318
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,090
emphasizes practical experience more.

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,450
Wei'an,

320
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,370
you might have to work very hard

321
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,250
in the coming days.

322
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,370
You should be prepared for that.

323
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,370
Don't worry.

324
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,330
I'll enjoy my hardship.

326
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,690
When was Su Wei'an here last time?

327
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,530
Wei'an? More than a week ago.

328
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,890
Isn't she preparing for an exam?

329
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,650
An exam?

330
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,330
You don't know?

331
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,210
She wants to get into Huaren's lab
as a researcher.

332
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,250
To get in there,
she has to pass an exam.

333
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,930
So recently she's been busy
preparing for it.

334
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,050

If he just directly hires Wei'an,
wouldn't that be easy?

338
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,930
Why bother with an exam?

339
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,970

of yours never went out.

403
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,170

404

475
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,340
I'll never regret it.

476
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,860
Not too much stuff.

477
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,900
I used to feel like

478
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,340
my home was too empty,

479
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,420
so it's good to fill it up a bit.

480
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,660

are you not leaving tonight?

about you moving in with me?

489
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,180
I told her it was too busy in the lab,

490
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,660

00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,820
that you made Prof. Wen
from Zhang He Hospital

556
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,820
embarrassed on the stage.

557
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,180
I did ask several more questions.

558
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,580
That's because

559
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,420
I thought Prof. Wen's explanation

560
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,220
of the adverse events was unclear,

561
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,740
and academic conferences

562
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,740
are for exchanging ideas
and discussions anyway.

563
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,860
So,

564
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,100
you wanted to use our department
as a stepping stone

565
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,700
to get justice for your aunt, right?

566
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,820
No.

567
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,740
I wanted to show them

568
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,220
that research should be done properly.

569
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,100
Even if my desire to get results

570
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,460
is a hundred times stronger than theirs,

571
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,900
I would never accomplish it

572
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,740
by sacrificing safety

573
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,060
and authenticity.

574
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,540
Next time,

575
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,580
when you confront famous professors
from other hospitals,

576
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,980
remember to bring

577
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,340
solid evidence you've found.

578
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,460
Did I

579
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,580
pass the interview?

580
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,180
Let's see

581
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,460
if you can

582
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,180
pass the second round of interviews.

583
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,460
Thank you, Mr. Wang!

[Diligent, Adopt, Veracity]

586
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,820
Didn't I ask you to wait at home?

587
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,740
After all, I'm interviewing
for your research team,

588
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,860
and we should avoid
any contact in public.

589
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,820
I'm not afraid of that.

590
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,220
You are the one that's afraid.

591
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,340
I just wanted to be the first
to confirm the good news.

592
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,420
Looks like,

593
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,340
you are sure of success.

594
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,820
That's hard to say.

595
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,620
I was fine with thinking on my feet,

596
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,340
but you know

597
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,980
my academic pedigree isn't an advantage.

598
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,540
It's okay.

599
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,940
Just prepare well
for the second interview.

600
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,100
The first one
is just to get first impressions.

601
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,820
The second one is what really matters.

602
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,620
It tests your practical abilities.

603
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,300
Is Mr. Wang Huanzhong

604
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,700
still the main interviewer
for the second one?

605
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,980
You'd better be careful.

606
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,100
Mr. Wang Huanzhong

607
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,820
doesn't tolerate the slightest flaw.

608
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,620
You can experience for yourself

609
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,460
his death stares during the interview.

610
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,940
Death stares?

611
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,700
Get in the car.

612
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,540
Slippers, Jiang.

613
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,060
Sorry, Jiang.

614
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,220
It's a bit messy in my home.

615
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,220
Flattie!

616
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,700
No.

617
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,340
Your place is better than I thought.

618
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,580
Let me clean up a bit.

619
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,340
You can sit down for a bit.

620
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,300
OK.

621
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,860
It's so awesome to live alone.

622
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,300
You can do whatever you want.

623
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,060
Put your clothes anywhere you like.

624
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,220
If I did that,

625
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,580
my parents would definitely scold me.

626
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,100
You came out so late.

627
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,220
Won't your parents be worried?

628
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,060
No.

629
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,700
I've talked to them about it.

630
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,700
That's good.

631
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,220
Are you not going to ask me

632
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,740
what I said to them?

633
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,620
What did you say?

634
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,220
I said

635
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,820
I already have a boyfriend now,

636
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,460
and he will take good care of me.

637
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,460
Of course.

638
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,300
I will send you home
no matter how late it gets.

639
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,460
Fang Mingfan.

640
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,740
Don't you think

641
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,500
Dr. Gu and Wei'an's relationship

642
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,100
has progressed in a rapid manner

643
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,140
since they became official?

644
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,460
We're both falling behind.

645
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,580
Are you stressed
about the progress of our relationship?

646
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
It's not a competition.

647
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,180
Your boss and Su Wei'an
are moving in together.

648
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
Are you still unhurried?

649
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,020
It's their own business.

650
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,940
Why should I rush?

651
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,020
Fang Mingfan,

652
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,220
you're so busy

653
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,820
and come home so late every night.

654
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,580
Flattie must feel lonely, right?

655
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,780
Not at all.

656
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,180
Cats are naturally solitary animals,

657
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,580
and Flattie doesn't like it

658
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,060
when we foolish humans cling to them.

659
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,660
Am I right, Flattie?

660
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,580
That won't do.

661
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,940
Flattie needs people to take care of it.

662
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,460
When you're not home,

663
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,580
I can take care of it.

664
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,700
Really?

665
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,180
Yes.

666
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,420
That's great.

667
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,300
I can give you my key.

668
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,540
Remember to lock the door
when you leave.

669
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,940
What's wrong, Jiang?

670
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,540
Fang Mingfan!

671
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,180
You deserve to be single!

672
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,540
Is it that my hints
weren't clear enough,

673
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,540
or is it because I'm not charming?

674
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,060
I'm a girl, after all.

675
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,020
When it comes to staying over,

676
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,940
do you want me
to be more direct with you?

677
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,940
Stay over?

678
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,020
You want to stay the night here?

679
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,660
Wait, Jiang.

680
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,780
I just think

681
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,020
that your home is very nice.

682
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,780
It might be uncomfortable
for you to come over here.

683
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,220
Why would I feel uncomfortable?

684
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,420
I won't feel that way,

685
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,180
Fang Mingfan!

686
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,940
I've always lived

687
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,660
with my parents since I was little,

688
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,060
and I commuted to college from home.

689
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,420
I've never experienced

690
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,180
the kind of alone time you have.

691
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,940
Your place,

692
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,220
even though not very big,
is so carefree.

693
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,660
Doing whatever you want every day,

694
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,220
going to bed whenever you want,

695
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,420
ordering takeout,

696
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,580
and having late-night snacks,

697
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,420
which sound like a blast!

698
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,820
And the best part

699
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,300
is being able to stay with you
and Flattie.

700
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,180
How wonderful!

701
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,820
You really think so?

702
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,340
Yes.

703
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,780
OK.

704
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,440
Do you know

705
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,280
what the next step is?

706
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,480
Subculture of nerve cells.

707
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,960
My answer is the same as Su Wei'an's.

708
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Can you explain

709
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,880
the digestion steps

710
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,520
for the subculturing of glial cells?

711
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,320
The digestion steps
for the subculturing of glial cells

712
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,600
require a 1:1 ratio.

713
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Add 0.125% trypsin

714
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,520
and

715
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,120
0.02%

716
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,960
EDTA.

717
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,960
It is advisable to cover the bottom
of the bottle evenly.

718
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,320
Anything to add to her answer?

719
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,040
Maintain a pH value of 7.5

720
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
and a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius.

721
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,120
You may start.

722
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,040
OK. Finished.

723
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,800
Thanks, Mr. Wang.

724
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,560
Does anyone else need to use this?

725
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,240
No more.

726
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,800
I've finished.

727
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,560
I'll wait for you at the cafe
by the hospital gate.

728
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,280
Sneak attacking me?
It's a little childish for your age.

729
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,480
We're openly
and honestly in a relationship,

730
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,040
but you make it sound
like we're having an affair.

731
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,280
Because we're at the hospital.

732
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,040
Last time, at the first interview,

733
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,040
someone said
that this position was set up for me.

734
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,840
I don't want them to say
you're favoring me for personal reasons.

735
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,800
Personal reasons?

736
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,480
Alright.

737
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,760
Su Wei'an, let me tell you,

738
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,960
no matter what we do,

739
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,520
those gossipmongers

740
