00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
Same as usual.

192
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,980
A latte without ice and an Americano

193
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,340
with double espresso. Thank you.

194
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,130
Okay.

195
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,660
I'll call Assistant Lin back.

196
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,420
Okay.

197
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,740
[Special Care]
[Your special friend is online.]

198
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,530
Su Wei'an.

199
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,860
[Wen Ran]
[The other party invites you to a video call.]

200
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Hello, Wei'an.

201
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,980
Long time no see.

202
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
Is there something going on?

203
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,980
Can't I just chat with you
for no reason?

204
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,980
You know,

205
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,660
you dropped out of school

206
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
and disappeared for three years.

207
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,700
Everyone missed you so much.

208
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,740
I've been worried sick

209
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,020
without any news from you for so long.

210
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,420
Are you still mad at me?

211
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,180
It's been so long.

212
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,020
I'm not mad at you anymore.

213
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,260
We're best friends.

214
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,780
Who are you chatting with?

215
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,700
Yuncheng, look.

216
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,180
Who am I chatting with?

217
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,340
Wei'an.

218
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,260
Wei'an!

219
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,060
Yuncheng.

220
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Long time no see.

221
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,100
I didn't expect you two to be together.

222
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,540
Congratulations.

223
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Thank you.

224
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,540
Wei An,

225
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,540
where are you?

226
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,780
Why are you wearing a hospital gown?

227
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Are you hospitalized?

228
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,620
Yeah, it's true, Wei'an.

229
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,060
Are you alright?

230
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,620
I was too excited

231
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,140
to notice that.

232
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,300
No, I'm fine.

233
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,100
It's just a minor injury.

234
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,620
Is that French on the wall behind you?

235
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,220
Wei'an, where exactly are you?

236
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,220
I'm in Lacaya.

237
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,340
Lacaya?

238
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,060
Why did you go there?

239
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,820
Don't you know how dangerous it is?

240
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,060
There were reports of gunfire

241
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,260
in Lacaya just last month.

242
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,660
Yuncheng,

243
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,100
it's not that serious.

244
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,100
Wei'an.

245
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,100
Your idol, Dr. Gu, is also in Lacaya.

246
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,620
Did you see him?

247
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,380
What idol?

248
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Dr. Gu is really smart.

249
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,820
Two years in Lacaya is equivalent

250
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,580
to four years of clinical work in China.

251
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,900
After he returns to China from Lacaya,

252
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,700
he'll definitely be promoted
to a full professor.

253
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,020
You can go

254
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,140
and ask around about him.

255
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
I'm not sure.

256
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,540
Wei'an.

257
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,180
Are you still...

258
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,180
[Assistant Lin]

259
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,340
Yuncheng,

260
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,620
you should answer the call.

261
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,620
Go ahead.

262
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,300
Hello.

263
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,820
Wei'an.

264
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,820
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,940
I have a question for you.

266
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,420
When I was in the lab,

267
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,060
The false positives on the background
of the stain were very serious.

268
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,580
I remember it wasn't like this before.

269
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,660
There could be several reasons.

270
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,540
How long has the serum been sealed?

271
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,820
Half an hour.

272
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,180
Try extending it to one hour.

273
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,180
Right.

274
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,700
When we were in the lab,

275
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,180
the teacher mentioned it.

276
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,580
But I forgot about it
since I've been busy recently.

277
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
Actually,
the teacher never mentioned it.

278
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
It was me.

279
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:04,740
[Su Wei'an]

280
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,180
I thought you would be bullied

281
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,980
by this devious girl again.

282
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,140
She made you

283
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,580
suffer a big loss back then.

284
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,220
Who would dare to bully me
with you around?

285
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,180
You're my only best friend in the world.

286
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,940
Oh, come on.

287
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,620
Ouch.

288
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,300
Sorry,
I accidentally touched your wound.

289
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,420
Let me take a look.

290
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,300
Quickly.

291
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,220
Stop.

292
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,500
Don't try to touch me.

293
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,780
I...

294
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,980
You seem quite happy to tease me.

295
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,260
Let me see
what delicious food you brought me.

296
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,220
Steamed buns.

297
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,380
You have no idea

298
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,060
how bored I am here
all by myself every day.

299
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,780
Luckily, I have you to keep me company.

300
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,780
I won't be able
to keep you company soon.

301
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,660
This weekend, we're joining Dr. Gu

302
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,020
on a medical mission in Labe Village.

303
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,340
Labe Village?

304
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,260
Without you,

305
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,780
I'll have to handle
the translation duties

306
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,980
for the whole medical team.

307
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Then let me accompany you.

308
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,460
No way.

309
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,940
Your wound hasn't fully healed yet.

310
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,100
Stay here obediently to recover.

311
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
Jiang.

312
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,220
The people in the rural areas of Lacaya

313
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,180
speak French with a strong accent,

314
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,740
and some of them
only speak the local language.

315
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,260
You won't be able to handle it alone.

316
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,100
Oh right.

317
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,700
But you still can't go.

318
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
What if your wound gets infected?

319
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
It's too dangerous.

320
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,260
I'll bring some gauze and iodine.

321
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,980
And if anything happens,

322
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,020
don't we have
the most skilled surgeon with us?

323
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,580
Nothing will happen.

324
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,300
Right, Dr. Xu is also going
on the medical mission.

325
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,900
And if we're leaving you alone
at the hospital,

326
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,860
I'm really not at ease.

327
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,020
Okay.

328
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,180
Is Wei'an still online?

329
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,420
She's already offline.

330
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,100
She seems quite busy.

331
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,020
Did she mention

332
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,820
where exactly she is in Lacaya?

333
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,220
I didn't ask,

334
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,860
and I don't know
why she went to such a place.

335
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,100
Lacaya,

336
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,980
why are they both in Lacaya?

337
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,060
[Su Wei'an]

338
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,780
(Wei'an,)

339
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,060
(where exactly are you in Lacaya?)

340
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,540
(Which hospital?)

341
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
Dr. Fang.

342
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,660
This baguette is hard as a rock.

343
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,820
I won't eat it.

344
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,740
I'll keep it for self-defense.

345
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,340
The medical mission will be held
in a remote location this time.

346
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,060
If you don't eat now,

347
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,580
there won't be anything left
when we get there.

348
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,220
Fine.

349
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,620
Let's have breakfast.

350
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,980
I know you worked hard
for the medical mission,

351
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,980
so I asked the cafeteria auntie
to make steamed buns overnight.

352
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Steamed buns?

353
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,980
We have steamed buns to eat now.

354
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Wait a minute.

355
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,860
Let's not eat them just yet.

356
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,380
Is there such a good thing in the world?

357
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,780
Our frugal Miss Su

358
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,660
treats us to a free breakfast?

359
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,780
There must be a catch.

360
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,260
A catch?

361
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,460
If you think there's a catch,

362
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,500
you can give me money instead.

363
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,660
One tea egg,

364
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,700
two steamed buns,

365
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,940
and a cup of soy milk,

366
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,540
would 20 US dollars be too much?

367
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,980
I knew it.

368
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,900
This set of breakfast
costs over 100 RMB.

369
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,340
You're really obsessed with money.

370
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,780
What did you say?

371
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,900
Who's obsessed with money?

372
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
You are!

373
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,300
Can't even fill your mouth when eating.

374
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Fang Mingfan.

375
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,740
Wei'an is kind-hearted and generous.

376
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,140
She paid for everything herself.

377
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,060
Well, these steamed buns
can't be eaten for free.

378
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,020
We should get paid for working overtime
on the weekend.

379
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,020
Dr. Gu should reimburse us.

380
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,700
Alright.

381
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,940
You'll get reimbursed.

382
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,020
Come.

383
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,500
Here you are.

384
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
No cilantro.

385
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,180
What?

386
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,300
I specially made it without cilantro
for you.

387
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,020
How did you know I don't eat cilantro?

388
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,260
Last time we had hot pot,

389
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,060
I saw you picking out cilantro.

390
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,460
You're still picky, even at your age.

391
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
Thank you.

392
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
Go get some more medicine.

393
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What's wrong with you?

394
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,600
Gosh, it stinks.

395
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,320
I told you to drink less water.

396
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,080
The toilet here
will definitely freak you out.

397
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,360
What?

398
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,160
You stepped on shit?

399
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,160
Stop laughing. Get rid of it for me!

400
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Wipe it off.

401
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,280
What's wrong?

402
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,080
My foot.

403
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,920
Come on.

404
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,600
Sit down.

405
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,400
Careful.

406
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,000
Thanks.

407
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,840
It's okay.

408
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,560
Sit tight.

409
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
What's up with her?

410
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,720
Her mom

411
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,320
hasn't been able to speak
or move for three months.

412
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,200
She'd like to have a doctor
treat her mom at her home.

413
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,720
But there's no bus available for her.

414
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,960
She walked hours before getting here.

415
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,000
Please. Please save my mom.

416
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,480
I'll go with you. No worries.

417
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,000
Please help her with her feet.

418
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
Dr. Gu, could you wait for me?

419
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,520
I just sprained my ankle.

420
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,080
But I can go with you very soon.

421
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,360
Forget it.

422
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,360
Just stay here.

423
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,440
Your foot is injured.

424
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,000
It'll be tomorrow when you get there.

425
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,200
No, I have to go.

426
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,440
Dr. Gu, just a second.

427
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,120
Jiang Muying,

428
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,440
you don't need to go.

429
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,040
I'll go alone.

430
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
That won't do.

431
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
I'll go with you.

432
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
But your wound...

433
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,400
It's much better. Don't worry.

434
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,480
Over there?

435
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,560
Yeah, just over there.

436
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Careful.

437
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,080
Mom, the doctor is here!

438
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,640
You'll get better.

439
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Eyes on my finger.

440
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,480
Look at his finger.

441
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Try to hold my finger.

442
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Hold his finger.

443
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,160
Hold it.

444
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,160
Hold it.

445
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,000
Based on her symptoms,

446
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,880
I guess you can make a diagnosis, too.

447
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Acroparalysis

448
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
and dysarthria.

449
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,280
It's probably

450
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
a stroke.

451
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,920
Considering the severity,
she can hardly recover.

452
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,880
Do you have anyone else in your family?

453
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,760
I'll write her a prescription later.

454
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,880
Tell her

455
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
to do this exercise first.

456
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,240
Every day.

457
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,040
Twenty times a set.

458
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,120
Three sets a day.

459
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
This exercise.

460
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,320
Do it every day.

461
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,200
Twenty times a set.

462
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Three sets a day.

463
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,760
The same goes for the legs.

464
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Twenty times a set.

465
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,200
Three sets a day.

466
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
The same goes for the legs.

467
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,240
Twenty times a set and three sets a day.

468
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
No need to be too fast.

469
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,160
Make sure the patient's joints

470
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,680
are fully extended.

471
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,640
No need to be too fast, get that?

472
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,720
This will help your mom recover.

473
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,000
Will my mom recover
if I do this every day?

474
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,520
Will my mom recover
if I do this every day?

475
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,040
Come here.

476
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,160
I believe that

477
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,000
your mom knows you haven't given up.

478
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,280
She'll also keep trying.

479
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,440
Things will get better.

480
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
Be careful not to step on the stones.

481
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
The stones are slippery. Careful.

482
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,040
What's wrong?

483
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
I was thinking

484
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,080
that back at the hospital,

485
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,000
you always ask me

486
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,880
to interpret to the patients faithfully.

487
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,160
But why is today different?

488
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,080
You clearly knew she was beyond cure,

489
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,280
but why did you

490
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,440
keep teaching the girl
tricks of recovery?

491
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,120
Instead of letting them die in despair,

492
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,240
why don't we

493
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,480
let them put up a fight?

494
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
Sometimes,

495
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
love

496
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,000
may create miracles.

497
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,760
What if all the efforts were in vain?

498
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
Are they worth it?

499
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,840
Everything is worth it

500
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
when you're with your loved ones.

501
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,080
Let's find a place
to hide from the rain.

502
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
There's a cave here.

503
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Let's hide in it.

504
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,200
Come on.

505
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,760
What now?

506
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,200
It's pouring outside.

507
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,840
We can only wait here for now.

508
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,200
We'll leave after the rain stops.

509
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Nothing else to do.

510
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,680
Are you not having any signal?

511
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,720
No.

512
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,200
If we can't get in touch with Jiang,

513
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,000
what should we do?

514
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,320
Let's make a fire
and dry our clothes first.

515
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Everything okay with you?

516
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Nothing.

517
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,600
Seems like the rain has wet my wound.

518
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,920
It hurts a bit.

519
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,760
What are you doing?

520
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,040
Your wound can be easily infected.

521
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Let me check.

522
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,040
No need.

523
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,200
I'll have Dr. Xu check it
when we get back.

524
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,720
The rainwater is quite dirty.

525
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
You'll probably have an infection.

526
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:12,800
Are...

527
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,200
Are you being shy?

528
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,160
What's there to be shy about?

529
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,880
It's nothing but a doctor
checking a patient's wound.

530
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm also a medical worker, okay?

531
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,800
Then what's the big deal?

532
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,960
Take away your hands.

533
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Su Wei'an,

534
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,680
I can only see a tiny fraction of gauze.

535
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,960
How am I supposed to check your wound?

536
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,000
I told you I knew how bad it was.

537
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
You really don't have to.

538
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Let me ask you this, Su Wei'an.

539
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,000
In your mind,

540
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,040
am I a doctor or a man?

541
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,200
Of course...

542
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,480
Of course, you're a doctor.

543
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,840
If so, move away your hands.

544
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,880
Since you take me as a doctor,

545
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,120
in a doctor's eyes,

546
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,560
a patient's body

547
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,960
is the sum of a pile of organs.

548
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,280
There's no gender difference.

549
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
You're a man. A man...

550
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,760
In my mind...

551
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
I'll do it myself.

552
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Look for yourself.

553
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,160
It's all wet by the rain.

554
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,200
And you still claimed to be fine.

555
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,200
Press it for now.

556
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,520
I'll change the dressing for you.

557
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,960
Bear with it.

558
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,960
Done.

559
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,000
Does it hurt?

560
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,960
There you are.

561
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Thank you.

562
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,440
Changing the dressing for you
is like fighting a war.

563
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,760
It's quite late already.

564

What? Can't walk any further?

754

Are we lost?

755
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,080
We have a compass.

756
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,040

Su Wei'an,

760
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,680
I thought you were quite brave.

761

Are you scared
by such a little movement?

Not very much.
