And her retest score

186
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
was indeed the first.

187
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,580
However,

188
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,460
her overall academic scores,

189
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,740
as well as in-school GPA
and other achievements,

190
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,700
are all on par with Wen Ran.

191
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,020
Moreover, President Du also believes

192
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,380
that Wen Ran has greater potential for
scientific research.

193
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,140
President Du.

194
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,140
Yunzheng.

195
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,540
Su Wei'an ranked first in
both the written test and the interview.

196
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,860
Why did you abuse your power
and refuse to hire her?

197
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,180
This person

198
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,900
could disrupt the peace of the hospital.

199
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,660
Do you believe that?

200
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,180
In the past, she caused a scandal over

201
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,980
authorship rights.

202
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,380
I would never allow
such a calculating person

203
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,180
to create chaos in Huaren's lab.

204
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,260
No investigation, no right to speak.

205
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,380
It was her authorship
that was taken away.

206
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,740
And it was she who was framed.

207
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,860
What mistakes did she actually make?

208
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,340
She is talented in medicine.

209
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,180
She's skilled,
and she especially loves her job.

210
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,460
My lab

211
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,900
needs talents like her.

212
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,660
The lab needs her

213
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,740
or you need her?

214
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,660
Do you think that everyone is like you?

215
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,340
Don't mix work with private interests.

216
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,700
And take a nurse home as wife randomly.

217
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,580
Mr. Du.

218
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,140
Yunzheng.

219
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,820
No matter how mad you are,

220
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,460
you can't confuse right and wrong.

221
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,180
I got married to your father

222
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,500
after I resigned.

223
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,540
Anyway,

224
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,100
we are the old.

225
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,700
How dare you say
those harsh words to us!

226
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,060
Gu Yunzheng,

227
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,700
it is useless to say that.

228
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,140
You just come here

229
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,340
and beg me for her.

230
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,180
But begging is begging.

231
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,580
Given your attitude,

232
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,260
it is impossible to change my mind.

233
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,980
I don't beg for anyone.

234
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,140
Competition should be fair.

235
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,380
Research assistants from my lab

236
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,380
must be gotten by skilled ability

237
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,700
instead of public opinions

238
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,140
or relations.

239
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,660
Please read this.

240
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,180
More than 90% of people

241
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,620
agree to have an
additional examination in public.

242
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,820
[Public examination? ]
[Yes(90%) No(30%)]

243
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,820
It matters

244
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,220
not only to Su and my fame

245
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,700
but also Huaren's.

246
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,500
If you want fairness,

247
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,340
have a competition

248
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,780
again.

249
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,500
Gu Yunzheng.

250
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,260
I've read the article in the forum.

251
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,300
Those words are dramatically unpleasant.
Do you know?

252
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,780
Is this the way you protect her?

253
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,180
Why did you blame it on me?

254
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,060
Obviously,

255
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,300
Wen Ran is the one to blame.

256
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,100
Why do problems between you

257
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,500
and her always trouble Wei'an?

258
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,180
I don't know
what honey words you said to her

259
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,780
to cheat her so that she stays there

260
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,820
as an assistant

261
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,260
rather than being a front woman here.

262
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,740
If you bring shame to her
without any reason again,

263
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,140
I'll really get angry with you.

264
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,700
I see. Mr. Du had seduced Wei'an with

265
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,300
the position of lab director of Jiehui.

266
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,620
Thank you for your reminders.

267
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,180
If you didn't tell me,

268
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,620
I would never know that

269
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,020
she is so attached to medicine

270
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,060
and scientific research.

271
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,820
Gu Yunzheng,

272
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,020
don't take advantage of Wei'an's love.

273
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,180
If she gets hurt one more time,

274
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,300
we shall see.

275
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,340
There is no need for you to

276
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,500
intrude on my relationship with Wei'an.

277
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,060
Mind your ex-girlfriend.

278
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,580
Let her get away from Wei'an.

279
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,980
Or,

280
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,620
I will not let it go.

281
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,180
Look, what's this?

282
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,700
[Notice of Additional Test]

283
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,260
Maybe your article works.

284
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,620
Yes.

285
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,780
Come.

286
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,180
Thanks, my boyfriend, Mr. Gu.

287
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,460
Su Wei'an.

288
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,380
This time, show your real skills

289
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,980
to everyone.

290
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,300
Let's win the game
with fairness and justice.

291
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,220
Of course.

292
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,820
Just like in university,

293
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,580
you helped me in the game again.

294
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,980
Fighting!

295
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,100
Dear teachers and judges.

296
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,460
Before the test,

297
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,700
I'd like to say a few words.

298
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,540
I had two tests:
a written exam and an interview.

299
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,980
Then, I got the position.

300
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,980
The whole process is transparent.

301
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,260
I have no idea

302
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,780
what the necessity of this test is.

303
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,660
If I win

304
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,420
the game again,

305
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,620
I wonder
if it will be like the last time.

306
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,980
Don't waste public resources

307
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,460
to give someone
with relations the position.

308
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,700
This test

309
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,900
is the last one.

310
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,620
The result will be announced in public.

311
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,180
Okay, sir.

312
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,900
Given that there have been two exams,

313
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,180
tell me your opinions briefly.

314
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,140
As a scientific assistant,

315
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,940
what is the most important thing?

316
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,020
Okay.

317
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,850
I think,

318
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,300
when doing scientific research,

319
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,620
persistence is the most important.

320
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,620
Never give up halfway.

321
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,330
Can't run away

322
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,180
from a minor problem.

323
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,220
I have spent

324
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,940
eight years in poor conditions.

325
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,740
Then, I received my Ph.D.
at Huaren Medical University.

326
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,020
While in school,

327
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,220
I won the first prize in the Science Cup

328
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,620
and other prizes.

329
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,660
I have made great efforts.

330
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,780
I know in my deep heart that
achievements are from accumulation.

331
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,370
And I firmly know

332
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,180
my love and pursuit of
scientific research.

333
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,180
Su Wei'an,

334
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,740
it's your turn now.

335
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,780
Well.

336
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,370
I think,

337
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,330
as a scientific assistant,

338
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,620
the most important is to
keep my feet on the ground.

339
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,780
Do one thing step by step.

340
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,180
Every data,

341
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,220
inference,

342
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,460
and experiment

343
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,180
should be rigorous.

344
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,620
We shouldn't be overanxious
for quick results.

345
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,940
Or even

346
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,780
be deceptive.

347
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,180
Su Wei'an, if you value data
and experiments so much,

348
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,380
have you issued any scientific papers?

349
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,180
And you dropped out halfway.

350
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,940
Do you really know

351
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,620
what academic research actually means?

352
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,580
I do.

353
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,780
While in school,
I finished a professional paper.

354
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,140
Just finished?

355
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,460
Finishing is not the same as publishing.

356
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,060
My essay was issued
by someone in a journal.

357
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,900
Its impact factor is more than 6.

358
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,860
I think
the quality of my paper is not bad.

359
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,020
But why is your content

360
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,900
the same as Wen Ran's, which won

361
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,060
the 1st prize at the Science Cup?

362
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,740
Did you publish it together?

363
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,060
Why not co-author with her?

364
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,860
I did.

365
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,020
After the sponsor
received my reporting letter,

366
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,500
they revoked the 1st prize
as soon as possible.

367
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,180
I wonder

368
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,580
why this prize, which had been revoked,

369
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,020
was in Miss Wen's resume.

370
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
Dear teachers,

371
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,140
although this prize

372
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,940
was reported by Su Wei'an on purpose,

373
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,020
the organizer revoked it
just for the moment.

374
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,320
[The 1st prize of the Science Cup]
I have this.

375
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,200
[Author: Wen Ran]
I have this.

376
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,020
Later, we provided

377
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,020
detailed certification materials.

378
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,820
Our tutor indeed made the decision

379
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,020
by works and contributions.

380
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,820
I didn't rob the first author.

381
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,020
We both know it.

382
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,700
When I left school,

383
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,180
I did not take my experiment diary away.

384
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,340
So you concluded
that I couldn't prove it.

385
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,140
But all teachers know

386
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,500
that scientific research is rigorous,
all linked with one another.

387
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,020
It can't be fake.

388
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,020
The paper is about fluorescent staining.

389
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,700
Miss Wen,

390
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,580
as the greatest contributor,

391
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,380
you should know the methods and steps

392
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,380
of the test clearly.

393
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,700
Absolutely.

394
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,020
I think so.

395
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,500
Because you chose the same way

396
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,820
in your other paper.

397
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,620
I have a question.

398
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,500
In your test,

399
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,780
which First Ab did you choose?

400
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,820
It was long, long ago.

401
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,500
There were many reagents.

402
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,580
How is it possible to remember them all?

403
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,180
You can't remember?

404
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,340
The paper clearly states
that it's from Meika Company.

405
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,940
That's it.

406
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,940
Any problems?

407
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,820
Can you tell the teachers here

408
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,380
what methods did you use

409
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,820
to avoid false positives in your test?

410
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,020
In my paper,

411
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,340
the test report

412
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,460
has specific methods

413
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,020
and detailed materials.

414
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,140
In the paper I reported,

415
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,700
Receptor Proteins First Ab
used in the test

416
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,820
was from America in Mar. 2014.

417
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,580
The company made special labels
on the batch of products

418
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,380
to increase sealing time

419
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,460
and reduce the incubation time
of First Ab.

420
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,620
They used more reagents
to avoid false positives by washing.

421
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,820
After this batch,
their reagents have made progress.

422
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,140
But Miss Wen

423
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
took the same way

424
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,380
in her new paper.

425
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,700
She and her reviewer
didn't realize that,

426
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,020
by her methods,

427
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,820
there were no results at all.

428
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,380
Miss Wen,

429
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,940
will you withdraw your latest paper

430
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,820
or wait for another report?

431
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,260
Maybe I have misremembered.

432
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,260
The reagents I used

433
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,940
were produced in Mar. 2014.

434
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,140
There are three years
between the two papers.

435
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,180
How could it be possible?

436
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,180
When the first test finished,

437
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,820
for the large consumption of reagents,

438
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,940
Mr. He Xiaoguang

439
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,180
told me to apply for more new reagents.

440
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,780
All things were recorded.

441
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,780
Headmaster,

442
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
I may use some reagents

443
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,500
which are left by other teachers.

444
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,260
Teachers,

445
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,380
I have nothing to say.

446
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,380
There is no need to continue.

447
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,020
It is the end.

448
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,700
The personnel
should give a plan right now.

449
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,500
Investigate papers issued in the past
five years in all departments.

450
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,180
If academic dishonesty is found indeed,

451
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,500
no one deserves forgiveness.

452
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,940
Mr. Wang,

453
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,060
especially investigate the two papers

454
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,380
written by He and Wen

455
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,820
carefully.

456
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,460
Scientific research
does not permit any dishonest things.

457
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,340
Huaren is not

458
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,020
a den for iniquity.

459
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,380
Mr. Du,

460
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,940
what is today's score and result?

461
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,980
Everyone is here.

462
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,900
I declare,

463
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,100
from now on,

464
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,500
the Neurosurgery Department will rectify
and reform from head to toe.

465
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,740
Investigate academic misconduct
thoroughly.

466
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
Dr. Gu,

467
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,580
you are in charge of
the investigation of papers.

468
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,180
You can't let go of any flaws.

469
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,100
Yes sir.

470
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,700
Boss, who wins?

471
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,580
Who wins, Boss?

472
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,740
Su Wei'an.

473
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,700
I knew that!

474
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,220
Come, let's have a dinner.

475
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,500
Look!

476
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,500
How does it look?

477
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,220
It is the outfit especially for tests

478
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,620
in school.

479
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,860
Do I look like a doctor?

480
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,620
You are a doctor.

481
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,980
Take a picture.

482
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,500
Three, two, one. Okay.

483
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,740
Look! Is it cute?

484
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,260
Yes.

485
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,340
Wei'an,

486
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,980
this time,

487
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,860
you won the competition with Wen Ran.

488
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,460
But it doesn't mean

489
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,260
that gossip will disappear.

490
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,340
Are you really ready

491
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,860
to work together with me?

492
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,700
Sure.

493
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,860
I am admitted to Huaren without stains.

494
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
I will not lose your face.

495
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,340
More than that.

496
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,220
I have higher demands.

497
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,700
I know, I know.

498
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,860
I still remember how you tortured me

499
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,020
in the past.

500
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,260
I mean.

501
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,620
This time,

502
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,620
we need to spend the shortest time

503
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,740
on finding relative evidence

504
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,100
of arterial aneurysm and HDQ39.

505
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,860
Otherwise, there is a risk

506
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,460
of new adverse events.

507
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,500
Compared to the past,

508
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,700
our work will be

509
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,860
much more.

510
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,620
You'd better get ready for it.

511
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,500
Smell nice?

512
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,580
It seems you are the fox.

513
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,500
You!

514
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,700
I regret to move here.

515
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,500
It is definitely a trip
into the lion's den.

516
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,140
I'll give you the chance

517
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,020
to call me 24/7.

518
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,900
No way.

519
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,640
Mr. Gu is ready to be

520
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,520
a barista, masseur, and chef.

521
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,520
Offer service to Miss Su
for 24 hours online.

522
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,640
Your identities are a lot.

523
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
There is another one.

524
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,800
Son-in-law of Su's family.

525
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
When will you take me to see Lan?

526
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,720
Push your luck.

527
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
It is late.

528
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,520
I'll take the subway. You drive.

529
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,360
See you later in the hospital.

530
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
What? Wei'an.

531
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,280
Don't

532
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,480
you eat?

533
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,520
I'll eat in the hospital.

534
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,880
It is my first day. I can't be late.

535
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,720
I…I've made great efforts.

536
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,280
We have been living together,

537
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,280
but we can't go to work together.

538
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,880
What a tragedy.

539
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,920
Well, Su Wei'an,

540
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,760
to get even with me and Mr. He,

541
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,920
you bring shame on me in public.

542
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,360
I just told the truth.

543
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,640
How can it be a shame?

544
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,280
The last time I video-chatted with you.

545
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,600
You already knew
there was a problem in Ab.

546
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,720
You didn't tell me anything
at that time,

547
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,520
but told me during the additional exam.

548
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,000
Wen Ran.

549
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,800
In the past, I took you as my friend.

550
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,640
I answered what you asked.

551
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,880
I helped with what you needed.

552
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,800
But after you said something to Mr. He,

553
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,120
turning the facts upside down,

554
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,760
you are not my friend anymore.

555
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,880
Don't say how good you are.

556
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,520
Yes.

557
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,920
You did the experiments.

558
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,280
You wrote the paper.

559
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,800
But without my father's help,

560
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,400
your paper would never

561
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,760
have been published in a journal
whose impact factor is more than 6.

562
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,040
It was Prof. Wen who

563
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,280
polished that paper.

564
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,520
Indeed.

565
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,360
With your own ability,

566
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,160
it is impossible to polish it.

567
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,720
You…

568
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,920
You are the one who begged me to

569
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,400
admit your aunt

570
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
into the HDQ39 clinical trial.

571
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,760
I did it.

572

What do you want to make me do?

573
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
I actually should thank you
for asking your dad.

574
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,120
But I have heard that

575
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,520
my aunt strictly followed

576
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,800
the rules of allocation concealment.

577

You don't need to flaunt it.

578
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,280
It was you who begged my father

579
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,720
to be admitted into his trial.

580
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,760
And you got it.

581
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,520

You are unhappy now.

582
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640

583
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,360
that you are ungrateful.

his efforts and contributions.

I'll get you for that.

592
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,240
Liang Yayi, why did you stain Ran?

we can't control what people say.

596
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,920
I saw that Wen Ran gave a watch to

597
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,160
the pre-president myself.

598
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,120
The points were close.

599

601
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,400
He was playing basketball.

602
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,000
He left his watch on the court.

603
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,000
I picked it up and gave it to him.

604
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,880
You picked a totally new watch

605
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,760
with a box?

606
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,120

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
It is impossible to deny.

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,400

From then on, it is impossible for him
to get promoted.

doctoral defense is forbidden.

it's never too late for revenge.

for Huntington's dopamine system,

00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,200
how many kinds does it have?

680
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,000
How does it work?

681
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,000
Two.

682
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,680
For motor and non-motor symptoms.

683
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,800
It works mainly by

684
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,600
inhibiting VMAT

685
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,320
and blocking
dopamine receptors directly.

686
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,360
Recently, there have been drugs
in development.

687
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,160
In the recent two years,

688
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,200
how many drugs
have been made to clinical Phase III?

689
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Three.

690
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,640
They are NRT057, HYD902

691
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,400
and HDQ39.

692
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,000
But the first two drugs

693
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
have been stuck in a bottleneck
for more than a year.

694
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,720
Why?

695
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,720
The reason…

696
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,160
The reason is complicated.

697
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,360
The two drugs

698
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
have been analyzed

699
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,560
in the paper
on Phase III clinical results.

700
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,800
And subgroup analysis

701
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,400
also shows significant differences.

702
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,240
One opinion is that

703
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,800
the effect of the drug lasts long.

704
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,160
Observation time is not long enough.

705
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,200
There's no need to say things

706
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,440
like drug companies
are saving themselves for the future.

707
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,960
What is your opinion?

708
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,440
After all,
the sample is several times larger.

709
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,400
It appears that the result was diluted.

710
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,080
You mean that the result of Phase III
is inaccurate?

711
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,920
No.

712
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,640
I mean that the result of Phase II
may be out of track.

713
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Where does it come from?

714
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,640
In the clinical result of Phase II,

715
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,240
what is the duration of
the enrolled patients?

716
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,120
Median.

717
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
In the clinical trial of phase III,

718
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,440
what are the inclusion criteria
based on?

719
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,640
It is in the supplements.

720
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,200
I only read the text.

721
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,960
You spent 8 hours on 10 papers.

722
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,440
Every paper took 40 minutes.

723
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,920
What did you read?

724
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,840
No matter it is a text or supplement,

725
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,920
for evaluating research,

726
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,320
they are very useful

727
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,800
and very important.

728
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,120
Why can't you answer it?

729
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,640
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

730
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,200

731

Mr. Gu,

732
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,920
I know you are strict.

733
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,400
But Miss Su

734
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,360
did not finish her master's degree.

735
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,920
It is her first day here.

736
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,680
You gave her so many tasks.

737
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,720
It is perfect for her to do so.

738
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,560

739
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,120

740

741

It can't be forgiven at all.

743

00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,000
you will be blamed for
securing advantages through relations.

745
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
Yes, Mr. Gu.

746
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,880
Before getting off work,

747
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,000
I will read it intensively,

748
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,360
including the supplements.

749
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,160
I bought it after a long queue.

750
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,200
Boss,

751
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,320
you must have learned face-changing.

752
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,440
You are totally different after work.

753
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,400
I am not the boss.

754
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,600
You are the boss.

755
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,200
How dare I.

756
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,600
You bossed around
when you assigned work.

757
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
I was shocked and I am still shaking.

758
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,960
Which boss does that to you?

759
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,400
Let me help you.

760
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,920
I thought you were mad

761
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,440
when I said that in public.

762
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,120
Am I stupid?

763
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,920
I know you are helping me.

764
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,160
And it is additional test
that causes thesis rectification.

765
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,440
It's normal that people are mad at me.

766
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,320
Anyway, the more strictly you treat me,

767
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,000
the more they sympathize with me.

768
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,080
Yes,

769
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,150
but not exactly.

770
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,190
What do you mean?

771
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,840
You really want to criticize me?

772
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,150
Go home.

773
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,600
Eat first, then talk.

774
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,400
Talk first, then eat.

775
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,190
Wei'an,

776
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,630
why do I make you read those papers

777
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,480
to keep up with
all the research developments?

778
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,920
What is our goal?

779
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,600
Prove the question of HDQ39

780
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,150
and its connection with aneurysm.

781
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,000
Definitely.

782
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,400
Have you thought about

783
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,560
why one kind of drug
with similar mechanisms

784
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,920
always failed
in the third phase of the clinic?

785
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,640
In this case,

786
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,560
compared to all the crowning arguments

787
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,400
inside the paper,

788
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,120
should we

789
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,560
understand what they're really doing?

790
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,560
Should you learn supplements

791
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
in all fields?

792
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,600
Yes.

793
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,600
I didn't think this through.

794
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,440
How about starting tonight?

795
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,840
Let's

796
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,440
read these ten papers

797
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,360
word by word.

798
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,800
Find breakthroughs in papers

799
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,240
to design the experiment.

800
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,680
So many works.

801
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,840
I should not fall in love
with the teacher.

802
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,240
There are endless review materials

803
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,800
and endless tests every day.

804
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,920
What?

805
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,000
Are you afraid?

806
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,920
It is too late to regret.

807
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,960
Do you think

808
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,800
other couples are the same as us?

809
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,640
Work day and night?

810
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,160
Don't you want to work?

811
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,840
Do you want to do other things?

812
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,560
The meal's ready!

813
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,920
I'm addicted to my studies.

814
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,480
Have it.

815
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,360
Here you are, broccoli.

816
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,240
Mummy.

817
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,440
Yuncheng is back.

818
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,720
Why did you call me back so hurriedly?

819
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,200
Dad?

820
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,720
Don't drink that.

821
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,760
This is pear and fungus soup
cooked right now.

822
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,280
Here.

823
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,320
All of you are busy.

824
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,680
No one can stay by my side.

825
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,960
Tell me.

826
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,720
I heard that

827
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,960
Ran was not hired

828
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,080
as a research assistant.

829
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,760
There is no space for her to stay
in the hospital.

830
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,360
How about going to your company?

831
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,360
What? Do you want to get involved in
my company's operation?

832
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,520
I know you are broken up.

833
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,680
There's a problem with the program

834
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,760
Prof. Wen is working on.

835
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,240
But Ran's heart to you never changes.

836
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,520
And your company needs someone like Ran.

837
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,720
She knows what's best for you.

838
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,280
She can help you solve tough problems.

839
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,760
Tough problems?

840
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,280
Yuncheng, just like what I said.

841
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,760
Our 3-year relationship

842
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,000
can't be passed away easily.

843
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,520
Ran,

844
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,520
I heard that

845
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,280
you didn't
get the research assistant job

846
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
in the end.

847
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,480
Jiehui needs a market manager.

848
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,040
Come here and help me.

849
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,320
Yuncheng,

850
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,480
the reason that
I interviewed for the job

851
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,280
is that I think no matter when,

852
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,280
as long as you need me,

853
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,080
I can stay by your side.

854
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,680
But I don't know
that I was set up by Su Wei'an.

855
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,720
When I videoed her earlier,

856
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,960
I asked her what to do
if false positives stay after staining.

857
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,040
She didn't mention the Ab.

858
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,680
She trapped me on purpose.

859
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,800
These don't matter.

860
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,280
I know your ability.

861
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,520
But there is a requirement

862
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,040
for performance.

863
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,800
The criteria can't be loosened

864
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,960
because you were introduced by me.

865
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,080
Can you

866
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,840
understand that?

867
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,040
Sure.

868
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,320
I don't need any special treatment.

869
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,440
As long as I am in your company,

870
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440
and I can see you from far away,

871
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,360
I am satisfied.

872
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,480
Yuncheng,

873
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,160
I know

874
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,640
you loved Su Wei'an in the past.

875
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,080
When you see her again,

876
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,440
it is hard to let it go.

877
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,160
But she is

878
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,680
Gu Yunzheng's girlfriend now.

879
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,160
Can we...

880
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,680
Ran.

881
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,400
I've put a lot of work

882
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,760
into HDQ39.

883
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,240
I think you know.

884
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,480
Now the company is trapped in

885
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,080
such a big negative report.

886
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,720
It's not clear
if this program will make it to market.

887
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,240
If it can't be handled well,

888
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,560
it is a fatal blow to Jiehui.

889
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,720
So,

890
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,200
I am not in the mood

891
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,800
for anything else.

892
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,060
[Zhang He Hospital]

893
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,440
The blind-breaking result shows that

894
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,160
patients of three samples
have adverse reactions

895
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,960
after having HDQ39

896
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,040
instead of a placebo.

897
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,640
How do you

898
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,080
explain this?

899
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,720
Teacher,

900
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,600
no more than 10 percent of the samples
were lost.

901
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,960
It will not affect the launch of HDQ39.

902
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,040
We still haven't figured out

903
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,320
the side effects of this drug.

904
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,600
Can it be launched rashly?

905
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,880
As long as the process is compliant,

906
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,840
it won't be affected.

907
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,000
You prepare materials now

908
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,080
to submit a report
to the Ethics Committee.

909
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
They will make a decision.

910
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,760
Teacher.

911
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,040
Our patients have adverse reactions

912
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,200
after dropping out.

913
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,680
It can be reported.

914
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,240
Yang,

915
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,560
don't forget we are doctors.

916
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,840
We consider

917
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,520
patients' health as the first

918
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,560
instead of other things.

919
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,280
I have studied HDQ39

920
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,440
to relieve the

921
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,480
symptoms of Huntington's Disease

922
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,960
instead of going to market or interests.

923
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,680
Given those words

924
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,000
you have said,

925
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,760
you are not like a doctor
of Zhang He Hospital,

926
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
but a staff of Jiehui.

927
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,320
Teacher.

928
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,960
Tell me.

929
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,320
What benefit did Jiehui really give you?

930
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,600
Teacher,

931
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,200
I admit

932
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,560
that I do have a bit of a rush.

933
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
That is because I don't want to see

934
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
our years of hard work gone by my eyes.

935
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,200
There is no benefit transfer

936
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,160
between me and Jiehui.

937
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,080
If you don't believe me,

938
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
you can ask Miss Wen.

939
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,240
She is a staff of Jiehui now.

940
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,040
What?

941
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,900
[Wen Ran, the job matching group of
HDQ39 and Jiehui]

942
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,920
Dad, you are back.

943
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,320
Mr. Wen,

944
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,920
have some water.

945
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,960
Ran,

946
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,600
why don't you tell us before you

947
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,080
work in Jiehui?

948
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,720
I am not interested in the clinic.

949
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,160
I am fond of scientific research.

950
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,120
Luckily, there is a work there.

951
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,120
Jiehui is a big company.

952
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,480
Ran,

953
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,360
I remember you told us that

954
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
you are applying to Huaren Hospital

955
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,720
as a research assistant.

956
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,840
Yeah.

957
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,640
I've considered this a lot.

958
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,440
I think

959
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,880
Jiehui's treatment
is better than Huaren's.

960
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,120
Is it the truth?

961
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,520
Or you just can't get in?

962
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,400
I have figured out

963
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,840
the whole story
of how you got to Jiehui.

964
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,240
Do you know?

965
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,640
Huaren fired your daughter.

966
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,000
Ran,

967
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,040
is that true?

968
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,520
What is going on?

969
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,040
No. Dad.

970
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,880
It is Su Wei'an.

971
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,880
She wanted to compete with me

972
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,320
for the research assistant.

973
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,480
She just wanted to prove that

974
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,200
your HDQ39 has something wrong.

975
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,560
She's up to no good.

976
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,720
Ran, why are you still lying?

977
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,120
Su Wei'an is
the principal author of the paper,

978
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,720
which was published in the journal,
whose impact factor is more than 6.
