Will you leave this escapist alone?

19
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,100
Dr. Li is too good to be true.

20
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,820
It would be a happy ending

30
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,020
they reveal how deeply you love me.

31
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,660
Your words convey the opposite
of their meanings.

32

When you say
you have nothing to do with me,

33
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,020

34
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,780
is that you love me.

35
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,700

to start a relationship with me.

00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,400
I'll provide you with pure help,

372
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,720
and I will do my best.

373
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,120
Great.

375
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,940
[Lu Zhengxing's personal information]

376
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,960
Hello?

377
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,240
What?

378
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,080
Okay.

379
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,280
Understood.

380
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,200
What's wrong, Yuncheng?

381
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,200
Dr. Lu's flight was rescheduled.

382
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,360
He arrived two hours early.

383
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
And he was picked up
by Huaren's Dept. Neurosurgery.

384
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,640
Huaren's Dept. Neurosurgery?

385
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,400
Do they also want
to introduce this patent?

386
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,920
Dr. Lu has a busy schedule here.

387
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,760
Huaren Hospital must aim at that

388
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,480
by jumping the queue.

389
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,920
Go,

390
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,680
let's intercept him at the hotel.

391
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,440
Understood.

392
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,620
[Lu Zhengxing's personal profile]

393
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,760
Dr. Lu.

394
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,880
It's an honor to have you accept

395
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,400
Prof. Wang Huanzhong's invitation

396
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,120
to pay a visit to Huaren Hospital.

397
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm here

398
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,120
because Prof. Wang

399
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,240
is involved in a critical surgery.

400
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,200
He's occupied.

401
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,960
So he sent me to pick you up.

402
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,960
Now I'll take you to the hotel.

403
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,040
Prof. Wang will invite you
to a dinner tonight.

404
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,480
Dr. Gu.

405
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,560
This old gentleman
doesn't understand Chinese, does he?

406
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,680
He just ignored you all the way.

407
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,480
Should we find a French interpreter?

408
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,960
Our interpreter is ready.

409
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,240
Dr. Gu, I'll be waiting for you
in the parking lot.

410
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,680
Okay.

411
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,520
I heard Huaren's staff picked up Dr. Lu.

412
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,520
I didn't expect it to be you.

413
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,560
We arranged our pickup with Dr. Lu

414
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,240
a month in advance.

415
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,160
I didn't expect

416
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,440
that there would be a line-cutter.

417
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,480
It's about having good relations,

418
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,280
not about who was first in line.

419
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,200
Our Director Wang
is Dr. Lu's old friend.

420
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,120
He's more aware of the schedule changes.

421
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,160
I'll talk to Dr. Lu now.

422
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,520
Su Wei'an.

423
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,920
Hello.

424
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Mr. Du, you seem so determined.

425
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,920
You even brought a French interpreter.

426
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,800
Wei'an is not only my interpreter

427
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,920
but also my close partner.

428
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,720
Close partner?

429
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,400
Does your girlfriend know that?

430
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,560
I've ended things with Wen Ran.

431
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,400
The one I like is Wei'an.

432
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,920
I'm pursuing her.

433
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,720
Are you aware

434
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,280
of her past with me in Lacaya?

435
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,760
Has Su Wei'an ever replied

436
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,920
to your wishful pursuit?

437
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,360
I don't care about the story

438
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,040
between you in Lacaya.

439
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,400
It's in the past.

440
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,520
It won't affect my affection for her.

441
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,480
You should understand

442
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,400
it's all over.

443
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,920
Stop sticking to her.

444
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,160
Dr. Lu,

445
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,640
we are from Jiehui Medicines Company.

446
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,720
We've been in touch before.

447
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,720
Jiehui?

448
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,480
Is this the company
that wants to buy my patent?

449
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,760
Oh, you're capable of Chinese.

450
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That's great.

451
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,400
Our company hopes...

452
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,240
I won't sell it.

453
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,240
Dr. Lu,

454
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,350
Mr. Du has prepared a dinner party
for you.

455
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,960
We can discuss it at the table.

456
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm not hungry.

457
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,280
This is my private time.

458
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,920
Don't discuss work with me now.

459
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,390
Let me help you with the luggage.

460
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,160
This way.

461
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,830
Have some water.

462
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,160
Thank you.

463
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Dr. Lu,

464
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,120
have some water.

465
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,360
That way.

466
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Dr. Lu,

467
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,400
please don't leave yet.

468
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
I know you are fluent in Chinese.

469
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,080
But during your home trip this time,

470
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,920
a considerate and reliable guide

471
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,320
will enhance your experience.

472
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,480
What do you think

473
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
if I serve as your tour guide?

474
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,280
Why should I let you be my tour guide?

475
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,320
Because I'm very familiar
with Jinhai City.

476
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,960
I know the places to eat,
drink, and have fun.

477
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,760
Take this store for example.

478
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,960
Guests here

479
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,000
usually choose dishes

480
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,640
like Spicy Sichuan Skewers,
Spicy Tofu Pudding,

481
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,520
or Wonton in Chili Oil...

482
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,120
But in this store,

483
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,240
the best dish
is Deep-fried Sticky Rice Balls.

484
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,440
They have a perfect ratio
of brown sugar to oil.

485
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,960
The dish is really soft and sweet.

486
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,960
That's it.

487
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,040
I don't want a lengthy introduction

488
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,920
about the company.

489
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,760
I know.

490
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,360
I'll be your tour guide from now on.

491
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,360
I won't mention the company

492
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,680
unless you ask about it.

493
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,480
I won't pay you a guide fee.

494
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,280
It doesn't matter.

495
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,120
You see,

496
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,480
my boss is here.

497
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,400
He will pay the bills.

498
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,360
I can enjoy the tour for your sake

499
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,640
at the company's expense,

500
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,560
right?

501
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,680
I can afford my expenses.

502
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,920
It's not about the money.

503
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,520
If he's here,

504
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,280
we'll be able to savor a few more dishes
and not waste them.

505
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,240
Otherwise, the two of us will waste food
if we buy more

506
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,840
and experience less fun if we buy less.

507
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,920
Right?

508
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,080
You make a point.

509
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,960
You can also help us with the dishes.

510
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,080
But I must be clear.

511
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,480
This is my private time.

512
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Don't discuss work with me.

513
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,920
Otherwise,

514
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,120
I might get angry.

515
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,280
Since you are familiar
with the food here,

516
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,480
please order for us.

517
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,480
No problem.

518
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,480
Excuse me.

519
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,160
Let's move on, Miss Su.

520
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,960
I've already figured out

521
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,240
where we're going next.

522
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,320
Dr. Lu,

523
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,640
don't you need a rest?

524
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,480
You've just returned from France.

525
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,040
Do you need jet lag?

526
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,840
Although I'm quite energetic,

527
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,520
I'll be exhausted

528
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,640
after another 3-hour walk.

529
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,400
But we'll be late there.

530
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,360
We won't.

531
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,040
The place offers free entry.

532
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,760
Even if it's as late as midnight,

533
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
I'll accompany you there.

534
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,920
Let's take a break first.

535
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,440
Have a seat, Dr. Lu.

536
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,080
Hello, teacher.

537
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,800
Dr. Lu is really a tough nut to crack.

538
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,040
Since we picked him up,

539
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,280
he has been making things
difficult for us.

540
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,200
And...

541
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
he refuses to talk about work affairs.

542
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,560
Dr. Lu is indeed a stubborn guy.

543
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,680
Just continue to spend time with him.

544
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Faith will move a mountain.

545
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,040
Understood.

546
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,280
Ran.

547
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,800
It's been a long time. I've missed you.

548
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,640
Why haven't you come to see me?

549
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,040
Auntie,

550
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,160
help me give this toy bear

551
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,960
back to Yuncheng.

552
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,160
It's a token of our love.

553
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,040
But it's not appropriate for me
to keep it anymore.

554
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,240
What's happened between you two?

555
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,600
Has Yun Cheng bullied you again?

556
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Yuncheng...

557
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,600
he won't answer my calls

558
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,880
or reply to my messages.

559
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,800
Why?

560
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,480
Yuncheng...

561
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,700
has shifted his love to another girl.

562
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,340
Who?

563
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,020
Her name is Su Wei'an.

564
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,660
She's our classmate in college.

565
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,380
Back then,

566
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,620
Yuncheng had a secret crush on her.

567
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,380
And now,

568
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,220
he has even brought her
into his company.

569
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,100
How could Du Yuncheng be so foolish?

570
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,620
Auntie.

571
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,820
Please don't blame Yun Cheng.

572
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,020
During our schooldays,

573
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,860
Wei'an and I used to be friends.

574
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,900
But she ended up

575
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,980
stealing my academic work

576
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,260
and was expelled from university.

577
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,260
I think this time,

578
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,100
she means to get back at me.

579
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,820
And it's causing trouble for Yuncheng.

580
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,140
Don't worry.

581
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,820
I promised you that

582
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,220
you'll be Yuncheng's only wife.

583
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,780
No one else can take your place.

584
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,980
That girl

585
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,140
won't get near the company

586
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,060
or Yuncheng

587
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,580
that easily.

588
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,060
Yuncheng

589
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,260
is my first love.

590
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,820
I...

591
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,420
I can't let him go.

592
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,300
Don't worry,

593
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,260
I'll handle this situation.

594
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,100
You'll be satisfied with the outcome.

595
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,700
Uh-huh.

596
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,660
What on earth does Dr. Lu want?

597
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,020
He just refuses
to talk about his patent.

598
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,420
What conditions is he dissatisfied with?

599
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,860
The price?

600
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,700
Or the exclusivity clause?

601
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,220
We can't go on like this with him.

602
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,900
I'm getting a call.

603
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,780
Mom.

604
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,020
Yuncheng,

605
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,700
I suddenly felt sick in my heart

606
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,580
while I was shopping.

607
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,580
Can you come and pick me up?

608
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,780
Yuncheng, over here!

609
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,780
Mom, what's the matter with you?

610
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,340
I'm fine.

611
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,300
I called you here

612
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,620
to enjoy a meal with me and Ran.

613
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,020
You might have made an excuse
and refused it.

614
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,220
I'm busy with accompanying
Dr. Lu from France.

615
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,420
I'm not free.

616
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,580
I'll leave now if you're all right.

617
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,580
Wait.

618
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,220
I think someone enchants you.

619
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,100
Your dad may blame you.

620
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,980
It's enough.

621
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,780
I know you two are bickering.

622
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,620
Just have a meal with us.

623
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,900
You two can watch a movie
and talk things over.

624
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,420
Don't bring misunderstandings
between you two

625
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,220
for an insignificant person.

626
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,580
You know,

627
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,900
your dad and grandpa

628
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,660
are satisfied with Ran.

629
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,140
Auntie,

630
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,460
I will forgive Yuncheng.

631
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,140
Yuncheng was just joking with me,

632
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,580
didn't you?

633
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,780
I know you've been upset.

634
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,220
What's stopping him

635
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,420
from selling his patent?

636
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,900
I see!

637
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,220
What are you reading?

638
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,660
It's a trade secret.

639
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,580
Stop peeping.

640
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,660
What trade secret?

641
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,580
It's just your chat with Du Yuncheng.

642
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,220
I'm not interested in it at all.

643
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,580
Then don't ask about it.

644
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,220
Does it matter to you whom I chat with?

645
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,340
Girl,

646
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,100
are you still not giving up?

647
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,780
I've made my attitude clear.

648
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,300
My patent

649
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,420
won't be sold at any price.

650
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,580
Dr. Lu,

651
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,780
we agreed not to discuss work.

652
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,580
I'm just your tour guide now.

653
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,580
There's another landmark in Jinhai City

654
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,580
that you haven't visited yet.

655
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,700
If you miss it,

656
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,140
your trip won't feel perfect.

657
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,660
Where is it?

658
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,820
Come with me.

659
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,660
It's a trade secret.
You're not allowed to follow.

660
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,020
I've invited him to follow.

661
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,660
If the next place you take me

662
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,900
can't impress me,

663
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,580
I might sell my patent to him.

664
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,340
Hear that?

665
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,020
[Six Bar]

666
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,420
Here, Dr. Lu.

667
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,580
Take a seat here.

668
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,140
Is this what you said

669
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,900
to be a landmark of Jinhai City?

670
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,780
What do you know?

671
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,900
Dr. Lu,

672
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,820
The Heaven Band in ONE WAY Bar

673
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,220
is very famous in Jinhai City.

674
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,580
I'll be playing for you tonight.

675
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,980
I promise to keep playing

676
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,780
until you're satisfied.

677
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,700
Great.

678
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,660
I'm expecting your performance tonight.

679
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,420
Okay.

680
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,180
You really go all out

681
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,420
to help Du Yuncheng.

682
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,420
Just leave if you don't like it.

683
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,540
All right.

684
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,780
Let's roll.

685
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,900
Do you love her?

686
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,780
I...

687
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,220
These past few days,

688
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,620
you claim to be receiving me
on behalf of your mentor.

689
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,180
But actually, your mind

690
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,260
was all on her.

691
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,180
And that Mr. Du of Jiehui,

692
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,940
he's the same.

693
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,260
