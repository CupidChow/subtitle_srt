187
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,440
What is the problem?

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,160
The six plates of cells
are all contaminated.

189
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Don't worry.

190
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,920
Clean up all the contaminated cells

191
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,680
as well as the containers.

192
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,680
That won't do.

193
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,080
It must be solved immediately.

194
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,840
Otherwise,

195
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,480
there will only
be more contaminated cells.

196
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
If there's no way

197
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,360
to find the source of contamination
in a short time,

198
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,080
I'll have to clean it inside and out.

199
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,720
You go back first.

200
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll go home when I'm done.

201
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,600
I must find the source
of pollution immediately.

202
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,520
Why is it polluted again?

203
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,640
What exactly is the problem?

204
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,760
Hello?

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840

It's twelve o'clock now.
Why aren't you back?

207
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,640
Why are you coughing?

208
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,560
Why are you coughing so badly?

209
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,560
Let me see.

210
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,760
You got a fever.

211
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,320
Have you been
under too much pressure recently?

212
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,160
I think I just caught a cold.

213
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,520
Where are the antipyretics?

214
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,280
I'll get it.

215

216
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,760
Don't go.

217
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,560
Just stay here with me for a while.

218
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,160
No.

219
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,360
You got a fever.

220
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
I'll get some medicine.

221
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,400
It's late at night.

222
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,280
It's not safe for you to go out alone.

223
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,120
I was alone in Lacaya.

224
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,200
Don't worry.

225
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,480
Give me a break now.

226
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,360
When you were in Lacaya,

227
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,960
you got a hole in your stomach.

228
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,920
All right.

229
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,880
Have a rest and stop talking.

230
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,960
This is the only thing in the fridge.

231
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,160
Bear with it.

232
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Feel better.

233
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,720
That's good.

234
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,560
Go to sleep.

235
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,520
Get some sleep,
and it will be fine tomorrow morning.

236
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,120

237
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,960
If you're not here with me,

238
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,680
I can't sleep.

239
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,040
Don't be so spoiled.

240
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,960
I got a serious fever.

241
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,960
You should stay with me.

242
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,480
Come on, don't do this.

243
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,760
I have to revise
the experimental design later.

244
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,080
Sleep now.

245
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,880
Did you sleep well?

246
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,040
It's eight o'clock.

247
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,920
I only wanted to sleep for two hours.

248
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,360
Do you know
that you snore when you sleep?

249
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,760
How did I get into bed?

250
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,880
How would I know?

251
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,520
You must do it yourself.

252
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,240
I am a patient now.

Why hasn't the fever gone yet?

256
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,960

Go to work quickly.

261

I can take care of myself.

262
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,440
Is that all right?

263
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,240
Yes.

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,160
I know my education is not high enough.

265
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,480
I am not rich in experience, either.

266
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
But for the basic operation,

267
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,440
I can still finish it.

268
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,320
Now I'm going to clean up the lab.

269

If you trust me,

270
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,560
I can help you clean

you can watch it here.

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,940
What's going on
with this vaccination certificate?

373
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,340
It's just on the day
when you got the fever.

374
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,860
Wei'an.

375
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,100
I just performed two surgeries.

376
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,700
I'm tired and hungry now.

377
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,660
Why don't you have lunch with me later?

378
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,580
In two hours,

379
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,900
I will have another operation.

380
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,620
Surgery in two hours

381
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,820
will be done by Fang Mingfan.

382
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,060
You're just a tutor.

383
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,700
You think I don't know?

384
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,900
How do you know that?

385
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,220
You make it clear to me.

386
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,820
Why do you suddenly go
to get vaccinated?

387
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,420
The hospital had
an epidemic a while ago.

388
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,460
As a healthcare worker,

389
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,300
I must protect myself first.

390
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,380
Then I can protect patients.

391
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,900
But is the cholera vaccine necessary?

392
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,180
I think it's necessary.

393
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,220
What if I go to foreign aid one day?

394
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,300
What if the local area
has a high incidence of cholera?

395
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,420
I am actively preventing it.

396
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,100
I think you did that to get a fever.

397
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,180
You did it on purpose.

398
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,900
What do you mean?

399
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,780
Actively participating in vaccination

400
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,180
is every medical staff's duty,

401
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,340
obligation, and mission.

402
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,020
You are out of your mind.

403
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,660
Do you want to know why?

404
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,260
I did it for you.

405
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,300
You stayed in the laboratory
twenty-four hours a day.

406
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,660
You don't go home, don't eat,
and don't sleep.

407
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,820
If I don't have a fever,

408
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,300
who knows when you would go home?

409
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,780
How could you sleep for six hours?

410
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,460
You turned off the alarm clock
that day, right?

411
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,220
I remember setting the clock that day.

412
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,140
No wonder it didn't ring.

413
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,500
I just found some time

414
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,420
when I was free.

415
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,700
But I didn't expect

416
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,420
that the vaccine
had such an impact on me.

417
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,620
I suppose even God
can't stand it anymore.

418
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,500
He doesn't want me to stay
at home alone.

419
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,620
Okay, didn't we get all the results
of the experiment?

420
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,220
We should be happy.

421
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,180
Well...

422
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,700
Let's make a deal.

423
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,900
Don't hide anything
from me in the future.

424
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,820
I don't want to quarrel over anything.

425
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,060
I miss you very much these two days.

426
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
But I didn't have time
to send you a message.

427
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,300
From now on, after we get home,

428
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,820
let's hug like this.

429
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,700
We should do what the lovers do.

430
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,260
What about this?

431
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,100
We're in the hospital.

432
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,180
All right.

433
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,300
Since you mentioned one.

434
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,780
Then I have to mention one as well.

435
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,620
No matter how busy you are
in the future,

436
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,340
You must have
three meals a day on time.

437
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,180
I can't be with you all the time.

438
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,380
For three meals a day,

439
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,100
you must send me WeChat.

440
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,860
I will check it.

441
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,820
And one last thing.

442
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,140
Let me introduce him to you.

443
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,060
This is

444
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,380
my boyfriend, a professor-to-be.

445
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,860
Hope you can take care of him.

446
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,580
Let me introduce her to you.

447
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,980
This is

448
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,460
my girlfriend,
who can't finish graduate school.

449
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,900
You don't have to take care of her.

450
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,140
Great.

451
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,860
May I ask Dr. Gu's girlfriend

452
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,380
if you have any plans for tonight?

453
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,700
Dr. Gu wants to have dinner with you.

454
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,700
Not tonight.

455
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,220
Today, my mother took my aunt

456
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,660
from the sanatorium.

457
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,820
My mother told me to go home for dinner.

458
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,900
Maybe next time.

459
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,980
It doesn't matter.

460
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,700
You see, we've been dating for so long.

461
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,260
It is time

462
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,620
for me to visit your mom and aunt.

463
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
It's not necessary, is it?

464
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,420
Su Wei'an.

465
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,820
Have you told your family

466
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,380
that we are together?

467
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,300
Not yet.

468
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,140
I haven't told them.

469
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,900
Then they don't know

470
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,620
you are living with me yet.

471
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,740
Is it because
your mother doesn't like me?

472
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,700
No way.

473
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,300
My mother likes you very much.

474
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,340
And

475
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,700
she's also grateful to you
for saving my aunt.

476
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,500
That's great.

477
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,860
In this case,

478
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,020
I should go to visit them.

479
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,820
Go.

480
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,700
Let's go.

481
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,180
Let's forget it.

482
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,340
I'm nervous.

483
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,220
Don't worry.

484
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,460
Who's there?

485
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,900
Su Wei'an.

486
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,020
Su Wei'an.

487
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,900
Hello, Mrs. Su.

488
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,020
Dr. Gu,

489
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,620
what are you doing here?

490
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,780
He is here for the dinner.

491
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,260
For the dinner.

492
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,700
Mrs. Su,

493
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,860
today,

494
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,260
I am not here as Dr. Gu.

495
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,100
I am now

496
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,740
Su Wei'an's boyfriend.

497
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,620
Then please come in.

498
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,580
Good.

499
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,620
Come on in.

500
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,260
Wei'an,

501
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,500
you should have told me
that Dr. Gu would come.

502
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,300
Please don't blame Wei'an.

503
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,700
It was my decision.

504
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,500
I heard that you wanted Wei'an
to go home for dinner.

505
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,660
Then I decided to come with her.

506
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,220
It is just a little embarrassing.

507
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,660
We don't have
men's slippers in our house.

508
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,420
This pair is new.

509
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,820
Just keep your shoes.

510
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,980
Yeah, keep them.

511
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,940
It is alright.

512
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,860
I should take them off.

513
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,820
Ms. Su,

514
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,460
speaking of which,

515
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,780
your aneurysm still needs

516
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,900
to have a re-examination of CTA

517
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,740
to see if there is
anything missed last time

518
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,780
or if there are some new problems.

519
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,700
How about this?

520
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,820
When you have time,

521
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,020
let's go to the outpatient clinic

522
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,580
to do another detailed examination.

523
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,700
That's great.

524
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,780
Is the dish ready?

525
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,660
I'll cook.

526
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,900
I'm with you.

527
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,580
I will cook with Wei'an.

528
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,860
That is not good.

529
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,580
Dr. Gu, it's your first time here today.

530
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,300
How can I let you cook?

531
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
It's okay, Mrs. Su.

532
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,340
Now, you and Ms. Su

533
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,580
just sit and rest first.

534
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,820
After I cook the meal

535
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,860
with Wei'an,

536
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,820
let's eat together.

537
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,940
You guys go get some rest.

538
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,500
Let's make pork ribs with potatoes.

539
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,140
Good.

540
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,500
And then chicken wings with garlic.

541
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,980
What else does your mother like to eat?

542
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,420
Come on, eat some fruit.

543
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,260
Roast eggplant.

544
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,460
Then a shredded pork with green pepper.

545
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,660
Is it good?

546
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,500
Yes.

547
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,700
I don't want to eat.

548
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,340
Taste it.

549
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,220
I don't want to eat.

550
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,700
Sister-in-law,

551
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,540
when did they become lovers?

552
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,860
I just found out today.

553
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,140
I have to say,

554
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,740
Wei'an is really strange.

555
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,620
She should tell me when she is in love.

556
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,340
I think Dr. Gu is very nice.

557
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,980
Wei'an has a good taste.

558
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,380
The problem is
that he is too considerate and careful.

559
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,340
It feels a little strange.

560
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,380
That is great.

561
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,500
Be careful. It is spicy.

562
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,700
Stop it, Su Wei'an.

563
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,780
Wei'an,

564
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,540
come here.

565
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,580
Hurry up.

566
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,420
Close the door.

567
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,340
What's the matter?

568
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,260
How long have you been together
with Dr. Gu?

569
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,380
It's been a while.

570
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,940
It's been a while?

571
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,340
During this period,

572
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,820
you haven't told me anything.

573
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,860
Good for you.

574
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,700
You have done a great job
of keeping me in the darkness.

575
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,540
I am not hiding it from you.

576
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,740
I will tell you

577
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,820
when our relationship becomes stable.

578
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,580
Do you live together?

579
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,140
No wonder you were elusive
some time ago.

580
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,740
You didn't come home at night.

581
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,780
How dare you?

582
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,540
So you are living with him now.

583
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,140
It's not like that.

584
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,980
It's because Gu Yunzheng's house

585
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,340
is close to the hospital.

586
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,580
That is why I live there.

587
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,820
It is close to the hospital.

588
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,340
Why are you so lazy?

589
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,380
It's just a few steps away.

590
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,260
Why do you

591
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,940
have to move to his house?

592
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,100
What were you thinking?

593
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,900
All right, don't be angry.

594
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,380
Tell me about it.

595
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,220
How long have you been with him?

596
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,060
How much do you know about him?

597
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,060
What do his parents do?

598
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,020
What are their jobs?

599
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,260
How is their personality?

600
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,140
Will you be bullied
when you go to their house?

601
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,740
The news nowadays

602
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,620
is all about young people
living together

603
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,820
and then taking knives
when they quarrel.

604
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,180
What if you meet a psychopath?

605
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:01,940
What would you do?

606
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,620
What are you talking about?

607
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,220
You are thinking too much.

608
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,620
Nonsense.

609
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,500
All these things I'm talking about

610
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
have happened in real life.

611
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,700
What were you thinking?

612
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,860
All right, Mom.

613
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
I am sorry.

614
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,700
I shouldn't do that.

615
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,100
I should have told you earlier.

616
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,100
I'm too lazy.

617
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,140
I shouldn't live in his house.

618
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,300
I will be diligent from now on.

619
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,780
Okay.

620
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,340
All right.

621
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,660
Don't be angry anymore.

622
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,820
Please forgive me.

623
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,140
Give me a break.

624
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,180
Please hear me out.

625
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,220
Gu Yunzheng is a very good person.

626
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,180
He has sacrificed

627
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,020
a lot for me.

628
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,940
It is a long story.

629
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,940
It is his first time here.

630
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,620
Be happy, shall we?

631
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,020
Be happy.

632
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,740
What's the matter?

633
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,700
Mrs. Su,

634
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,780
I am a local person.

635
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,140
My mother is a bridge architect.

636
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,380
But

637
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,620
she died when I was very young.

638
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,780
My father is also a doctor.

639
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,740
They're divorced,

640
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,140
so I don't have much contact with him.

641
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,220
I can assure you

642
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,820
that as long as Wei'an is with me,

643
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,980
she will not be bullied.

644
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,940
And for your last question,

645
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,300
I can answer you with great certainty

646
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,660
that I'm not a psychopath.

647
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,740
If you still don't feel at ease,

648
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,860
I can do a psychological test.

649
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
All right.

650
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,620
Go to cook now.

651
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,460
Go, Wei'an.

652
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,620
Mrs. Su,

653
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,940
I'm really in a hurry today.

654
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,580
I don't have time for preparation.

655
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,380
So I only cooked a few dishes.

656
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,660
I don't know if it's to your liking.

657
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,860
I hope you will like it.

658
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,620
Dr. Gu,

659
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,580
It is your first time here.

660
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,340
But you cooked yourself.

661
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,940
We are sorry for that.

662
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,740
It's all Wei'an's fault.

663
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,940
She should call me in advance
and let me know.

664
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,580
You bad girl.

665
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,180
You didn't behave well when cooking.

666
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,460
Next time you are here,

667
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,660
I will treat you well.

668
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,580
It is fine.

669
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,740
It's not Wei'an's problem.

670
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,900
It is me. I want to show myself.

671
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,940
So I took her job.

672
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,940
Right?

673
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,980
Enough.

674
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,380
Dr. Gu.

675
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,420
Mrs. Su,

676
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,340
please just call me Yunzheng.

677
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,140
Here.

678
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,700
What are your plans?

679
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,580
Do you plan to get married?

680
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,780
Mom.

681
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,980
I have quite a lot of plans myself.

682
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,220
But most importantly,

683
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,540
it depends on Wei'an.

684
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,340
I don't have any idea.

685
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,300
Mrs. Su,

686
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,980
here is the thing.

687
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,380
No matter whether we get married or not,

688
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,340
and no matter when we get married,

689
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,780
my love for Wei'an is true.

690
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,500
It will never change.

691
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,860
How to prove it?

692
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,340
You still remember?

693
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,060
How did you know?

694
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,540
It is tomato and fried egg noodles.

695
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,460
And it's two eggs

696
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,740
fried on one side only.

697
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,700
Wei'an told me before.

698
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,820
She said

699
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,060
this is the taste of dad.

700
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,980
So I've decided

701
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,900
since then,

702
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,500
I'll cook it for her from now on.

703
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,780
Mr.Su is gone,

704
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,180
but

705
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,620
the taste can go on.

706
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,260
Yes.

707
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,500
Wei'an, eat it.

708
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,220
Come no.

709
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,220
You eat first, mom.

710
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,980
Mrs. Su, you eat first.

711
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,580
Taste if it is the old flavor.

712
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,060
Come and taste it.

713
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,820
Let's eat.

714
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,260
Come on.

715
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,180
Mom, I'll see Gu Yunzheng off.

716
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,900
You guys cooked so much.

717
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,300
You two take it back.

718
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,260
Thank you, Mrs. Su.

719
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,060
The two of us?

720
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,340
Take it back?

721
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,300
Don't you need to go to work tomorrow?

722
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,580
Didn't you tell me

723
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,740
Yunzheng's home is closer
to the hospital?

724
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,260
Mrs. Su, don't worry.

725
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,180
As long as Wei'an is with me,

726
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,700
I will take good care of her.

727
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,340
See you then.

728
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,520
[Outpatient]

729
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,300
Mr. He,

730
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,020
don't forget to return your badge
to the HR department.

731
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,220
(Gu Yunzheng)

732
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,020
(All these things happened)

733
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,260
(because of you.)

734
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,300
You're back.

735
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,660
Ms. Su,

736
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,420
now the sound therapy room
is under ultraviolet disinfection.

737
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,820
But the chess room,

738
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,700
the billiards hall,
and the yoga hall are open.

739
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,500
Why don't you go and play?

740
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,660
No need.

741
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,660
Now there are only a few people

742
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,500
in the sports rehabilitation room.

743
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,460
And we recently hired a new coach.

744
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,620
He is a doctor
of medicine from Sport University.

745
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,380
He can make a rehabilitation plan

746
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,100
for Ms. Su.

747
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,660
I can lead you there.

748
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,100
Aunt Yuan,

749
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,460
exercise physiotherapy
is helpful in delaying the illness.

750
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,860
Shall we go and take a look?

751
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,260
Besides, I can ask the others out.

752
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,980
So you two

753
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,340
can also join her.

754
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,100
Aunt Yuan?

755
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,020
It happens that my waist
is uncomfortable these days.

756
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,180
Can you

757
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,940
ask the coach
to take a look at it for me?

758
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,740
No problem.

759
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,660
This way, please.

760
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,140
Ms. Su, please come with me.

761
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,100
Coach Sun,

762
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,940
this is Ms. Su,
whom I have mentioned to you.

763
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,700
I hope you can

764
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,100
have a rehabilitation plan

765
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,900
that is safe

766
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,580
and able to strengthen
the small muscle groups.

767
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,780
Okay, then I'll get ready first.

768
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,780
First, let's check Ms. Su's

769
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,620
muscle strength.

770
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,500
Thank you.

771
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,580
Let's take a look
at this patient's image

772
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,300
from before taking part in drug trials

773
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,580
[Contrast]
to after the trial.

774
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,540
Aunt Yuan,

775
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,260
have you been to this rehab room before?

776
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,140
Yes.

777
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,860
Have you ever made a video here?

778
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,900
Wei'an,

779
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,060
what is it?

780
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,420
What do you mean?

781
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,980
Du's assistant

782
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,620
told me it was for advertising.

783
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,580
It won't show my face.

784
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,500
How does his assistant

785
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,860
know my aunt is here?

786
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,700
Who introduced this sanatorium to you?

787
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,340
Is it related to Zhang He Hospital

788
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,060
and Yuncheng?

789
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,500
Du wanted good for me.

790
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,740
He was afraid it would be too hard
for me to take care of her by myself.

791
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,100
He told me this place

792
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,180
has signed a...

793
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,100
It's free anyway.

794
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,220
So I want to have a try.

795
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,700
And I took your aunt here.

796
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,500
No.

797
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,380
It is a high-end sanatorium.

798
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,740
How can it be free?

799
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,220
What are you thinking?

800
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,740
You even lied to me
that it was introduced by the neighbor.

801
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,780
Aunt Yuan,

802
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,260
Did he ask you to sign

803
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,260
the voluntary withdrawal agreement?

804
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,100
No.

805
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,660
I...

806
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,500
I quit voluntarily.

807
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,340
I have something to do.

808
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,220
At this year's neurology conference,

809
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,660
HDQ39

810
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,900
was widely questioned.

811
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,700
The party at the scene

812
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,700
exposed three cases
of ruptured aneurysms.

813
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,220
Professor Wen Yuliang, who is
in charge of research and development,

814
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,500
couldn't convince
the public at the conference.

815
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,500
Mr. Du,

816
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,300
I wonder if it is
because you tried to hide it from us

817
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,140
or because of mismanagement.
