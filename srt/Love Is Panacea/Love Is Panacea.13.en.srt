[The show is the Major Project

[in Sichuan Province in 2022]

17
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,980
[Based on the novel "Healer"
by Ningmeng Yuyan]

18
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,060
I heard

19
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,940
that you once performed the surgery

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,100
with a gun to your head, right?

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,540
You know all about it.

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,100
The person with the gun to my head

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,660
is General Kouyate.

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,660
When I was returning
to attend your birthday party,

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,660
he chased me to the airport

26
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,980
just to give me this,

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,860
his gift for you.

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,140
It's a pocket watch made in Germany
during World War II.

29
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,020
I've checked it already,

30
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,900
and it's very accurate.

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,180
It's just like you,
growing stronger with age.

32
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
Good stuff.

33
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,140
You know me so well.

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,580
General Kouyate

35
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,060
asked the president

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,260
to give me this.

37
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,700
Independence Medal.

38
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,140
Just to thank me for saving his life.

39
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,660
Dad, I got something
to do in the company.

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,860
Do you have to go?

41
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,060
Can't you just ask someone else
to do it?

42
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,740
Yuncheng,

43
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,500
it's Grandpa's birthday.

44
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,060
No matter how urgent it is,
it can be delayed.

45
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,500
How about

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,450
eating grandpa's birthday cake first?

47
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,500
Then you can leave.

48
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,060
It's okay. If he is busy,

49
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,220
just let him go first.

50
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,100
I got Yunzheng here.

51
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,660
Go.

52
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,180
Jiang,

53
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,500
why are you here?

54
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,300
Where have you been so late?

55
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,420
I have been waiting for you all night.

56
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,020
Where have you been?

57
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,900
I am asking you.

58
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,780
I am asking you.

59
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,100
I just returned home.

60
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,540
I went to see people's nightlife.

61
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,500
Can't I?

62
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,340
Really?

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,300
When did you come back?

64
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,500
You're not there.

65
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,220
I'm alone.

66
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,300
There's no point in me
staying in that place.

67
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,300
So I went back.

68
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,020
But Fang Mingfan was there.

69
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,900
What is your relationship now?

70
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,700
I have succeeded.

71
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,740
Really? Great.

72
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,820
You have made the process so long.

73
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,380
What?

74
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,860
He asked me to be responsible for him.

75
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,940
He is a man.

76
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,100
What can I do for him?

77
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,340
So I just do as he wishes.

78
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,580
He is now my boyfriend.

79
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,700
Great.

80
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,500
He's back, too?

81
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,380
Yeah.

82
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,020
Right.

83
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,300
OK, don't go tonight.

84
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,140
I will sleep with you in my arms.

85
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,300
I wasn't going to leave.

86
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,340
It's too early.

87
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,700
As a result, I went
from Lacaya to Jinhai.

88
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,900
What? What Lacaya?

89
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,340
What did you say?

90
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,500
Good morning, Lan.

91
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,900
You're up so early.

92
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,740
Shakespeare.

93
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,420
We were just talking about him.

94
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,020
I mean,

95
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,540
next to the UPMC,

96
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,780
there is a Shakespeare's bookstore.

97
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,660
And then we often go there

98
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,700
to drink coffee.

99
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,220
Right.

100
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,420
We like reading books there.

101
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,820
Really?

102
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,900
Tell me,

103
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,340
when you were reading books,

104
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,500
were there any foreign boys

105
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,980
who had a crush on her?

106
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,020
She wouldn't tell me.

107
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,580
If you don't focus
on having a boyfriend,

108
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,980
I will skin you.

109
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,980
Of course.

110
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,300
Really?

111
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,420
It's quite a lot.

112
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,740
Really? Come on now.

113
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,540
Tell me.

114
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,100
Come on.

115
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,300
Wei'an wouldn't tell me.

116
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,340
Tell me now,

117
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,020
what kind of person he is?

118
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,860
He is a Frenchman.

119
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,820
His name is Eliot.

120
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,700
He is a famous French doctor.

121
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,940
His eyes are

122
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,180
deep and charming.

123
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,060
After you see it,

124
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,980
your soul will be hooked away.

125
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,580
So handsome?

126
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,100
French are good.

127
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,060
French people are romantic
and emotional.

128
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,700
But aunt, he's a playboy.

129
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,300
When we went to the dance,

130
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,300
he pulled a woman and kissed her.

131
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,020
And he almost kissed me.

132
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,300
I was so scared
that I grabbed Wei'an and ran away.

133
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,100
That's no good. I can't accept that.

134
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,420
No matter how handsome he is,
that is no good.

135
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,060
Right.

136
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,700
Think about it.

137
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,900
Did someone give her a stone?

138
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,860
Stone?

139
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,980
It is like...

140
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,780
Wait a minute, I will show you.

141
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,300
That's it.

142
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,460
Look at it.

143
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,180
This...

144
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,980
Do you know?

145
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,220
Let me think about it.

146
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,420
We went to climb the mountain.

147
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,140
On the mountain,

148
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,180
there is a big wishing pool.

149
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,900
This was picked up in the wishing pool.

150
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,820
It was picked up?

151
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,340
It was picked up?

152
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,620
Yeah, I remember.

153
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,100
This one is for lovers.

154
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,620
It is for lovers.

155
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,580
Wei'an said it is for good luck.

156
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,380
Aunt,

157
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,580
she is embarrassed to tell you.

158
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,580
She must be afraid
that if she can't find her Mr. Right,

159
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,900
you will scold her.

160
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,780
Right.

161
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,180
Glad to hear that.

162
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,780
I almost threw it away.

163
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,540
I have to find a good place for it.

164
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,140
Put it here.

165
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,700
Good.

166
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,900
Please help my daughter
find her Mr. Right.

167
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,340
Think about it.

168
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,340
Is there anyone called Yun

169
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,220
or Zheng?

170
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,700
Mom,

171
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,540
why do you ask her that?

172
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,820
Is the meal ready?

173
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,500
I'm starving.

174
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,940
What?

175
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,300
There is plenty of food in the kitchen.

176
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,700
Get it yourself.

177
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,380
How do I know if I don't ask?

178
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,220
I care about you.

179
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,500
If you work hard,

180
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
I don't have to worry about it here.

181
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,340
Right?

182
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,060
Right.

183
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,820
Now,

184
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,260
think about it for me.

185
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,900
Is there anyone called Yun or...

186
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,340
Aunt,

187
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,580
the one you are talking
about is Du Yuncheng.

188
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,580
It seems to be a bit like this name.

189
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,500
Yes, it must be him.

190
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,570
He is Wei'an's senior.

191
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,810
When he was in school,

192
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,500
he confessed to her in public.

193
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,780
He did?

194
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,220
And then?

195
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,900
By the way, Wei'an,

196
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,700
you have told me

197
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,380
that he is the CEO of Jiehui.

198
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,380
What happened?

199
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,980
He is the CEO?

200
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,980
No wonder he is the CEO.

201
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,260
He has a good taste.

202
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,740
He chose Wei'an among all the people.

203
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,380
He has a girlfriend.

204
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,740
Has a girlfriend?

205
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,580
That is not possible.

206
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,100
If he has a girlfriend,

207
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,180
Why do you call his name

208
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,900
in the middle of the night?

209
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,420
No way. I only saw him once
after I came back.

210
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,660
I heard it myself.

211
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,500
It was clear.

212
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,660
Yuncheng.

213
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,300
Mom.

214
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,220
Square dance.

215
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,580
I am late.

216
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,860
I have already cooked the meal.

217
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,700
Help yourselves.

218
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,500
Go quickly.

219
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,820
You can talk to me when I come back.

220
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,820
Scared me to death.

221
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,940
I am sorry.

222
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,080
[Outpatient]

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,200
[Su Wei'an]

224
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,700
(Gone?)

225
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,540
(Where did she go?)

226
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,380
(Where did she go?)

227
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,420
(Where did she go?)

228
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,420
(How do I know where she's going?)

229
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,260
Boss.

230
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,540
What are you thinking about?

231
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,940
Mind your business.

232
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,300
I know if you don't tell me.

233
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,260
Come with me.

234
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,300
Where to?

235
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,620
Psychological department.

236
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
You should know it.

237
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,380
After the aid medical team comes back,

238
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,140
all the members have
to take a mental health test.

239
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,220
I heard
that they hired a great medical doctor

240
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,900
from Harvard Medical School.

241
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,300
Just in time

242
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,700
to see if you have
any other psychological problems.

243
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,860
Go.

244
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,380
Dr. Gu,

245
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,540
what a coincidence.

246
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,300
I thought you

247
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,140
wouldn't come back this year.

248
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,380
It seems

249
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,940
you don't want me to be back.

250
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,100
No way.

251
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,700
I miss you so much.

252
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,820
I'll miss a competitor
if you are not here.

253
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,060
Life is tasteless.

254
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,660
It seems that I have been

255
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,340
away from China for a long time.

256
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,980
I don't know why Dr. He

257
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,140
has become so confident.

258
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,300
You're not qualified

259
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,220
to be my competitor.

260
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,820
Things have changed since then.

261
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,700
You know what.

262
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,700
Young Talent Fund selections
will begin soon.

263
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,860
No matter what you did in Lacaya,

264
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,860
who you saved there,

265
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,740
or what medal you got.

266
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,620
It's no use.

267
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,980
This selection depends
on scientific research.

268
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,700
You have wasted too much time in Lacaya.

269
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,300
While I am making progress here.

270
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,300
So this time,

271
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,220
I won't lose to you.

272
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,060
Goodbye.

273
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,980
What a joke.

274
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,180
Boss, just ignore him.

275
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,980
This man is out of his mind.

276
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,500
I don't care.

277
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,180
He is a man

278
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,780
who idles his time away.

279
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,860
No wonder when I was out there,

280
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,060
I haven't seen him publish an article

281
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,220
on SCI.

282
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,340
Just ignore him.

283
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,100
Come with me.

284
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Let's go.

285
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,980
I said I didn't want to go.

286
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
You'll know when you go.

287
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,380
Here we are.

288
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,020
Here it is.

289
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,820
Dr. Gu,

290
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,700
are you here for a mental health test?

291
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,060
Right.

292
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,620
Then take a rest over there first.

293
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,540
You are still so popular.

294
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,580
- Thank you.
- Are both of you

295
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,860
who assisted Lacaya in the mission?

296
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,660
Right.

297
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,500
How long have you been back?

298
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,620
Just two weeks.

299
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,900
Then you two have a drink of water
and have a rest.

300
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,020
Prof. Li has been informed.

301
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,100
OK.

302
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,740
This place has changed.

303
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,340
This chair is better

304
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,420
than the bed in our lounge.

305
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,340
Boss,

306
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,300
do you know how much more
this woman doctor

307
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,580
from Harvard earns than we did?

308
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,140
This looks luxurious.

309
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,980
It must be at one's own expense
in the international department.

310
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,540
Mental illness
is the disease of the rich.

311
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,140
Boss,

312
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,740
you have to check it out clearly.

313
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,540
Fang Mingfan,

314
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,140
could you please shut up?

315
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,540
Hello, two of you.

316
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,580
I'm Li Wantong.

317
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,740
Hello.

318
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,940
You are the woman doctor

319
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,140
who came back
from Harvard Medical School.

320
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,540
Yes.

321
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,180
I am new here.

322
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,340
Nice to meet you.

323
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,900
Dr. Gu Yunzheng.

324
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,780
I read your paper on glioma

325
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,740
in the Lancet.

326
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:36,980
I've heard your name before.

327
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,420
You are a doctor of Psychology.

328
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,980
Why would you read a paper on glioma?

329
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,260
Psychology is also
an important branch of medicine.

330
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,020
As a doctor,

331
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,500
it is necessary to understand

332
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,140
frontier research
in various disciplines.

333
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,820
All right,
then let's go over there, gentlemen.

334
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,540
Let's go, Boss.

335
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,100
Has Dr. Gu encountered
any setbacks recently?

336
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,380
I mean the emotional one.

337
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,500
No.

338
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,620
The anxiety index is a little high.

339
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,420
And you have
a short-term sensitive manifestation

340
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,300
to relationships.

341
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,300
The scores of other items are excellent.

342
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,100
So have I passed the test?

343
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,180
You're in good spirits.

344
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,700
The ability to resist pressure
is also strong.

345
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,100
As for short-term mood swings,

346
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
I think you can adjust yourself.

347
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,700
Thank you, Dr. Li.

348
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,940
I'll go back to the department.

349
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,620
Wait.

350
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,740
Any problem?

351
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,100
The psychiatry,

352
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,620
in addition to external patients,

353
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,740
welcomes doctors in our hospital.

354
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,780
Free psychological counseling
is provided.

355
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,660
I think maybe one day,

356
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,740
you will need this service.

357
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,860
So,

358
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,140
I want to say sorry to you in advance.

359
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,980
If it really comes to that day,

360
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,700
I may not be able
to consult you personally.

361
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,740
Why?

362
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,980
Because as a counselor,

363
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,180
I can't have any emotional relationships
with the patient.

364
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,380
But I'm sure we're about
to have a relationship.

365
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,580
Dr. Li,

366
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,060
since we met,

367
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,700
it has been no more than thirty minutes.

368
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,780
I'm pretty sure

369
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,820
we won't get into
any emotional relationships.

370
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,660
But

371
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,020
I've known you
for more than thirty minutes.

372
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,820
Before I saw you,

373
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,500
I had screened
through the hospital system

374
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,700
to see the personal data
of all single male doctors.

375
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,100
From height and weight,

376
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,780
blood glucose, blood lipid
and blood pressure,

377
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,580
as well as

378
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,300
this list of 90 symptoms,

379
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,700
mental health self-test form

380
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,780
and educational background,
resume and personal experience,

381
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,300
you are in the top three in all numbers.

382
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,100
And when I first saw you,

383
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,020
my pulse quickened and beat 27 times.

384
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,300
So I'm pretty sure

385
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,380
you are

386
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,900
the perfect quality male for me.

387
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,700
Dr. Li,

388
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,500
I think the one
who really should do psychotherapy

389
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,540
is you.

390
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:13,940
Boss,

391
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,700
what took you so long?

392
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,700
What happened?

393
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
Did she tell you the result?

394
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,460
Sick.

395
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,740
Do you mean it?

396
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,780
What kind of disease?

397
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,500
Depression?

398
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,140
Su Wei'an has made you depressed?

399
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,300
Is it true?

400
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,540
Is it because Miss Su abandons you?

401
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,940
Now you have
the post-traumatic stress disorder.

402
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,780
Don't you scare me.

403
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,700
Shut up.

404
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,840
[Pet Social Life House]

405
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,100
Jiang,

406
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,380
go.

407
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,220
Look.

408
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,060
Flattie.

409
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,700
Yes.

410
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,700
Hello, here is your cat.

411
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,180
Thank you.

412
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,980
Thank you.

413
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,700
Flattie.

414
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,700
It's really you.

415
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,620
Of course, it is.

416
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,900
Long time no see.

417
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,820
You're still so flat.

418
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,780
How did you get it back?

419
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,500
I found several shipping companies.

420
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,660
I also asked Dr. Seck

421
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,220
to handle a lot of quarantine documents.

422
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,300
And then from car to plane
and plane to car,

423
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,620
it took a lot of time.

424
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,620
It took me great effort.

425
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,500
It's troublesome.

426
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
Then why did you get it back?

427
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
I promised you.

428
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,860
Jiang,

429
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,780
I will try my best to do
what I promise you.

430
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,180
Fang Mingfan, you really care about me.

431
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,820
My beautiful Miss Jiang,

432
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,020
are you free this evening?

433
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,140
Let's have dinner together.

434
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,380
I have an appointment tonight.

435
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,300
An appointment?

436
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,660
Yes.

437
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,460
Who is it?

438
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,020
My parents.

439
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,260
They asked me to go to eat with a family

440
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,340
that came back from America.

441
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,620
All right.

442
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,660
Then tonight I have to

443
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,420
work overtime alone.

444
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,780
Don't worry.
I'll accompany you next time.

445
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,900
It's a deal.

446
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,820
Hello, Boss.

447
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,620
Didn't you

448
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,300
ask Jiang Muying out for dinner tonight?

449
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,140
Don't mention it.
She has an appointment.

450
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,180
Looks like my weekend

451
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,820
is destined to belong to the duty room.

452
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,380
Have an appointment?

453
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,180
Yes.

454
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,780
Men or women?

455
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,060
You think it's

456
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,340
Miss Su, right?

457
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,380
Boss, don't think about her.

458
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,420
She's determined
to cut off contact with you.

459
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,900
She's deleted your phone number
and blacklisted you on WeChat.

460
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,620
Isn't it obvious
that she has rejected you?

461
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,020
But I still don't feel at ease.

462
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,700
Do you think something happened to her?

463
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,380
What could happen to such a big guy?

464
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,380
Now it is an information society.

465
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,220
If you can't ask her on WeChat,

466
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,700
do it through a phone call.

467
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,700
Boss,

468
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,100
you should realize that

469
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,540
the disappearance of a person

470
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,100
is not temporary.

471
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
It is forever.

472
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,300
No matter what time it is,

473
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,380
if she wants to put an end to me,

474
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,820
she should tell me in person.

475
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,220
If you don't get sad after being dumped,

476
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,300
you will get mad.

477
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,260
The best way for a broken heart

478
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,740
is to find another lover.

479
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,340
I think Dr. Li is quite good.

480
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,740
She is quite beautiful.

481
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,140
She is as good as you are.

482
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,300
I think she is
the most beautiful female doctor.

483
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,740
So excellent.

484
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,460
Why don't you give up Jiang Muying

485
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,340
and choose Dr. Li?

486
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,180
Don't do that.

487
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,300
I mean, she is

488
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,740
the most beautiful girl except Jiang.

489
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,180
Don't make it wrong.

490
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,100
How time flies.

491
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,700
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

492
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,860
Yeah.

493
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,300
It's been a long time.

494
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,460
You know...

495
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,780
Jiang, come in.

496
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,500
This is Jiang.

497
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,220
Yeah.

498
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,300
How fast time flies.

499
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,620
She's grown up.

500
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,740
She was so little at that time.

501
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,780
She's grown up to be a great beauty now.

502
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,020
Hello, aunt and uncle.

503
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,140
When you went to America,

504
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,860
Jiang hadn't gone to primary school yet.

505
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,780
Yeah.

506
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,940
Jiang,

507
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,020
do you remember
Uncle Yan and Auntie Fang?

508
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,500
When you were a kid,

509
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,660
Auntie Fang hugged you.

510
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,660
How time flies.

511
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,620
(More than 20 years ago.)

512
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,180
(What can I remember?)

513
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,940
(I shouldn't have come)

514
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,900
(to this awkward middle-aged gathering.)

515
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,220
(It's better to
go to dinner with Dr. Fang.)

516
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,100
Look, why isn't Kai here yet?

517
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
Exactly.

518
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,500
This child

519
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,180
has no sense of time.

520
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,700
Don't worry, we'll wait for him.

521
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,020
Kai has just returned to China.
Is he settling in?

522
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,780
What's he doing now?

523
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,980
This time he returned

524
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,740
with an offer

525
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,860
from a well-known game company.

526
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,620
Yeah.

527
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,740
He's the marketing director.

528
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,980
He's always busy.

529
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,420
I don't think we should wait.

530
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,020
Let's eat while waiting for him.

531
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,420
Muying must be hungry.

532
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,260
Muying, have some more meat.

533
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,500
You're too skinny.

534
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,940
- Thank you, Auntie.
- Eat more.

535
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,780
I remember...

536
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,900
Kai was always good at school
when he was young.

537
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,460
And he's been successful as he grew up.

538
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,180
The game company pays well, right?

539
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,380
They pay an annual salary.

540
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,860
It's average, I suppose.

541
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,140
(Coming all the way back
from the United States.)

542
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,900
(Just to show off your child?)

543
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,780
(I shouldn't have come to this dinner.)

544
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,900
Kai is

545
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,100
three years older than Muying, right?

546
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Yeah, exactly three years older.

547
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,300
The two of them

548
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,260
must have something in common.

549
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,220
(What's going on here?)

550
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,940
(Could it be a blind date for me?)

551
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,700
(With my dating skills,)

552
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,140
(do I even need a blind date?)

553
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,500
(I've achieved nothing
in life all these years.)

554
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,380
(It's all because
I've been too focused on dating.)

555
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,180
(Look down on me!)

556
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,740
Muying.

557
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,580
What university did you go to?

558
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,060
What's your major?

559
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,140
Muying is studying medicine.

560
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,740
That's good.

561
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,780
Auntie Fang.

562
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,940
I went to Jinhai University.

563
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,660
I majored in veterinary medicine.

564
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,500
That's good, yeah.

565
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,620

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,900
I saw some beautiful flowers

597
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,300
downstairs earlier.

598
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,900
And I remember that you've always
liked flowers since you were a child.

599
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,220
So I bought them for you.

600
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:49,980

You still remember that I like flowers?

603
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,740
Of course.

604
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,020
I remember when you were little,
you came to visit our house.

605
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,780
You loved my dad's Chinese rose.

606
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,300
So you took the flower off
and put it on your head.

607
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,580
When my dad came back
and saw the bare branches,

608
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,020
he thought I did it.

609
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,100
He beat me up.

610
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,060
That's true.

611
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,780
Really?

612
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,860
I don't quite remember.

613
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,940
Do you remember

614
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,100
when we were little,
you bought a popsicle

615
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,460
and let me take a bite?

616
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,260
I took a big bite
and almost finished half of it.

617
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,420
Then you cried
and complained to our parents.

618
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,130
I remember that.

619
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,540
Muying cried so hard back then.

620
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,460
I thought she was bullied outside.

621
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,690
I didn't realize it was
because of a popsicle.

622

00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,020
Wei'an's senior at university.

752
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,620
Hello, senior.
Seniors are the most reliable.

753
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,340
Even more so

754
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,860
if he doesn't have a girlfriend, right?

755
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,420
No...

756
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,180
I mean, Wei'an told me

757
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,980
that she has a reliable senior.

758
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,100
I didn't expect to meet you today.

759
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,170
- Su Wei'an.
- Let's go.

760
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,340
Auntie made a lot of delicious food.

761
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,260
- (Is that why you disappeared?)
- Come.

762
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,220
Let's go home and eat.

763
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,860
Don't be shy. Let's go.

764
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,940
I have a lot to talk to you about.

765
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,780
(Could it all be my imagination?)

766
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,220
(I've been making a fool
of myself all along.)

767
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,340
(If I lose, I admit it.)

768
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,220
(I'm willing to)

769
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,420
(lose to you.)

770
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,380
If this isn't love,

771
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,860
then do I

772
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,580
really know her at all?

773
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,780
(I can't run away from it.)

774
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,660
(I have to clear things up.)

it must end with a proper closure.)

778
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,500
A 45-year-old male patient

779
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,180
with an intracranial mass
urgently needs medical attention.

780
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,380
The CT scan shows intracranial mass,

781
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,900
bleeding and cerebellar herniation.

782
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,060
He's unconscious.

783
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,980

785

For the cerebral herniation patient,

786
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,700
immediately administer mannitol
for pressure reduction,

787
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,460
and stabilize the patient's vital signs.

788
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,060

789
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,100
Half an hour later.

790
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,380
Operate immediately.

791
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,500
Auntie is very good at cooking.

792
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,820
I'm afraid

793
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,380
I'll become a pickier from now on.

794
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,300
What's wrong, Wei'an?

795
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,220
Nothing.

796
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,420
What did you say?

797
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,060
I said

798
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,500
Auntie's cooking is delicious.

799
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,900
If you ever want to eat again,
just let me know.

800
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,980
I'll ask my mom to cook for you.

801
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,780
Alright, I'll leave now.

802
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,300

803
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,500

Now, gradually separate the tumor

The tumor is tough.

818
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,400
We can choose to use an ultrasonic knife
to break it down.

819
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,760
Then we can use a suction device
to clean it up.

You've got a solid grasp of the theory.

to do the rest of the tumor dissection.

you are careful with this step,

It feels a bit better when you scold me.

834
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,560
You want me to scold you

835

in this world.

936
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,590
Wake up!

937
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,910
Girls like you

938
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,870
deserve to be single for life.

939
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,990
The perfect man you describe

940
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,550
only exists in TV dramas.

941
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,070
You can't find him in real life.

942
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,470
And even if you do,

943
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,910
why would he fall for you?

944
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,510
You've just watched too many TV dramas.

945
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,910
You're right.

946
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,830
Don't ever talk about me and my senior.

947
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,070
It's really impossible.

948
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,710
Why not?

949
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,790
Tell me, what's wrong with your senior?

950
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,390
He's perfect in every way.

951
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,310
It's me. I don't deserve him, OK?

952
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:03,790
That's true.

953
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,190
Alright, get out of here.

954
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,390
I need to do some research.

955
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,590
You're kicking me out again.

956
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,510
Look, I haven't even talked
about my work yet.

957
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,270
Your aunt?

958
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,390
The clinical trial spot
has been resolved.

959
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,070
But it's a long way to go.

960
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,500
Your aunt is a strong-willed person.

961
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,500
Do you think she can make it through?

962
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,790
It will indeed be a prolonged battle.

963
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,110
How about this?

964
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,190
I'll find

965
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,870
a good psychologist in China to provide

966
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,790
regular psychological counseling
for her.

967
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,710
Psychologist?

968
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,030
Is it that serious?

969
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,910
Mom.

970
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,790
Psychotherapy

971
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,670
is a normal way to help people nowadays.

972
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,430
Don't be prejudiced.

973
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,270
And for chorea patients,

974
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,990
it's important to keep a healthy mind.

975
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,350
Right.

976
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,550
Okay, then find a good one for her.

977
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,950
Go to bed now.

978
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,110
Don't stay up too late.

979
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,180

Medical doctorate in psychiatry.

982

Outstanding young member
of the American Psychiatric Association.

983
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,070
So beautiful.

984
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,110
So young.

985
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,710
The world is indeed unfair.

986
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,350
Some people are favored

987
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,550
throughout their lives.

988
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,820
Huaren Hospital International Department

989

They aren't in the same building.

990
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,770
So I shouldn't run into Gu Yunzheng.
