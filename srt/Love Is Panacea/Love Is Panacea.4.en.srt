that Dr. Gu told me to make for you.

189
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,500
You'll be full of energy
after drinking it.

190
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,860
Seriously?

191
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,100
(See? She still needs my help.)

192
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,300
Yummy.

193
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,820
Right?

194
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,540
What is this?

195
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,820
Cabinda bark.

196
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
What's wrong with you?

197
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,220
What happened?

198
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,100
Cabinda bark?

199
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,500
Yeah.

200
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,820
Well...

201
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,660
Stop drinking.

202
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,180
What?

203
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,460
This is for enhancing male functions.

204
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,140
Are you sure

205
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,540
Gu Yunzheng wants me to drink this?

206
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,940
I had no idea.

207
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,940
Dr. Gu

208
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,820
must have been fooled by the ads.

209
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,540
Let me ask him about it.

210
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,340
I'm going to ask him.

211
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,900
Dr. Gu.

212
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,380
What's this?

213
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,900
Considering that your injured hand
cannot get wet,

214
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,740
Wei'an washed and folded your clothes.

215
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,940
She had me deliver them to you.

216
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,380
Why doesn't she send them herself?

217
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,420
You know,

218
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,060
Wei'an is a shy girl.

219
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,940
Just keep silent about it.

220
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,340
Don't ever ask her in person.

221
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,660
She'll blame me.

222
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,460
Tell her she did a great job.

223
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,650
But don't do such things again.

224
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,220
Jiang,

225
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,460
did you really give Miss Su

226
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,980
a cup of Cabinda bark tea?

227
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,940
Alright.

228
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,500
You've ruined my fboss's

229
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,940
perfect image.

230
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,580
How was I supposed to know?

231
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,340
I saw the ad at the stall saying

232
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,340
prolonging youth and anti fatigue.

233
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,940
So I just bought some.

234
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,940
Who would have known?

235
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,500
Why did you do such things anyway?

236
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,900
It was because of me that

237
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,940
Wei'an became the target of that driver,

238
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,940
and Dr. Gu's hand was injured.

239
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,420
I wanted to do something for them.

240
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,700
And I know Su Wei'an too well.

241
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,820
Only god knows

242
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,340
when she'll make the first move.

243
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,620
But

244
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,460
you're not helping at all.

245
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
You think I don't know?

246
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,260
What a bummer.

247
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,700
I tried to make it up to them.

248
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,300
But now things have gotten worse.

249
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,340
Jiang, it's okay.

250
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,860
With a friend like you helping her,

251
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,340
Su Wei'an will only be happy about it.

252
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,220
I think you're adorable.

253
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,980
I want someone like you to be my

254
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,340
girl...

255
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:26,940
I mean, friend.

256
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,900
Friend.

257
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,900
Aren't we friends already?

258
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,220
Boss's hand is about to recover.

259
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,540
How long am I going to wash clothes
for him?

260
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,140
Till they tie the knot

261
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
and are of one mind forever.

262
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,900
Okay.

263
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,940
Stop.

264
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,580
Boss, aren't you going out for fun
on the weekend?

265
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,340
What's wrong with your T-shirt?

266
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,620
What?

267
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,260
What?

268
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,220
Did Su Wei'an wash it for you, too?

269
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
Yes.

270
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,180
Yes or not?

271
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,860
Who did you say I washed clothes for?

272
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,700
I see.

273
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,460
Miss Su values money over anything.

274
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,500
Why would she wash clothes
for someone for free?

275
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,460
You're right.

276
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,060
For someone like Dr. Gu,

277
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,740
his body must be so strong

278
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,100
if he drinks Cabinda bark daily.

279
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,300
Why would he need

280
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,980
someone else to do such labor for him?

281
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,900
When did I drink Cabinda bark?

282
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,940
Jiang Muying,

283
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,940
I'll settle the scores when we're back.

284
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,380
Miss Su's time is precious.

285
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,700
I can't afford to waste any.

286
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,660
From now on,

287
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,260
stop doing such things on my behalf.

288
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,140
Dr. Gu is a busy man.

289
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,420
From now on,

290
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,940
I won't need Dr. Gu's help.

291
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,060
Follow me.

292
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,820
Lady Su,

293
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,940
please have tea.

294
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,340
What is this tea again?

295
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,540
Your Ladyship,

296
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
this tea

297
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,980
is bought and made

298
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,220
all by your humble servant.

299
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,660
There won't be any problem at all.

300
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,660
Fine, you may kowtow and leave.

301
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,740
Are you not mad at me, Your Ladyship?

302
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,980
If that happens again,

303
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,180
I'll give you the Scarlet Red.

304
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,940
You get lost in your own drama?

305
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,780
You really think you're the lady, huh?

306
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,820
Listen, if you ever be mean to me again,

307
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,100
I'll give you the Scarlet Red,
did you hear me?

308
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,540
Not again.

309
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,900
November 1.

310
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,940
Isn't that tomorrow?

311
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,180
What's so important about tomorrow?

312
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,260
It's the day when
Lacaya champion coffee beans

313
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,300
are open for sale on the market.

314
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,860
It starts at 7 a.m.

315
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,180
First come first served.

316
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,780
And there's only one day in a year.

317
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,300
Whether I get rich or not depends on it.

318
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,100
Then let me go with you.

319
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,540
Take me as your assistant.

320
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,860
Like you mean it.

321
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,620
Can you get up on time?

322
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,700
Then wake me up!

323
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,420
Just... Wake me up by beating.

324
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,780
Okay.

325
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,300
I will go to bed now.

326
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,220
I can definitely get up on time.

327
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,420
Remember to wake me up.

328
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,700
(The day hasn't even broken yet.)

329
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,100
(Is she sleepwalking?)

330
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,960
[Friendship Hospital]

331
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,620
How much for taking me to 69th Avenue?

332
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,940
It's still dark.
You'll have to pay double.

333
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,260
Too expensive. It's already daytime.

334
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,100
Save it. I don't bargain.

335
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,580
(Where is she going so early?)

336
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,940
Never mind.

337
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,940
Su Wei'an.

338
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,500
It's so early in the morning.

339
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,300
Where are you going?

340
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,660
I don't think I need to report to you.

341
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
What about you?

342
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,340
I...

343
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,180
I'm out for a morning jog.

344
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,540
That doctor went toward the plaza.

345
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,020
The station is right ahead.

346
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,700
Is this your everyday morning jog route?

347
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,540
Where exactly are you going
so early in the morning?

348
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,860
To the morning market.

349
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,940
What morning market?

350
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,660
Today's the annual coffee beans contest.

351
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,620
I'm going to get the right of agency
of the champion beans in China.

352
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,940
I can't be late for that.

353
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,500
You're all about making money, huh?

354
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,460
Go back to rest.

355
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,940
Your first operation starts at 8:30.

356
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,420
You are also aware of that, huh?

357
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
You'll be fined if you're late.

358
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,020
Don't worry.

359
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,660
I won't be late for that.

360
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,860
I...

361
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,820
I'll watch you get on the bus.

362
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,300
The bus stop is right through the lane.

363
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,620
Go back to rest.

364
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,940
Then I'll jog to the bus stop.

365
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,700
Suit yourself.

366
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,940
Stop following me.

367
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,180
There seems to be someone up ahead.

368
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Something's not right.

369
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,940
Are you kidding?

370
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,540
Bad things happen
whenever I run into you.

371
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,140
Go.

372
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,700
You make Paj lose so much money.

373
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,580

you gave the blood test result
to the police.

of her head.

Mr. Du,

410
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,580
although our data
from the phase II experiment

411
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,940
is not as ideal as expected,

412
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,420
everything is within control.

413
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,660
I believe

414
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,180
that as long as the fund
for the next phase is ready,

415
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,940
we can still carry out the clinical test

416

as per our original plan.

417
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,940

that we can start clinical tests
this year.

00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,460
Thanks. That is so sweet.

561
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,740
What do you mean, sweet?

562
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,980
He's my attending doctor.

563
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,540
Isn't it his job

564
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,620
to get to know his patients?

565
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,580
Would you help

566
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,180
get rid of the messy things

567
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,580
on her head later,

568
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
in case she gets a wound infection?

569
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,500
Doctor's advice.

570
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,300
Okay.

571
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,620
Wei'an,

572
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,700
I wish I was the one who got injured.

573
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,740
It must hurt after bleeding so much.

574
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,980
I'm fine.

575
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,540
You know I'm not afraid of pain.

576
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,100
Don't do this anymore.

577
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,540
Stay at home and don't go anywhere.

578
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,860
I got it.

579
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,700
By the way,

580
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,980
don't tell my mom about this.

581
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,780
She'll be worried sick.

582
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,980
I won't.

583
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,580
Dr. Gu's advice is so good.

584
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,140
I've been wanting to make better

585
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,740
your messy braids for quite some time.

586
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,980
Give me back my pretty scholar
from medical school.

587
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,540
Jiang Muying,

588
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,420
which side are you on?

589
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,180
Well, Dr. Gu

590
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,340
has been waiting for you to wake up.

591
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,780
He cares about you a lot.

592
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,140
Isn't it the most normal thing

593
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,020
for a doctor to care about his patient?

594
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,540
Then what about you?

595
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,700
Is it also normal

596
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,980
to take a hit for Dr. Gu?

597
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,980
What do you mean to take a hit for him?

598
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,700
I did not.

599
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,860
That's...

600
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,300
Nowhere else to duck.

601
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
You know that.

602
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,860
I've lost majorly this time.

603
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,460
I think Gu Yunzheng and I
aren't meant to be together.

604
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,620
Whenever I meet him,

605
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,340
I'll either lose money

606
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,980
or get injured.

607
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,500
Oh yeah?

608
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,620
Maybe Dr. Gu doesn't think so.

609
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,460
For saving his life,

610
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,300
he'd have to pledge to marry you.

611
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,420
Marry your foot!

612
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:38,980
Hold on a second.

613
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,140
I'm the one who got injured,

614
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,500
but why have you suffered
from brain trauma?

615
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,940
Pledge to marry me?

616
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,980
You're giving me headaches.

617
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,860
Alright, I won't say that again.

618
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Be gone, headaches.

619
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,940
Wei'an,

620
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,220
you know what?

621
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,900
The odds of us running into true love

622
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,500
are just three out of a million.

623
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,900
So seize him if you run into one.

624
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,980
Don't let go.

625
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,980
Only three out of a million?

626
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,460
This probability

627
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,700
is lower than getting cancer.

628
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,700
No wonder love and death

629
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,220
are the eternal themes of humans.

630
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,500
Death and cancer?

631
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Enough of the nonsense.

632
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,980
Fine.

633
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,980
I shouldn't mention these.

634
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,660
You're no longer my friend
if you ever talk about these again.

635
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,500
[Friendship Hospital]

636
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,820
Gu Yunzheng...

637
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,420
I've tried many combinations

638
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,460
but can't get a complete meaning
out of it.

639
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,140
Okay, it's done.

640
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,580
Charcoal ash.

641
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,020
You...

642
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,740
You protected me with your life.
Is it because my life is more valuable?

643
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,740
Your life values more than mine.

644
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,460
You can save more people if you live on.

645
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,780
This crazy woman.

646
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,740
What exactly was she thinking?

647
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,940
She just died like this?

648
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,980
The heroine did so much for him.

649
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,020
And she even died for him in the end.

650
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,220
How could it be like this?

651
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,740
She didn't confess her love
to the hero even till death.

652
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,460
Really.

653
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
Dr. Gu,

654
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,580
we're not slacking.

655
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,340
You know, it's passed working hours.

656
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,260
Please don't tell our head nurse.

657
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,740
Let me ask you something.

658
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,380
About that woman.

659
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,100
Why would she die for the hero?

660
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,100
Because of love!

661
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,220
She is madly in love with the hero.

662
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,780
She'll never let him get hurt for a bit.

663
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,740
She'd rather sacrifice herself
to protect the hero.

664
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,740
Then, after doing so much for the hero,

665
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,740
why wouldn't she admit it to him anyway?

666
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,740
Gu Yunzheng...

667
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,500
You were calling my name.

668
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,420
No.

669
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,300
That's because

670
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,300
all women always say yes and mean no.

671
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,780
I wanted to say that
I don't owe you money anymore.

672
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,340
No matter how much she loves a man,

673
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,740
she will never say it.

674
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,260
Whoever says it loses.

675
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,060
Really?

676
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,740
Of course. That's all the TV dramas say.

677
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,020
Dr. Gu,

678
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,740
I know so much more than you about this.

679
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,900
I see.

680
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,540
Dr. Gu, we should go now.

681
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,420
Afraid of losing.

682
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,040
It smells so good.

683
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,440
What a small world, Dr. Gu.

684
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,600
What are you doing here?

685
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,440
Well...

686
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
I just got off work.

687
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,040
Have you been here for a long time?

688
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,280
I didn't want to disturb you

689
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,920
from enjoying the flowers
on a moonlit night.

690
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,440
They're quite beautiful.

691
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,280
You also like Jacaranda, huh?

692
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,360
I mean...

693
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,760
You look pretty.

694
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,400
Um, well…

695
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,160
It's getting late.

696
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,080
You should go rest.

697
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
(I mean...)

698
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,760
(You look pretty.)

699
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,040
(Su Wei'an,
why are you acting so infatuated?)

700
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,920
(Have you been influenced
by Jiang Muying?)

701
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,800
(Or are you suffering
from the after-effects of concussion?)

702
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,440
You saw Su
at the Friendship Hospital last time?

703
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,160
Yes, she was hiding there,
working as an interpreter.

704
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,240
Friendship Hospital
has a special status.

705
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,320
We don't dare to make a move.

706
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,160
My head's about to explode.

707
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,200
Forget about that.

708
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,560
It's her fake alcohol
that's giving me headaches.

709
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
Get the guards together.

710
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,480
Yes, sir.

711
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,040
But, General.

712
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Dr. Eliot said

713
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,440
that all the examination reports show

714
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,240
that your brain is perfectly fine.

715
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,720
No tumors, no bleeding.

716
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,880
The equipment and medical resources
at the French National Hospital

717
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,400
have always been the best in Lacaya.

718
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,160
There should be no mistakes, right?

719
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,640
Let's hope that the Chinese doctors
at the Friendship Hospital

720
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,480
aren't so incompetent.

721
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
Good morning, Dr. Gu.

722
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,880
Good morning.

723
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,080
I heard you almost got injured.

724
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,640
An interpreter saved your life.

725
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
Remember to return the favor, huh?

726
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,000
Buy some tonic
and take good care of her.

727
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,840
When you both come back
after your term ends,

728
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,840
I'll thank her properly.

729
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,320
Okay, Grandpa.

730
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,520
I'll try to bring her back with me.

731
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,960
The same three for today?

732
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Yeah, right.

733
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,560
Auntie,

734
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,840
please prepare an extra breakfast
for me today.

735
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,200
Sure, no problem.

736
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,080
And this millet porridge.

737
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,560
A bowl of millet porridge, too.

738
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,240
Don't you dislike millet porridge?

739
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,640
Pack the millet porridge for me.

740
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,880
It's nutritious, right?

741
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Yes, of course.

742
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,440
Add some side dishes, too.

743
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
Okay.

744
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,040
Auntie,

745
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,560
do you sell the fillings

746
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,520
and wrappers for wontons?

747
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,680
Those wontons are not
from our cafeteria.

748
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,280
From the wrapper to the filling,

749
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,120
I didn't spend a cent of public money.

750
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,520
I just made them for myself.

751
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,440
I can tell the filling is delicious.

752
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:52,960
Isn't it?

753
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Look at the amount.

754
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,480
It's not even enough for one person.

755
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
Auntie.

756
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,040
Alright.

757
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,440
How are you feeling today? Any better?

758
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,760
Nutritious breakfast for everyone.

759
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,760
Come on, let's eat.

760
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,320
Come.

761
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,760
But I haven't ordered yet.

762
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,960
There's no need to buy, it's free.

763
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,960
When did it become free?

764
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,760
One for each neurosurgical patient.

765
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
Are you a patient?

766
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,520
Breakfast is free for patients.

767
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,520
Specials for the patient in bed 2,
on doctor's orders.

768
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
Specials?

769
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,800
Come, Wei'an, eat while it's hot.

770
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,520
Mini wontons?!

771
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,360
I'm dying for this, Auntie.

772
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
I want to eat some wontons, too.

773
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,520
Only one bowl is available.

774
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,520
Dr. Fang,

775
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,760
your breakfast

776
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,640
is in the cafeteria.

777
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,480
Hold on, my heart hurts so much.

778
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,760
Quickly check me.

779
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,240
I want to eat wontons, too.

780
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,560
Eat while it's hot,
as the doctor ordered.

781
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,360
We can still have wontons in Lacaya!

782
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,480
I can't believe it.

783
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,360
The mini wontons.

784
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,520
Which doctor prescribed it?

785
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,520
Boss.

786
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,520
Do you know?

787
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,520
I only know that you're free now.

788
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,520
Go and get an extension
for the patient in bed 2.

789
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Extend the stay?

790
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,120
Why?

791
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,000
I just have a mild concussion.

792
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,440
I should be able
to be discharged tomorrow, right?

793
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,520
Remain in the hospital for observation

794
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,520
to prevent
delayed intracranial hemorrhage.

795
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,240
But I've already recovered.

796
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm a doctor.

797
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,240
And this is my order.
