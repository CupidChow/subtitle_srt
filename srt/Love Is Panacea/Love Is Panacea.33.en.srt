00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,720
Dear families,

190
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,240
they're the crooks.

191
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,130
Leave!

192
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,600
So you're here to cause trouble?

193
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,360
Get out of here.

194
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,240
You're not welcome here.

195
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,720
You're really good at that.

196
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,480
People like you

197
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,240
are bloodsuckers

198
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,360
who defraud patients
of their hard-earned money.

199
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,400
Your drugs

200
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,360
are not safe at all.

201
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,800
They're completely untraceable.

202
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,040
You're playing with human lives.

203
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,600
We're doctors from Huaren Hospital.

204
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,680
Please trust us.

205
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,600
Huaren Hospital.

206
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,720
They're the liars!

207
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,680
Don't get conned by them.

208
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,480
They're the crooks.

209
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Get them out of here!

210
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,800
Get them out of here!

211
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,520
Liars! Liars!

212
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,360
What are you doing?

213
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,600
Police! Don't move!

214
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
The police are here.

215
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Who's Dr. Gu?

216
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,680
Sir.

217
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,160
Dr. Gu.

218
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,560
Squat there.

219
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,840
Thank you very much for your report.

220
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,320
Stay still.

221
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,240
Thanks also to these materials

222
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,120
and some evidence you provided,

223
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
we were able

224
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,160
to solve this fake drug fraud case
so quickly.

225
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,280
Thank you very much.

226
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,600
Over the years, these patients
with rare diseases

227
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,600
are already
in a very difficult situation.

228
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,480
These crooks

229
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,720
are exploiting

230
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
their desperation

231
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,240
to make a killing.

232
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,000
It's so hateful.

233
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,240
Sir.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Thank you.

235
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,640
You're welcome. Then I'll leave first.

236
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,360
Dr. Gu.

237
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,640
Ling, what are you doing here?

238
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,960
As soon as I heard the news,
I rushed over.

239
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,240
Many patients and their families

240
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,600
have collectively lost contact

241
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,080
and don't contact us any more.

242
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,640
I knew they were up to something.

243
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,520
If you hadn't used your expertise

244
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,600
to gather evidence of their crimes,

245
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm afraid

246
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,000
they'd still be making a fortune

247
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,480
in patients' life-saving money.

248
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,520
Ling.

249
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,600
Over these years,

250
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,240
you've done a lot for chorea patients.

251
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,120
It's my job to do so.

252
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,760
Miss, as a beginner like you,

253
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,200
there's no need to rush.

254
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,520
You can take your time.

255
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
I have to make it today.

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,520
Is it for your boyfriend?

257
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,120
It's the thought that counts.

258
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,600
If you can't make it this year,
then next year and the year after.

259
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Next year or the year after,

260
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,880
I'm afraid
I won't do any better by then.

261
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,720
It's finally done.

262
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,360
With a girlfriend like you,

263
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,480
your boyfriend must be happy to see it.

264
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,200
I hope so.

265
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,060
[Happy Birthday]

266
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,380
[Happy Birthday, my big boy.]

267
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,240
Happy Birthday.

268
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,960
You never celebrated your birthday
in the past.

269
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,880
Let's celebrate it together this year.

270
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,520
Did you like the surprise
I prepared for you?

271
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,840
Yes, I do.

272
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,960
Wei'an.

273
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,240
From now on,

274
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,120
we should celebrate every day
we spend together.

275
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,120
Come.

276
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Take a look at the birthday gift
I prepared for you.

284
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,760
Thank you.

285
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,600
Alright.

286
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,520
Look.

287
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,600
All these are prepared for you.

288
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,520
That's a lot.

289
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,680
Yeah, that's right.

290
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,720
I was going to pick just one.

291
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,480
But then I looked at them

292
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,720
and realized all of them were fit.

293
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,880
So I bought them all.

294
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,120
Consider them as your birthday gifts

295
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,600
from this year

296
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,520
till you turn 80.

297
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,080
By what logic?

298
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,520
This is for my fifty?

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,760
Look.

300
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,520
Well.

301
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,760
This looks so old-fashioned.

302
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,480
You're supposed to wear it
when you're 50.

303
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,120
Of course, it'd be a bit old-fashioned.

304
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
When I'm 50,

305
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,720
I'll be a cool old man.

306
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,960
Your taste

307
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
is really not very good.

308
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,240
I used all my taste to fall for you.

309
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,360
Look at this.

310
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,480
For my 70?

311
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,720
What's it?

312
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,360
This is a hearing aid.

313
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,480
Dear Wei'an.

314
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,960
When I am 70,

315
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,720
the hearing aid

316
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,600
will be upgraded for quite a few rounds.

317
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,720
Are you sure this will still work?

318
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
Anyway, these are all my gifts.

319
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,000
Fine.

320
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,240
Thank you.

321
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,120
And this.

322
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,760
This is the most important.

323
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,400
I made this cake myself.

324
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,720
And it's got you on it.

325
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,360
Do you like it?

326
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,400
Yes, I do.

327
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,760
From now on,

328
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,720
I no longer need to

329
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,360
make a cake for myself.

330
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,120
Then, blow out the candles
and make a wish.

331
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,880
I'm done.

332
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,120
Blow out the candles.

333
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,320
Aren't birthdays supposed
to involve making three wishes?

334
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,600
I only made one.

335
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,880
The rest I leave to you.

336
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,120
Why so?

337
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
It's your birthday,
so you make the wishes.

338
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
I already made mine,

339
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,840
so it's your turn.

340
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,360
Okay, I'll do it then.

Alright.

344
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,240
Come, blow out the candles.

345
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
One, two, three.

You go first.

00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,600
Marriage.

352
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,200
So corny.

353
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,760
What about you, then?

354
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,480
Someone ambitious like me,

355
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,720
of course, wished

356
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,960
to discover a treatment method
for Huntington's Disease.

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,590
You just blurted it out.

358
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,240
Aren't you afraid it won't come true?

359
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,200
You said it first.

360
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,960
I said it for you to hear.

361
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,720
Me too.

362
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,960
You have to work hard

363
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,480
to help me achieve my wish.

364
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,590
You help me achieve mine,

365
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,480
and I'll help you with yours.

366
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,960
Then, what if you trick me?

367
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,360
Then I'll deserve to take care of you
for the rest of my life.

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,760
Didn't sleep well.

373
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,080
Didn't hold it firmly.

374
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,320

Su Wei'an broke two all at once.

566
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,360
It's too dangerous.

567
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,600
What's the topic today?

568
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,600
Don't talk about it. What's the point?

569
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,120
Please calm down.

570
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,720
Let's listen to Dr. Gu first.

571
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
My girlfriend's name

572
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,960
is Su Wei'an.

573
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,040
She's

574
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,040
also a patient
with Huntington's Disease.

575
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,320
Not long ago,

576
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,760
She had the first attack.

577
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,320
She offered

578
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,240
to be the first subject

579
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,200
of our clinical trial.

580
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,000
If your girlfriend wants to try it,

581
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,680
let her try it herself.

582
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,240
When it works,

583
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,000
we'll use it then, right?

584
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,520
- Yes, that's right.
- Yeah.

585
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,040
I proposed to her yesterday.

586
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,840
I'll prepare

587
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,240
a dream wedding for her.

588
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,040
I promised her

589
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,520
I'd accompany her

590
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,240
all the way.

591
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
No matter how long,

592
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,840
I'll be with her for the journey.

593
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,480
And as for subjects,

594
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,440
all I can do now

595
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,520
is to promise everyone

596
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,230
that my girlfriend and I,

597
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,520
Oh no,

598
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,760
my fiancee and I,

599
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,520
spent six to seven years

600
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,840
working day and night on this drug.

601
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,040
Every experiment we conducted

602
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,360
and every piece of data we recorded

603
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,960
is absolutely rigorous and serious.

604
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,710
I want this drug to work

605
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,600
more than anyone.

606
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,120
Because I hope

607
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,600
I can accompany my girlfriend,

608
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,670
oh no,

609
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,960
accompany my fiancee...

610
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,520
I wish I could accompany her

611
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
much longer.

612
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,420
If it's us, let's think about it.

613
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,520
Actually,

614
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,760
I don't expect you all

615
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,120
to truly understand

616
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,040
what exactly we're doing now.

617
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,480
I just want you to know

618
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,120
that at the moment,
with just the two of us,

619
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,040
it's really hard

620
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,240
to find that ray of light

621
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,920
in the dark.

622
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,320
We need more power now.

623
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,760
We need more people to help us.

624
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,040
Only with your help

625
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,840
can we find

626
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,280
that light together.

627
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,760
So, if you agree to the trial,

628
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,520
I give you my word.

629
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,040
If any adverse events occur

630
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,040
during the trial,

631
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,000
we'll track and respond immediately.

632
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,960
I think it's trustworthy.

633
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,560
I promise you all

634
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,800
we'll never take anyone's life

635
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,200
as a joke.

636
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,680
Thank you all.

637
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,480
I'm willing to let my son

638
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,040
participate in your drug trial.

639
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,520
Me too.

640
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,120
I'd like to be part of your drug trial.

641
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,040
Thank you.

642
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,000
Did Gu Yunzheng find

643
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,880
clinical trial participants? So fast?

644
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,520
Yes.

645
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
It was said in the patient chat group

646
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,040
that even the doctor's girlfriend

647
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,920
started trying the drug.

648
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,440
So everyone started to join them.

649
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,920
You mean

650
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,240
Gu Yunzheng let Su Wei'an try the drug?

651
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,080
Yes.

652
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,080
Is he crazy?

653
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,360
Mr. Du.

654
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,240
There are journalists downstairs now.

655
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,080
It's not a good time for you to show up.

656
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,600
Don't stop me!

657
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,360
Mr. Du.

658
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,320
Du Yuncheng, are you crazy?

659
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,520
Why did you agree
to Su Wei'an trying the drug?

660
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Aren't you her boyfriend?

661
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,920
Why didn't you stop her?

662
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,520
I proposed to her.

663
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,520
I'm her fiancé now.

664
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,400
I agreed to let her participate

665
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,880
in the clinical trial of GHS380.

666
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,080
Are you so desperate to win me over?

667
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,560
You don't even care about We'an's life?

668
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,440
Other people can take that risk.

669
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,360
But not her.

670
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,560
I can guarantee every step
of my experiment

671
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,560
and every experimental data.

672
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,040
I can guarantee

673
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,920
that all my research is grounded.

674
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,480
You, a failure in scientific research,

675
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,680
who are you to shout at me?

676
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,040
Who are you calling
a failure in scientific research?

677
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,720
If it wasn't for your

678
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,440
underground experiments
that have caused deaths,

679
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,400
how could we

680
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,120
not even find a single participant?

681
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,360
How could Wei'an have been forced

682
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,720
to take part in the drug trial?

683
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,400
Du Yuncheng.

684
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,600
Didn't you cause all this?

685
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Nonsense!

686
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,720
You're just malicious.

687
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,120
As long as it can cure
Huntington's Disease,

688
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,080
who cares if it's an underground trial?

689
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,320
Who cares if it's not documented?

690
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,040
It's not important.

691
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
It doesn't matter.

692
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,320
Do you hear yourself talking?

693
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,120
Du Yuncheng.

694
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,000
You can disregard

695
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,960
even Su Wei'an's aunt's life.

696
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,200
How dare you say
you're trying to save Wei'an?

697
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,920
Do you really want Wei'an

698
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,680
to rely on a completely unsecured
and uncertified drug?

699
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,200
With your current progress,

700
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,160
when will the new drug be available?

701
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,520
By the time your new drug is
on the market,

702
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,360
Wei'an may already...

703
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,440
Already dead.

704
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,640
Only my drug can save her.

705
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm her only support.

706
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,000
Wei'an doesn't need your support.

707
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,520
I'll never stoop to falsifying data

708
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,040
and disregarding life, just like you.

709
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,200
Your drug is too dirty.

710
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,480
Even if it does save lives,

711
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,320
Wei'an won't take it.

712
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,440
Who are you to make decisions for her?

713
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,840
Besides,

714
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,800
don't you understand

715
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,560
the only hope is to live?

716
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,040
Nothing else matters at all.

717
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,880
Du Yuncheng.

718
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,440
Feel your conscience

719
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,560
and ask yourself.

720
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,200
Did you come this far

721
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,200
to find a cure for Wei'an

722
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,520
or to tell everyone

723
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,200
you're better than me

724
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,120
and they are wrong about us?

725
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
Think what you will.

726
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,480
No one can

727
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,240
stop a decision I make.

728
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,440
Du Yuncheng, I'm warning you.

729
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,720
Stay away from Su Wei'an.

730
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,000
For what you've done,

731
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,440
I'll never let it go.

732
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,200
[Jiehui Medicines Company]

733
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,160
Bad news, Mr. Du.

734
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,440
The Ethics Committee rejected

735
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,520
the clinical approval of HDQ40.

736
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,360
Take a look.

737
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,800
Why did they reject the approval?

738
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,600
Mr. Du.

739
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,880
Jiehui's stock price has been
continuously hitting the limit down,

740
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,800
and some shareholders have started
to withdraw their capital.

741
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,040
They are also requesting

742
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,120
that you resign
from the position of CEO immediately

743
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,880
and hold a press conference
to explain the situation.

744
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,720
It's like rats deserting a sinking ship.

745
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,520
They're all greedy
when it comes to making money.

746
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,200
Mr. Du, maybe we should pause the R&D.

747
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,320
We can't stop the development
of the new drug.

748
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,120
Zhang.

749
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,600
Arrange for the next R&D funds

750
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,480
to be disbursed immediately.

751
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,720
Mr. Du, without approval,

752
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
if we continue to allocate funds,

753
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
I'm afraid

754
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,720
it's not easy to explain to the board.

755
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,520
Are you out of your mind?

756
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,240
I spent a lot of money

757
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,920
to hire you as the CFO.

758
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,640
You're here to solve problems,

759
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,560
not to raise them with me.

760
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,600
I'm sorry, Mr. Du.

761
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,240
Get it done quickly.

762
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:51,800
I'll handle it.

763
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,560
Loser!

764
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,520
Bad news, Mr. Du.

765
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,320
The police suddenly summoned
the R&D director.

766
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,840
What?

767
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,000
The matter of counterfeit banned drugs

768
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,040
is likely to be exposed.

769
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,120
We should go abroad to avoid trouble.

770
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,840
Du Yuncheng has gone mad.

771
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,120
He's determined to surpass Gu Yunzheng,

772
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,240
to the extent of instructing me

773
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,560
to counterfeit drugs not approved
in foreign countries.

774
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,880
What?

775
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,000
Du Yuncheng is no longer

776
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,520
the senior you knew at Huaren.

777
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,200
He could do anything now.

778
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,520
Quickly destroy all the data

779
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,240
and transfer all liquidity abroad.

780
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,760
We'll conduct R&D abroad.

781
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,720
We can't move a single cent
from our account.

782
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,360
We'll be lucky
to get out of the country.

783
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,640
Don't even think about R&D.
