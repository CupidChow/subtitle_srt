00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,040
Moth orchid?

189
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,440
So, it's good.

190
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,800
I will choose it.

191
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,480
I think it's good.

192
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,200
Okay, it's my decision.

193
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,320
I'm leaving, grandpa.

194
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,160
Wait a minute. I haven't agreed yet.

195
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,880
Who are you giving it to?

196
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,240
OK, I will tell you.

197
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,640
At first,

198
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,520
I wanted to take Wei'an home

199
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,840
to celebrate the coming
Spring Festival together.

200
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,680
But her mother is alone at home

201
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,480
because her father died young.

202
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,040
So I want to go to their home

203
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,840
to spend time with them
and surprise her.

204
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
But I can't go without any gift, can I?

205
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,440
I know you plant many flowers here.

206
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,320
So I want to choose one
and give it to her.

207
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,240
This flower's name is moth orchid.

208
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,960
Its name is related

209
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,280
to her mother's name.

210
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,280
So,

211
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,920
this is a good choice.

212
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,160
I see. It's for the future in-laws.

213
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,080
You should have told me earlier.

214
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,480
I will buy half of the flowers

215
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,520
from the flower market for her.

216
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,480
No need for that.

217
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,520
This one will work. It's the best.

218
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,640
Okay, then I'm leaving.

219
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,680
Wait a minute.

220
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,440
Now that you take my flower,

221
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,840
when will you bring
my granddaughter-in-law home?

222
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,040
I want to see her.

223
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,680
It depends on how good

224
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
your flower is.

225
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,840
If it works well,

226
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,680
I will bring her home

227
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,040
on the New Year's first day.

228
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,840
OK?

229
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,920
New Year's first day?

230
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
You are not going
to spend New Year's Eve with me?

231
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,400
What's the point of me being at home?

232
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,880
Can I go to her house
with you for the Spring Festival?

233
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,400
How can we do that, Grandpa?

234
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,800
It's not good.

235
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,880
Even for me, it is not appropriate
to visit them,

236
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,000
let alone you.

237
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,880
You can't stay there.

238
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,920
Right?

239
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,280
Come on now, Grandpa.

240
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,680
Why don't you go inside and sleep?

241
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,440
Wait for my good news.

242
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,280
Okay?

243
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,440
See you then.

244
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,600
Good night.

245
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,280
I'm leaving.

246
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,400
Thank you for your flower, Grandpa.

247
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Good night.

248
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,640
What a kid! He doesn't want me
to visit them together.

249
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,320
Who is it? Coming.

250
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,120
- Mrs. Su.
- Yunzheng.

251
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,840
It's me.

252
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,000
It's Chinese New Year's Eve.
You got up so early?

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,920
Happy New Year.

254
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
This flower is for you.

255
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,000
It's so beautiful.

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,760
Where should we put it?

257
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,600
Put it on the table.

258
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,440
Let's put it here.

259
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,120
You bought this?

260
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,280
No.

261
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,520
This flower

262
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,920
was carefully cultivated
by my grandfather.

263
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,280
He plants a lot of flowers.

264
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,880
I picked the one
that looks best for you.

265
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,720
My grandpa

266
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,360
was reluctant to give it to me.

267
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,720
I guess this flower is very rare.

268
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,760
And I think

269
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,880
your name

270
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,080
has a character of this flower's name.

271
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,880
You are just as beautiful as it.

272
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,760
Yunzheng, I am flattered.

273
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,080
Yuncheng,

274
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,160
tell your grandpa that I am grateful.

275
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,200
Okay.

276
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,840
By the way, Mrs. Su,

277
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,520
I am not just coming here today

278
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,480
to give you a flower.

279
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,480
I want to celebrate
the Spring Festival with you.

280
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,240
Is that okay?

281
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,240
Of course. That is great.

282
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,240
That's good.

283
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Wei'an.

284
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,400
Yunzheng is here.

285
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,440
Come and meet him right now.

286
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,040
It's New Year's Eve.

287
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Why are you here?

288
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,880
You're not coming home with me

289
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,040
to spend time with Grandpa.

290
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Then, I'll go home
and spend time with you.

291
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,760
What do you mean?

292
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,440
This is my home.

293
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,960
Any difference?

294
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,800
Anyway, it will be
my mother-in-law's home soon.

295
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,800
OK, you two take your time.

296
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,680
I'll wash the fruits you brought.

297
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,760
Be careful. It is heavy.

298
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,320
You can go on.

299
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,240
I can take it.

300
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,160
If you spend New Year's Eve here,

301
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,960
what about your grandpa
and your other family?

302
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,120
I just want to spend
the holiday with you.

303
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,800
Mom,

304
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,600
Gu Yunzheng will
do most of the housework today.

305
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,440
He needs to earn
his New Year's Eve dinner.

306
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,880
It's okay, Mrs. Su.

307
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,080
Just tell me what to do if you need me.

308
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,600
You can count on me.

309
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,240
Okay.

310
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Yunzheng, I can do it myself.

311
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,440
It is alright.

312
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,960
Who is it?

313
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,760
Coming.

314
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,640
You are...

315
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,360
I'm Yunzheng's grandfather.

316
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,800
Yunzheng.

317
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,040
Grandpa, why are you here?

318
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,640
Come on in.

319
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,520
Come on.

320
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,960
It's your first time
to celebrate the Spring Festival here.

321
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,680
I'm afraid you're not well prepared.

322
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,800
I...

323
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,240
That is impossible.

324
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,520
You can ask Mrs. Su.

325
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,560
I gave your moth orchid to her.

326
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,040
And I went to the big supermarket

327
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,800
to buy the biggest imported fruit box.

328
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,560
See? That is not enough.

329
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,240
This is our housekeeper, Mrs. Sun.

330
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,640
She can help to cook in the kitchen.

331
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,920
Glad to meet you.
Now, I will help with the cooking.

332
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,640
You don't have to do that.

333
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,520
These are nourishing sea cucumbers
and cubilose.

334
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,760
These are abalones and scallops.

335
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,280
It tastes good
if you put some of them in porridge.

336
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,240
I hope you like it.

337
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,080
You shouldn't have.

338
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,800
Yunzheng bothers you here.

339
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,520
Not at all.

340
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,360
And I'll bother you, too.

341
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,800
Not at all.

342
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,040
For Spring Festival,
the more people, the better.

343
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,800
Yeah.

344
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,640
Please take a seat.

345
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,920
Thank you.

346
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,680
Grandpa, I need to talk to you.

347
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,840
I finally know who he looks like.

348
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,360
Make some tea for them.

349
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,480
Take a seat, Grandpa.

350
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,360
Isn't this the moth orchid?

351
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,280
Let me ask you something.

352
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,080
Will you stay here
for the Spring Festival?

353
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,360
What are you afraid of?

354
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,560
Anyway, sooner or later,
we will be family.

355
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,680
I am here to make us closer.

356
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,040
You're not at home.

357
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,360
There is no point in celebrating

358
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,040
the Spring Festival
with the three of them.

359
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,560
What did I say?

360
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,360
I love you the most.

361
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,360
Grandpa,

362
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,400
have some tea.

363
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,360
OK, thank you.

364
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,520
Happy New Year.

365
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,360
The same to you.

366
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Thank you for your gifts.

367
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,800
I'll help with the cooking.
You stay here with Grandpa.

368
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,080
Isn't Wei'an cute?

369
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,120
That is too much.

370
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,960
It's a holiday today.

371
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,960
I should make myself look good.

372
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,280
Besides,

373
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,920
Yunzheng's grandfather is here.

374
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,960
I have to do it for you.

375
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,240
But you don't have to wear
such red lipstick.

376
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,840
Why not?

377
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,240
Who is it?

378
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,920
Who is it this time?

379
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,760
Let's see.

380
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,960
Uncle Zhao.

381
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,400
Zhao, what brings you here?

382
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Early this morning,

383
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,600
I went to the market and bought a fish.

384
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,400
It is big and fresh.

385
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,840
I think

386
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
you must like it.

387
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,960
Thank you, Uncle Zhao.

388
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,840
Meilan,

389
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,160
you look good in this dress.

390
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,920
Today is New Year's Eve.

391
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,040
I want to make myself look good.

392
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,920
Come on,

393
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,960
come in, please.

394
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,680
Come in and have a seat.

395
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,400
No.

396
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,160
I am here to give you the fish.

397
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,400
Uncle Zhao's children are all abroad.

398
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Don't you have to go home

399
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,720
to have a video chat with them?

400
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,240
Yes.

401
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,840
Then, I'm leaving now.

402
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,960
Please stay, Uncle Zhao.

403
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,280
You don't have to celebrate
the New Year's Eve alone.

404
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,360
Don't you think so, Mom?

405
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,920
Stay with us for New Year's Eve.

406
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,040
The more people, the better.

407
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,160
Since Wei'an invited you, you can stay.

408
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,040
Okay.

409
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:08,960
Come in.

410
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,920
I'll cook the fish.

411
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,400
This is Yunzheng.

412
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,160
He is Wei'an's boyfriend.

413
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,590
And this is Yunzheng's grandfather.

414
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,040
Nice to meet you.

415
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,240
This is my mom's...

416
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,520
Friend?

417
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,160
Yeah, my friend.

418
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,400
Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhao.

419
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,480
Nice to meet you, too.

420
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,360
Let me carry it for you.

421
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,480
It is fine.

422
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,080
Allow me.

423
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
Mrs. Sun will cook this fish later.

424
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
It is New Year's Eve.

425
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,280
Why don't we

426
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,240
play poker together later?

427
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,400
Sure.

428
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,280
I haven't played poker for long.

429
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,480
So, you like playing poker, don't you?

430
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:47,920
Yeah.

431
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,600
Good.

432
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,840
Three with pairs.

433
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,400
No. You shouldn't play like that.

434
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,960
What is your next move, then?

435
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,800
Yunzheng, help me here.

436
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,960
You are not married yet.

437
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,600
How can you ignore me?

438
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,840
Pass.

439
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,680
Okay.

440
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,400
Let me help you.

441
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,240
Three queens with one pair of five.

442
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,600
Pass.

443
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,680
Again?

444
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,400
My mother is the landlord.

445
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,520
The three of us are on a team.

446
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,600
I don't have the cards to play.

447
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,840
He's right.

448
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,600
But I have.

449
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,840
She played three queens
with a pair of fives.

450
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,400
Your cards don't match at all.

451
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,360
Oh! It is a good pair.

452
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,160
We have to hold on to it.

453
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,240
We can't break it up.

454
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,520
Grandpa,

455
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,600
I think there's little chance
you can win

456
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,720
as you are the landlord this time.

457
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,040
I am an old man now.

458
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,600
My eyes and brain can't work well.

459
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,240
I lost a lot in one afternoon.

460
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,400
I will help you this round.

461
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,960
You will win.

462
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,680
Right?

463
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,960
My grandfather will win this round.

464
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,720
Yes.

465
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,480
I am sure he will win.

466
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,240
Three, four, five, six, seven.

467
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Pass.

468
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,280
You can continue.

469
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,840
Three eights and two fours.

470
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,240
Oh, no.

471
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
I can't stop him.

472
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,160
Pass. I only have one card left.

473
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Pass.

474
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,080
Then, I'll be the winner.

475
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,840
No more cards.

476
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,400
He wins.

477
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,920
- That's great.
- Awesome.

478
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,840
Sir, should I

479
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,280
serve your Spring Festival meal

480
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,960
that you bought for 3888 yuan right now?

481
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,040
Sure.

482
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,480
Okay.

483
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,720
Excuse me?

484
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,840
There are only three of us.

485
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,520
Can you change it

486
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,360
to a meal that's only 1888 yuan?

487
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,800
I am sorry, ma'am.

488
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,520
It can't be changed now.

489
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,720
We'll have

490
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,240
the 3888-yuan meal.

491
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,040
No need to change.

492
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,400
Serve it now.

493
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,400
All right.

494
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,520
Du,

495
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,600
don't be angry on New Year's Eve.

496
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,000
Yunzheng has never been with us

497
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,960
on New Year's Eve.

498
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,800
It doesn't matter
if your father is not here.

499
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,600
After all, the three of us

500
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,520
are a family that loves each other.

501
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,680
Everyone else won't understand.

502
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,960
Shut up.

503
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,440
Mom, you don't have to talk so nice.

504
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,160
We have a lot of disagreements,

505
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,200
and we don't love each other.

506
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,800
There is no point for the three of us

507
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,920
to gather on New Year's Eve.

508
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,280
I've got something to do in the company.

509
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,400
I'm leaving now.

510
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,680
Yuncheng.

511
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
I have to take another look.

512
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,800
Happy New Year, Mr. and Mrs. Jiang.

513
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,160
I'm Ying's boyfriend, Fang Mingfan.

514
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,920
It is a great honor

515
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,280
for me to celebrate New Year's Eve

516
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,760
with you.

517
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,680
Mr. and Mrs. Jiang.

518
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,880
You're here, aren't you?

519
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,520
I saw you through the window.

520
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,920
What are you doing down there?

521
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,920
Hurry up.

522
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,320
Happy New Year.

523
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,920
Mom and Dad, my boyfriend is here.

524
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,520
Where is he?

525
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,760
Happy New Year, Mr. and Mrs. Jiang.

526
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I'm Ying's boyfriend, Fang Mingfan.

527
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,040
He is quite handsome.

528
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,920
Looks good.

529
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,640
It is a great honor

530
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,320
for me to celebrate New Year's Eve

531
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,280
with you here.

532
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,920
Fang,

533
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,160
come on in.

534
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,520
Take a seat.

535
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,160
Mr. and Mrs. Jiang.

536
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,680
This is cured goose meat made by my mom.

537
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,520
It's for you.

538
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,760
Thank you.

539
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,400
Please take a seat.

540
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,920
The dinner will be ready soon.

541
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,120
Come on in.

542
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,440
Jiang,

543
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,320
introduce your boyfriend to us.

544
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,920
Pretty handsome.

545
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,160
This is my boyfriend, Fang Mingfan.

546
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,120
He is a neurosurgeon

547
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,560
at Huaren Hospital.

548
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,760
That is a promising job.

549
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,040
These two

550
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,040
are my aunts.

551
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,040
Nice to meet you.

552
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Nice to meet you, too.

553
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,760
This is my uncle and aunt.

554
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,920
Nice to meet you.

555
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,560
Fang is quite good.

556
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,000
I think so.

557
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,280
Fang,

558
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,640
are you a director or a deputy director?

559
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,040
Aunt.

560
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,880
I'm trying to get a promotion.

561
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,800
As for when it happens,
it is hard to say.

562
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,920
Has anyone given you red envelopes?

563
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,120
I heard the doctor

564
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,000
- could earn much in this way.
- Yeah.

565
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
Being a doctor can make a fortune.

566
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,520
He must be rich.

567
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,400
Our hospital doesn't allow that.

568
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,920
I've never received them, either.

569
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,920
No red envelope?

570
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,640
How much is your monthly salary?

571
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,320
Apart from living expenses and rent,

572
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,440
there is still two
or three thousand yuan left.

573
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,160
How can you live with two
or three thousand yuan?

574
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,160
Two or three thousand yuan.

575
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,400
So, are you saying

576
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,160
you're still renting a house?

577
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,800
But have your parents

578
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
ever thought
about buying a house for you?

579
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,920
A house is necessary.

580
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,280
This is reality.

581
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,160
You can't live without a house.

582
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,320
It's serious.

583
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,800
Yeah.

584
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,000
Aunts,

585
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,760
it is my boyfriend's first time here.

586
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,920
Don't say that.

587
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,280
You'll scare him.

588
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,040
If I can't get married,
you are responsible for it.

589
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,680
It is alright.

590
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,920
I will definitely buy a house

591
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,880
when we get married.

592
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,320
I will definitely keep this in mind.

593
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,120
What's the use of keeping it in mind?

594
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,820
You have to take action.

595
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,520
Hello?

596
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,000
OK.

597
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,800
I'll be there soon.

598
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,440
Mr. and Mrs. Jiang.

599
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,040
What's the matter?

600
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,440
I'm sorry.

601
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
The elevated road in the south
of the city collapsed.

602
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
More than a dozen patients
were sent to our hospital.

603
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,920
I have to support them.

604
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,320
You're leaving now?

605
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,120
You can go.

606
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,400
Today is New Year's Eve.

607
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,920
I'm sorry.

608
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,160
- It is New Year's Eve.
- I'm sorry.

609
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,040
Take care.

610
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,160
Why does he work overtime?

611
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,320
Be careful on the road.

612
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,840
Jiang, see you then.

613
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,800
He is really unreliable.

614
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,520
This is our first time meeting.

615
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,200
Jiang.

616
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,520
- The future will only get worse.
- Yeah.

617
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,160
For this young man,

618
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,760
you have to think it over.

619
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,920
Up to now,

620
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,920
he doesn't have a house.

621
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,320
I invited my boyfriend here today

622
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,680
to let you know.

623
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,560
You shouldn't be so mean and critical.

624
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,240
It's like you were picking some goods.

625
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,880
Salary and house

626
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,960
are nothing if you

627
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,080
compare them

628
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,120
with his medical ideals.

629
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,920
Come on, dinner is ready.

630
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Let's stop it.

631
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,640
Let's eat.

632
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,640
It's okay.

633
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,960
Happy New Year!

634
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,960
Grandpa,

635
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,440
welcome to my home
to celebrate New Year's Eve.

636
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,200
You should come often in the future.

637
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
I wish you a good health.

638
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,960
Thank you.

639
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,720
Wish my mom

640
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,120
always young

641
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
and beautiful.

642
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,320
I hope you get along well

643
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,960
with Mr. Zhao.

644
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,800
You cheeky girl.

645
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,880
Nice talk.

646
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,720
Go for it.

647
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,720
Yunzheng,

648
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,720
do you remember what you did
at the Spring Festival in the past?

649
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,560
You traveled around the world alone.

650
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,800
That was so boring, wasn't it?

651
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Yeah, Grandpa.

652
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,360
From now on,

653
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,720
I will stay

654
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
with Wei'an forever.

655
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,720
You promised we would take me
and travel to Iceland together.

656
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,480
You must keep your promise.

657
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,680
Of course, I will take you there.

658
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,320
In the future,

659
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,240
Gu and Grandpa can come here

660
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,480
to celebrate the New Year.
Is that a good idea?

661
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,120
Yeah.

662
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,120
Good.

663
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,320
What about Mr. Zhao?

664
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,720
As for Mr. Zhao,

665
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,120
shouldn't we invite him

666
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,600
to celebrate the New Year
with us as well?

667
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,600
Of course.

668
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,040
We will celebrate it together.

669
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,120
The best thing

670
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,560
for a home

671
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,680
is its mutual tolerance
and understanding.

672
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,800
Just like the last round
of cards just now.

673
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,480
Do you think I can't tell

674
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,240
you were teaming up to let me win?

675
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,480
I am not that old yet. I can tell.

676
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,080
Mr. Gu.

677
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,440
We are family.

678
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,480
It doesn't matter who wins.

679
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,320
The most important thing is

680
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,720
that we all have fun together.

681
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,200
Right?

682
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,760
Yes.

683
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,080
Next routine.

684
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,080
Red envelopes.

685
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,080
Kids, take it.

686
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,080
Grandpa, I have grown up.

687
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,560
That is not appropriate.

688
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,840
I don't give this red envelope
for nothing.

689
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,080
After you take it,

690
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,320
you'll get married next year. Right?

691
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,040
Yeah.

692
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,920
Grandpa,

693
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,720
you don't have to wait until next year.

694
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,600
Great.

695
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,720
So happy. Cheer!

696
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,120
I haven't had

697
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,720
such a happy New Year's Eve dinner

698
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,720
for so many years.

699
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
Here is the thing.

700
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,200
Let's forget about the future.

701
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,840
We cherish the time right now.

702
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,720
That is right.

703
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,800
Here.

704
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Bottoms up.

705
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,600
Cherish the people you're with.

706
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

707
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,600
Cherish the people you're with.

708
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,600
My relatives

709
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,200
talked without thinking.

710
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,960
Don't take it seriously.

711
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,920
You are the best in my eyes.

712
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,320
Thank you, Jiang.

713
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
You must have searched

714
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,600
your words at the beginning
on the Internet. Right?

715
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,320
It was not fluent at all.

716
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,920
You must remember

717
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,320
when you propose to me,

718
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,720
you can't search your words
on the Internet.

719
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,480
That's not impressive.

720
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,320
You must think about it yourself.

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,640
Happy New Year.

750
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,360
Who is it?

751
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,120
Jiang.

752
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,080
How come you're back?

753
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,640
Uncle and aunt,

754
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,120
I'm sorry,

755
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,680
I left before I finished speaking.

756
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,120
I'm really sorry.

757
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,440
Mr. and Mrs. Jiang.

758
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,400
I want

759
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:15,840
to tell you

760
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,440
I really like Jing.

761
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,360
From the first time I saw her

762
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,680
in Lacaya,

763
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,880
I fell in love with her.

764
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,320
No matter what difficulties we encounter
in the future,

765
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,920
I will be good to her

766
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,360
and protect her.

767
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,400
I won't let her get any hurt.

768
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,400
Mr. Du.

769
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,600
Happy New Year.

770
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,720
It is New Year's Eve.
You should take a rest.

771
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,040
Anything I can help with?

772
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,280
Animal experimental data
failed to meet the standard.

773
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,040
Are you still in the mood
for the Chinese New Year?

774
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,680
I am not in the mood.

775
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,360
But I'm not idle at home.

776
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,160
I'm looking for reasons.

777
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,240
But you know, it takes time.

778
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,800
I have found a solution.

779
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,960
Do as I tell you.

780
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,040
It doesn't seem

781
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,560
to be my experimental data report.

782
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,880
It is not yours.

783
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,200
I asked someone else to do it.

784
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,880
Someone else?

785
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
After taking the new drugs,
50% of the investigational mice

786
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,200
have relief from the disease.

787
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,320
And 30% of the investigational mice

788
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,640
completely recovered.

789
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,520
This data is almost double

790
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,600
the results of animal experiments

791
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,880
we did last time.

792
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,120
However, the formulation

793
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,440
dosage of drugs

794
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,880
has not changed much.

795
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,960
This is so abnormal.

796
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,840
You know about drug research.

797
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,400
A subtle change

798
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,080
will affect the overall results.

799
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,680
It is not a surprise.

800
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,200
It is a blessing from God.

801
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,480
We are one step closer to success.

802
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,640
Mr. Du,

803
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,880
I am professional in this.

804
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
Don't be joking.

805
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,120
It is not metaphysics.

806
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,800
Everything has its fruit and its cause.

807
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,200
I think we should check it thoroughly

808
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,120
to ensure the accuracy of our data.

809
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,880
Are you questioning

810
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,920
the accuracy of the data I give?

811
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,160
Just advance the clinical trials.

812
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,640
Wei'an, come here.

813
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,080
You take these gifts

814
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,160
to visit Yunzheng's grandpa

815
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,360
and say hello to him for me.

816
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,400
Carry them like this.

817
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,240
So many?

818
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,400
Are you preparing my dowry?

819
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,160
When you get married,

820
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,480
I'll give you

821
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,120
a golden mountain.

822
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,720
I don't want to get married so young.

823
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,680
I still want

824
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,560
to stay with you.

825
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,080
Don't lie to me.

826
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,440
Once Yunzheng is here,

827
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,240
you will stay with him.

828
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,400
Hurry up.

829
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,800
Go and visit Yunzheng.

830
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,480
Be quick.

831
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,960
Why are you in such a hurry?

832
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,680
Is Mr. Zhao coming?

833
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,400
I have no problem with Mr. Zhao.

834
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
You should settle this up.

835
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,680
Mind your own business.

836
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,800
I mean it.

837
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Yes, it is me.

838
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,800
Okay, I got it.

839
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,360
Thank you.

840
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,920
The nursing home called

841
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,360
and said your aunt fell down.

842
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,480
Her condition is not very good.

843
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,040
Go.

844
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,640
Go.

845
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,200
I will get the clothes. Come on.

846
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,360
Jing.

847
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,400
How is my aunt?

848
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,160
What happened?

849
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,120
Actually,

850
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,040
she has a serious mental degradation.

851
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,560
Sometimes, she can't

852
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,440
find the thing she wants.

853
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,880
She doesn't remember eating.

854
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,880
There are even several times

855
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,480
she recognizes me as Miss Su.

856
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,150
Because of this, she didn't want

857
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,400
to go home to celebrate
the Spring Festival with us.

858
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,150
Right?

859
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,320
Mrs. Su has a strong self-esteem.

860
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,280
Except for me,

861
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,320
she doesn't want to see anyone.

862
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,480
Sometimes,

863
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,360
she doesn't want me

864
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,800
to do some daily care for her.

865
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,840
Mrs. Su

866
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,630
doesn't want me to tell you the truth.

867
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,040
But I don't think I can keep it
from you anymore.

868
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,960
You're right.

869
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,880
Can I go and take a look?

870
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,320
It's better not to irritate her.

871
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,230
I'm afraid she'll hurt herself
when she gets angry.

872
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,230
Well...

873
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,760
Then, let's just have a look
through the door.

874
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,560
Okay?

875
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,920
By the way,

876
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,150
When Mrs. Su was conscious, she told me

877
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,480
that she wanted to try some medicine.

878
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,640
I don't know what that means.

879
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,480
The last time I came to see her,

880
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,160
I told her that the drug you studied

881
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,880
was about to go through clinical trials.

882
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,080
I just want her to have hope.

883
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
I didn't expect her to remember that.

884
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,320
Aunt.

885
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,640
Aunt.

886
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Aunt, open the door.

887
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
I want to talk to you.

888
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,120
We come to celebrate
the Spring Festival with you.

889
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,320
Open the door now.

890
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,200
Aunt.

891
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,160
Medicine.

892
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,600
Medicine.

893
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,160
Aunt,

894
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,880
the clinical trial
of gene editing therapy

895
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,440
is still at a very early stage.

896
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,400
The entry criteria for subjects
are very strict.

897
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,560
You've experienced
aneurysm rupture twice.

898
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,760
You really don't fit to be a subject.

899
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,600
I know you're worried.

900
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,000
But this time,

901
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,440
I really can't put you at risk.

902
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,440
Yuan.

903
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,360
Yuan, are you all right?

904
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:04,880
Aunt.

905
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,880
Please open the door.

906
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,560
Aunt.

907
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,400
Do you have a spare key?

908
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,320
She'll open the door when you're gone.

909
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,360
Wei'an,

910
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,640
we might as well go home now.

911
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,920
Don't bother her anymore.

912
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,480
Jing, I will leave her to you, then.

913
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,480
Don't worry.

914
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,440
Let's go home now.

915
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,480
Jing will take care of her.

916
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,440
Aunt,

917
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,320
I will definitely
speed up the drug trial.

918
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
You have to take good care of yourself.

919
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,040
Wait for new drugs to go on the market.

920
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,400
Let's go.

921
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,120
Thank you.

922
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,240
I'm sorry to trouble you.

923
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,240
(A phase II clinical trial
needs tens of millions of funds.)

924
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,000
(Where can we raise so much money?)

925
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,400
(Where there is a will, there is a way.)

926
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,520
(Don't worry about it.)

927
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,400
(I'll handle it.)

928
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,680
Dr. Gu,

929
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,800
although Huntington's Disease

930
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,880
is a rare disease,

931
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,360
The drug you're developing

932
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,400
is also the so-called "orphan drug".

933
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,160
But I understand

934
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,640
this road is very difficult.

935
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,600
I am willing to contribute

936
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,560
to your process.

937
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,160
Mr. Li, thank you for your support.

938
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,560
At present, our country has a lot of

939
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,600
supporting policies for "orphan drugs".

940
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,520
We will try our best

941
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,960
to get some help.

942
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,080
Dr. Gu,

943
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,680
The company has its own process

944
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,640
to evaluate a project.

945
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,920
I hope Dr. Gu

946
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,160
can show more sincerity.

947
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,240
So that I can make the process easier.

948
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,640
Mr. Li, what do you mean by sincerity?

949
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,080
For example, in the animal
experiment stage,

950
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,880
what are the core technologies adopted?

951
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,560
Mr. Li, you should know that.

952
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,640
Before the research results
are officially published,

953
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,080
important core technologies

954
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,840
and the test process,

955
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,600
as well as

956
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,600
data and information,
are all scientific research secrets.

957
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,480
I understand all of this.

958
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,800
But the company is very cautious
about investing in projects now.

959
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,360
We want to make sure
your drug is promising.

960
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,800
Without this information,

961
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,480
I'm afraid I can't guarantee
your project can pass.

962
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,120
Mr. Li,

963
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,640
this brain pacemaker

964
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,440
for Huntington's chorea

965
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,480
is very promising.

966
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,840
Its selling price

967
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,840
will be between 300,000 and 500,000.

968
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,200
The profit rate is over 70%.

969
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,800
If

970
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,240
you don't have a clear

971
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,440
cooperation intention,

972
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,400
I think

973
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,080
there's no need for us to talk.

974
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,160
Don't worry, Dr. Gu.

975
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,840
Since your brain pacemaker

976
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,880
has such a market prospect,

977
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,360
we're definitely going to invest in it.

978
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,360
Are you from a medical company?

979
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,640
Have you read my project plan?

980
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,840
Of course I have read.

981
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,600
I promise.

982
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,480
Excuse me, Mr. Li.

983
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,480
I have work to do.

984
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,240
See you then.

985
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,720
Dr. Gu.

986
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,880
Miss Wen.

987
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,120
You can't get any information.

988
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,480
How dare you ask me for money?

989
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,600
Actually, it was quite smooth.

990
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,480
I don't know which sentence is wrong.

991
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,320
He suddenly became suspicious.

992
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,240
What did you say?

993
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,880
Gu Yunzheng told me

994
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,480
the brain pacemaker

995
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,160
can be sold at a good price.

996
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,040
There is no shortage of investment.

997
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,960
You are a fool.

998
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,200
He studies drugs,

999
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,480
not a pacemaker.

1000
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,120
Gu Yunzheng

1001
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,800
is really a fox.

1002
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,080
He is so defensive.

1003
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,880
Dr. Gu,

1004
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,880
how's it going?

1005
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,320
Is Tongyuan Pharmaceutical
willing to invest in us?

1006
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,240
That Mr. Li is not
from the company at all.

1007
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,680
He was sent by Wen Ran

1008
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,400
and tried to steal our plan.

1009
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,720
Did you give it to them?

1010
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,640
Of course not.

1011
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,720
I know the identity of that man.

1012
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
Then, I terminated the negotiations.

1013
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,160
That's good.

1014
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,880
How can Wen Ran do that?

1015
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,960
That is not fair.

1016
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,800
What does she want?

1017
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,160
I guess they can't break
through technical barriers.

1018
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,040
After all, that plan

1019
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,120
was stolen from me by He Xiaoguang.

1020
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,880
He has no ability to advance at all.

1021
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,680
What about the money?

1022
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,160
We have no time to lose.

1023
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,720
I went to see my aunt.

1024
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,480
She said

1025
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,080
she is willing to be our subject.

1026
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,360
Did you agree?

1027
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,400
Of course not.

1028
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,160
She's experienced
aneurysm rupture twice.

1029
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,880
No matter what happens,

1030
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,840
we have to wait until
all the clinical trials are completed

1031
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,160
and ensure the safety and effectiveness
before it can be used by her.

1032
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,080
It's just that I'm afraid
she can't wait.

1033
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,360
Wei'an, no matter how hard it is,

1034
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,760
I will solve the problem
of funds as soon as possible.

1035
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,880
It was a difficult experiment.
But we made it.

1036
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,760
We can solve the problem of money.

1037
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,760
Mr. Xu,

1038
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,080
how do you do? I'm Gu Yunzheng.

1039
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,880
I think you have read

1040
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,680
our project's materials, haven't you?

1041
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,480
Yes. It's about Huntington's Disease.

1042
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,560
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

1043
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,400
Mr. Xiao.

1044
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,240
Are you

1045
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,160
Mr. Yang of Meiya Botai?

1046
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,680
Yes, I am Gu Yunzheng
from Huaren Hospital.

1047
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,960
For the fund...

1048
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,640
Hello?

1049
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,320
Yes. Huntington's Disease.

1050
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,000
Hello?

1051
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,480
Didn't you say last time

1052
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,640
that the project has

1053
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,000
been reviewed internally?

1054
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,640
Hello?

1055
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,160
