186
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,300
with a caption saying life is difficult.

187
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,900
Why did you do that?
Who did you send it to?

188
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,500
Which girl do you want
to care about you?

189
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,900
I didn't mean that at all, Jiang.

190
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,500
I was just passing by a cafe that day,

191
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
seeing a little bear.

192
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,700
And I felt a bit sad

193
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,700
at that moment. That's all.

194
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,200
Then why did you block me?

195
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,600
Besides,

196
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
when you're in trouble,

197
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,100
shouldn't I be the first to know?

198
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,300
No. Jiang, I...

199
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,500
I just didn't want you to feel sad.

200
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,400
I was afraid you'd worry about me.

201
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,700
I didn't want my emotions to affect you.

202
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,700
And there was the thing that happened
in the hospital operating room that day.

203
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,100
It's hard to say in a few words.

204
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
It's hard to say in a few words?

205
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,900
Then just say a few more words.

206
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,000
Jiang, let's drop it.

207
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
Can't we be happy
and have a nice meal together?

208
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,300
Let's eat.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,100
I know I'm dumb and useless.

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,900
I don't know

211
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,500
any of those medical terms

212
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,400
that you are familiar with.

213
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
I know you just don't want
to talk to me.

214
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,100
Because you think talking to me

215
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
is like talking to a wall.

216
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,800
Is that it?

217
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,100
Jiang, why do you misunderstand me?

218
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,200
I really didn't have that thought
at that time.

219
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,100
I blocked you back then

220
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,600
just because I didn't want you
to worry about me.

221
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,900
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,700
I didn't consider your feelings.

223
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,900
But I really don't mean
to think less of you.

224
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,100
Then tell me now.

225
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,100
What kind of trouble are you in?

226
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,500
I don't deserve to know it,

227
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,200
is that it?

228
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,600
Fang Mingfan,

229
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,900
you don't have
to tell me anything anymore.

230
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900
I don't want to hear it either.

231
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
From now on, your joys or sorrows

232
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,900
have nothing to do with me

233
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
as long as you are happy.

234
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,800
Jiang.

235
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,500
Jiang.

236
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,400
Sir, you haven't paid yet.

237
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Ying.

238
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,900
Kai.

239
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,700
You don't look so good.

240
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,600
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

241
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,900
No.

242
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,000
Maybe I didn't sleep well last night.

243
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm a bit tired.

244
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,400
How about we reschedule for another day?

245
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,500
Don't worry. I am fine.

246
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,800
We're already here.

247
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
Just let me know

248
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,500
If you feel uncomfortable.

249
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,900
Let's go.

250
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,900
Wait a moment.

251
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,300
I need to tell my mom.

252
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,700
Mom,

253
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,900
I'm going to the movies with Ying,

254
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,100
and I cannot go shopping with you.

255
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,100
You can only shop by yourselves.

256
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,800
Let's take a picture.

257
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Smile.

258
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
Alright, let's go.

259
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:40,900
Dr. Gu,

260
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,100
there are no more surgeries today.

261
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,500
You can go home and get some rest.

262
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,200
Okay, got it. Thank you.

263
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,200
No need to work overtime today.

264
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,500
Why don't you go on a date
with your girlfriend?

265
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,200
I almost
don't have a girlfriend anymore.

266
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,500
What happened? Did you have a fight?

267
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,300
To be precise,

268
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,100
I made her angry.

269
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,700
She just wanted to comfort me,

270
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,100
but I...

271
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,100
She was right.

272
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,900
I was just feeling sorry for myself.

273
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,200
Look at this.

274
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,800
I've made so many calls,
but she didn't answer.

275
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,900
First, she didn't answer the phone.

276
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,700
Then she blocked me on WeChat.

277
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,600
And finally,
she disappeared without a word

278
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,100
and went without a trace.

279
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,400
I know this all too well.

280
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Patrãozinho,

281
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,700
she didn't block me.

282
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,700
It's just you
who didn't make it through.

283
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,300
Just kidding.

284
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,500
She only blocked you

285
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,100
and didn't delete you,

286
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,600
which means there's still hope for you.

287
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,300
Is there a difference

288
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,800
between block and delete?

289
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,100
Of course there is.

290
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,900
If she deletes you,

291
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,900
it is to erase all of your memories,

292
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
like the chat history,

293
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
the pictures,
and the videos you sent are all gone.

294
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
But If she blocks you,

295
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,100
you are just not chatting temporarily.

296
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
That makes sense.

297
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
In terms of love skills,

298
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,900
I do have a little
more experience than you.

299
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,700
My Jiang Muying

300
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,300
is probably
just temporarily ignoring me.

301
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,200
You look like
you're going to live alone forever.

302
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,100
I'm going to live alone forever
because of you.

303
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,800
What did I do wrong again?

304
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,100
Last time, I was actually going

305
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,700
to clear things up with Su Wei'an

306
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,300
but was called back for surgery by you.

307
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,300
I'm sorry, patrãozinho.

308
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,900
I really didn't know at the time.

309
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,100
Fang Mingfan,

310
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,900
I can give you a chance to make amends.

311
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,400
I want to meet Su Wei'an.

312
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,100
Su Wei'an?

313
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,300
Where can I find Su Wei'an?

314
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,500
I don't have her contact information.

315
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,400
Su Wei'an is in China right now.

316
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,400
Your girlfriend

317
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,700
meets her frequently.

318
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't care what tricks you use.

319
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,300
If I can't meet the person
I want to see,

320
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,200
then you'll never get to see the person

321
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,300
you want to see.

322
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,900
Okay.

323
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Understood.

324
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,500
I'll go make up with Jiang Muying now

325
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,500
and then bring Su Wei'an
in front of you.

326
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,700
Then why don't you go right away?

327
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
[ONE WAY LIVE HOUSE Bar]

328
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,400
Wei'an,

329
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm your most loyal fan.

330
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't let my passion intimidate you.

331
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,700
You've done a great job
with the atmosphere here.

332
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,700
You can ask the boss
for your salary later.

333
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,000
Today, I'll show you

334
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,900
what it means to be a one-person team.

335
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
Where's Fang Mingfan?

336
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,300
Doing surgery?

337
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,100
Don't mention him.

338
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,900
We haven't contacted
for quite a few days.

339
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,500
Let it be.

340
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,600
Reconciliation is just one step
from the fight.

341
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,000
It depends on who takes that step first.

342
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,600
Then why should I be the one
to take the step?

343
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,600
Can't he take that step first?

344
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,200
Of course he can,

345
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,600
but it could have different outcomes.

346
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,900
It's like if he misses a step,

347
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,300
it might be just a scrape.

348
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,100
But if he rolls down the stairs,

349
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,400
then it's all over.

to you a mystery guest.

Who?

358
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,900
Wei'an.

Alright,

362
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,900
today's performance is up to you.

363
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,100
You guys have a good chat.

364
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,000
Yuncheng, do you remember me?

365
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,500

00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
please give him a glass of honey water.

554
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,300
That's great.

555
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,200
You're going to feed me, aren't you?

556
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,000
Come on.

557
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,500
Let's have a drink together.

558
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,900
If you continue like this,
I'll call security.

559
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,900
You little girl,

560
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,400
stop pretending to be aloof with me.

561
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,600
Come on.

562
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,500
Let go of me.

563
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,900
You've got a temper, don't you?

564
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,600
Let me see how tough you are.

565
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,300
Who are you? Mind your own business.

566
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,300
I'm really sorry, dude.

567
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,900
I haven't practiced Ju-Jitsu
for a long time.

568
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,300

569
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,900
I just couldn't help it.

570

I'll tell you what.

571
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,800
Even though you stink

572
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,000
and you're ugly,

573
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,400
you are suitable as the sitting ducks.

574
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,900

577
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
Let me tell you.

578
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,300
You'd better get out of here quickly

579
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,500

580
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,800

584
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,000

585
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,700
Listen,

586
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,900
I've already called the police.

594
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,700

Don't worry.

596

Okay.

I know you have me in mind.

607

If you hadn't been there just now,

608
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,300
I might have got hurt.

609
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,500
Dr. Gu,

610
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,700
won't you introduce your friend to us?

611
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,000
Let me introduce myself.

612
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
My name is Li Wantong.

613
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,100
I'm Dr. Gu's

614
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,800

615
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,500
Just colleague.

616
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,900
It's a bit strange.

617
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,100
It's a feeling I can't describe.

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,900
Who is this lady?

619

620
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,200
She's a Harvard Ph.D.

621
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,600
in the Psychological Department
at Huaren Hospital.

622
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,400
She is Boss's pursuer.

623

She's a Harvard woman with a PhD?

624
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,000
Impressive.

I remember now.

626
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,700
Wei'an mentioned her last time.

627
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,300
Since we're all gathered here,

628
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,400
how about having a drink

629
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,500
and getting to know each other?

630
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,700
Yeah, that's right.

631
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,100
Why is everyone still standing here?

632
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,700
Let's drink and talk. Let's go.

633
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,600
I won't be joining you.

634
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
I have to perform.

635
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,300
Wei'an,

636
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,000
you don't have to perform today.

637
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,100
Just have a good drink
and chat with your friends.

638
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
Don't worry. You'll still get paid.

639
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,400
I'll cover

640
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
all the expenses today.

641

I'm here if you need anything.

643

Su Wei'an,

644
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,300
your boss told you to stay.

645
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Are you still going to run away?

646
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,800
Why would I run away?

647
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So,

648
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,700
why don't we sit together,

649
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,500

650
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,100
I don't have time.

651
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,300
I'm busy.

652
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,600
Is there any kind of painful past

653
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,500
between Miss Su and Dr. Gu?

654
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,100
Otherwise, why would it trigger

655
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,400
such a strong

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,700

657
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,900
You're overthinking it.

658
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
There was nothing special between us
in the past.

659
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,000
I just don't want to talk.

660
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,800
So,

let's all sit together and chat.

662

for a long time.

665

It's not safe.

738
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,100
Why didn't you tell me?
I'll drink it for you.

739
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,700
You will have the chance
to drink it later.

740
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,500
Wei'an, it's your turn.

741
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,000
Truth or Dare?

742
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,200
I'll choose Truth.

743
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,100
What's great about this game is

744
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,100
that you can hear things

745
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,700
you don't usually hear.

746
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,300
But I like to play Dare.

747
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,800
Yes, Wei'an likes adventures.

748
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,900
Look at the person directly
across from you for 30 seconds.

749
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,200
Su Wei'an,

750
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,200
what's the matter?

751
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,500
You don't even have the guts
to look me in the eyes?

752
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,000
Come over.

753
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,400
Su Wei'an,

754
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,300
look me in the eyes.

755
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,800
I'll time it.

756
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,500
Ready, go.

757
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,000
[Is there someone of the opposite sex
in this gathering whom you like? ]

758
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
Boring.

759
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,500
Is this boring to you?

760
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,700
I think it's quite fun.

761
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,800
At least it gives me a chance

762
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,100
to ask you

763
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,000
why you disappeared without a word.

764
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,500
Ladies and gentlemen.

765
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,900
Miss Jiang Muying

766
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,100
just dedicated a song to all of you.

767
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,100
Let's shake our hands.

768
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,200
Dr. Gu,

769
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,700
the most important thing for adults
in a relationship

770
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,500
is to be responsible for themselves.

771
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,400
The past is the past,

772
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,500
even if it's beautiful.

773
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,700
Wei'an has moved on now.

774
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,300
Why are you stuck in the past?

775
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,500
You're making everyone unhappy.

776
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,600
Did I make her unhappy?

777
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,600
Yes.

778
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,500
Life is not easy for Wei'an.

779
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,100
I beg you, Dr. Gu.

780
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,600
Please stay away from her

781
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,800
and stop putting so much pressure
on her.

782
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Wei'an, are you okay?

783
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,700
Is there a story

784
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,100
between you and Gu Yunzheng?

785
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,700
Seeing you two were. . .

786
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,200
It's all right.

787
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,300
When we were in Lacaya,

788
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,400
he was a doctor
and I was an interpreter.

789
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,900
We were just

790
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,900
work partners.

791
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,600
Maybe I left too abruptly

792
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,000
and didn't explain things
to him clearly.

793
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,700
So there might be some misunderstanding.

794
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,800
Besides that,

795
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,700
there's nothing else.

796
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,300
Actually, I really like being with you.

797
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
I can take off the mask
and stay away from competition.

798
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,900
It's nice to live life to the fullest.

799
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,700
Wei'an, actually,

800
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,800
you can be like this too.

801
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,100
You can tell me
what's bothering you.

802
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,300
But compared to an exciting life,

803
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,100
what I want more

804
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,000
is a peaceful and lasting one.

805
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,500
You know, you don't have to
push yourself too hard.

806
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,100
Just relax and be yourself.

807
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,300
But I don't have time anymore.

808
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,200
Why?

809
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,400
