[Based on the novel "Healer"
by Ningmeng Yuyan]

18
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,140
You said

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,540
you were receiving me for your mentor,

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,100
but your attention

21
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,180
was all on her these days.

22
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,100
And Mr. Du from Jiehui

23
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,860
is the same.

24
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,180
Receiving me is not your real intention.

25
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,460
Except looking cute,

26
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,180
I can't see what's so unusual

27
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,700
about this little girl.

28
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,700
She could always

29
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,180
bring some surprises.

30
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,300
Dr. Lu, I made this especially for you.

31
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,580
It's called Déjà Vu.

32
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,700
Déjà Vu?

33
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,100
Why did you give it this name?

34
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,940
It means seeming familiar in French.

35
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,980
For example,

36
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,780
if a person comes to a place

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,140
that he's been longing for,

38
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,420
he will have a strong sense

39
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,180
of shock and familiarity.

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,860
He may even have a feeling

41
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,100
that he's been here before.

42
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,460
Do you like it?

43
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,780
So?

44
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,540
Dr. Lu, you were born in Jinhai City.

45
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,820
Though you've left for decades,

46
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,180
and the landmark buildings here

47
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,980
are no longer what you remembered,

48
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,100
you still took a lot of photos

49
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,580
and spoke like a dictionary
on their history.

50
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,820
Everything in your hometown

51
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,340
is still familiar to you.

52
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,940
So I named it Déjà Vu.

53
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,540
I'm getting to know the surprises

54
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,700
you just talked about.

55
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,580
Let's have a toast.

56
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,540
Dr. Lu, welcome home.

57
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,220
Hope you can find the sense of belonging

58
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,340
that you've been longing for
in the days to come.

59
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,940
Alright, thanks.

60
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,580
However,

61
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,460
no matter how great you are

62
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,100
at fawning over me, I don't plan

63
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,340
to sell my patent to Jiehui.

64
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,340
Is it because

65
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,460
this patent has defects?

66
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,180
How did you know this?

67
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,180
It's rare.

68
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,500
I thought Jiehui

69
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,100
would never know this,

70
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,820
and they assumed

71
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,780
that I was only unsatisfied
with the price.

72
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,020
You've been keeping

73
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,300
this information from the public.

74
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,940
I made this bold speculation

75
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,540
because I saw the news.

76
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,700
Which news?

77
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,220
When personalized standard brain atlas
real-time navigation technology

78
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,700
enters clinical trials,

79
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,940
you said,

80
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,340
as long as this technology
can save one more person,

81
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,300
your lifelong research
will not be in vain.

82
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,980
I guess,

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,780
if a person
could say something like that,

84
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,940
he would never delay it

85
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,340
from entering the Chinese market

86
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,860
for the price.

87
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,300
The number of deaths

88
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,420
caused by glioma in China

89
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,580
every year has reached 30,000.

90
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,180
The reason behind this may only be

91
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,340
that the technology is not yet perfect.

92
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,340
Dr. Lu,

93
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,700
Huaren's scientific research ability

94
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,340
is evident to everyone.

95
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,820
We can work together

96
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,340
to solve this problem.

97
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,180
But to study neuronavigation systems,

98
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,100
it is necessary
to combine stereotactic technology,

99
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,580
modern imaging technology, AI,

100
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,340
MIS, and so on.

101
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,700
Strong financial support
is needed for this.

102
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,060
So, Dr. Lu,

103
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,780
I think Jiehui is your best choice.

104
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,100
Let me ask you.

105
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,300
How do you maintain the purity
of research in profit-driven companies?

106
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,180
Dr. Lu,

107
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,460
Mr. Du is a businessman now,

108
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,740
but he

109
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,980
was an excellent doctor.

110
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,340
He chooses to develop medicine

111
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
because he wants to help doctors

112
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,940
cure and save more people.

113
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,420
So Du Yuncheng is perfect in your mind.

114
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,580
Are you done with this?

115
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,700
We are talking about work.

116
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,860
I am talking about work.

117
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,300
Don't involve your personal grudges.

118
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,060
I...

119
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,580
It's boring talking about work.

120
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,420
How about this?

121
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,540
Miss Su has just performed for us.

122
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,540
Dr. Gu,

123
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,340
it's your turn.

124
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,700
If you win higher cheers,

125
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,700
I'd work with Huaren.

126
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Dr. Lu,

127
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,940
how could you decide such a big thing

128
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,300
in a playful way like this?

129
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,460
It's my patent.

130
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,820
I can sell it to whoever I want.

131
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,180
I'm this old now.

132
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,700
Money can't buy me happiness.
Just for fun.

133
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,540
Dr. Lu,

134
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,980
that's a deal.

135
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,780
Girl,

136
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,940

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,780
I'm sorry.

191
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,580
I didn't mean to deceive you.

192
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,380
After breaking up with you,

193
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,340
I couldn't drink or eat.

194
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,500
I know I shouldn't bother you.

195
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,660
If Mrs. Du didn't find me,

196
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,500
I wouldn't have told her

197
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,660
that we had broken up.

198
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,900
Do you know why my mom likes you?

199
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,380
We have similar tastes and interests.

200
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,780
We have common topics to talk about.

201
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,660
If she weren't your mom,

202
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,980
we would have been good friends.

203
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,500
Why are you laughing, Yuncheng?

204
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,820
Good friends. Common topics.

205
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,220
Do you know how much she's done

206
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,020
to please you?

207
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,020
She hates sports,

208
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,660
but she signed up
for a yoga class with you.

209
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,020
She bought clothes
from your favorite brands,

210
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,820
but she never wore them.

211
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,260
We are in a relationship,

212
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,500
but she put in the most effort.

213
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,500
Do you think it's funny?

214
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,340
But why did she do this?

215
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,300
I never asked her

216
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,100
to like the things I like.

217
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,100
Because, in her eyes,

218
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,900
the Wen and Du families
are of equal social rank.

219
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,060
And you

220
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,100
are the best choice
for her daughter-in-law.

221
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,060
I don't mind, Yuncheng.

222
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,300
As long as I can be with you,

223
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,580
I won't mind these things.

224
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,020
Wen Ran, if I tell you

225
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,380
that I've never loved you.

226
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Don't you mind?

227
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,740
Why did you be with me

228
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,260
if you didn't like me?

229
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,620
Why?

230
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,820
You don't know why?

231
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,140
You are just using me.

232
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,420
You threatened me.

233
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,820
You threatened me with your father.

234
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,780
You knew how important

235
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,900
HDQ39 was to me.

236
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,980
Yuncheng,

237
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,580
I thought you could fall in love

238
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,740
with me gradually
if I treated you better.

239
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,860
I don't understand.

240
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,340
Why is

241
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,100
Su Wei'an

242
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,060
better than me?

243
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,820
Yuncheng,

244
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,740
it's still the same now.

245
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,900
Nothing has changed.

246
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,060
I can still
give you everything you want.

247
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,340
Please don't break up with me.

248
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,340
Can you have some dignity, Wen Ran?

249
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,060
Yuncheng, you know

250
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,540
how much I love you.

251
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,500
Dignity means nothing

252
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,060
in front of love.

253
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,540
Sorry,

254
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,820
to me,

255
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,740
your love means nothing.

256
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,060
Bye.

257
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,020
Goodnight, Dr. Lu.

258
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,980
See you tomorrow.

259
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,260
Have a good rest.

260
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,060
The result
of today's competition is obvious.

261
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,140
You lost.

262
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,700
But

263
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,220
I don't feel like working
with Huaren, either.

264
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,740
What? Why?

265
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,860
Dr. Lu, a deal is a deal.

266
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,060
Why?

267
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,900
Dr. Lu can do whatever he wants.

268
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,260
It's his patent.

269
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,140
How about this?

270
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,820
If you work together

271
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,660
and can

272
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,420
improve this technology together,

273
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,740
maybe I can think about this.

274
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
- Okay.
- Impossible.

275
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,060
What are you talking about?

276
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,140
I think we can do this.

277
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,820
Dr. Lu,

278
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,100
I'm not a researcher of Jiehui.

279
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,420
I'm just a help to receive you.

280
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,820
You are so focused on this,

281
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,340
and you are so familiar
with the development

282
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,340
of neuronavigation technology.

283
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,340
I thought you were a researcher.

284
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,060
I'm just a help.

285
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,500
Mr. Du is so lucky.

286
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,500
Even a temporary worker
is so responsible.

287
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,740
Others may think

288
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,100
Jiehui is operated
by a couple of you two.

289
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,740
No.

290
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,900
She's always responsible
for her temporary work.

291
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,580
Never mind.

292
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,060
I don't think
we can work together this time.

293
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,540
Hold on, Dr. Lu.

294
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,260
Bye-bye.

295
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,340
Dr. Lu,

296
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,140
are you sure you're willing

297
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,860
to waste your decades of hard work?

298
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,820
Please think about it.

299
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,140
It's too late.

300
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,060
Dr. Lu.

301
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,860
Dr. Lu.

302
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,060
That's it.

303
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,980
It's raining.

304
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,340
It's hard to take a taxi.

305
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,660
Let me take you back.

306
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,300
No need. It's all your fault.

307
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,540
I have important things to tell you

308
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,420
about your aunt.

309
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,740
I'm not so sure

310
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,540
if your aunt's aneurysm

311
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,540
is related to the drug testing

312
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,820
or how much they are related,

313
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,060
but just to play it safe,

314
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,660
I suggest stopping the drug test first.

315
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,380
What happened?

316
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,540
I have reviewed

317
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,740
all the relevant materials of HDQ39.

318
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,340
Among a total of 100 testees

319
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,220
in clinical phase I and phase II,

320
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,540
none existed in this kind of situation.

321
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,540
However, there have been reports

322
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,140
of aneurysms in mice
in animal experimental papers

323
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,860
during the HDQ39
molecular development phase.

324
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,860
This does not necessarily indicate

325
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,100
that HDQ39 can lead
to aneurysms, though.

326
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,500
However, HDQ39

327
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,660
significantly alleviated
my aunt's movement disorders.

328
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,900
My aunt only stopped the medicine
for three days,

329
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,100
and her symptoms reappeared.

330
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,020
But Wei'an,

331
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,580
I still suggest
stopping the medicine first

332
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,100
to rule out this possibility.

333
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,340
No.

334
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,820
I'm afraid stopping the medicine

335
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,540
will affect my aunt.

336
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,580
I know you are avoiding me,

337
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,980
but please don't doubt
my professional advice

338
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,820
because of this.

339
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,100
I'm not.

340
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,980
But we can't stop the medicine rashly

341
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,140
because of speculation.

342
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,500
HDQ39

343
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,340
is my aunt's only hope now.

344
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,540
[Yuncheng]

345
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,340
Hello, Yuncheng.

346
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,540
What are you doing?

347
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,860
I hate to see you with Du Yuncheng.

348
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,380
I hate him calling you.

349
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,140
I hate him screwing the bottle cap
for you.

350
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,580
I hate the way he looks at you.

351
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,380
I hate the way he talks to you.

352
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,860
I don't know why.

353
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,100
I feel angry

354
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,060
when I see you with him.

355
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,540
Does it have anything to do with you?

356
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,340
This is where I am most angry.

357
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,340
Su Wei'an,

358
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,260
what do you think

359
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,340
of the things that happened between us?

360
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,740
We went through so much
in Lacaya together.

361
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,340
You forget?

362
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,060
Or do you want to end this

363
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,380
without an explanation?

364
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,260
Yes.

365
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,780
I'm just like that.

366
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,780
I like giving up halfway.

367
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,780
Fine.

368
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,540
Why do you keep the stone with you?

369
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,220
What stone?

370
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,060
What are you doing?

371
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,340
Explain this.

372
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,740
This stone

373
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,740
reminds me of the dark rainbow.

374
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,540
It has nothing to do with you.

375
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,900
Really?

376
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,100
Fine.

377

If that's the case,

378
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,740
you won't mind if I throw it.

379
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,740
Gu Yunzheng,

380
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,900
can we stop this?

381
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,500
We've left Lacaya.

382
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,900
Why are you still trapped there?

383
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,340
Yes.

384
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,580
I was down and out and bored,

385
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,860
then you appeared.

386
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,060
But if it wasn't you,

387
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,780
there would be others.

388
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,620
The dream ends now,

389
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,620

Your entanglement with me now

392
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,340
is only your one-sided wish.

393
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,900
Wei'an,

394
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,100

are you alright?

412
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,220
Why are you back so late?

(of the things

We went through so much
in Lacaya together.

You forget?

418
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,820
Or do you want to end this

419
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,260
without an explanation?

Hey,

430
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,540
why did she blackmail me?

431
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,820
Sir, we are closing now.

432
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,020
Shall I contact your friend
to pick you up?

433
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,500
Okay.

434
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,340
Call her.

435
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,580
Ask her to come here to pick me up.

436
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,500
Sir, what's your password?

437
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,340
I can't unlock your phone.

00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,580
Well, six zeros.

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,620
Hello.

440
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,380
Yes.

00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,980
Mr. Gu you are looking for

442

is drunk in our bar.

443
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,580
Can you come and pick him up?

444
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,060
Dr. Gu,

445
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,980
you are awake.

446
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,420
Where am I?

447
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,580
Why are you here?

448
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,860
It's a hotel.

449
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,980
As to why I am here,

450
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,500
what do you think?

451
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,340
I drank too much last night.

452
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,620
I can't remember anything.

453
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
But from a biological perspective,

454
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,100
a hangover man

455
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,220
is absolutely impossible

456
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,500
to engage in drunken promiscuity.

457
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,500
Dr. Li,

458
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,340
please leave us both some dignity.

459
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,380
For your dignity,

460
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,540
I dragged you here from the bar.

461
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,660
You vomited on your coat.

462
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,500
I cleaned and air-dried it for you.

463
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,780
But now you're completely ungrateful.

464
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,020
And you are blaming me now.

465
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,820
Gu Yunzheng, you are heartless.

466
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,340
Sorry,

467
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,300
I wronged you.

468
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,860
I wouldn't say you wronged me.

469
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,140
I had other intentions last night,

470
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,300
but I tried everything

471
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,980
to move you to this bed,

472
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,620
and you just fell asleep.

473
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,500
I couldn't wake you up.

474
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,380
Why was it you that moved me here?

475
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,380
Who do you hope it would be?

476
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,580
Su Wei'an?

477
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,740
I've heard this name

478
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,580
so many times last night.

479
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,580
Tell me, how did she

480
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,140
abandon you?

481
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,060
Enough.

482
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,900
With your look and IQ,

483
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,020
you have perfect genes.

Gu Yunzheng,

487
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,380
you're abandoned, and I'm single.

488

Why don't we

489
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,380
be together?

490
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,060
Gu Yunzheng,
you have no tenderness toward women.

491
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,140
Li Wantong,

492
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,140
you should

493
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,100
go see a psychologist.

494
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,740
I'm going to work. Get off.

495
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,380
I'm going to work too, Dr. Gu.

496
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,500
We have the same destination.

You are here.

501
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,860
that they went to the hotel together.

502
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,660
You came alone?

503
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,540
I come here alone every day.

509
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500

in the emergency dept for a few months?

that Dr. Lu is in the advanced stage
of gastric cancer,

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,660
has nothing to do with HDQ39,

566
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,380
so he didn't stop the drug test?

567
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,020
You suspect the aneurysm
is related to the drug test?

568
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,740
Dr. Gu has this speculation.

569
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,740
According to regulations,

570
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,820
serious adverse events

571
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,060
should be reported immediately.

572
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,900
If HDQ39

573
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,740
is related to the aneurysm,

574
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,140
we would have to stop the test.

575
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,420
Of course.

576
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,620
However, it still depends
on Prof. Wen's consideration

577
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,260
and the decision
of the competent department

578
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,420
responsible for clinical trials.

579
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,260
Oh my.

580
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,420
We just broke up,

581
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,020
and now you are always together.

582
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,340
What a lovely couple.

583
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,260
Are you so anxious?

584
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,740
Wen Ran,

585
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,740
mind your words.

586
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,900
We broke up in peace.

587
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,660
Don't insult me here.

588
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,140
Su Wei'an,

589
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,060
I broke up with Yuncheng because of you.

590
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,620
Are you satisfied now?

591
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,060
You stole my signature at school,

592
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,540
and now you are stealing my boyfriend.

593
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,300
Why are you always stealing from others?

594
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,900
Wen Ran,

595
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,740
I'll give these words back to you.

596
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,620
I don't want to fight with you.

597
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,620
If you spread rumors

598
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,060
or intervene in my personal life again,

599
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,140
I'll teach you a lesson.

600
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,900
Wei'an, come back.

601
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,660
Wen Ran,

602
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,820
it's enough.

603
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,500
According to the examination,
Dr. Lu has advanced gastric cancer.

604
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,580
Director Wang wants you to see him
representing our department.

605
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,260
He'll see him when he's back
from the meeting of the Health Commission.

606
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,220
Gu Yunzheng,

607
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,940
it's you again.

608
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,140
Don't you have to work?

609
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,100
Gu Yunzheng,

610
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,540

611
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,780
or leaving early these days.

612
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,740
You are avoiding me.

613
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,380
You can't take it now?

614
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,420
You'll be fascinated by me later.

615
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,020
And I'm so sad.

616
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,820
You weren't so cold that night.

617
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,820
Wei'an.

618
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,580
Dr. Gu.

619
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,180
Dr. Gu.

620
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,060
Dr. Li,

621
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,740
it's work time.

622
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,620
Please go back to your seat.

623
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,060
Do not affect my work.

624
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,900
I'm here for work.

625
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,940
I'm here to discuss the feasibility

626
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,260
of interdisciplinary cooperation
with you.

627
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,820
Dr. Li.

628
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,980
You're right.

629
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,020
Clinically,
interdisciplinary cooperation

630
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,380
is indeed practical and urgent.

631
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,340
Dr. Gu,

632
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,100

633
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,620

634
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,180
I've been sending you
invitations for days.

635
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,860
Email is faster.

636
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,340
There are so many people here.

637
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,500
Aunt Yuan, it's all right.

638
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,220
Aunt Yuan, let me carry you.

639
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,180
Let's go through the stairs.

640
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,140
It's faster.

641
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,460
Is that okay?

642
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,220
No problem.

643
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,100
Alright.

644
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,220
Thanks, Yuncheng.

645
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,220
You're welcome.

646
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,500
Come.

647
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,860
Slowly.

648
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,940

649
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,340
Alright.

650
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,540
Be careful.

651
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,500
Okay.

652
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,140
Give me the wheelchair.

653
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,700
You push the wheelchair.

654
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,500
Put on this for her.

655
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,740
Let's go.

656
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,180
Aunt Yuan, how do you feel

657
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,060
using our HDQ39?

658
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,540
The effect of this medicine
is quite obvious.

659
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,780
I have fewer cases
of uncontrolled limbs.

660
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,860
I read your discharge report.

661
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,580
Your doctor requested

662
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,780
that you have to stop the drug.

663
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,660
Stop the drug?

664
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,740
Why?

665
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,620
I feel a little better. Why stop it?

666
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,180
Aunt Yuan, don't worry.

667
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,140
Gu Yunzheng is worried
that your aneurysm

668
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,620
may be related to the drug test.

669
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,060
So he suggested this.

670
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,820
I'll consult Prof. Wen for more.

671
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,220
Do others have an aneurysm?

672
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,620
No, it's just you.

673
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,180
Then it's not related to this drug.

674
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,620
I can't stop the drug.

675
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,940
I can't.

676
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,660
It's okay, Aunt Yuan.

677
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,660
I can't stop the medicine.

Thanks.

681
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,380
Come.

682
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,260
Slowly.

683
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,980
Where's Wei'an?

684
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,900
I will pick her up.

685
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,220
- Where is she?
- Lan.

686
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,580
It's all my fault.

I told you to wait for me in place.

691
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,100
It's not that bad.

692
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,820
I don't want to make Aunt Yuan sad.

693
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,260
Yuncheng,

694
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,340
put me down. I'm really fine.

695

Don't move.

700
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,260
Let me down.

701
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,380
What happened, boss?

702
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,020
This is an injury ointment.

703
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,500
You may feel cold at first,

704
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,300
but you are going
to feel comfortable soon.

705
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,260
I'm fine, Yuncheng.
It's just a small injury.

I'm fine.

707
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,940
Wei'an, I'm sorry.

708
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,020
I'm fine, Aunt Yuan. It doesn't hurt.

709
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,820
Yuan, it's okay.

710
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,420
Wei'an is not delicate.

711

when she was a kid, and she's fine.

753
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,300
let's have dinner together.

754
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,740
I won't have dinner with you.

755
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,620
Dinners after work are unnecessary.

756
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,500
You will.

757
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,420
Hello, director,

758
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,100
I'm in contact with Dr. Gu.

759
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,260
I'm with him right now.

760
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,900
Okay, you tell him.

761
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,940
Hello, Director Wang,

762
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,740
it's me.

763
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,860
Interdisciplinary cooperation
pilot unit.

764
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:09,980
Okay.

765
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,860
Got it.

766
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,500
Director Wang Huanzhong

767
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,100
wants me to treat you to dinner
on behalf of the department.

768
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,380
Okay. I'm happy to go.

769
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,100
Enjoy.

770
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,940
This is mushrooms with beef?

771
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,100
This small dish costs too much.

772
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,220
M9 Australian wagyu beef

773
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,340
with this season's white truffles.

774
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,700
You have to savor it

775
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,420
to live up to the craftsmanship
of an old master.

776
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,980
How much would this meal cost me?

777
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,500
Never mind.

778
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,420
My treat today.

779
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,180
Order anything you like.

780
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,980
Let's break relations after this meal.

781
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,900
No.

782
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,300
I'm waiting for you

783
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,940
to be my best assistant in Jiehui.

784
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,700
Hello, this is your dish.

785
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,420
Enjoy.

786
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,100
Thanks.

787
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,900
Are we eating food?

788
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,780
We are eating money.

789
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,500
Well,

790
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,780
they have a special dessert.

791
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,100
This season's must-order.

792
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,980
More?

793
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,620
I can watch you eat.

794
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,620
You'll regret it.

795
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,140
This is special in this season.

796
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,500
A white truffle ice cream, please.

797
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,660
I want a white truffle ice cream.

798
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,500
Sorry,

799
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,660
our white truffle ice cream

800
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,740
has a high demand
for the freshness of ingredients.

801
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,940
It's limited.

802
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,620
We can only make one now.

803
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,340
You can discuss
who can cancel the order.

804
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,540
How much for one?

805
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,340
Six hundred yuan for one.

806
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,620
Let them have it.

807
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,860
It sold out.

808
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,140
Miss,

809
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,740
today's limited

810
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,660
white truffle ice cream
has only one left.

811
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,140
The two guests at the bar
gave this out to you.

812
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,140
Really? We have to thank them.

813
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,540
Give them two caramel puddings.
My treat.

814
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,500
Okay.

815
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,620
Miss Su,

816
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,700
you also like
their limited white truffle ice cream?

817
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,700
What a coincidence!

818
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,220
Shall we have a meal together?

819
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,700
Yuncheng, are you full?

820
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,220
Yes.

821
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,620
Can we have the bill, please?

822
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,460
I've settled the bill
from Mr. Du's membership card.

823
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,060
They are leaving.

824
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,340
Aren't you coming to say hi?

825
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,020
What a coincidence!

826
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,540
Dr. Li and I...

827
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,300
Let's go.

828
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,770
We are talking about work.

829
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,180
So they are together.

830
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,460
I thought they had something

831
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,140
that day at the bar.

832
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,740
They aren't.

833
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,460
Dr. Li, are you done eating?

834
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,780
I'll pay the bill.
