is Gu Yunzheng sure

186
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,580
that the aneurysm rupture

187
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,380
is related to the drug test?

188
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,460
He's not certain yet.

189
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,780
He just reported my aunt's case

190
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,740
to the subject facilitator

191
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,460
according to normal procedures.

192
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,780
As for the next step,

193
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,420
to confirm whether the aneurysm

194
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,220
has anything to do with HDQ39

195
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,220
will be in the hands of Prof. Wen.

196
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,620
Who would've thought.

197
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,100
The research took so long

198
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,140
but didn't pan out.

199
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,940
Actually, I want to meet Prof. Wen

200
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,140
to confirm the grouping

201
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,060
because I hope

202
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,340
that my aunt's aneurysm
is just a special case.

203
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,580
If he can confirm

204
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,260
that what my aunt took were placebos,

205
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
that would be great.

206
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
This means HDQ39 is okay.

207
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,300
If HDQ39 really is flawed,

208
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,300
I'd rather end it myself.

209
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,500

210
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,260

212
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820

213
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,420

Besides,

216
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,140

217
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,100
will come into the market.

218
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,540
Then you should give the files
to Prof. Wen as soon as possible,

219
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,740
so he can report to the Ethics Committee

220
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,180
and let the latter

221
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,940
review the safety of this drug,

222
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,940
which is the fairest.

223
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,820
Mm.

226

will grant me leave next week.

So the wonder drug will be available
to them sooner.

So we can save one more patient earlier.

560
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,660
I'm not sure if they're caused by HDQ39.
