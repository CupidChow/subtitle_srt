I'm throwing meat at a dog.

192
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,080
It never comes back.

193
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,360
Who's a dog?

194
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,640
You.

195
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,080
My holy god.

196
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,440
My plan's all over.

197
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,320
I made a match between you two because
I wanted you to go back together,

198
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,840
not stay in Lacaya.

199
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,400
Aren't you trapped

200
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,560
by someone in Lacaya too?

201
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,680
How could you laugh at me?

202
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,560
Wei'an,

203
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,960
[Gu Yunzheng]
I'm happy for you.

204
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,560
You are finally in love.

205
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,640
And Dr. Gu is such a good person.

206
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,600
He loves you,

207
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,880
and he can take care of you.

208
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,960
I can rest assured.

209
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,040
Tell me

210
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,160
what did you do the night in the desert.

211
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,240
You are curious?

212
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
I won't tell you.

213
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,120
Su Wei'an,

214
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,200
how could you do this to me?

215
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,280
You are heartless.

216
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,920
I told you every

217
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,560
love experiences of mine.

218
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,960
How could you keep it from me?

219
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm not keeping it from you.

220
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,680
We are not in a real relationship yet.

221
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,320
That stupid Gu yunzheng

222
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,600
hasn't confessed to you?

223
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,640
No.

224
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,760
He,

225
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,480
he confessed.

226
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,840
But I'm not so sure about this.

227
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,440
Isn't he the man of your dreams?

228
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,240
You won't find one this good

229
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,160
if you miss out on him.

230
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,040
What are you hesitating for?

231
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,040
What's wrong with you?

232
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,800
You've got the man of your dreams.

233
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,320
Don't act mysterious here.

234
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,160
It's okay.

235
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,320
You don't have to worry about me.

236
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,040
Laugh as you want.

237
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,400
I know you wanna laugh.

238
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,600
He told me

239
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,120
he wanted to be with me forever,

240
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,040
but I'm not so sure

241
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,680
if I can fulfill this promise.

242
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,520
Su Wei'an,

243
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
are you showing off to me?

244
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,240
I don't know you.

245
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,720
Gu Yunzheng said

246
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,240
he wanted to be with you forever.

247
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,640
You should be happy about this.

248
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,840
If I were you,

249
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,040
I'd marry him right now.

250
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,520
Who's that?

251
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,320
Lan.

252
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,240
Lan?

253
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,920
Hello, Lan,

254
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,080
you are awake?

255
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,320
Wei'an,

256
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,240
your aunt's sick.

257
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,920
She went to the hospital,

258
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
and the doctor said she had the

259
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,720
Chorea.

260
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,000
The doctor also said

261
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,840
this disease is hereditary.

262
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,560
I didn't understand.

263
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,720
And he said somewhat
it broke out ahead of time.

264
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,440
This disease is inherited in the
second generation of the paternal line.

265
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,240
It may break out around 30.

266
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,920
[Disease name: Huntington Chorea]
It could be worse.

267
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
Break out around 30?

268
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,200
Highly probably.

269
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,760
Hello,

270
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,640
Wei'an,

271
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,080
can you hear me?

272
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,320
Do you have time?

273
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,440
Can you come back?

274
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,600
Do you plan to stay in Lacaya forever?

275
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,520
I'm begging you to clear your mind.

276
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,880
What about your research?

277
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,640
You want to give up on

278
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,360
your hard work for years?

279
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,360
You don't care about
the future of Huaren?

280
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Why did you want to
study medicine in the first place?

281
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,680
I study medicine to treat
and save people,

282
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,080
not to write papers for promotion.

283
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,080
I can treat and save people
in Lacaya too.

284
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,040
I've made up my mind to stay in Lacaya.

285
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,240
You can't stop me.

286
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,320
You are back.

287
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,520
Wei'an, what are you doing?

288
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Where are you going now?

289
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,120
Going back to China.

290
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,160
Back to China? Wait.

291
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,040
Why?

292
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,960
Didn't you just be with Gu Yunzheng?

293
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,280
I've been thinking about it.

294
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm not suitable for dating.

295
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,480
I should make more money.

296
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,280
Su Wei'an,

297
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,680
are you deceiving me again?

298
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,680
I'm breaking up with you.

299
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,840
Wei'an,

300
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,240
did anything happen just now?

301
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,920
Is it Lan?

302
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,880
No.

303
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,080
Su Wei'an,

304
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,400
How could you lie to me?

305
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,880
You promised not to deceive me again.

306
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,920
What are you doing?

307
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,280
Jiang,

308
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,360
my aunt has a rare disease.

309
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,000
I have to come back now.

310
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,880
I didn't mean to deceive you.

311
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,480
I don't want anyone to worry about me.

312
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,360
Is it

313
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,800
Huntington Chorea?

314
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,040
How did you know that?

315
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,680
The day you were stabbed,

316
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,760
Dr. Gu searched your bag
in the hospital

317
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,480
and gave you a full body checkup.

318
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
He did this because

319
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,680
he suspected you had severe diseases.

320
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,080
I couldn't rest assured,

321
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,160
so I also checked your bag too.

322
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,040
I found the genetic test report

323
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,840
hidden in your notebook.

324
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,400
Relax. Gu Yunzheng didn't see it.

325
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,040
Wei'an,

326
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,840
that's why you dropped out,

327
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,360
earned money with your life,

328
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,840
did research on euthanasia,

329
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,440
and rejected Gu Yunzheng.

330
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,320
It's all because of

331
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,320
Chorea.

332
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,240
Please keep the secret for me.

333
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
Don't tell anyone,

334
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,440
especially Gu Yunzheng.

335
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,440
Please.

336
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,320
Wei'an,

337
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,280
I don't believe this.

338
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,200
Is it possible that they made a mistake

339
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,520
on the genetic test report?

340
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,240
I hope so.

341
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,440
I thought if I was braver,

342
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,560
god could cut me some slack.

343
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,800
Let me fall in love without any regrets

344
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,240
and go further with Gu Yunzheng.

345
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,120
But now my aunt's sick.

346
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,440
If the disease breaks out on me,

347
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,520
I could be worse.

348
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,120
I can't give Gu Yunzheng

349
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,720
the future he asks for.

350
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,600
Wei'an,

351
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,320
stop.

352
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,840
It's so unfair.

353
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,320
Why does it have to be you?

354
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,120
Relax.

355
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm fine.

356
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,200
Wei'an.

357
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,960
Jiang,

358
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
I'm lucky enough

359
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,240
to meet Gu Yunzheng.

360
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,440
Please don't let him know.

361
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,040
He hates irresponsible deserters.

362
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,040
Let him hate me as a deserter.

363
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,720
So he could forget me.

364
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,000
(Beautiful.)

365
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,960
(You like blue jacaranda too?)

366
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,960
I mean

367
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,640
you are beautiful.

368
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,840
Take my motorcycle.

369
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,240
I assure you I can take you anywhere

370
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
in the city within 50 minutes.

371
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,900
♪You can feel my♪

372
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,220
♪Missing for you clearly♪

373
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,880
Right,

374
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,040
I found your motorcycle.

375
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,520
I searched the whole Lacaya.

376
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,840
It was in a total mess

377
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,160
when I found it.

378
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,960
