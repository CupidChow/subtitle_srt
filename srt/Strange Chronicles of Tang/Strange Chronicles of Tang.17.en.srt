[Episode 17]

3
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,110
Come on, my beauty.

4
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,430
Hurry and come in.

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,230
Beauty.

6
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,920
Don't rush.

7
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,880
I'm in a rush.

8
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,430
I'm really in a rush.

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,900
You haven't told me

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,730
what you do for a living.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,870
Does it matter?

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,600
Of course it matters.

13
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,729
I don't want to be some kept woman.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,920
I want to marry you.

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,240
But I'm afraid

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,400
if I tell you what I do,

17
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,130
it might frighten you.

18
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,870
You're not an official, are you?

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,670
I just saw

20
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,070
someone bringing you a gift.

21
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,390
That's right.

22
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,479
A gift indeed.

23
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,920
Let's see what it is.

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,590
Gulou Pastry?

25
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,610
It's the most fashionable delicacy

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,280
in Chang'an these days.

27
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,150
Here.

28
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,030
Lamb?

29
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,750
I've never been able to eat lamb
since I was little.

30
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,480
Then you're missing out.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,730
Tastes good.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,240
So good.

33
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,480
Don't be shy.

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,840
Eat more.

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,940
Later on,

36
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,710
you'll have the strength

37
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,210
you need in bed.

38
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,200
Pervert.

39
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,910
Wait!

40
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,240
You still won't

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,560
tell me what you do.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,400
Everything's so unclear,

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,880
I...

44
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,300
Actually,

45
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,079
it's for your own good.

46
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,480
Who's there?

47
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,680
What's going on?

48
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,400
Honey!

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,450
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,820
You dare seduce my wife?

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,360
This isn't over between us.

52
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,830
Who are you?

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,080
How dare you
break into my private residence?

54
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,250
You're not young,

55
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,950
yet you're quite strong.

56
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,750
Pretending to be a general?

57
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,120
Who are you trying to scare?

58
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,650
As if a general
would be interested in my wife.

[Zhu Ling,
Grand General of the Left Imperial Guard]

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
You picked the wrong man to scam.

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,540
Do you really have no idea who I am?

62
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,030
I don't care who you are!

63
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,650
Let's go!

64
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,710
Come with me to see the official!

65
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,310
Well,

66
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,240
it's fine if you don't want to.

67
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,520
You need to give me 500 coins.

68
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,750
What?

69
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,310

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,840
No.

71

600 coins.

72
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,540
Move!

73
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,410
Look at your pathetic demands.

74
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,400
10,000 coins.

75
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,190
10,000 coins, huh?

76
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,150
Fine.

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,840
Today,

78
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,579
I'll cut you 10,000 times!

79
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,010
Old fool.

80
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,710
Stop pretending to be tough!

81
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,830
You hit him too hard!

82
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,030
If he dies,

83
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,600
who will we get the money from?

84
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,110
I didn't hit him hard.

85
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,920
What's...

86
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,280
Who are you looking for?

87
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,590
Is this

88
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,890
Grand General Zhu's private residence?

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,159
Who are you?

90
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,390
I'm your master's old friend from Wuzhong.

91
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,390
My name is Lu Tong.

92
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,630
Lu Tong?

93
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
Sounds familiar.

94
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,040
How did you find this place?

95
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,870
Grand General Zhu

96
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,630
was not at
the Left Imperial Guard's office

97
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,720
or the main camp,

98
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,450
or at his own residence.

99
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,280
So

100
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,580
I just asked around.

101
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,680
Luckily, the clerk at the office said

102
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,190
that the Grand General recently

103
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,560
purchased a villa.

104
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,180
Such a blabbermouth.

105
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,500
Hurry up and report it.

106
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,350
Look,

107
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,070
this is water shield from Wuzhong.

108
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,130
And I specifically bought 3 perches.

109
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,560
We can make water shield soup

110
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,480
and sliced perch,

111
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,830
and your Grand General and I

112
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,270
can reminisce about our hometown
in Wuzhong

113
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,720
through these hometown dishes.

114
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,630
But the Grand General
is handling official business.

115
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,630
It's not convenient for receiving guests.

116
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,160
Zhu Ling is in high spirits.

117
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,490
Handling official business in his villa?

118
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,970
You cannot go in!

119
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,720

You really can't!

122
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,920
Outrageous!

I am the Grand General
of the Right Imperial Guard!

124
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,560
Everyone knows the Left
and Right Imperial Guards don't get along.

125
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,240
Today I brought some fish specifically

If you keep blocking me,

129
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,310
I'll slap you so hard

130

He's not here?

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,480
He is.

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,600
He is here.

137
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,920
He's not keeping a kept woman here, is he?

138
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,800
Not exactly.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,070
Lately there have been some kept women

140

using their looks to seduce men

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,310
and actually extort money.

142

145

to stay away from such things.

146

What a coincidence.

3 elderly men over 60

Last night,

I had Jia tailing him.

173
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,620
Perhaps Jia was careless,

174
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,530
or the suspect was too cunning.

175

193
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,000
Zhu Ling, the Grand General
of the Left Imperial Guard

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,240
was murdered in his private residence,

195
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,870
and the murderer is believed to be

196
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,830
Lu Tong, the Grand General

197
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,120
of the Right Imperial Guard.

198
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,760
What?

199
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,680
Both the Left and Right Imperial Guards

200
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,830
have received the news.

201
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,600
A bloody clash

202
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,730
may be unavoidable.

203
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,110
Lu Lingfeng!

204
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,900
You must not act rashly!

205
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Everyone, calm down!

206
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,270
Don't act impulsively!

207
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,600
Don't act impulsively!

208
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,910
Put down your weapons!

209
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,740
Right Imperial Guard,

210
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,090
step back 10 paces!

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,680
General,

212
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,080
the Grand General is still inside.

213
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,510
We brothers of the Right Imperial Guard

214
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,240
swear to protect the Grand General
with our lives!

215
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,170
We swear to protect the Grand General
with our lives!

216
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,300
I understand how you feel!

217
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,200
But in Chang'an territory,

218
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,660
under His Majesty's rule,

219
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,480
the Left and Right Imperial Guards
drawing blades against each other

220
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,550
is certainly not something
the Grand General

221
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,550
would want to see!

222
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,200
Step back!

223
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,790
Brothers of the Left Imperial Guard,

224
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,520
please also step back 10 paces.

225
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,200
Why should we listen to you?

226
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,480
Grand General Zhu was murdered.

227
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,580
We'll kill Lu Tong

228
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,840
and avenge him!

229
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,720
I, Lu Lingfeng, Yongzhou Judicial Office,

230
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,520
will never shield the murderer.

231
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,160
However,

232
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,430
before the case is fully solved,

233
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,630
you must not act on mere speculation,

234
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,960
nor allow yourselves to be used by others!

235
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,080
Please,

236
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,150
step back.

237
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,840
Step back.

238
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,200
Sir,

239
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,910
the autopsy is complete.

240
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,770
The findings have been recorded.

241
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,270
The food container

242
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,000
and suspicious items,

243
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,240
including the unfinished Gulou Pastry,

244
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,600
have all been collected.

245
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,390
Understood.

246
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,430
All of you may leave now.

247
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,320
Yes.

248
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,790
Yes.

249
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,870
[Wei Yan, Chang'an County Sheriff]

250
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,200
We have known each other

251
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,440
for over 40 years.

252
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,060
I never thought that today I, Wei Yan,

253
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,210
would have to bid you farewell

254
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,360
in this way.

255
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,360
Mr. Zhu Ling,

256
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,270
may you

257
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,870
rest in peace.

258
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,550
Take Zhu Ling's body

259
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,470
back to the county office first.

260
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes.

261
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:33,960
Guards!

262
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,010
Grand General!

263
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,840
Grand General!

264
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Are you all right?

265
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,910
Can I leave now?

266
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,390
Grand General Lu,

267
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,760
you and the Zhu family servant

268
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,600
were the first to discover the body.

269
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,130
Therefore, please do me the honor

270
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,710
of going back
to the Chang'an County Office with me.

271
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,850
What did you say?

272
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,800
Didn't I make myself clear?

273
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:10,960
Wei Yan.

274
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,470
No wonder you're over 60

275
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,550
but still just a county sheriff.

276
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,440
What's wrong with being a county sheriff?

277
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,550
Investigating crimes

278
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,200
is the duty given to me by the court.

279
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,720
But I've already explained!

280
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,670
I was merely visiting a fellow townsman.

281
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,960
The servant can testify!

282
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,670
The servant?

283
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,270
The servant went to buy food,

284
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,480
and when he returned,
you were already at the gate.

285
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,710
Who can testify

286
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,430
for what happened before that?

287
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,500
Who knows

288
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,520
if you didn't go out from here,

289
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,000
see the servant returning,

290
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,480
and then pretend to knock on the door?

291
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:38,910
You...

292
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,100
Don't act so arrogant before me.

293
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,200
When I was a third-rank official,

294
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,010
you, Lu Tong,

295
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,600
were just a minor captain

296
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,950
in the Imperial Guard.

297
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,120
Sheriff Wei,

298
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,550
many soldiers from both

299
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,870
the Left and Right Imperial Guards
are gathering outside.

300
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,030
Taking the Grand General

301
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,600
to the office for questioning right now

302
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,130
is clearly inappropriate.

303
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,750
Official Lu,

304
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,600
this is Chang'an County.

305
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,630
As Chang'an County Sheriff,

306
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,790
I don't need anyone telling me

307
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,250
how to investigate a case.

308
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,000
Today I must take Lu Tong

309
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,440
to the Chang'an County Office
for questioning.

310
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,170
That is according to protocol.

311
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,270
No matter if there are
thousands of troops outside

312
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,870
or people there to plead on his behalf,

313
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,870
I must proceed.

314
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,790
Even if His Majesty himself were here,

315
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,210
it would be the same.

316
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm Su Wuming. Greetings, Sheriff Wei.

317
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,520
This is west of Zhuque Avenue,

318
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,870
not within Wannian County's jurisdiction.

319
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,000
What are you doing here?

320
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,910
Are you here to investigate a case?

321
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,510
I wouldn't dare.

322
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,550
Then does that mean

323
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,750
you're here to plead for Lu Tong as well?

324
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,480
Don't bother.

325
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,200
Greetings, Grand General.

326
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,080
What's happening here?

327
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,170
Sheriff Su.

328
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,100
Captain Feng.

329
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,890
May I take a look at the body?

330
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
Please be quick then.

331
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,700
What?

332
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,120
Are you angry?

333
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,410
Lu Tong must be even angrier than you.

334
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,550
The Grand General was truly furious.

335
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,350
You know what?

336
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,910
He took the initiative to see Zhu Ling

337
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,440
on His Majesty's instruction.

338
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,080
It was meant to ease tensions

339
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,550
between
the Left and Right Imperial Guards.

340
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,720
The Grand General did make concessions.

341
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,200
Yet now he's suspected of murder

342
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,730
and even taken to the office
for questioning.

343
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,090
If word gets out,

344
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,670
wouldn't the Imperial Guard's reputation

345
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,140
be ruined overnight?

346
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,480
I've thought of all that.

347
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,210
But Wei Yan is highly seasoned.

348
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,630
Back in Emperor Gaozong's reign,

349
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,040
he was already serving
at Crown Prince Hong's side.

350
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,240
Later,

351
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,960
he rose all the way to Censor-in-Chief.

352
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,120
He was demoted to Fengtian County Sheriff

353
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,440
after the suppression
of Deposed Queen Wei's rebellion

354
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,320
only because he backed the wrong side.

355
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,870
He was just recently appointed
as Chang'an County Sheriff.

356
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,530
Therefore,

357
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,840
he won't give

358
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,370
the Grand General any face,

359
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,260
let alone you.

360
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,270
Didn't you say

361
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,600
that there was already a suspect

362
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,360
in the 3 murders of elderly men earlier?

363
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,020
When will you make the arrest?

364
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,870
I intended
to wait until we had solid evidence

365
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,730
before moving.

366
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,480
But now it seems

367
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,510
we'll have to act earlier than planned.
