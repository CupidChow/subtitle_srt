[Episode 11]

3
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,390
Home, sweet home.

4
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,560
This chicken soup Xijun made

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,590
really has the taste

6
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,100
of Nanzhou Prefecture's family tradition.

7
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,560
I'm full.

8
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,430
I'm full.

9
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,010
Xijun,

10
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,370
you should eat too.

11
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,350
I won't have any appetite

12
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,590
unless I see you getting better.

13
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,590
With you taking such good care of me,

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,780
it'd be strange if I don't get better.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,870
It was your miraculous medicine

16
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,950
that helped you recover so quickly.

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,789
Fei.

18
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,950
How about a drink?

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,789
I'll...

20
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,070
hold off on drinking for now.

21
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,759
When my wound heals,

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,140
I'll drink to my heart's content.

23
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,850
So you've learned to value your life.

24
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,930
Those two assassins were truly vicious.

25
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,039
Fei,

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,000
why were they targeting you?

27
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,160
Wasn't it because of you?

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,000
They're disciples of Silent Ember,

29
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,120
named...

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,710
Wu Zhu and Chi Zhen—

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,190
two bird names.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,960
If they wanted revenge,

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,020
why didn't they come for me directly?

34
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,570
You don't understand.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,740
Silent Ember is known for his cunning.

36
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,120
The first rule he teaches his disciples is

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,420
if you can't win, run.

38
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,790
With your reputation

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,900
in martial skills,

40
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,750
you think they'd dare to come after you?

41
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,910
That's strange.

42
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,250
Then why did they suddenly

43
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,400
fight me so desperately

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,520
when I went to save you?

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,360
And they were saying something like,

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,310
"the ritual has begun,"

47
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,270
"so it can't be stopped."

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,190
Fei,

49
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,090
what ritual were they talking about?

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,590
The wind was strong in the forest.

51
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,390
Who knows what they were saying?

52
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,250
You must have misheard.

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,960
In the Ascension Forest,

54
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,570
I also encountered these two assassins.

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,360
I stumbled upon them,

56
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,800
but Fei was taken captive.

57
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,750
That's not right.

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,490
If they wanted revenge for Silent Ember,

59
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,800
Lu Lingfeng
should've been their first target,

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,840
and I should've been the second.

61
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,680
How could they...

62
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,710
Why is my chest hurting again?

63
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,320
I heard Yingtao say

64
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,800
they went somewhere yesterday

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,280
that was very interesting.

66
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,120
Everyone can pour out their troubles there

67
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,320
and find some relief.

68
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,810
Whatever troubles are in your heart,

69
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,470
once spoken, they will pass.

70
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,710
Since we're free tonight,

71
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,870
why don't we

72
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,870
try that game too?

73
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,400
That sounds good.

74
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,590
I didn't get a chance
to pour out my troubles yesterday.

75
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,710
My heart has been heavy all this time.

76
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:47,940
How about this?

77
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,870
The four of us

78
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,430
take turns.

79
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,040
I'll go first.

80
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,030
I'm from the Su family
of Wugong in Guanxi,

81
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,430
a collateral branch.

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,530
My family had no vast fortune,

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,040
only a few thatched huts.

84
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
When I was 8,

85
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,870
my father died in an accident

86
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,480
at the government office.

87
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,360
The cause was never determined.

88
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,500
My mother made and sold shoes,

89
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,680
enduring every hardship

90
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,920
to raise me.

91
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,610
I studied for 10 long years

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
and eventually
passed the imperial examination.

93
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,600
On the night the results were posted,

94
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,400
I looked up at the sky

95
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,810
and asked myself

96
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,800
where my ambitions lay.

97
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,360
With the stars as my witness,

98
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,240
my ambition was never high office,

99
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,680
but criminal investigation.

100
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,720
So I apprenticed myself to a great master

101
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,820
and learned the art of detection.

102
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,870
However,

103
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,430
for various reasons,

104
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,510
I have been drifting in official circles,

105
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,920
rising one moment and falling the next,

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,310
for more than ten years now.

107
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,270
People often say

108
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,430
I'm shrewd,

109
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,190
but who knows the resentment in my heart?

110
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,480
After investigating cases
for over a decade,

111
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,600
my own father's death

112
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,160
remains unsolved.

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,190
How painful.

114
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,290
Yingtao is both strong and gentle.

115
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,070
I hope to share my life with her.

116
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,950
Yet,

117
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,630
I'm caught in a vortex,

118
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
surrounded by turbulent currents,

119
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,240
living on the edge of danger every day,

120
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,630
with death always near.

121
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,510
How could I...

122
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,240
I can't bring myself to push her away,

123
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,120
yet keeping her close risks
dragging her down with me.

124
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,720
Trapped between letting go and holding on,

125
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,159
my heart is full of worry.

126
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,230
As for the Tang Empire,

127
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,560
which weighs most on my heart,

128
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,240
I can never let it go.

129
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,160
I...

130
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,750
Have I said too much?

131
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,560
Xijun,

132
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,050
it's... it's your turn.

133
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,890
Don't look at me,

134
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,890
or I'll feel embarrassed.

135
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,330
Lu Lingfeng,

136
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,360
especially you.

137
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,630
Look away.

138
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,520
I was born into a noble family
and raised in official circles.

139
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,200
That's nothing special.

140
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,720
In Chang'an,

141
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,830
women of my background

142
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,070
are countless.

143
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,080
People say women leave no mark in history.

144
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,990
Those recorded are only empresses

145
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,000
or princesses.

146
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,870
Though unworthy,

147
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,960
I decided to defy fate,

148
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,510
so I trained in painting from a young age

149
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,880
and finally mastered it,

150
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,360
able to capture all things in the world.

151
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,480
I want to leave traces of my life

152
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,000
through painting.

153
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,070
Painting is my passion,

154
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,940
and through it

155
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,070
I met the one I love.

156
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,830
I originally intended
to speak of my sorrows,

157
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,560
but after thinking it through,

158
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
I realized I have no sorrows to tell.

159
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,400
Or rather,

160
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,720
compared to your troubles,

161
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,120
my small troubles

162
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,680
hardly matter.

163
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,930
So I'll just share a thought with you.

164
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,930
Life passes

165
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,560
like a fleeting shadow.

166
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,890
There's no need

167
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,120
to keep pain and sorrows bottled up.

168
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,110
Instead, with true friends,

169
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,880
you can open your heart
and speak your mind.

170
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,240
I believe

171
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,630
that if you do this,

172
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,090
good fortune will follow.

173
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,950
No matter how harsh the past,

174
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,600
the road ahead will be smooth.

175
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,909
My turn.

176
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,510
I'll tell a story

177
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,550
about a princess, an assassin,

178
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,400
and a child.

179
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,070
[Great Virtue Can Carry the World]

180
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,600
Later,

181
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,170
the child came to the capital.

182
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,480
The former Empress was gone.

183
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,150
Of those who killed his father,

184
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,750
only the princess remained.

185
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,770
And she

186
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,130
was also the very woman who gave him life,

187
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,120
his mother by blood.

188
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,510
Fei,

189
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,270
it's your turn.

190
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,360
Master Fei,

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,840
though you're optimistic and cheerful,

192
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,370
you must have something
you want to share too.

193
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,240
Fei,

194
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,850
you haven't fallen asleep, have you?

195
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,780
What's there to share?

196
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,810
If you want to interrogate me, then do it.

197
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,940
I've got nothing to say.

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,530
If you're going to torture me,
make it brutal.

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,980
Send me straight to my mentor.

200
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,750
If you still see me

201
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,270
as a friend,

202
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,690
please do me a favor

203
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,300
and bury my remains

204
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,280
outside the Medicine King Hall.

205
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,720
Master Fei.

206
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,750
Shut up!

207
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,360
You little girl.

208
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,630
You're in on this with them,

209
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,900
plotting against me.

210
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,360
I know,

211
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,510
I

212
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,160
have been in Chang'an for decades

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,330
and still don't even have
a house of my own.

214
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,610
I can only lodge at your Pei's Mansion.

215
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,720
What?

216
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,440
Are you kicking me out?

217
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,710
Fine, I'll leave.

218
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,050
Fei!

219
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,750
Fei!

220
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,790
If you don't want to talk,
no one's forcing you,

221
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,030
and no one's kicking you out.

222
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,830
That's right.

223
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,120
You're not young anymore,

224
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,690
and you're badly injured,

225
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,930
so why keep

226
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,630
losing your temper?

227
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,560
Look how you've frightened Xijun.

228
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,620
We were wrong.

229
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,800
Just rest well.

230
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,690
If there are things

231
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,550
you don't want to talk about, then don't.

232
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,530
If you don't want

233
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,880
to bring up the past,

234
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,270
then we won't mention it again.

235
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:14,800
Alright?

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,720
Come on.

237
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,400
Though he didn't say anything,

238
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,870
it was as good as an admission.

239
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,670
[Great Virtue Can Carry the World]

240
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,720
Fei heals the sick,

241
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,120
benefiting the people.

242
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,880
We've all seen it
with our own eyes over the years.

243
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,810
As for his past,

244
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,120
let it remain a mystery.

245
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,560
He's been mysterious

246
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,320
from the start.

247
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I'm not trying to dig up old matters.

248
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,910
It's just that lately,

249
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,030
the Crimson Pact assassins
have been appearing frequently.

250
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,850
I'm worried

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,550
something big might happen in Chang'an.

252
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,400
That's why I wanted to get

253
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,970
some information from him.

254
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,720
The three female assassins

255
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,030
who imprisoned Xie You

256
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,760
were probably minions.

257
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,060
They have long lost contact

258
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,380
with the Crimson Pact.

259
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,290
Their exposure this time
must be coincidental.

260
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,390
[Great Virtue Can Carry the World]

261
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,910
As for Wu Zhu and Chi Zhen,

262
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,690
I actually find it interesting that they

263
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,780
keep showing up in Ascension Forest.

264
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,320
How so?

265
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,800
The other day, Fei said that

266
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,000
minions

267
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,320
are assassins in the Crimson Pact,

268
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,330
but not really assassins.

269
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,010
They can recruit their own subordinates,

270
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,740
but have only one direct handler.

271
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,880
If they lose contact

272
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,040
with their  handler,

273
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,920
they become expendable.

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,790
There are cases where a master

275
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,750
trains a disciple as a minion.

276
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,200
If Wu Zhu and Chi Zhen

277
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,390
are such minions,

278
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,200
then their master, Silent Ember,

279
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,670
must be their handler.

280
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,910
So...

281
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,390
Ascension Forest

282
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,120
is their meeting point?

283
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,670
That place is dark and frightening.

284
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,790
People are wary of it.

285
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,840
Isn't it perfect

286
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,400
for a meeting point?

287
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,150
When punishing so-called traitors,

288
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,080
they also chose Ascension Forest.

289
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,600
Therefore,

290
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,640
the Crimson Pact's headquarters
must be nearby.

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,750
Perhaps...

292
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,960
it's in Xiuzhen District.

293
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,630
Back then, when my master, Master Di,

294
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:35,750
was investigating the Crimson Pact,

295
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,790
[Great Virtue Can Carry the World]

296
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,790
he came all the way

297
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,990
from Divine Capital to Chang'an.

298
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,610
He also suspected
it was in Xiuzhen District,

299
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,510
but never found solid evidence.

300
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,790
What is it?

301
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,130
I'd like you
to visit Xiuzhen District again

302
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,600
and draw a map for me.

303
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,520
That's easy.

304
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
I'll go tomorrow.

305
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,270
[Chicken Master of Tang]

306
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,700
[Chicken Master of Tang]

307
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,630
[Relief-from-Woes]

308
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,930
If there's anyone special,

309
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
it would be her.

310
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,840
She came to us on her own.

311
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,170
And the gold coin she gave

312
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,230
was quite unusual.

313
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,390
Gold coin?

314
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,830
Where is it?

315
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,820
Put it away.

316
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,030
This gold coin

317
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,630
was specially made when His Majesty

318
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,080
was invested as Crown Prince.

319
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,440
I've received such a reward before,

320
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,300
so I remember that mark clearly.

321
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,960
Although I've never received

322
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,200
such a reward,

323
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,030
I can still tell

324
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,420
that gold coin is special.

325
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,980
This mere Relief-from-Woes Shop

326
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,150
actually has something to do
with His Majesty.

327
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,200
Truly unexpected.
