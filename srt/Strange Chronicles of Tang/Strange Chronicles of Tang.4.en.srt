[Yongzhou Prefecture]

4
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,300
Am I free now?

5
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,980
Am I finally free?

6
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,200
Thank you, Officers.

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,320
Thank you all.

8
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,170
I can't wait

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,960
to visit the East Market,

10
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,830
eat a bowl of Xiao's wontons,

11
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,310
and buy myself some decent clothes.

12
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,990
And then

13
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,630
have some fun in the Pingkang District.

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,870
I go to the Pingkang District

15
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,940
just to listen to the songstresses

16
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,940
playing the pipa.

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,490
It's been months

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,920
since I heard any music.

19
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,310
I really can't stand it anymore.

20
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:39,759
Did you really not write the blood letter?

21
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,560
No, I didn't.

22
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,610
Why don't you check again?

23
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,840
Biting my finger would hurt so much.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,440
I can't bring myself to do it.

25
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,910
Write down your name.

26
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,920
Why?

27
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,120
Cut the crap.

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,920
Is this a place for you

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
to ask questions?

30
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,750
I'll write it. I'll write it.

31
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,000
[Xie Xia]

32
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,040
Why did those 3 women

33
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,470
imprison you?

34
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,800
They are bad people.

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,990
Then how did you get

36
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,560
the nickname "Woe-Reliever"?

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,960
I...

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,280
Yeah,

39
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,950
it's my fault.

40
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,520
I seduced them first.

41
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,079
I admit that.

42
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
Later, I wanted to leave,

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,130
but I couldn't get away.

44
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,810
You brought this on yourself.

45
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,579
With such poor character,

46
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,430
you don't deserve
to become a jinshi scholar.

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,830
Go back to your hometown!

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,530
I could tell at first glance

49
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,020
that the blood letter
wasn't written by him.

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,100
But what I want to say

51
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,680
is whoever wrote that blood letter

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,710
must be a scholar.

53
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,430
Writing with blood

54
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,840
and still making such neat letters

55
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
isn't easy at all.

56
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,710
I understand.

57
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,480
Thank you for your work.

58
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,140
[Honesty and Diligence]

59
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,600
The 3 women are neighbors,

60
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,910
all widows.

61
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,400
Is this kind of situation

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,000
common in the Xiuzhen District?

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,660
Not common.

64
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,000
I believe this would be unusual

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,060
anywhere else too.

66
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,850
Have they always lived there?

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,690
Not exactly.

68
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,079
Cong has lived

69
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,110
in the Xiuzhen District since childhood.

70
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,370
She married a live-in man.

71
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,829
That man was quite honest.

72
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,960
Later on,

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,190
he caught an unknown illness

74
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,750
and died.

75
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,310
As for Manniang and Hua,

76
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,280
they moved here in the past few years.

77
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
Manniang came earlier,

78
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,030
and Hua

79
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,370
a few months later.

80
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,080
Was Cong's husband

81
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
still alive then?

82
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,340
I need to think about that carefully.

83
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,190
In the glorious capital,

84
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,860
you dared to imprison someone as a slave.

85
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,000
What punishment do you deserve?

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,290
Captain Xue.

87
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,159
They're not answering.

88
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,270
Apply torture!

89
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,270
Apply torture!

90
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,610
I am the mastermind.

91
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,950
The underground chamber is in my house.

92
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,870
The idea of imprisoning Xie You

93
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,680
was also mine.

94
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,750
These 2 had nothing to do with it.

95
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,150
Having Manniang and Hua

96
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,670
move in as your neighbors

97
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,460
was also your idea, wasn't it?

98
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,750
How did your husband die?

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Take her away.

100
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,360
Yes!

101
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,080
Manniang.

102
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,070
Your martial skills are impressive.

103
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,730
How many lives have you taken?

104
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,870
Take her away too.

105
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,450
Yes!

106
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,510
[Loyalty]

107
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,390
Hua!

108
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,440
I...

109
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,840
I'm just an accomplice.

110
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,830
I was an assassin before,

111
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,450
but I only assisted others.

112
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,420
I've never killed anyone myself!

113
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,210
If I didn't have evidence,

114
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,820
would I let you stay alone?

115
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,430
You killed Cong's husband,

116
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,510
didn't you?

117
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,870
No, no, I didn't kill him!

118
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,000
It was Manniang!

119
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,630
Manniang

120
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,800
was the handler for Cong and me.

121
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,630
Because of my carelessness,

122
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,800
Cong's husband

123
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,230
found out about our past.

124
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,070
Manniang didn't even give a warning

125
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,130
before she struck.

126
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,830
His blood splattered all over me.

127
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,070
It was terrifying.

128
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,210
What happened in the past?

129
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,390
Nothing important.

130
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,680
Not talking?

131
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,390
Luo, Jia, Liu!

132
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,680
Silence!

133
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,630
I'll talk! I'll talk!

134
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,120
Manniang

135
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,830
was an assassin from the Crimson Pact.

136
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,400
Cong and I were her subordinates.

137
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,080
How did you find the flaw?

138
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,120
When you went mushroom picking
at Leyouyuan

139
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,480
to celebrate his birthday,

140
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,610
he had supposedly moved away already.

141
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,160
It's all because of Hua's big mouth.

142
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,900
Of course, it's also my fault.

143
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,980
I was seduced by the Woe-Reliever

144
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,140
and ended up like this.

145
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,200
About the Crimson Pact,

146
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,080
I won't say anything.

147
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,970
Just cut off my head!

148
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,070
Yingtao,

149
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,080
you're a heroine.

150
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,920
When you were saving Su Wuming,

151
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
you weren't afraid of death.

152
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,480
And you're now afraid
of my mere acupuncture needles?

153
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,960
Don't move. Don't move.

154
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,130
Done.

155
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,750
Although I've removed the needles,

156
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,880
you should still lie down a bit longer.

157
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,450
Don't worry.

158
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,870
With me here,

159
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,590
everything will be fine.

160
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,720
Yingtao used all her strength

161
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,920
to protect me.

162
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Those 2 assassins, a man and a woman,

163
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,310
were highly skilled in martial arts.

164
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,160
I've been thinking,

165
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,430
but I can't figure it out.

166
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,510
I have no enemies.

167
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,310
Who would want to kill me?

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,460
How did you all
get involved with assassins?

169
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,190
Those 3 women,

170
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,800
though ordinary in martial arts,

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,600
have been confirmed
to be Crimson Pact assassins.

172
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,020
Ordinary in martial arts?

173
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
They're just minions at best.

174
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,390
What are minions?

175
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,600
Minions

176
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,920
are part of the Crimson Pact

177
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,169
but not really assassins.

178
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,090
They can develop their own subordinates

179
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,750
but have only one direct handler.

180
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,070
If they lose contact

181
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,370
with their handler,

182
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,380
they'll become abandoned pieces

183
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,080
and can never find
their assassin group again.

184
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,390
The core assassins of the Crimson Pact

185
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,840
are either highly skilled martial artists

186
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
or experts with extraordinary abilities,

187
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,030
including those who excel in poisoning

188
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,750
or illusion.

189
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,120
In short,

190
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,290
their common characteristic

191
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,600
is that they're all extremely arrogant.

192
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
Assassins of high caliber like Beacon Fire

193
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,390
and Silent Ember

194
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,310
naturally have

195
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,160
all kinds of business

196
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,970
from clients seeking them out.

197
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,680
But if the target

198
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,430
is just an ordinary nobody,

199
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,670
even if you offer them a fortune,

200
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,650
they won't do the job themselves.

201
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,810
That's why they have minions

202
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,600
handle the minor tasks.

203
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,890
Some masters even train

204
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
their disciples to become minions.

205
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,900
I must say, Mr. Fei,

206
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,030
you seem to know

207
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,290
quite a lot about this.

208
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,840
Of course I do.

209
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,450
After all, I once treated

210
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,810
Silent Ember's wounds.

211
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,440
Su Wuming.

212
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,000
Why don't you

213
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,120
take another look at this thing?

214
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,420
You said it's 15 days old,

215
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,830
but Mr. Fei suggested

216
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,300
it's 5 days old.

217
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,880
[Save Lives, Relieve Woes]

218
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,120
[Save Lives, Relieve Woes]

219
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,590
The bloodstains seeped into the linen,

220
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,490
winding like trails left by earthworms
crawling through mud.

221
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,630
Though it was just a quick assessment
back then,

222
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,150
it seems correct now.

223
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,910
Something this completely dried out

224
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,120
and brittle

225
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,320
should be at least 15 days old, right?

226
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,200
Su Wuming,

227
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,720
you've learned well from Master Di.

228
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,030
When criminals leave traces,

229
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,920
they can't escape your keen eye.

230
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,400
But when it comes to human blood,

231
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,380
I have seen

232
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,300
more than most.

233
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,440
I didn't just guess it was 5 days old.

234
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,880
I smelled it.

235
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,250
Try it yourself.

236
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,440
Your noses aren't good enough.

237
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,350
Haven't you smelled the blood?

238
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,030
No, I haven't.

239
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,600
Scrape off a bit more

240
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,320
and dissolve it in water, then smell.

241
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,880
Especially the word

242
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,160
"Relieve."

243
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,810
The first 2 words "Save Lives"

244
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,510
are clearly lighter
than the following words.

245
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,000
This is because the blood was still thin

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,240
at the initial stage of writing,

247
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,440
requiring the writer

248
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,670
to bite his fingertips repeatedly.

249
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,960
[Save Lives, Relieve Woes]

250
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,750
Look, it turns as red as cinnabar

251
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,240
toward the end.

252
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,010
My mentor Sun Simiao once said

253
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,910
once drawn from the body, human blood will
develop a putrid odor after 3 days

254
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,600
and decompose by the fifth.

255
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,800
Now, smell the blood in the water again.

256
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,630
There is indeed a faint putrid odor.

257
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,360
This is a sign that the vital essence
in the blood hasn't dispersed.

258
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,000
According to
the "Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon,"

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,600
based on the principles
of blood decomposition,

260
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,550
it is definitely no more than 5 days old,

261
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,390
likely between 3 and 5 days old.

262
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,910
But the cracking level of these words...

263
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,030
I understand now.

264
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,960
Recently, the Maestros of Rain in Chang'an

265
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,080
have all been praying for rain,

266
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,030
which only came this afternoon.

267
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,080
The robe

268
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,480
was hanging in Ascension Forest.

269
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,510
The robe was exposed to wind and sun,

270
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,540
which accelerated its drying.

271
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,970
That's why

272
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,600
this blood writing
that's only a few days old

273
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,480
appears

274
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,960
to be half a month old.

275
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,930
That's right.

276
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,640
Thank you, Miracle Doctor Fei,

277
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,520
for correcting my misjudgment.

278
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,630
No need for that.

279
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,480
We're a team.

280
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,730
Such a grand gesture

281
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,550
might shorten my life.

282
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,840
In the future,

283
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,030
if there's anything you don't understand,

284
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,860
just ask me.

285
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,200
I'll give you some guidance anytime.

286
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,670
Alright,

287
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,990
both of you, sit down.

288
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,370
Whether it's 15 or 5 days old,

289
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,210
the leads have gone cold on both sides.

290
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,000
Didn't we capture

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,330
the 3 female assassins?

292
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,260
That's quite an achievement.

293
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,970
What a coincidence.

294
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,720
Today, when I left the district office,

295
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,600
I ran into Mr. Hou from Hero Restaurant.

296
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,640
So I ordered

297
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,470
some of their signature dishes.

298
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,950
They should arrive soon.

299
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,960
How about we have a few drinks?

300
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,430
A few drinks sounds good.

301
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,740
A few drinks can help blood circulation,

302
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,680
which is perfect

303
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,320
for my back to heal faster.

304
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,670
Ruan Daxiong has gone beyond the border.

305
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,270
Mr. Hou is running the restaurant alone.

306
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,420
He must be very busy.

307
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,510
The restaurant is already short-staffed.

308
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,360
And you've made them

309
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,790
deliver food all the way here.

310
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,600
Won't that interfere with

311
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,260
Hero Restaurant's business?

312
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,080
It sounds like

313
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,150
Official Lu has invested

314
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,430
in Hero Restaurant.

315
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,010
Besides,

316
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,670
I wouldn't have

317
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,910
their staff deliver it.

318
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,960
I hired an errand service to pick it up.

319
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,910
Everyone's been so busy lately.

320
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,200
Lu Lingfeng and Xue Huan
used to stay at the district office,

321
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,800
so it's rare for us to gather.

322
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,720
There's no time to cook,

323
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,200
so this is the best I can do.

324
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,480
I've already asked Xue Huan

325
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,750
to buy some good wine.

326
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,550
Xijun, you really understand me.

327
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,960
My gold-plated silver flask

328
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,370
with a dancing horse pattern

329
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,650
is already empty.

330
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,670
Doesn't the name
I came up with for this flask,

331
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,530
the one Xijun gave me, sound nice?

332
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,870
It's nice,

333
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,770
but just a bit of a mouthful.

334
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,670
According to my original plan,

335
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,360
tomorrow, the district circuit
shall take place in the Xiuzhen District.

336
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,030
I hope

337
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,000
I can find some useful clues.

338
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,140
So I won't drink today.

339
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,240
The recent cases we've investigated

340
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,670
and situations we've encountered

341
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,020
are all related to this Xiuzhen District.

342
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,840
How about I go with you tomorrow?

343
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,460
You volunteered to go,

344
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,480
so don't complain.

345
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,870
For the sake of the investigation,

346
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,470
when have I ever complained?

347
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,000
Thank you for your work.

348
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,200
Here's your fee.

349
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,320
Thank you, Miss.

350
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,180
To be honest,

351
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,150
I've been working as an errand runner

352
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,080
for over 6 months now,

353
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,670
but this is my first time delivering food.

354
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,030
On my way here, I was wondering

355
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,360
who would be rich enough

356
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,550
to have just a few dishes

357
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,870
delivered from outside Kaiyuan Gate,

358
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,550
all the way across half of Chang'an.

359
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,480
Little did I know

360
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,480
you were going to host

361
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,480
the renowned disciple of Master Di.

362
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,320
I've seen Official Lu before.

363
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,870
On district circuit for cases,
he cuts an imposing figure

364
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,320
and is so kind to us common folk.

365
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,400
This errand trip

366
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,840
is definitely worth it.

367
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:54,910
Here,

368
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,040
this is from Official Lu for you.

369
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,240
Thank you, Miss.

370
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,040
Thank you, Official Lu.

371
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,370
Please enjoy your meal.

372
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,200
I'll be on my way now.

373
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,440
I have more deliveries to make.

374
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,040
Farewell.

375
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,530
For an official,

376
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,280
earning the people's approval

377
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,750
is the greatest joy.

378
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,720
How about you have a few drinks tonight?

379
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,390
Just a small drink,

380
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,320
not enough to affect
the district circuit tomorrow.

381
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,390
Well then,

382
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,280
a small drink?

383
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,320
A small drink.

384
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,600
In my entire life,

385
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,150
I hate nothing
more than the words "small drink."

386
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,810
It reeks of pretentiousness.

387
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,320
You 2 can have your small drink.

388
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
I shall drink heartily with others.

389
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,330
If we're drinking, let's drink properly!

390
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,320
Let's go.
