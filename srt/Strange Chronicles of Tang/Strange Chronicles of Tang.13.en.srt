4
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,000
Back then,

5
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,710
when I followed my revered mentor,
Master Di,

6
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,320
in investigating mysterious cases,

7
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,530
the so-called deities we offended

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,940
were too many to count!

9
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,930
One more won't make a difference!

10
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,070
Though worldly affairs are complex,

11
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,280
they follow certain rules.

12
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,400
Life is full of suffering,

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,000
but there is always a way
to relieve one's woes.

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,620
I cannot bear to see people suffer,

15
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,350
so I came here

16
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,520
to help relieve their woes—

17
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,870
only to meet such disrespect
from this youngster.

18
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,430
Do you wish for the Demon of Woes

19
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,160
to remain in this mortal world,

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,990
bringing harm everywhere?

21
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,560
Please don't be angry, divine one.

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,920
Please remain in the mortal world

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,110
to relieve our woes!

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,789
-Master, please calm your anger.
-Master, please calm your anger.

25
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:54,580
Please remain in the mortal world

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,400
and relieve our woes.

27
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,480
-Master, please calm down.
-Master, please calm down.

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,560
Guards!

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,520
Throw this troublemaker out

30
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,920
and never allow him to return
to the Relief-from-Woes Shop!

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
Let go of me!

32
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,310
Let go of me!

33
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,400
Let go of me!

[Abode of Transcendence]

35
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,970
Madam, you are a gold member,

36
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,150
yet you didn't get a chance
to share your troubles.

37
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,550
We're deeply sorry.

38
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,310
It's fine.

39
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,360
Witnessing a deity descend

40
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,020
into the world with my own eyes

41
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,630
is already an honor beyond measure.

42
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,190
You're devout and faithful.

43
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,750
Why not remain here
and cultivate immortality?

44
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,750
I can remain here?

45
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,840
Of course.

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,920
Even gold members

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,120
cannot compare to

48
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,730
the cultivators here.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,290
What's the difference?

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,630
Cultivators can serve
the Master regularly.

51
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,630
Their souls dwell alongside the divine,

52
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,960
and worries and woes cannot afflict them.

53
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,630
They have a greater chance
of slaying the Ultimate Evil

54
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,360
born of worries and woes—

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,870
not a straw effigy

56
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,870
like the one on stage today.

57
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,800
Excellent.

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,240
However...

59
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,000
I still have unfinished business
in the mortal world.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,030
Once I've settled it,

61
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,150
I'll surely return here to cultivate.

62
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,480
I have another request.

63
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,280
I have a friend

64
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,190
who also wishes to seek relief here.

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,790
Is there any way

66
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,720
to give him a chance
to voice his woes publicly?

67
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,610
If gold coins can settle it,

68
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,310
just name the amount.

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,560
Worldly possessions are
the source of troubles,

70
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,079
and this is certainly not a place
to line one's pockets.

71
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,170
As for your friend,

72
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,520
he seems to have a fated connection
with this place.

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,450
What do you mean?

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,960
Today's Relief-from-Woes Assembly

75
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,080
was disrupted by some troublemaker
named Su.

76
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,140
The Master also feels sorry about it,

77
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,560
so he's decided to hold
an additional session tomorrow.

78
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,030
Only 12 gold members

79
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,580
will be permitted to enter,

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,570
and all will be given a chance
to voice their woes.

81
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,220
Bring your friend.

82
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,149
No gold coins are needed.

83
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,450
Official Lu,

84
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,870
did I mess things up today?

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,260
Why would you say that?

86
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,680
If it were me,

87
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,130
I'd have done the same.

88
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,090
It's just that the Demon of Woes

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,020
was disguised too convincingly.

90
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,240
I'm telling you—

91
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,570
last time, I saw it with my own eyes

92
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,870
as blood splattered out,

93
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,800
and it was definitely human blood!

94
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,070
Besides, if it were really made of straw,

95
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,510
there's no way the sound of its head

96
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,159
hitting the ground

97
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,360
could have been that real!

98
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,510
That was a real human head!

99
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,310
What shocked me even more was...

100
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,000
that Master's

101
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,170
voice—where did it come from?

102
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,070
Your hearing is sharp.

103
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,070
Did you detect it?

104
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,830
Strange.

105
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,680
My ears failed me

106
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,870
as soon as I entered
the Relief-from-Woes Shop.

107
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,240
I couldn't even tell

108
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,680
that the voice wasn't coming

109
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,150
from the Master himself.

110
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,610
The guard standing behind him

111
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,850
is very suspicious.

112
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,310
Also,

113
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,140
Fei's suffering is bitter beyond words.

114
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,680
We haven't

115
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,000
cared enough about him.

116
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,390
Let's forget everything

117
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,190
we heard tonight.

118
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,070
And never ask about

119
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,200
his past again.

120
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,270
Xijun told me

121
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,600
that beneath the Hanzhou city walls,

122
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,730
Fei once said...

123
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,050
You and I cannot leave.

124
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,490
In life,

125
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,500
we journey west together.

126
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,560
In death,

127
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,100
we go to the underworld together.

128
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,280
So we must never

129
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,390
abandon him.

130
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,840
Technically,

131
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,270
I can eat chicken

132
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,520
without paying,

133
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,870
because I have...

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,110
I'll keep my good stuff to myself.

135
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,900
Therefore,

136
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,070
I'll pay!

137
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
Which one would you like?

138
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,690
I want that one,

139
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,330
the one that's almost done,

140
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,360
with the chicken wing tips
glistening with oil.

141
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,190
But that chicken

142
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,720
has already been reserved.

143
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,470
Reserved?

144
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,500
Not reserved, not reserved. It's yours.

145
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,220
I'll go take a leak.

146
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,950
When I come back, I want it on my table!

147
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,610
Sure thing!

149

The scab is about to fall off.

150
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,090
It shouldn't leave a scar.

151
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,360
Your ointment works wonders.

152
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,460
Before,

153
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,970
a wound like this

154
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,230
would've taken at least a month to heal.

155
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,690
Come on.

159
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:25,920
No need.

My feet are huge.

162
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,870
They're ugly.

163
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,990
Big feet help you stand firm.

164
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,080
They're beautiful to me.

165
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,000
Just like your face.

who owns a house in Chang'an.

169
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,720
Not only do I own a house,

170
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,150
but I can also pay off the pawnshop debt.

171
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,580
Not only am I debt-free now...

172
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,930
but I even have money to spare.

173
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,440
From now on,

174
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,880
I, Sheng, can hold my head high

175
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,840
and stand as a proper citizen of Chang'an.

176
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,960
You've betrayed the Master.

177
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,290

you shall be free of all troubles.

[Yongzhou Prefecture]

189
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,550
In Lantian County,

190
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,150
we found information about Chen Qian.

191
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,010
Five years ago,

192
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,410
after his parents died,

193
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,200
he decided to go to the capital
to take the imperial exam.

194
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,460
When leaving Lantian,

195
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,840
he vowed to pass the exam

196
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,970
and return in glory.

197
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,630
But after that,

198
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,690
he never came back.

199
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,960
With the portrait Miss Xijun drew,

200
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
we asked the neighbors
near Chen Qian's old residence.

201
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,390
It's him.

202
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,790
Five years ago.

203
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,510
The timeline matches up.

204
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,360
The female Master of Rain left home

205
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,030
at 6 PM.

206
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,320
Her husband, Chen Qian,

207
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,390
left a quarter of an hour after her.

208
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,670
They were cautious,

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,730
so I didn't follow too closely.

210
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,840
They went in the direction

211
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,510
of the Relief-from-Woes Shop,
but whether they actually entered

212
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,640
remains uncertain.

213
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,450
At 8 PM,

214
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,120
the couple returned home together.

215
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,520
I intended to keep watch,

216
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,460
but then I heard Sheng's screams.

217
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,270
Their houses are very close together.

218
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,600
How is Sheng?

219
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,930
I saved him from Ascension Forest.

220
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,140
He's really lucky.

221
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,690
Uncle Fei's life-saving miracle medicine

222
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,750
was all used on him.

223
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,090
He's awake now.

224
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,150
We agreed to be friends,

225
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,550
and friends shouldn't hide anything
from each other.

226
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,440
But you?

227
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,550
If I hadn't asked Madam Yingtao

228
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
to protect you secretly,

229
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,000
you would have...

230
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,400
They actually wanted to
drain all my blood.

231
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,670
They wanted those Ghost Birds
to devour me.

232
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,810
Not even...

233
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,090
Not even my bones would remain!

234
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,270
So you even know

235
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,080
the secrets of Ascension Forest.

236
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,140
How dare you, Sheng!

237
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,610
What else are you hiding?

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,060
Hanging myself...

239
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
taking poison...

240
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,090
or jumping into the Qu River...

241
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,540
Which one should I choose?

242
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,720
That was two months ago.

243
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,120
I discovered

244
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,630
that my wife was actually

245
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,670
cheating on me

246
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,280
in the house I bought.

247
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,270
I was heartbroken at the time

248
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,910
and wanted to end my life.

249
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,460
But then I heard

250
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,860
there was a new Relief-from-Woes Shop
in the district.

251
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,970
I know that place.

252
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,870
It used to be some unknown

253
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,150
general's residence
from the previous dynasty.

254
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,390
Rumor had it that it was haunted,
and no one dared to go there.

255
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,960
It had been abandoned for many years.

256
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,940
Somehow,

257
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,140
someone had fixed it up quite nicely.

258
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,240
After pouring out my sorrows,

259
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,910
they actually asked me

260
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,170
to become a cultivator

261
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,040
and seek immortality there.

262
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,390
I worried

263
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,030
that they were just trying

264
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,960
to take my house.

265
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:16,750
Well...

266
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,870
I worked hard to get my house.

267
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,270
How could I agree to that?

268
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,000
But...

269
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,110
the altar attendant wasn't angry at all

270
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,360
and even gave me an assignment.

271
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,840
[East Street of Chunming Gate,
Xingqing District]

272
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,030
He gave me different addresses each time.

273
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,390
He asked me to go to those places

274
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,030
to praise the Relief-from-Woes Shop.

275
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,960
I thought it was nothing more than
drumming up clients,

276
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,560
just a broker's work at most.

277
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,690
But... they made me swear

278
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,560
never to betray the Master.

279
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,450
Otherwise,

280
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,160
they would execute me

281
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,150
as a traitor.

282
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,730
I needed the money,

283
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,230
so I agreed.

284
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,170
You took the money but didn't do the work,

285
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,270
and that's why you faced disaster tonight.

286
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,510
No!

287
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,410
When I take someone's money, I do the job.

288
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,270
I, Sheng, follow the rules!

289
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,320
Then why?

290
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,630
You

291
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,110
weren't recruited

292
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,790
at the designated location.

293
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,150
By making a scene at the altar,

294
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,080
you clearly posed a threat to them.

295
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,200
Also,

296
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,620
I took gold coins behind their backs.

297
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,380
Yingtao, go check his home

298
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,070
to see if the gold coins are still there.

299
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,000
The so-called gold membership

300
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
had to be purchased with gold coins—

301
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,080
that's your money-making scheme?

302
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,670
Yes.

303
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,150
They only asked me to drum up clients

304
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,550
and never mentioned charging any fees.

305
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,080
Gold, silver, iron—

306
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,200
there's actually no difference.

307
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,060
Just a gimmick.

308
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,630
Cultivating immortality inside the shop

309
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,870
also doesn't require offering up
one's family property.

310
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,400
I only found that out later.

311
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,410
But from that moment on,

312
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,870
I truly believed

313
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,300
the Master was a god.

314
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,970
Because only a god would not seek money

315
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,230
and would only want to relieve our woes.

316
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,460
Where is your wife?

317
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,390
Why didn't we see her
when we went to your house?

318
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,320
After I confessed
at the Relief-from-Woes Shop,

319
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,030
perhaps

320
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,270
she realized I had discovered her affair,

321
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,130
so she ran away.

322
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,370
She never came back.

323
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,800
Then how do you know she ran away

324
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,020
rather than being harmed by someone?

325
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,630
Also,

326
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,440
why didn't you report it
to the authorities?

327
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,700
Why should I report it?

328
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,840
A wife like that—

329
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,690
it'd be better if she were dead!

330
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,080
You're more vicious than I thought.

331
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,630
Let me ask you:

332
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,510
the Relief-from-Woes Assembly
was originally held every three days,

333
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,390
but suddenly an extra one was added.

334
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,120
Has this ever happened before?

335
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,270
Never.

336
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,480
Where did they

337
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,240
have you go to attract clients?

338
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,490
Think carefully

339
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,000
and don't leave out a single location.

340
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,750
Yes.

341
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,390
Yes.

342
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,210
[Jincheng District]

343
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,430
[Banzheng District]

The Xingqing District was formerly
called Longqing District,

[Xingqing District] [Chunming Gate]

350

351
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,670
lived when he was Prince of Linzi.

352
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,370
I've also noticed

353
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,340
that the districts where they sent Sheng

354
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,290
all have imperial courtiers living there.

355
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,430
Could it be...

All the money is here.

358
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,550
The fact that the Relief-from-Woes Shop

359
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,910
doesn't seek money
is precisely what makes it so dangerous.

360
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,270
This is your reward.

361
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,270
Your Majesty,

362
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,670
this reward is too generous.

363
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,800
I dare not accept it.

364

and relieve my worries and woes,

366
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,870
this reward is nothing.

367
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,840

368
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
You may all leave.

in advance.

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,650
I implore Your Majesty

378
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,130
to prioritize the realm and its people

379
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,350
and reconsider this matter carefully!

380
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,670
I just want to find a place

381
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,000
to express my troubles
and find some relief!

382
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,599
What is there to reconsider?

383
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,790
Though I am no emperor
who conquers on horseback,

384
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,349
I surely don't need

385
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,079
your protection at every turn!

386
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,240
Lu Tong,

387
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,950
you are my grand general.

388
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,000
How could you take orders from him,

389
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,930
a mere Yongzhou Judicial Officer?

390
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,960
Lu Lingfeng deduced that Your Majesty

391
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,589
planned to exit through
the northwest side gate

392
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,829
and head to Xiuzhen District.

393
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,829
I didn't believe it at first,

394
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,349
but considering Your Majesty's safety,

395
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:25,880
I just...

396
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,960
I almost thought

397
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,880
you had planted spies

398
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,350
around me.

399
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,880
Your Majesty jests.

400
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,790
This accusation

401
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,510
is too serious for me to bear.

402
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,830
Alright, that's enough kneeling.

403
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,350
Get up.

404
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

405
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,000
Lu Lingfeng,

406
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,100
how did you know of my plan?

407
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,160
This subordinate is
currently investigating a case

408
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
regarding the Relief-from-Woes Shop
in Xiuzhen District.

409
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,750
Allow me to report the details.
