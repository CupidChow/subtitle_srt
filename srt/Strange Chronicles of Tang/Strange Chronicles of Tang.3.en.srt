[Episode 3]

3
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,470
Tell us.

4
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,790
So the 3 of us

5
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,650
don't have to suspect each other.

6
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,710
Otherwise...

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,120
Don't! Don't! Don't!

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,480
I know nothing about any blood letter.

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,110
When did I ever write a blood letter?

10
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,640
You messed with us
and then tried to leave?

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,560
If we hadn't locked you up here,

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,350
you would have run away long ago.

13
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,350
You wrote a blood letter asking for help,

14
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,210
and now you don't dare to admit it.

15
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,270
Then I have no choice.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,430
Though I hate to do it,

17
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,760
I'll have to

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,750
kill you.

19
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,110
Get off the horse.

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,320
Don't make any noise.

21
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,470
I...

22
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,210
I did think about

23
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,120
renting a place somewhere else.

24
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,870
But now I don't want to leave.

25
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,800
You three

26
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,280
have treated me well,

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,420
taking turns keeping me company.

28
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,579
This is even better

29
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,870
than having multiple wives.

30
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,960
Living such a pleasurable life,

31
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,290
who would want to leave?

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,910
And also,

33
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,570
when I wanted mushrooms for my birthday,

34
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,730
you three

35
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,280
gathered mushrooms to make soup for me.

36
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,760
How could I possibly think of leaving?

37
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,840
Did you really not write a blood letter?

38
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,870
No, I didn't.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,360
Look.

40
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,520
If you don't believe me,

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,650
see for yourselves.

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,230
Where are the wounds

43
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,210
on my 10 fingers?

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,740
Where have they ever bled?

45
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,760
Could it be that Lu Lingfeng

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,290
has deceived us?

47
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,280
Manniang,

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,320
you don't need to be so vigilant.

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,160
He must have made a mistake.

50
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,400
We've lived in the Xiuzhen District

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,500
for several years.

52
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,510
Surely nothing will happen.

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,540
It's still your fault.

54
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,030
Manniang told you to talk less,

55
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,690
but you just wouldn't listen.

56
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,060
Who put him in the cage?

57
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,800
I did.

58
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,680
Let him out.

59
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,159
If he's locked up too long and gets sick,

60
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,760
how will he relieve our woes?

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Manniang,

62
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,870
you make it sound like

63
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,070
you're the only one who cares about him.

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,750
Thank you, ladies.

65
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,660
Woe-Reliever.

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,950
Since it wasn't

67
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,800
you who wrote that blood letter for help,

68
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,370
you might as well stay here.

69
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,720
Better than having you go elsewhere

70
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,950
and flirt with other women.

71
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,720
You don't need
to take the palace examination anymore.

72
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,320
We will take good care of you.

73
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,790
For the rest of your life,

74
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,080
this is how it'll be.

75
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,420
Someone else is here!

76
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,600
Ladies, protect me!

77
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,490
Someone has finally come to rescue me.

78
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,490
These 3 female bandits

79
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,080
are extremely vicious.

80
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,150
I've been imprisoned here in darkness,

81
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,670
forced all day long

82
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,320
to relieve their woes.

83
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,510
Jerk!

84
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,090
Didn't you just say

85
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,720
it's a pleasurable life
living with the 3 of us?

86
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,450
This forest is called Ascension Forest.

87
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,170
I pulled the robe off the tree

88
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,640
3 days ago in the morning.

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,430
According to local custom,

90
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,760
whenever someone dies,

91
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,800
their family applies a little sheep fat

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,460
to the clothes or accessories

93
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,040
they last wore

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,460
and hangs them on branches
in Ascension Forest.

95
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,870
This robe

96
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,610
belonged to someone who died?

97
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,630
Hanging up the deceased's clothes

98
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,270
is supposedly to summon their soul,

99
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,710
but actually, it serves to appease ghosts.

100
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,270
This way, the spirits of the dead

101
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,040
won't linger

102
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,100
in the family home.

103
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,270
So, isn't it the truth
that once someone dies,

104
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,600
their family just wants
to get rid of them?

105
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,040
Why?

106
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,600
Did I say something wrong?

107
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,200
Not at all.

108
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,120
It's just that nobody else
thinks of it that way,

109
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,600
but now that you mention it,

110
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
I think you make a good point.

111
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,480
Why is there a green bird over there?

112
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,390
Indeed.

113
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,800
It's bright green.

114
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,030
Madam Master of Rain,

115
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,400
do you come here often?

116
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,810
Every morning.

117
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,920
Because, besides being a Master of Rain,

118
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,320
I have another identity.

119
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
I'm a dew collector.

120
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,070
You collect morning dew?

121
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,600
Exactly.

122
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,600
A Master of Rain, much like a coroner,

123
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,070
is passed down through generations
in the family.

124
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,870
My generation has no male heirs.

125
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,740
I was 10 years old then.

126
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,360
And somehow, I became

127
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,650
Chang'an's first female Master of Rain.

128
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,120
I can't say I hate it,

129
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,290
nor do I particularly like it.

130
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,270
But I always wanted to choose something

131
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,270
for myself,

132
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,600
so I became a dew collector.

133
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,800
What's the dew used for?

134
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,159
For years, Xiuzhen District
has been accepting

135
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,310
cultivators from other districts

136
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,170
and even from other prefectures.

137
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,830
There are nearly 1,000 of them now.

138
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,680
They believe

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,630
that if they continuously consume
morning dew,

140
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,090
they'll eventually ascend to immortality.

141
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,530
That's quite a business
with no investment.

142
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,480
That morning,

143
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,480
as usual,

144
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,450
I came to Ascension Forest to collect dew.

145
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,750
It was my first time

146
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,680
taking a robe from Ascension Forest.

147
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,400
I really liked the color

148
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,070
and thought I'd wear it
during rain prayers.

149
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,670
But when I tried it on at home,

150
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,730
for some reason,

151
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,050
a bone-chilling cold came over me.

152
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,300
It was terrifying.

153
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,160
Just then, someone
came collecting old items,

154
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,120
so I sold it.

155
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,030
I know I was wrong,

156
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,549
but the robe was hung for the dead,

157
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,370
so it's not really stealing, is it?

158
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,270
I suppose not.

159
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,390
I just want to know

160
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,480
where exactly

161
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,130
this robe was hanging.

162
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,020
Right here.

163
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,240
On that branch?

164
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,310
Anything else?

165
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,510
If not,

166
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,920
I need to go back and cook for my husband.

167
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,270
Thank you for your trouble.

168
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:09,970
Today,

169
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,670
thanks to your timely arrival,

170
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,470
that scoundrel didn't succeed.

171
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Thank you.

172
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,370
D-Don't mention it.

173
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,280
If it weren't for Madam Yingtao,

174
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,780
I would have been done for.

175
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,670
Then I should thank you too.

176
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,240
No need.

177
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,400
I didn't come to save you anyway.

178
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,000
Well, you're still a good girl.

179
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,750
Mr. Su is quite fortunate.

180
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,670
I... I really am a good girl.

181
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,340
You're not bad either.

182
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,120
Well,

183
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,060
how did this turn
into a mutual admiration session?

184
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
You two should not

185
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,570
stay here too long.

186
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,510
Though this place
is called Ascension Forest,

187
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,440
the yin energy is very strong here.

188
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,600
Thanks for the reminder.

189
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,460
We'll just look around and leave.

190
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,390
That woman is strange.

191
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,000
Is she?

192
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,630
She just complimented you.

193
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,680
She's right, though.

194
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,120
I am a good girl.

195
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,200
Yes,

196
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,030
yes, you are.

197
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
Can a good girl

198
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,390
climb trees?

199
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,750
Of course.

200
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,150
Yingtao!

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,730
Are you okay?

202
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,130
I'm fine.

203
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,340
Why were there so many birds in this tree?

204
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,620
And they're all green.

205
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,320
According to legend,

206
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,390
after death but before burial,

207
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,320
a type of bird flies out from the coffin,

208
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,390
called Sha.

209
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,720
The "Sha" that means "kill"?

210
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,480
Yes, yes,

211
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,670
that's the word.

212
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,400
It has emerald green feathers,

213
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,670
transformed from human ghosts.

214
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,270
It shouldn't be called Sha.

215
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,080
Might as well just call it Ghost Bird.

216
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,720
Its common name is indeed Ghost Bird.

217
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,950
These birds are strange.

218
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,700
I didn't see any outside.

219
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,700
They must

220
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,200
only live in this forest.

221
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,780
So,

222
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,270
it's not the birds that are strange;

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,550
it's this forest.

224
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,720
Can you climb up again?

225
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,270
Yes.

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,390
Have you found any clues up there?

227
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,790
No.

228
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,870
There's not even a thread

229
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,970
on these branches.

230
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Could Ruiqiu have lied to us?

231
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,960
Here, catch this.

232
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,360
Hang it there.

233
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,540
What are you doing?

234
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,960
Quickly, search carefully.

235
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,550
If the robe had knot buttons before,

236
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,720
they must have been torn off

237
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,670
when Ruiqiu pulled it down.

238
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,730
Hurry, look for it.

239
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,550
Su Wuming.

240
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,000
Is this it?

241
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,900
This should be it.

242
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,960
The fabric is ordinary,

243
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,530
but this knot button

244
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,790
is made of turquoise.

245
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,440
The robe

246
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,130
has quite a history.

247
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,680
Run now!

248
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,700
Guys.

249
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,030
You must be wanderers
of the martial world.

250
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,150
Who sent you

251
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,960
to assassinate us?

252
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,720
Not gonna say anything?

253
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,480
Fine,

254
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,600
I'll tell you something.

255
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,410
The man behind me

256
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,410
is under my protection.

257
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,860
If you dare take his life

258
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,330
or harm him in any way,

259
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,160
I will fight you to the death.

260
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,720
Until

261
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,980
I shed my last drop of blood!

262
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,390
Thankfully, you've been

263
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,850
by my side, protecting me.

264
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,960
Otherwise,

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,260
I would've died twice.

266
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,150
Quick, help rub my back.

267
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,950
What's wrong?

268
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
When I was saving you,

269
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,050
I pulled my back.

270
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,750
Good thing I've scared

271
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,960
those 2 assassins away.

272
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,840
Otherwise, we'd both be dead.
