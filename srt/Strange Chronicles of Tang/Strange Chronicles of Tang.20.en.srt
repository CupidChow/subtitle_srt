[Episode 20]

3
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,740
It really is poisonous.

4
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,240
And it's definitely strychnine.

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,890
This is my

6
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,380
and Official Lu's friend,

7
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,440
Chicken Fei,

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,490
a disciple of the King of Medicine.

9
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,870
A disciple of the King of Medicine
would never lie.

10
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,120
In that case,

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,760
I thank you all for saving my life.

12
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,690
No need for thanks.

13
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,840
Let's go see the painting first.

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,620
I've long heard about this painting,

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,000
but never had the chance to see it.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,400
I never expected it to be so lifelike.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,070
I painted this from memory,

18
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,400
copying as best I could.

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,350
I had little time, so it's not very good.

20
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,759
I must seem ridiculous to you, Sir.

21
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,280
No, no.

22
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:35,920
It's very well done.

23
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,240
Look here.

24
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,250
This is Emperor Xiaojing.

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,350
This one

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,470
is me.

27
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,250
I was the Director
of the Imperial Stables then.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,490
Then this officer

29
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,990
must be Zhu Ling.

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,640
Yes.

31
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,490
At that time, Grand General Zhu

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,710
was the Crown Prince's Left Guard

33
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,509
and Ranking Officer
of the Crown Prince's Guard.

34
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,100
This is Zheng Zhong.

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,080
He was the Deputy Director
of the Imperial Catering then.

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,460
What about the others?

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,240
This is a palace maid.

38
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,010
Because of her strong arms,

39
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,400
Emperor Xiaojing taught her to play polo.

40
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,130
Do you remember her name?

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,560
Something with Cui, I think.

42
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,780
Bo Cui?

43
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes, that's the name.

44
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,040
What about this person?

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,079
His back is turned.

46
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,540
How could I recognize him?

47
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,280
However,

48
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,040
this one catching the polo ball
by the pool

49
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,190
is a young eunuch.

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,620
He was very clever.

51
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,430
Emperor Xiaojing called him Xi.

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,520
A few years ago, I saw him on the street

53
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,240
once.

54
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,780
He had become a beggar.

55
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,190
I believe he was expelled from the palace

56
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,200
for stealing.

57
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,710
Sir,

58
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,280
please wait a moment.

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,340
I'll be right back.

60
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,710
You two,

61
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,980
stop speaking in riddles.

62
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,960
Are you trying to drive me mad
with anxiety?

63
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,870
Three days ago,

64
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,840
a body was found in Wannian County.

65
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,710
According to the examination,

66
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,110
death was caused by strychnine poisoning,

67
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,440
and there was a blow to the head.

68
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,920
I just re-examined the body and discovered

69
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,740
that he was a eunuch.

70
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,940
Xi?

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
How can this painting

72
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,220
be so eerily connected?

73
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,290
I'm afraid the murderer deliberately

74
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
killed according to this painting.

75
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,120
This reminds me

76
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,710
of the Stone Bridge Painting
from Nanzhou Prefecture.

77
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,930
If that's the case,

78
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,000
this unidentified person in the painting

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,260
might be the murderer.

80
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,950
According to Ma Meng,

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,430
in the entire Palace Secretariat,

82
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,750
no one knows

83
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,730
who the artist of this painting is.

84
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,460
Therefore,

85
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,860
the identity of this figure
with his back turned...

86
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,030
The old archives
of the Ministry of Personnel

87
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,070
should contain

88
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,990
records of officials who served

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,800
in the Eastern Palace back then.

90
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,680
I just remembered someone else—

91
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,910
the current Ghost Market Magistrate,
Feng Tai.

92
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,630
He likes to collect

93
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,610
all sorts of strange curiosities.

94
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,120
Emperor Xiaojing was also playful,

95
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,830
so he often invited him
to the Eastern Palace.

96
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,170
Go find him.

97
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,030
Perhaps,

98
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,540
he can recall events from those days.

99
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,600
In that case,

100
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,650
we'll split into 2 groups.

101
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,270
I'll trouble you two county sheriffs

102
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,750
to make a trip to the Ghost Market.

103
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,280
Yingtao, you protect them.

104
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,480
Xue Huan, Xijun,

105
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,600
come with me to the Ministry of Personnel

106
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,860
to search through the archives tonight.

107
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,690
W-What about me?

108
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,230
We've all been busy lately.

109
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,440
You've been running

110
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,270
the sushan shop all by yourself.

111
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,530
You must be exhausted.

112
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,950
Go home and get some rest.

113
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,409
I am rather tired.

114
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,680
Wait.

115
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,630
This can detect poison.

116
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,020
And also...

117
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,910
This one.

118
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,210
If the poisoning isn't severe,

119
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,270
it can save lives.

120
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,110
Thank you.

121
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,230
By the way,

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,800
give me the painting.

[Ghost Market]

124
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,910
Let me take a look.

125
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:31,480
You've certainly found the right person.

126
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,190
[Feng Tai, Ghost Market Magistrate]

127
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,230
Forty years ago,

128
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,270
I often visited the Eastern Palace.

129
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,040
That's right.

130
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,120
This is Crown Prince Hong.

131
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,980
When he died,

132
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,940
I wept for 3 days and nights.

133
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,750
I thought the Tang Empire's fortune

134
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,270
would decline from then on.

135
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,000
Unexpectedly, it has continued until today

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,200
and shows signs of growing prosperity.

137
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,590
Look.

138
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,580
Isn't this you?

139
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,480
Yes.

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Magistrate Feng.

141
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,080
We wanted you to identify

142
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,680
who this person is.

143
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,600
This man

144
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,490
is Tutu Wenzhen.

145
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,420
Yes.

146
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,490
It's him.

147
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,240
He was

148
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,390
Emperor Xiaojing's most trusted
palace attendant.

149
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,450
How could I have forgotten about him?

150
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,480
Thank you, Old Master Feng.

151
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,990
Let's hurry back

152
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,300
to find Tutu Wenzhen's whereabouts.

153
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,360
No need to search.

154
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,950
He's right here in my Ghost Market.

155
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,040
After retirement, he had nowhere to go,

156
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,300
so he became my clerk at the Ghost Market.

157
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,000
Behind the Earth God Temple
in the Ghost Market,

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,930
there's a house.

159
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,870
He works, eats, and lives there.

160
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,680
Perfect!

161
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,950
Please lead the way.

162
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,870
Move aside.

163
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,240
Why isn't he opening the door yet?

164
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,040
If I hadn't received
the temporary residence permit,

165
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,360
which can be exchanged for
a long-term residence permit after a year

166
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,040
to register as a citizen

167
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,310
after 3 years in Chang'an,

168
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,570
I wouldn't bother with this damn permit.

169
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,920
Since we've waited so long,

170
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,250
let's wait a bit longer.

171
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,560
Maybe the old eunuch

172
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,830
had too much to drink,

173
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,450

Tell them Tutu Wenzhen is dead.

178

then someone
will take matters into their own hands.

and Autumn Annals" in one sentence.

192
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:37,870
[Liu Zigui, Ma Meng's Classmate]

193
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,549
No wonder those exam candidates

194
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,409
all refer to you

195
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,799
as the Confucian Master
of the Spring and Autumn Annals.

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,770
I don't deserve such praise.

197
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,550
I recall that previously,

198
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,320
the one honored as the Confucian Master
of the Spring and Autumn Annals

199
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,290
was Emperor Xiaojing's teacher,

200
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,150
Guo Yu.

201
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,650
He was a true Confucian Master.

202
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,330
I can't even hope to catch up to him.

203
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,320
I'm leaving.

204
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,550
[The Lament of the Imperial Scandal]

205
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,080
Liu.

206
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,800
What have you been busy with lately?

207
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,270
Busy with what I should be doing.

208
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,800
Can you share some details?

209
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,800
Confucius said,

210
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,320
"As in piling up earth
to erect a mountain,

211
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,870
if, with only one basketful
short of completion,

212
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,510
I stop,

213
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,750
I have stopped.

214
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,630
As in filling a ditch to level the ground,

215
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,360
if, having dumped in only one basketful,

216
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,020
I continue,

217
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,500
I am progressing."

218
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,660
I, Liu Zigui,

219
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,760
will never fail when success is at hand.

220
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,070
You still haven't told me
what you've been doing.

221
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,870
You'll know when the time comes.

222
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
The sentence just now

223
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,670
isn't from the "Spring and Autumn Annals."

224
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,130
It's from the "Zi Han" chapter
of "The Analects of Confucius."

225
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,720
[Unwavering Integrity]

226
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,170
You old fool,

227
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,160
you're already prepared.

228
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,480
Ma Meng?

229
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,320
Deputy Director of the Palace Secretariat?

230
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,190
Now it's good you know

231
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,150
I'm from His Majesty's side.

232
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,920
Since I'm here to take your life,

233
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,170
it means His Majesty demands your life.

234
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,040
This is bestowed upon you by His Majesty.

235
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,750
Take it.

236
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,930
The "His Majesty" you speak of

237
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,370
isn't the current Emperor, is he?

238
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,190
You old fool.

239
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,650
It seems you still remember

240
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,100
the evil you've done.

241
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,490
You're right.

242
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,150
I'm here on Emperor Xiaojing's orders

243
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,390
to claim your life.

244
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,900
You jerk,

245
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,360
playing tricks!

246
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,390
I'll capture you

247
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,010
and avenge Zhu Ling and Zheng Zhong!

[Unwavering Integrity]

249
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,030
Old fool,

250
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,320
you still think of revenge?

251
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,050
Sheriff Wei, you may take a rest!

252
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,510
I'm Chu Yingtao,
a secret agent of Yongzhou Prefecture.

253
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,080
I'm here to capture the criminal!

254
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,890
A woman?

255
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,940
I won't fight you—

256
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,130
don't throw your life away.

257
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,110
We'll see who dies today!

258
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,520
Who goes there?

259
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,150
I'm Lu Lingfeng
from the Yongzhou Judicial Office.

260
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,350
Surrender now.

261
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,390
I've heard much about you.

262
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,080
It seems

263
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,370
I've fallen into a trap.

264
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,480
I can't fail when so close to success.

265
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,200
Have at you!

266
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,040
Using hidden weapons before me?

267
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,630
Yingtao, don't!

268
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,030
This person is involved
in multiple murders.

269
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,630
The 3 judicial departments
must jointly interrogate him

270
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,160
and record his confession.

271
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,960
You want to interrogate me?

272
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,680
Dream on!

273
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,240
I'm the Deputy Director
of the Palace Secretariat,

274
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,640
from His Majesty's side.

275
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,110
What can you do to me?

276
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,320
Deputy Director of the Palace Secretariat?

277
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,810
You don't really think

278
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,270
you are Ma Meng, do you?

279
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,140
Secretariat Ma,

280
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,280
come out now.

281
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,440
How have you transformed

282
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,570
into my appearance?

283
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,720
If I'm not mistaken,

284
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,600
this is a kind of

285
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,530
extremely thin mask.

286
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,240
The mold

287
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,390
must be made from the real person's face.

288
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,320
Secretariat Ma,

289
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,620
you need to carefully recall

290
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,390
who would have such an opportunity.

291
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,480
Having just arrived in the capital,

292
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,940
I don't have many friends.

293
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,390
Only my classmate Liu Zigui

294
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,630
is particularly close to me.

295
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,490
I drank with him

296
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,030
and listened to his exposition
on the "Spring and Autumn Annals."

297
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,430
Once I got drunk,
I stayed at Liu's Mansion.

298
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,400
Liu,

299
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,210
it can't really be you, can it?

300
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,340
Ma Meng,

301
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,140
you were born into a humble family,

302
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,470
with mediocre talents,

303
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,630
yet you had the chance to become
Deputy Director of the Palace Secretariat.

304
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,760
On the contrary, I am

305
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,670
a descendant of a famous Confucian,

306
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,960
well-versed
in the "Spring and Autumn Annals,"

307
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,790
yet I received no recognition.

308
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,080
It's all because the current Emperor
is incompetent.

309
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,150
If Emperor Xiaojing were still alive,

310
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,270
I would have become

311
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,930
the chancellor by now.

312
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,630
Liu Zigui!

313
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,440
Drop your disguise now!

314
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,980
I refuse.

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,330
If you can't capture me,

316
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,770
I certainly won't confess.

317
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,240
Last night at the Ministry of Personnel,

318
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,440
while reviewing
the Eastern Palace's files,

319
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,620
I discovered a name,

320
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,810
Guo Sigong.

321
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,550
If Emperor Xiaojing

322
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,770
hadn't suddenly passed away,

323
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,200
this man would have entered
the Eastern Palace

324
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,720
and

325
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,510
would have been entrusted
with important duties.

326
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,900
Also,

327
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,480
Old Master Feng, Ghost Market Magistrate,

328
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,200
also saw
"The Lament of the Imperial Scandal"

329
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,590
and recalled a past event.

330
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,670
So you're Grand Tutor Guo's son.

331
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,290
Do you play polo?

332
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,240
No.

333
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,690
That's rather unfortunate.

334
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,680
Although I don't play polo,

335
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,810
I've been skilled at painting
since childhood.

336
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,420
I would like to

337
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,870
[Guo Sigong, Son of Guo Yu]

338
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,600
paint a polo scene for you, Your Highness.

339
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,900
That's a good idea.

340
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,290
When the rain stops,

341
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll call them

342
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,130
to play polo with me.

343
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,670
I'd like to see

344
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,500
how well you can paint.

345
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,640
This painting

346
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,690
will surely be remembered for generations.
