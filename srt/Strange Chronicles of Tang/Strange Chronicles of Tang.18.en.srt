5
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,450
Did you bring the coins?

6
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,690
Where are the goods?

7
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,910
Thirty gold coins.

8
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,329
I need to see them first.

9
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,410
I need to check the goods first.

10
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,100
Fine.

11
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,410
Look, inside it are

12
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,470
the souls of 3 people.

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,710
They're all

14
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,820
from the elders over 70.

15
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,110
You can calculate it.

16
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,710
If you swallow all the souls

17
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,030
in the bottle in one go,

18
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,620
how many years of life would that extend?

19
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,630
How am I supposed to trust you?

20
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,190
What if

21
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,710
you actually took

22
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,840
3 young men's souls?

23
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,490
That's impossible.

24
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,560
I

25
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,470
put strychnine in their food

26
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,650
and drink myself.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,800
And I

28
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,290
extracted their souls myself.

29
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,690
I see.

30
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,910
You must admit this treasure is

31
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,420
worth 30 gold coins.

32
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,780
It's fine if you don't want it.

36
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,490

to the county office for questioning.

Perhaps they have been watching
even longer.

Yes.

And he was under the strict surveillance

of the Yongzhou Prefecture.

123

How could he possibly kill

125
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,770
Of course I know this.

126
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,250
Zuo Lu's confession was

127
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,690
likely forced by Wei Yan's torture.

128
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,700
As for Wei Yan's motive,

129
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,800
it remains unknown for now.

130
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,720
I've seen

Zhu Ling's body.

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,200
There was a hit to the temple.

133

We can't determine the weapon,

The killer is the same one

136
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,720
who murdered the beggar before.

137
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,560
Therefore,

to merge the cases.

Without other evidence for now,

140
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,450
I'm afraid Wei Yan won't agree.

141
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,720
Before it's reported

142

to the Yongzhou Prefecture,

143
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,600
I cannot intervene either.

144
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,510
I have a feeling

145
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,000
that if the real murderer
remains at large,

146
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,830
more people will die.

147
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,310
How much

148
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,130
do you want for these items?

149
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,070
Whatever you think is fair, sir.

150
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,070
We're not greedy.

151
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,920
Then how about

152
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,520
5,000 coins?

153
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,740
5,000 coins?

154
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Okay! Nice!

155
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:52,580
Good!

156
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,130
That's the price then.

157
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,680
Wait.

158
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,880
I think these items are

159
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,640
worth at least 50,000 coins.

160
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,270
Why don't you

161
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,760
sell them to me instead?

162
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,250
Hey, you!

163
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,430
How can you mess with my business
in my shop?

164

165
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,160
whether their items are

worth 5,000

167

aren't they?

170
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,430
If you take these items,

171
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,000
you're helping them sell stolen goods.

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,190
Take these stolen goods

173
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,250
to the Wannian County Office with me!

[Wannian County Office]

176
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,260
Yes.

177
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,600
The old man said

178
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,840
that's the name of the food in the box.

179
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,900
How much did he eat?

180
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,760
Half a piece.

181
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,210
Then he eagerly

182
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,570
pulled me into the room.

183
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,080
That old lecher.

184
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,450
When we saw he was dying,

185
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,000
my wife and I were terrified.

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,120
We only wanted money,

187
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,050
never anyone's life.

188
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,160
So we ran away in a rush.

189
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,450
But as the saying goes,

190
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,730
"A thief never leaves empty-handed."

191
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,010
So we grabbed those few items.

192
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,460
And you said that Gulou Pastry was

193
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,110
given to him by someone else?

194
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:02,950
Yes.

195
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,450
The day before that, I saw that old man

196
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,240
spending lavishly in Pingkang District,

197
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,670
so I deliberately wandered back and forth
in front of him.

198
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,510
Then

199
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,670
we made an appointment to meet

200
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,330
at his residence the next day.

201
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,150
Did you get a good look at that person?

202
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,950
It was a bit far away.

203
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,920
I only saw a blurry outline.

204
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,040
Yingtao.

205
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,700
Go fetch Xijun.

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,390
Yes.

207
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,590
First seduction, then blackmail.

208
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,170
That's a serious crime.

209
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,500
Now, you need

210
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,550
to carefully recall the appearance

211
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,670
of the person who offered the gift

212
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,120
and help the county office draw a sketch.

213
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,510
This may earn you leniency.

214
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,400
Understand?

215
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,570
Yes.

216
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,630
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

217
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,320
Honey,

218
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,070
it all counts on you now.

219
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,200
The female culprit doesn't remember

220
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,510
the gift-giver's face clearly.

221
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,340
She did say it was quite far away.

222
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,060
Strangely enough,

223
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,440
though it was far away,

224
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,790
she can remember the person's eyes.

225
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,720
She just has no impression
of the facial expression.

226
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,970
Why does he look so much like someone?

227
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,480
The one we met in Hanzhou Prefecture.

228
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,840
He's called Ma...

230
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,570
When I was drawing,

231
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,900
I had the same illusion.

232
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,670
Maybe it's because I recently ate

233
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,670
the Gulou Pastries he treated me to.

234
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,380
I'm afraid it's not an illusion.

my old classmate, Liu Zigui.

241
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,330
Let him in.

242
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,320
It's not Mr. Liu,

Since we parted in Hanzhou Prefecture,

254
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,670
we finally met again in Chang'an.

255
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,600
Secretariat Ma,

256
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,750
I was occupied with official duties before

257
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,240
and had to break our appointment.

258
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,270
Please forgive me.

259
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:40,900
It's okay.

260
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,070
That day,

261
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,070
Mr. Su and I had a wonderful chat.

262
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,580
Indeed.

263
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,670
Especially after tasting
the Scholar Tree Leaf Cold Noodles,

264
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,890

Mr. Ma, you're reading
the "Spring and Autumn Annals"?

279

This version
of "Spring and Autumn Annals" is

280

quite rare to find

truly a rare find.

where you obtained it, Mr. Ma.

He has a deep understanding
of the "Spring and Autumn Annals."

Though he hasn't passed
the imperial exams,

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,080
he often gives lessons at Ximing Temple

292
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,240

Honestly, I don't know about that.

about the classics

Why did His Majesty do that?

First of all,

354

Emperor Xiaojing was the best polo player

in the imperial family.

356
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,650
It was also his idea back then

to hold a polo tournament every 4 years

358
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,240
to pacify foreign territories

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,320
and reinforce diplomatic ties.

360
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,920
That's how

361
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,050

came into being.
