[Strange Chronicles of Tang]

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,000
[Episode 21]

3
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,850
So, you're the son of Grand Tutor Guo.

4
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,640
Do you know how to play polo?

5
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,330
No, I don't.

6
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,570
That's quite a pity.

7
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,510
Though I can't play polo,

8
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,530
I've excelled at painting since childhood.

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
I'd be honored...

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,480
to paint a polo match for Your Highness.

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,080
That's actually a good idea.

12
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,180
When the rain stops,

13
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,920
I'll call them

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,050
to play polo with me.

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,770
I'd like to see

16
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,410
how well you can paint.

17
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,650
My painting...

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,860
will surely be passed down
through the ages.

19
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,560
You're so arrogant.

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,479
Do you think you're as good as Gu Kaizhi?

21
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,310
Gu Kaizhi was merely

22
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,870
peerless in painting, unmatched in talent,
and utterly obsessed.

23
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm more versed in the classics
than he was.

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,200
I can recite
the "Spring and Autumn Annals" backward.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Does Your Highness doubt

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,170
that within 10 years...

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,620
my fame will surpass his?

28
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,570
That crazed scholar?

29
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,800
I remember now.

30
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,229
He was the son
of the great Confucian Master Guo Yu.

31
00:01:59,229 --> 00:01:59,720
Yes.

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,840
It was Guo Sigong

33
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,640
who presented a folding screen
to the Palace Secretariat,

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,770
10 years

35
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,060
after Emperor Xiaojing's death.

36
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,650
And upon that screen

37
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,740
was the painting
"The Lament of the Imperial Scandal."

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,460
Liu,

39
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,670
every time you come to see me,

40
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,050
you stare at that screen in a daze.

41
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,900
Could it be

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,780
that you and Guo Sigong

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,380
have some connection?

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,500
Liu!

45
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,310
Take off your disguise!

46
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,870
Liu Zigui.

47
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,370
Why did you do this?

48
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,840
Did you kill all those people

49
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,850
in the painting?

50
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,700
They deserved to die.

51
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,410
Every single one of them deserved death!

52
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,960
[United in Virtue and Learning]

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,630
It was a spring many years ago.

54
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,190
At that time,
the great Confucian Master Guo Yu

55
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,000
was teaching Emperor Xiaojing
the "Spring and Autumn Annals."

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,080
[Guo Yu, Eastern Palace Official]

57
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,880
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

58
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,890
Your Highness.

59
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,590
If Your Highness finds the passage
in the Spring and Autumn Annals

60
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,030
about Shangchen murdering his father,
the emperor, too cruel

61
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,280
and unbearable to hear,

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,520
then starting tomorrow,

63
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,670
I will teach Your Highness

64
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,350
the "Book of Rites" instead.

65
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,170
Your Highness?

66
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,930
Why isn't he dead yet?

67
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,000
Wasn't the strychnine

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,310
supposed to have killed him already?

69
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,710
I can hit him in the temple

70
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,160
with a polo mallet!

71
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,190
[Zhu Ling]

72
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,720
To put him out of his misery.

73
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,150
What do you think?

74
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,050
You can't be the only one to strike him.

75
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,150
[Wei Yan]

76
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,000
If we're doing this,

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,080
everyone present

78
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
must take part.

79
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,610
You're afraid

80
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,000
that otherwise,

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,310
[Tutu Wenzhen]

82
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,709
someone might leak the truth
in the future?

83
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,600
Aren't we just acting on orders?

84
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,750
[Bo Cui]

85
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,829
What is there to fear?

86
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,610
Fear that the one who gave the orders

87
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,310
[Zheng Zhong]

88
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,040
might change their mind later.

89
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,480
Wei Yan's idea is good.

90
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,860
Let's go with that.

91
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,400
Xi,

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,130
you must strike as well.

93
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,190
Me too?

94
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,630
[Xi]

95
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,290
Otherwise,

96
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,870
you'll eat the rest of the flatbread

97
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,100
and follow His Highness in death!

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,720
No, no.

99
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,220
I'll do it.

100
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,420
I'll do it.

101
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,430
Hurry up then. You go first!

102
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,870
You're talking nonsense!

103
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,480
Guo Yu was fabricating stories!

104
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,210
He was lying!

105
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,290
Sheriff Wei,

106
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,480
there's no need to be so agitated.

107
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,630
The one fabricating stories

108
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,890
is probably not Guo Yu.

109
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,750
Let him finish what he has to say.

110
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,870
My grandfather

111
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,290
witnessed it with his own eyes.

112
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,190
He told everything to my father.

113
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,680
And less than a year after

114
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,560
Emperor Xiaojing's death,

115
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,190
he died of depression.

116
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,950
And my father,

117
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,180
because of Emperor Xiaojing's death,

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,800
lost his promising career.

119
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,860
Before he died,

120
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,630
he told me the secret

121
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,430
of "The Lament of the Imperial Scandal"

122
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,560
and instructed me

123
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,810
to avenge Emperor Xiaojing!

124
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,760
I, Guo Zigui,

125
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:42,950
[Liu Zigui, Ma Meng's Classmate]

126
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,370
then sneaked into Chang'an with my mother,

127
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,750
[Guo Zigui, Ma Meng's Classmate]

128
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,350
waiting for an opportunity.

129
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,720
Until Ma Meng...

130
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,360
rose from a mere

131
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,290
Hanzhou Judicial Advisor

132
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,510
to become Deputy Director
of the Palace Secretariat!

133
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,370
He's now a fourth-rank official.

134
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,180
I both admired him

135
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,750
and felt a bit jealous.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,120
But more importantly,

137
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,770
I saw an opportunity for revenge!

138
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,190
I sent Gulou Pastry

139
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,070
to those people while disguised as him—

140
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,600
who would refuse it?

141
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,420
This must be His Majesty's kindness.

142
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,780
Grand General,

143
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,670
do you need me to spell it out?

144
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,450
In that case,

145
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,000
many thanks to Secretariat Ma.

146
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,120
The Ghost Market Magistrate Feng

147
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,190
also recalled something:

148
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,900
Crown Prince Hong held his teacher Guo Yu

149
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,490
in the highest regard.

150
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,650
The Crown Prince once

151
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,840
bestowed upon him the golden polo mallet

152
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,310
granted by Emperor Gaozong himself.

153
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,190
What you're carrying now
is that very item, isn't it?

154
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,310
Yes!

155
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,040
And so what?

156
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,620
I had planned to force

157
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,430
strychnine poison down Wei Yan's throat.

158
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,830
Then, using the same method they used

159
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,630
to murder Emperor Xiaojing,

160
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,210
I'd deal with him

161
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,470
just like the others!

162
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,480
Secretariat Ma...

163
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,920
Why?

164
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,600
Who are you, really?

165
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,670
The golden mallet bestowed by His Majesty

166
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,720
didn't get to taste Tutu Wenzhen's blood.

167
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,240
Though that old eunuch is dead,

168
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,750
this still leaves me

169
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,130
like Duke Xiang of Song—defeated at Hong,

170
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,600
filled only with regret.

171
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,960
Stop desecrating
the "Spring and Autumn Annals" here!

172
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,010
Do you know

173
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,120
who delivered the screen

174
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,510
painted with
"The Lament of the Imperial Scandal"

175
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,260
to the Palace Secretariat?

176
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,000
It was me,

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,550
Tutu Wenzhen.

178
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,030
You're still alive?

179
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,600
This old life of mine

180
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,390
isn't worth saving.

181
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,150
What's truly regrettable is
that back then,

182
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,330
I helped your father

183
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,040
deliver the screen
to the Palace Secretariat,

184
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,000
yet it still didn't cure his madness.

185
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,750
What did you say?

186
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,680
Attendant Tutu,

187
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,750
you were my father's good friend.

188
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,210
Please help me.

189
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,320
It's not that I'm unwilling to help.

190
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,850
But everyone knows you're ill,

191
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,680
and I don't know

192
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,330
how best to help you.

193
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,360
I have just completed a new painting

194
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,150
of Emperor Xiaojing playing polo,

195
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,750
also titled
"The Lament of the Imperial Scandal."

196
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,490
It's exquisite.

197
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,550
Attendant Tutu, I only ask

198
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,150
that you help me
send it to the Palace Secretariat.

199
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,000
I believe

200
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,760
once His Majesty sees it,

201
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,030
he will surely be impressed by my talent.

202
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,670
Then,

203
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,080
there will be hope for my official career.

204
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,510
Fine.

205
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,750
For your father's sake,

206
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,830
I will help you.

207
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,750
According to
the Ministry of Personnel's records,

208
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,720
the court

209
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,410
no longer employed Guo Sigong

210
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,630
because he suffered from

211
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,790
severe delusions.

212
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,340
Especially after Guo Yu's death,

213
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,150
his condition worsened significantly.

214
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,810
Therefore,

215
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,050
Guo Yu's so-called eyewitness account

216
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,270
of Crown Prince Hong's murder

217
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,790
must be Guo Sigong's delusion.

218
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,580
Impossible!

219
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,550
I know!

220
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,590
Many street storytellers

221
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,270
often fabricate tales

222
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,840
about Crown Prince Hong's death,

223
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,320
bewitching the common people.

224
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,150
In their wild inventions,

225
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,910
Empress Wu Zetian becomes
the mastermind behind it all.

226
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,960
Some even dare

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,750
to slander Emperor Gaozong himself.

228
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,600
And we, the former officials
of the Eastern Palace,

229
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,800
become accomplices.

230
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,800
Do you know

231
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,150
that after His Highness died,

232
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,440
Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu Zetian
were extremely grief-stricken?

233
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,100
Otherwise,

234
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,270
why would they posthumously bestow
upon him the title Emperor Xiaojing

235
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,840
and have him buried with
the rites of an emperor

236
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,370
in the imperial mausoleum?

237
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,070
I heard Emperor Gaozong say
with my own ears

238
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,270
that Crown Prince Hong's death
was a loss to the nation

239
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,150
and that the empire lost a wise ruler

240
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,150
and a polo champion!

241
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,440
When Emperor Gaozong said this,

242
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,900
he was in tears.

243
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
This old man

244
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,440
still remembers it vividly to this day!

245
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,400
Impossible!

246
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,000
Impossible.

247
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,770
You will never convince me!

248
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,800
My father was the most

249
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,470
excellent man in this world!

250
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,120
If Crown Prince Hong hadn't

251
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,320
been murdered by you,

252
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,840
he could have at least become chancellor!

253
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,830
And I,

254
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,910
Guo Zigui,

255
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,470
wouldn't be like I am now—

256
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,440
skilled in both civil and military arts,

257
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,510
full of talent

258
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,310
yet unrecognized by anyone!

259
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,600
Wei Yan,

260
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,080
Tutu Wenzhen,

261
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,410
you are the murderers.

262
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,690
By Emperor Xiaojing's edict,

263
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,510
I hereby take your lives!

264
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,510
This was bestowed by His Majesty.

265
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,050
This was the treasure

266
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,140
granted to our Guo family
by Emperor Xiaojing himself!

267
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,150
I'll kill you!

268
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:18,910
No!

269
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,600
Stop!

270
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,090
Sheriff Wei.

271
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,840
It seems that Guo Zigui

272
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,480
also suffers from madness.

273
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,510
Although he has confessed his crimes,

274
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,370
this case

275
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,750
involves many high-ranking court officials

276
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,280
and still requires a joint trial
by the Three Judicial Offices!

277
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,350
There is no need

278
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,050
for a joint trial for such a madman!

279
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,840
[The Lament of the Imperial Scandal]

280
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,320
His Majesty has ordered
the Palace Secretariat

281
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,650
to destroy this screen.

282
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,670
I heard.

283
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,080
Xijun thinks

284
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,910
it's a great pity.

285
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,970
In terms of artistry alone,

286
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,730
this painting is on par with
Gu Kaizhi's work.

287
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,040
It would indeed be a shame to destroy it.

288
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,880
Fortunately,

289
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,670
Her Highness the Princess learned of this

290
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,870
and sent someone to request the screen.

291
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,200
What does Her Highness want it for?

292
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Her Highness said

293
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,960
she wishes to gaze upon the painting

294
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,670
to ease her longing for her elder brother.

295
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,360
When Emperor Xiaojing passed away,

296
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,720
Her Highness was only 10 years old.

297
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,840
It's said they had
a very close sibling relationship.

298
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,910
Whether this is an excuse or not,

299
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,150
at least

300
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,320
this treasured painting has been spared.

301
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,440
I just wonder

302
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,660
if this painting will survive
for thousands of years.

303
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,550
Who knows what will happen

304
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,110
thousands of years from now?

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,980
Yin,

309
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,910
is today's gastrodia powder ready?

310
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,390
I heard Your Majesty

311
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,840
was furious over
"The Lament of the Imperial Scandal" case.

312
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,950
This worried me

313
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,720
to the point of distraction,

314
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,960
and I forgot to prepare it.

315
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
This servant deserves death.

316
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,750
This servant will go make it right away.

317
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,390
No hurry.

318
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,750
Do you know...

319
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,730
I dreamed about you last night?

320
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,530

323
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,200
it wasn't in this lifetime.

No matter which lifetime,

I'm happy just to be
by Your Majesty's side.

I was no longer the Emperor,

but merely...

329
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,910
a clerk in a general store.

330
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,680
A clerk?

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,250
