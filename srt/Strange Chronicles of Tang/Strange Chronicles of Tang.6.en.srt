[Episode 6]

3
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,670
Easy with it,

4
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,240
or the dew will all end up on the ground.

5
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,080
Thank you for the advice,
Madam Master of Rain.

6
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,560
It's you?

7
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,110
After hearing what you said,
I asked around

8
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,000
and learned
that this is a lucrative business.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,660
So, I-I wanted to give it a try.

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,870
Madam, do you live near this place?

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,480
Yes.

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,080
Who do you live with?

13
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:31,710
My husband.

14
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,070
Why are you being so distant with me?

15
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,800
Since I came of age at 15,

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,680
I'd run into several scoundrels

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,509
every month.

18
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,120
You're a scholar.

19
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,960
Why are you behaving like them?

20
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,150
You're getting it wrong.

21
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,880
How could I possibly be like...

22
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:49,759
Previously,

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,250
to drive away

24
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,000
that punk Da for you,

25
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,120
I nearly lost my life.

26
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,350
Have you forgotten it?

27
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,570
Da craves money.

28
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,390
You didn't hire him, did you?

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,680
My husband and I are deeply in love.

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
Whatever your intentions are,

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,440
please stay away from me.

32
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,080
Got a finding?

33
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,630
What's going on?

34
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,079
Why is she giving you the cold shoulder?

35
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,990
Madam Master of Rain

36
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,640
is quite popular in town.

37
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,030
Isn't it just normal

38
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,160
that she ignores me?

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,190
Go get that piece of clothing

40
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,030
for me now.

41
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,400
I think it was hung there not long ago.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,730
Maybe it's related to the missing person.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,680
Yes.

44
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,260
This is Lai's robe.

45
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,150
I made it for him myself.

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,940
Where is he?

47
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,410
He...

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,800
hasn't been found yet.

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,260
Then...

50
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,000
where was this robe

51
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,960
discovered?

52
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,640
In the Ascension Forest.

53
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,630

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,360

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,930
He died out there,

58
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,310
and someone hung his robe

59
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,080
in the Ascension Forest.

60
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,930
That's not too bad.

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,780
Not too bad.

62
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,390
Officer,

63
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,300
please hang this robe

64
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,560
back on where it was.

65
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,120
So I won't be haunted by Lai's spirit

66
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,030
anymore.

67
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,190
You...

68
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,650
Early this morning,

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,840
I found Lai's robe

70
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,060
at this place.

71
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,540
It's been confirmed to be his by his wife.

72
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,910
You nearly lost your life

73
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,310
at this place yesterday.

74
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,290
Why would you dare come here again?

75
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,250
Where is Lu Lingfeng?

76
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Why the shouting?

77
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,160
Aren't I right here?

78
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:48,960
Exactly.

79
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,890
With you here, what do I have to fear?

80
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,840
I'd really like to know

81
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,840
what these Ghost Birds do at night

82
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,750
and what they feed on.

83
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,589
That's the spot, I think.

84
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,930
Right.

85
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,320
This is the spot.

86
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
Madam Master of Rain said

87
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,770
this red robe

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,930
was hanging right here when she saw it.

89
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,840
It seems this robe

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,190
is all we can count on to find clues.

91
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,560
Show me that turquoise

92
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,240
again.

93
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
The robe is made of ordinary fabric,

94
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,250
yet the knot button is premium turquoise.

95
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,690
Such a combination...

96
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,310
must be rare in the market, right?

97
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,070
Right.

98
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,390

from manager to shop owner.

195
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,720
Isn't it time to pay the difference
for the coffin?

196
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,240
It's crafted from cypress wood,
not mulberry.

197
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
So you need to pay me 500 extra coins.

198
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,440
Are you out of your mind?

199
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,500
Is that cypress coffin worth so much?

200
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,120
A cypress coffin

201
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,960
is certainly more expensive
than a mulberry one.

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,700
A cypress coffin

203
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,240
can deter evil spirits

204
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,730
and monsters

205
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,510
from the deceased.

206
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,350
That's right.

207
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,750
How brilliant of you.

208
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,940
Such a nice shop

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
of your nephew's is now

210
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,580
in your possession.

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
Yet you're haggling

212
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,530
with me for his coffin.

213
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,960
Is it even appropriate?

214
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,780
Butterfly,

215
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,300
give him the money.

216
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,960
Just leave, you awful man.

217
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,510
If you had paid up earlier,
I wouldn't have come at all.

218
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,080
Thanks.

219
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,810
So your nephew died?

220
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,920
Shancai died of a sudden illness.

221
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,240
There were witnesses.

222
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,710
Did I ask you about that?

223
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,220
He really died of a sudden illness.

224
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,240
He had no children.

225
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,150
As his uncle,

226
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,450
I had to step forward

227
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,550
to hold a funeral for him.

228
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,510
Then you conveniently took over his shop

229
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,720
as its new owner.

230
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,470
Let me ask you.

231
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,550
How much savings did your nephew have?

232
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,300
Less than 100,000 coins.

233
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,240
It sounds like you think

234
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,890
it's too little, don't you?

235
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,030
Dai!

236
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,150
Why did you kneel down?

237
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,150
I...

238
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,800
My legs suddenly went weak.

239
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,410
Have I told you to get up?

240
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
What's your name?

241
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,270
Butterfly.

242
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,390
How are you related to him?

243
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,120
Not in any way!

244
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,390
I'm Shancai's wife.

245
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,550
Then how could you
deny being related to him?

246
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,010
Isn't he Shancai's uncle?

247
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,680
Yes, he is.

248
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,350
Your husband is dead.

249
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,630
This shop should be yours.

250
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,690
Why is it his now?

251
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,630
It's not like that.

252
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,760
Uncle is just managing the shop for me.

253
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,240
He claims to be the shop owner.

254
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,750
Others consider him that way too.

255
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,080
Why don't you refute it?

256
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,510
I...

257
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,030
Mr. Dai.

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,700
Please tell us

259
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,240
how your nephew died.

260
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,250
I didn't kill him!

261
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,510
Then you must've murdered your husband.

262
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,710
I didn't do it either!

263
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,490
Are the two of you...

264
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,670
having an affair?

265
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,590
She seduced me!

266
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,000
You old bastard!

267
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,730
We agreed to never tell.

268
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:03,870
[Butterfly, Shancai's wife]

269
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,150
Yet you've confessed even before being

270
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,920
taken to court.

271
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,520
Bah!

272
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,450
You did seduce me!

273
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,150
You had thoughts about me and peeped at me

274
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,120
while I bathed.

275
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,720
How else could I have
successfully seduced you?

276
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,670
What kind of excuse is that?

277
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,960
I...

278
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,760
The two of you, stop bickering.

279
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,870
Just tell us how you killed Shancai.

280
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,240
Confess now.

281
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,920
Or you'll be put to torture.

282
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,960
Shancai...

283
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
had severe ulcers

284
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,820
on his back.

285
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,940
The doctor said he must avoid goose meat.

286
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,000
Actually,

287
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,660
he had never eaten goose meat,

288
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,240
so it was easy to fool him.

289
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,030
I just...

290
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,210
In fact, it was her idea!

291
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,360
What?

292
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,840
You ungrateful bastard!

293
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,970
I'm going to end you!

294
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,480
I'm telling the truth!

295
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,170
I...

296
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,720
I'm telling the truth!

297
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,510
-You're dead meat!
-Official Lu, this...

298
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,710
What's going on here?

299
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,150
Before Shancai died,

300
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,420
I decided to

301
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,000
to move all his valuable belongings

302
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
to my place,

303
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,110
since it'd be ominous

304
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,520
to do so after he died.

305
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,490
I meant to take this robe too.

306
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,730
At that time,

307
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,210
I dared not leave his home,

308
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,390
being worried
that his friends might visit him

309
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,520
and get him a doctor.

310
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,360
So,

311
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,700
I hired delivery service.

312
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,300
Delivery service?

313
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,650
Like a courier?

314
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,390
Yes.

315
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,250
Everything was delivered,

316
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,380
except for this robe.

317
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,470
Recently,

318
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,750
I've been wanting to confront them
about it.

319
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,210
Who provided the service?

320
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,570
The Flying General.

321
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,510
We often have them deliver
the expensive clothes

322
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,480
made in our shop.

323
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,790
Nothing had gone wrong before that.

324
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,980
Here's your statement.

325
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,590
Read it.

326
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,540
Sign it

327
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,190
if you find it correct.

328
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,250
Let me through!

329
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,840
Make way, please.

330
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,670
-Give me a hand.
-Let me through!

331
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,080
Sure.

332
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,570
Gentlemen,

333
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,670
here are the logs.

334
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,990
[Flying General]

335
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,750
This is it.

336
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,280
[Courier: Chen Shubao]

337
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,870
It was Chen Shubao who made

338
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,750
this delivery.

339
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,550
He has the name
of a fallen kingdom's ruler.

340
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,480
I knew he couldn't be a good person.

341
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,180
Mr. Kang,

342
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,320
you seem to have much knowledge
about the history and famous figures

343
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,610
of the Central Plains.

344
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,870
Though I'm Sogdian,

345
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,420
I've long been a Chang'an resident

346
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,480
and a Tang citizen.

347
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,950
Where is Chen Shubao?

348
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,090
Have him come over.

349
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,650
He no longer works here.

350
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,320
Then where does he live?

351
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,480
I don't know.

352
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,050
But you should.

353
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
You recruited him to deliver items,

354
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,790
yet you don't know where he lives.

355
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,080
How would that leave you

356
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,270
if he stole anything?

357
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,750
This person is somewhat unusual.

358
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,390
When he first came here...

359
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,810
My name is Chen Shubao.

360
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,870
Isn't it

361
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,000
a king's name?

362
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Where do you live?

363
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,220
Does it matter?

364
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,680
Of course it matters.

365
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,390
What if your purpose of working here

366
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,320
is to steal valuable items

367
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,910
that customers entrust to us for delivery?

368
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,110
I won't steal.

369
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,260
I'm a scholar.

370
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,620
And I'm a businessman.

371
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,400
Words are not enough to convince me.

372
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,200
I must know

373
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,730
where you live,

374
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,200
[Chen Shubao]

375
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,800
meet your family,

376
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,440
and inquire

377
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,120
about your character in the neighborhood

378
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,180
before hiring you.

379
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,740
That's too much trouble.

380
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,440
How about this?

381
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,510
I'll leave a deposit with you

382
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,370
as a guarantee that I won't steal.

383
