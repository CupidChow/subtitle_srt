[Strange Chronicles of Tang]

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,970
[Episode 5]

3
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,840
Come.

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,680
Wait a moment.

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,820
Yingtao.

6
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,560
Xijun.

7
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,039
It's not that I suspect Hero Restaurant.

8
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,100
Nor do I suspect the errand runner.

9
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,350
I had a close call today.

10
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,160
So it's better to be careful.

11
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,670
This is the right thing to do.

12
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,510
Around you and Lu Lingfeng,

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,230
we should

14
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,160
be extremely careful at all times.

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,740
But from this, we can deduce

16
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,479
that errand services for food

17
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,590
might not become popular anytime soon.

18
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,200
After all, in Chang'an,

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,680
since the beginning
of the errand business,

20
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,810
food items have never been delivered.

21
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,080
Today,

22
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,000
I paid the errand runner

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,200
double the usual fee,

24
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,960
so he agreed to take this order.

25
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:47,710
They're not poisoned.

26
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,840
You can eat them now.

27
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:50,560
Were you just

28
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,400
talking about the Xiuzhen District?

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,280
I heard it's a sacred place
for immortal cultivation.

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,009
I only visited there as a child.

31
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,400
Then let's go together.

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,009
Let's drink.

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
Come, come.

34
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,500
If all of you go,

35
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,590
who will look after the sushan shop?

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,790
-You.
-You.

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,400
Then tell me

38
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,510
how many days he's been missing.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,910
About half a month.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Be more specific.

41
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,710
17...

42
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,140
He left at night 17 days ago.

43
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,860
He hasn't returned since.

44
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,030
Oh, right.

45
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,579
My husband has

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,010
a birthmark on his neck.

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
It's quite large.

48
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,960
Looks like

49
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,829
a big black worm crawling there.

50
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,100
It's very recognizable.

51
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,630
Also,

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,329
because of this birthmark,

53
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,030
he gave himself a nickname,

54
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,270
called Lai Worm.

55
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,800
Why don't you describe Lai's appearance

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
to this lady?

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,250
Then she can draw his portrait for you.

58
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,800
Madam,

59
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,280
please come with me.

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,080
Ruiqiu.

61
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,750
This is...

62
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,890
I am Xin Zifang,

63
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,920
Magistrate of Chang'an County.

64
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,630
Greetings, Magistrate Xin.

65
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,870
[Xin Zifang,
Magistrate of Chang'an County]

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,750
I've long heard

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
that the Master of Rain
in the Xiuzhen District

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,310
is as beautiful as a celestial maiden,

69
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,310
and it's truly not an exaggeration.

70
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,060
If Cao Zijian had met you,

71
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,360
he might have discarded
his "Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River."

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,190
The phrase "graceful as a startled swan"

73
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,390
should have been a description for you.

74
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,630
You flatter me, Magistrate.

75
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,270
If there's nothing else,

76
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,680
I must go perform the rain prayer.

77
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,750
There is something.

78
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,950
Important business.

79
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,800
With such beauty,

80
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,750
why do you always
wear a mask when praying for rain?

81
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,750
Isn't that a pity?

82
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,130
I was wondering

83
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,780
if you could remove it.

84
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,280
This doesn't seem right.

85
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,400
Maestros of Rain

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,190
always wear a dragon-head mask

87
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,960
when officiating the prayer ceremony.

88
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,900
Otherwise,

89
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,800
the Dragon King might

90
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,190
refuse to grant an audience.

91
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,150
Then let's remove it

92
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,000
after the formal rain prayer ceremony.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,630
I've heard

94
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,360
you often lead everyone in dancing
on stage.

95
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,220
At that moment,

96
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,820
you can remove the mask.

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,470
Well...

98
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,400
Our Tang Empire is open-minded

99
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,260
and inclusive.

100
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,750
We needn't be bound by old traditions.

101
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,750
I believe, when you

102
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,750
remove your mask,

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,329
you will be very popular

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,120
and attract people from the east district,

105
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,190
especially the officials and nobles
from Wannian,

106
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,040
to come here.

107
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,930
District Head.

108
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,510
Yes?

109
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,630
I've heard that in your district,

110
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,240
there are increasing people
practicing immortality cultivation.

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,630
Yes.

112
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,480
I wouldn't dare to lie about this.

113
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,840
Nearly 1,000 people have come
to cultivate immortality here.

114
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,040
This place is called Xiuzhen District.

115
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,170
It's the best place

116
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,630
in the entire Chang'an
for immortality cultivation.

117
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,360
Only 1,000 people have come so far.

118
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,220
That's too few.

119
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,870
I believe

120
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,510
if Madam Master of Rain removes her mask,

121
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,720
it will attract more people

122
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,040
to the Xiuzhen District.

123
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,070
And you can take this opportunity
to promote

124
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,000
the reputation as a sacred place
for immortality cultivation.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,880
By then,

126
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,240
the visitors to the Xiuzhen District

127
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
and property values will surely...

128
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,830
That would be wonderful.

129
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,630
However,

130
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,680
Ruiqiu...

131
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,050
Madam Master of Rain's payment

132
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,990
will be doubled

133
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,620
and funded directly by Chang'an County.

134
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,870
Madam,

135
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,940
would that be acceptable?

136
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,800
I appreciate your high regard, Magistrate.

137
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
I am willing,

138
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,270
but

139
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,750
I have a wound on my forehead

140
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,680
and fear it might frighten people.

141
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,480
Who did this to you?

142
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I-I accidentally bumped it myself.

143
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,310
If I follow your suggestion

144
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,370
to remove the mask,

145
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,600
I'll need some time to fix my appearance

146
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,040
and start the rain ceremony later.

147
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,500
Would that be acceptable?

148
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,870
This young lady draws very well.

149
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,220
It looks exactly like my husband.

150
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,920
What's your husband's temperament like?

151
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,800
He...

152
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,620
[Lai Worm]

153
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,800
Honey,

154
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,000
where are you going now?

155
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,160
Honey.

156
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,400
Who do you think you are

157
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,830
to dare ask me where I'm going?

158
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,630
Lai.

159
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,730
Stop being idle all day

160
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,290
and beating your wife for no reason.

161
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:20,820
Besides,

162
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,830
who would give themselves

163
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,290
a nickname called "Worm"?

164
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,120
Isn't that because of you

165
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,360
giving birth to me
with this worm-shaped birthmark?

166
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,480
How can you blame me?

167
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,210
You old fool!

168
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,390
Had I been blessed with Pan An's looks,

169
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,840
would I be this idle?

170
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,240
If you'd made me as fierce as Lv Bu,

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,750
wouldn't I have become successful
long ago?

172
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,880
Would I still need to be called "Worm"?

173
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,190
You ungrateful son!

174
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,950
I'll teach you a lesson!

175
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,240
Get away!

176
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,950
Do you know what "Worm" means?

177
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,080
It can become tiger!

178
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,190
You two old fools,

179
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,850
if you dare to bother me again,

180
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,540
I'll eat you alive!

181
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,650
Get out of my way!

182
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,070
How can there be such an unfilial person
in this world?

183
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,260
If my husband hadn't gone missing,

184
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,920
I would never dare to speak ill of him

185
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,070
in front of others.

186
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,360
Officer,

187
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,430
please help me find him.

188
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,960
His father and mother

189
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,920
are still hoping for his return.

190
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,810
The rain prayer ceremony
is about to begin!

191
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,680
Do you have any more questions?

192
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,910
Does Lai have any close friends?

193
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,250
He has some questionable companions.

194
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,710
But close friends?

195
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,920
Not a single one.

196
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,270
He usually cheats and lies

197
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,560
and even steals from his friends.

198
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,120
And...

199
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,200
And he even harassed other men's wives.

200
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,990
Who would want

201
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,409
to be close to a person like him?

202
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,360
Alright.

203
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,810
We understand the situation now.

204
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,190
When will you be able to find him?

205
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:48,990
Go home first.

206
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,130
We'll notify you if there's any news.

207
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,800
If he's still alive,

208
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,420
and after you find him,

209
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,720
please don't tell him

210
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,750
that I told you about his misdeeds.

211
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,000
If he finds out,

212
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,070
I'll be dead for sure.

213
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,070
Also,

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,400
please don't punish him.

215
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,480
Why?

216
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,920
This Lai

217
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,270
is so despicable.

218
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,720
What's wrong with the district office

219
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,580
punishing him?

220
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,250
He was so disrespectful

221
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,490
to his own parents.

222
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,510
Doesn't he deserve punishment?

223
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,110
I fear that if he's punished,

224
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,310
after he returns,

225
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,860
he'll treat me even worse.

226
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,770
Besides,

227
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,190
he is still my husband after all.

228
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,430
I can't bear to see him beaten.

229
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,570
Alright.

230
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,220
You should go home now.

231
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm not going home.

232
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,090
I'm waiting to dance

233
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,440
with Madam Master of Rain.

234
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,650
There have been too many worries today.

235
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,510
This is the only moment
I can forget my sorrows.

236
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,320
Dragon King above,

237
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,190
I, Ruiqiu, Master of Rain
of the Xiuzhen District,

238
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,600
beg you to bestow rain upon us!

239
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,370
[Fair Winds and Gentle Rains]

240
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,240
Dragon King!

241
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,000
Please show your divine power!

242
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,930
I watched it yesterday.

243
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,300
The dance was quite interesting.

244
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,240
Xijun, come on.

245
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,790
Let's go learn to dance too.

246
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,730
Magistrate.

247
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,600
Magistrate.

248
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,440
Well,

249
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,800
why are you two looking at me?

250
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,070
Hurry and spread the news.

251
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:32,870
Tell everyone

252
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,550
that our Madam Master of Rain
in Chang'an County

253
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,030
is as beautiful as a celestial being,

254
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,270
and that her rain prayers
are most effective.

255
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,670
She might be a dragon princess
descended to earth.

256
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,390
That's why many people

257
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,590
have joined the Xiuzhen District
to pursue immortality.

258
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,690
Go now!

259
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,600
Official Lu.

260
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,440
Master.

261
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,510
Huan.

262
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,630
Look.

263
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,440
The people of Chang'an
are so happy together.

264
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
If the whole world

265
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,810
can be this harmonious and peaceful,

266
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,380
won't we achieve a golden age?

267
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,130
So that's what you're thinking, Master.

268
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,200
Can I join them

269
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,030
and learn to dance

270
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,690
for a while?

271
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,480
Go ahead.

272
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,000
And all of you.

273
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,000
Go dance too.

274
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:16,870
Yes.

275
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,200
It's so relaxing.

276
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,270
I've been hoping
for the rain prayer ceremony.

277
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,840
While I'm dancing
with Madam Master of Rain,

278
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,930
all my troubles have just disappeared.

279
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,720
Me too.

280
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,870
I live in the Xuanyang District,

281
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,550
but to dance with Madam Master of Rain,

282
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,150
I've decided to move
to the Xiuzhen District.

283
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,320
Dancing every day

284
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,240
relieves all woes.

285
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,100
How wonderful.

286
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,390
Small-minded.

287
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,200
Who exactly are you referring to?

288
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,260
You two, of course.

289
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,120
The place that can truly relieve woes

290
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,270
is indeed in the Xiuzhen District,

291
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,080
but not here.

292
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,200
If you two want to try it,

293
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,970
I can introduce you.

294
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,330
Look at his shabby appearance.

295
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,150
Let's ignore him.

296
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,550
You...

297
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,330
Magistrate.

298
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,930
Magistrate.

299
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,490
Just follow him

300
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,630
and see what he's up to.

301
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,270
The Rain Master's Dance
is quite interesting.

302
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,530
Why didn't you join in?

303
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,240
I'm a secret agent.

304
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,600
I need to earn my monthly salary

305
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,790
from Yongzhou Prefecture,

306
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,440
don't I?

307
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,590
Su Wuming.

308
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,360
You can dance,

309
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,610
but you can't make eyes at those women.

310
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,600
I don't.

311
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,440
D-Do I?

312
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,730
Try if you dare.

313
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,420
Who are you people?

314
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,160
Why are you taking me?

315
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,340
I am not someone to be messed with!

316
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,390
Let me go!

317
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,910
What are you doing?

318
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,910
Let go!

319
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,760
Why did you take off my clothes?

320
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,670
You can go now.

321
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,240
You've brought me

322
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,770
to this godforsaken place,

323
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,700
doing nothing.

324
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,630
And you want to drive me away?

325
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,160
Get lost!

326
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,670
I am

327
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,510
not someone

328
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,310
you can bully whenever you want!

329
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,760
One day,

330
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:45,960
I'll burn down

331
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,360
this damn place of yours!

332
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,660
What are you doing?

333
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,610
I am not someone to be messed with!

334
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,440
Kill!

335
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,830
You need to slow down.

336
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,630
Otherwise, all the dew
will fall to the ground.

337
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,240
Thank you for your guidance,
Madam Master of Rain.

338
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,600
It's you.
