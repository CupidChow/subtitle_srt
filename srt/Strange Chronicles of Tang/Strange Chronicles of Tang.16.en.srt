Can you tell me about it?

190
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,030
Strychnine—how is it used
as a medicine,

191
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,630
and what can make it a poison?

192
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,630
I'm very curious.

193
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,570
Gentlemen.

194
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,330
You two clearly look wealthy.

195
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,150
Our restaurant's Gulou Pastry

196
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,880
is the most famous in Chang'an.

197
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,500
Shall I serve one to you both?

198
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,820
What is a Gulou Pastry?

199
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,830
It's a delicacy from the west.

200
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,530
A large stuffed flatbread

201
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,800
with layers of lamb filling

202
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,030
spread evenly inside the bread,

203
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,540
sprinkled with pepper
and fermented beans between layers,

204
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,000
topped with sesame seeds,

205
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,090
brushed with ghee,

206
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,010
and then baked.

207
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,800
I see you're an expert.

208
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,770
Su,

209
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,090
I must apologize.

210
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,110
While in Hanzhou Prefecture,

211
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,110
I didn't treat you to this delicacy.

212
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,840
No matter.

213
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,670
It's not too late to try it in Chang'an.

214
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,300
Our shop

215
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,870
makes only 10 Gulou Pastries daily,

216
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,550
all reserved for officials and nobles.

217
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,540
But today one customer didn't show up,

218
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,600
so we have one left.

219
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,030
Shall I bring it for you both?

220
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,660
Hold on.

221
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,920
Let me ask first.

222
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,390
How much is one?

223
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,270
I'll give you a discount.

224
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,780
90 coins for one.

225
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,940
90 coins...

226
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,540
Ma,

227
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,250
perhaps we should come back another time.

228
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,800
Too expensive for you?

229
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,510
Lamb prices have gone up again.

230
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,630
One Gulou Pastry

231
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,850
requires over half a kilo of lamb.

232
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,480
The ghee and pepper

233
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,950
are not cheap either.

234
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,900
It's not about the price.

235
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,820
I'm just short on funds today.

236
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,060
Why invite guests if you can't afford it?

237
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,660
Come back!

238
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,150
That leftover Gulou Pastry of yours,

239
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,470
we don't want it.

240
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,710
Tomorrow,

241
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,700
make 10 fresh ones for me.

242
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,820
Extra pepper,

243
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,870
extra lamb.

244
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,870
Tomorrow?

245
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,420
What time will you come?

246
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,940
I'll prepare them in advance.

247
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,140
After they're ready,

248
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,420
deliver them directly
to Wannian County Office.

249
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,010
I'm treating it to
County Sheriff Su here.

250
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,270
County Sheriff?

251
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,870
I apologize for my rudeness earlier.

252
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,270
Ma,

253
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,070
please put your money away.

254
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,740
No need to get upset with him.

255
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,700
No,

256
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,820
I must order 10 Gulou Pastries.

257
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,220
I insist on treating you.

258
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:37,990
After all,

259
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,640
I've been consulting you.

260
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,390
Consider it my thanks.

261
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,180
But I can't eat that many.

262
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,840
Five of them, then.

263
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,230
You can share with your colleagues.

264
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,760
The other five,

265
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,110
deliver to Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

266
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,500
It'll be my treat to

267
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,430
Judicial Officer Lu Lingfeng.

268
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,660
These are all big shots.

269
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,620
Noted.

270
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,750
Su.

271
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,910
Strychnine.

272
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,330
You must be hungry.

273
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,840
Are you asking me?

274
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,420
Yes.

275
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,560
But I don't know you.

276
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,060
As long as I know you.

277
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,540
You can

278
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,270
have this.

279
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,490
It's the aroma of lamb,

280
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,020
and the fragrance of cheese.

281
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,580
Could it be Gulou Pastry?

282
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,630
You really know your food.

283
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,920
Take it.

284
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,570
It really is Gulou Pastry.

285
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,030
The victim was a beggar.

286
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,990
No one knows his name.

287
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,110
He died in a terrible way.

288
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,230
His body and limbs were put together,

289
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,390
bent into a bow shape.

290
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,150
It looks like he was poisoned
by strychnine.

291
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,540
I've sent someone to get Coroner Su Chan

292
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,670
to examine the body.

293
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,550
What is this?

294
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,630
It smells delicious.

295
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,560
It's similar to the Gulou Pastry
we had the other day.

296
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,580
You know what,

297
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,980
it really smells like it.

298
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:40,910
Mr. Su,

299
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,270
it's the delicacy

300
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
your friend had specially delivered

301
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,310
that day.
