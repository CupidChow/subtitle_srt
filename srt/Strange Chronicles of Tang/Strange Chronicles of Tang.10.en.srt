[Strange Chronicles of Tang]

00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,020
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,099
What's the happy occasion today?

4
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,200
To serve at Your Majesty's side

5
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,420
is my every day joy.

6
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,070
No, that's not it.

7
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,500
You've been frowning lately,

8
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,980
but you're smiling today.

9
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,840
Did something good happen?

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
Tell me, so I can be happy too.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,310
Nothing special.

12
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,590
It's just that...

13
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,370
I went to a place yesterday

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,000
called Relief-from-Woes Shop.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,270
You can share your woes

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,480
and all of it will vanish instantly.

17
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,270
There is such a place?

18
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,200
Yes.

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,210
I can only say

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,870
the only way to relieve your woes

21
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,000
is to visit the Relief-from-Woes Shop.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
Can you take me there?

23
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,229
Your Majesty.

24
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,590
This shop is in the remote area of
Xiuzhen District.

25
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,560
You can't go there, Your Majesty.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,310
Why not?

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,070
I also have troubles weighing on my heart

28
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,479
that I need to get off my chest.

29
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,710
All of us are witnesses to it
as your servants

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,039
and it pains our hearts,

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,600
but...

32
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,310
a place like the Relief-from-Woes Shop

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,870
is only suitable

34
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,400
for people like us to visit.

35
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,560
Your Majesty's safety

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,590
is the foundation of the Tang Empire.

37
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,000
We cannot risk any mishap.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,070
Besides, you need to exchange passwords

39
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,000
and wear a mask.

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,000
So...

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,880
So that sounds interesting.

42
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,310
Once I wear a mask,

43
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,770
no one will recognize who I am.

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,420
If you can't recognize me,

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,060
neither can those who wish to harm me.

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,740
Therefore, safety won't be an issue.

47
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,760
Here in Tang Empire's Chang'an,

48
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,590
peace reigns all too well.

49
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,440
That still won't do!

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,680
It's all my fault

51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,560
for speaking nonsense.

52
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,150
I deserve a beating!

53
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,310
He looks familiar.

54
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,630
I just can’t seem to recall it right away.

55
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,240
Isn't this Ruiqiu's husband,

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,060
Chen Qian?

57
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,310
No wonder he looked so familiar.

58
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,430
It is Chen Qian.

59
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,079
Who drew this?

60
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,150
It looks so much like him.

61
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,800
Ruiqiu,

62
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,680
the female Master of Rain?

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Yes, she's the Madam Master of Rain.

64
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,750
Where does she live?

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,520
Over there.

66
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,270
Anyone there?

67
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,960
Yongzhou Judicial Office here for a case!

68
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,030
Official Lu.

69
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,079
Magistrate Xin.

70
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,290
You're here for a case?

71
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,490
You'll have to wait.

72
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,430
What I'm currently discussing with Ruiqiu

73
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,470
is no small matter either.

74
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,079
It might even be more significant
than the case

75
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,410
you're investigating.

76
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,670
Ruiqiu,

77
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
to put it simply,

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,270
I want you to select

79
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,000
some beautiful woman who possess

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
natural grace and charm from

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,030
within the district.

82
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,520
Perhaps five, seven, or nine of them,

83
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,030
practice some dance routines together,

84
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,710
and perform in all districts of Chang'an.

85
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,590
We could name it

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Xiuzhen District's
Madam Master of Rain Dance Troupe.

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,210
This way,

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,870
we can attract more people,

89
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,750
especially the officials and nobles

90
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,870
from Wannian County.

91
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,730
Let's make them

92
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,910
buy houses here,

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,240
practice cultivation here,

94
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,280
and dine and wine here.

95
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,030
Then this desolate Xiuzhen District

96
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,960
will become prosperous, won't it?

97
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,120
As for your wages,

98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,660
it will be covered entirely by
Chang'an County.

99
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,260
Of course,

100
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,710
masks cannot be worn during performances.

101
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,470
This is very important.

102
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,200
Magistrate,

103
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,840
this won't work.

104
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,030
Why not?

105
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,680
I have given this careful thought.

106
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,990
I can make you

107
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,270
the most famous woman in Chang'an.

108
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,430
But I don't want

109
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,760
to be that kind of woman.

110
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,360
Well...

111
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,360
Ruiqiu,

112
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,510
why don't you give it another thought?

113
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,510
District Head Li,

114
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,120
back in that year of severe drought,

115
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,800
Chang'an saw only

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,130
a handful of rainfalls.

117
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,310
But Xiuzhen District

118
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,120
didn't receive a single drop of rain.

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
It was not long after my father's passing.

120
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,310
The neighbors all blamed me

121
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,800
because our Master of Rain family
had no male heir.

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,310
That's why I had to steel myself,

123
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,060
put on a mask,
and performed the rain prayer ritual.

124
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,990
Indeed, indeed.

125
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,360
That night, heavy rain fell in Chang'an,

126
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,920
and Xiuzhen District

127
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,070
received the most rainfall.

128
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,950
Otherwise, Chang'an

129
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,050
wouldn't have

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,850
a female Master of Rain, right?

131
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,040
The previous time,

132
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,510
when you asked me to remove my mask,

133
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,480
I already did.

134
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,750
But asking me to lead several women

135
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,080
and go out there dancing

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,820
is quite the challenge for me.

137
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,600
My husband is preparing for his exams.

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
I need to cook for him.

139
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Is your husband's name is Chen Qian?

140
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,720
Yes.

141
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,950
Come over here and look at this painting.

142
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,870
Is he this man?

143
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,550
Who painted this?

144
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
It looks a lot like him.

145
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,900
Where is he?

146
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,870
Where is he now?

147
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,890
He's sleeping inside.

148
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,680
Sleeping?

149
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,310
The Magistrate comes to your home,

150
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,920
and yet your husband is sleeping?

151
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,450
Isn't that inappropriate?

152
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,680
He studied all night

153
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
and is exhausted.

154
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,159
When the Magistrate arrived,

155
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,290
I wanted to wake him,

156
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,390
but the Magistrate said
it wasn't necessary.

157
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,190
That's right.

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,830
I came to discuss matters with Ruiqiu.

159
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,040
I don't care if her husband

160
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,170
is sleeping inside.

161
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,570
Isn't this how a gentleman should behave?

162
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,920
Of course.

163
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,360
That's how it should be.

164
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,750
The Magistrate is down-to-earth

165
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,480
and doesn't fuss about minor details.

166
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,750
I admire that.

167
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,700
Ruiqiu.

168
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,170
Let me ask you again.

169
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,260
Besides preparing for the exam,

170
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,870
does your husband
do anything else for a living?

171
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,680
He worked as a courier for a while.

172
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
I told him it was too exhausting,

173
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,140
so I persuaded him to quit.

174
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,670
Is he really sleeping inside?

175
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,240
If not,

176
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,950
Madam Master of Rain,

177
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,840
have you thought about
how to cover up your lie?

178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,680
The Magistrate is at my home.

179
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,080
How could I possibly lie?

180
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,920
Since you're so eager to see my husband,

181
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,830
please wait a moment.

182
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,890
I'll go wake him up.

183
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,810
Chen Shubao!

184
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,360
Didn't you meet a wealthy young lady

185
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,310
while delivering something

186
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,620
to Xuanyang District,

187
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,360
and planned to enjoy

188
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,760
a life of luxury with her?

189
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,630
What's your intention

190
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,480
of saying such things

191
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,540
in front of my wife?

192
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,120
I...

193
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
-Didn’t you say your wife…
-Shut up!

194
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,310
I'll admit

195
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,830
Ruiqiu and I had a disagreement.

196
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,430
I was upset

197
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,870
and said some things outside

198
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,130
that I shouldn't have.

199
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,040
But my wife and I have reconciled now.

200
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,160
Why are you stirring up trouble?

201
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,600
I...

202
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,310
Besides, my name isn't Chen Shubao.

203
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,630
That was just an alias.

204
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,070
After all, it's not dignified

205
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,240
for a scholar to work as a courier.

206
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,840
Su Wuming.

207
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,040
Do you recognize this clothing?

208
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,120
This clothing?

209
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,510
He was suddenly wearing a new outfit

210
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,240
when he returned the other day,

211
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,909
so I was very curious.

212
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,790
Where did you get this from?

213
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,750
I got it from a secondhand store.

214
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,430
How much?

215
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,580
A few dozen wen.

216
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,870
Just three days' worth of wages
as a courier.

217
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,600
My husband, you must be joking.

218
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,780
Just this turquoise knot button
on the collar

219
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,980
is worth far more than a few hundred wen.

220
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,880
That expensive?

221
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,680
I had suspected that

222
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,720
he had stolen it while delivering packages

223
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,450
for the Express Delivery Shop.

224
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,830
Yes.

225
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,000
My dear,

226
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,360
I've disgraced you.

227
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,750
I...

228
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,750
I'm so ashamed.

229
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,320
That day after our big fight,

230
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,240
I took

231
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,000
this clothing

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,320
and hung it in Ascension Forest.

233
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,030
I was afraid the shopkeeper
would report it

234
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,960
and catch us with the stolen goods.

235
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,720
But after a couple of days, I thought,

236
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,780
since my husband had already worn it,

237
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,430
hanging it there
would be like cursing him.

238
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,410
So I went back to Ascension Forest

239
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,470
and pulled it down.

240
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,680
But in my haste,

241
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,720
the most valuable turquoise knot button

242
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
came off.

243
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,120
I searched everywhere
but couldn't find it,

244
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
so I had to give up.

245
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,830
After that...

246
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,570
No way!

247
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,320
Xiuzhen District's Madam Master of Rain!

248
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,840
To see

249
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,480
your true face, Madam Master of Rain,

250
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,360
I purposely waited for you

251
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
to remove your mask after the performance.

252
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,510
So I recognize you.

253
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,880
You are?

254
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,000
I am the shopkeeper of
Lady Hong's Secondhand Store.

255
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,710
Today, I'm collecting old items
in the district.

256
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,000
[Mr. Zuo, Lady Hong's Secondhand Store]

257
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,910
Are you selling

258
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,870
this robe?

259
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,390
My husband was going to return

260
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,550
this piece of clothing.

261
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,870
I am the one who took it upon myself

262
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,270
and sold it as a used item.

263
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,320
If someone must be punished,

264
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,030
I'll take it on behalf of my husband.

265
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,000
If there's a fine,

266
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
we're willing to pay.

267
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,000
Official Lu.

268
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,630
That shopkeeper, Mr. Dai,

269
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,230
who murdered his own nephew,

270
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,340
has confessed?

271
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,200
He had confessed.

272
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,750
So this robe was stolen property
to begin with,

273
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,000
and was even worn by a dead man.

274
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,530
It's not worth much anyway.

275
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,690
As for you,

276
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,120
doing something like this

277
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,270
as a scholar

278
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,750
is completely unacceptable.

279
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,670
I, the Magistrate,

280
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,200
officially reprimand you.

281
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,750
Yes.

282
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,060
I acknowledge my mistake.

283
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,000
Official Lu,

284
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,870
I think we should let this matter go.

285
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,040
After all, it's not a serious offense.

286
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,840
Ruiqiu,

287
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,670
about what I discussed with you earlier,

288
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,130
please think it over carefully.

289
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:17,610
By then,

290
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,120
I will invite people
from Pingkang District

291
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,520
and the Persian Pavilion

292
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,840
and put on Chang'an's

293
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,570
most beautiful makeup for you.

294
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,870
That Chen Qian,

295
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,290
in terms of appearance,

296
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,750
does match Hu's description of

297
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,080
Chen Shubao perfectly.

298
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,520
But I still feel something's not right.

299
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Look at him,

300
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,370
there's no hint of slyness.

301
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,120
He doesn't seem like someone

302
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,520
who's been running errands
for half a year.

303
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,600
Chen Qian,

304
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,390
Ruiqiu's Rain Master's Dance

305
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,270
matters greatly

306
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,320
to Xiuzhen District and

307
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,360
all of Chang'an County.

308
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,030
You must persuade her

309
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,290
to accept my proposal.

310
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,200
In your day-to-day,

311
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,730
take good care of your wife.

312
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,630
Don't let her cook for you

313
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,970
or get injured again.

314
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,790
Look at her forehead.

315
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,760
I understand.

316
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,120
I've noted everything.

317
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,550
Please rest assured, Magistrate.

318
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,280
Official Lu,

319
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,840
I will take Chen Qian and Ruiqiu

320
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,570
back for further questioning.

321
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,390
Nonsense!

322
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,030
Don't you see Magistrate Xin is here?

323
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,360
Even if he weren't here,

324
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,760
you can't just arrest people
as you please.

325
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,870
Yes.

326
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,640
How I yearn for you,
yet you're in Chang'an.

327
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,630
Rumors say I'm ordered to guard
the garrisons in Gaolan.

328
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,000
Longcheng is far,
and the garrisons are cold.

329
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,530
Sorrows makes one thinner,

330
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,920
and the belt naturally becomes loose.

331
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,270
Chen Qian,

332
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,610
what were those last two lines again?

333
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I haven't read this poem, Sir.

334
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,240
Enough.

335
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,100
Such a vulgar poem,

336
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,400
yet you keep reciting it, Official Lu.

337
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,600
Ridiculous.

338
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,680
I do remember the last two lines though.

339
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,320
As I think of you who's not here now,

340
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,750
who will now embrace my waist?

341
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,090
It's a bit vulgar,

342
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,000
but still quite catchy.

343
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,440
Chen Qian,

344
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,970
where are you from?

345
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,110
My ancestral home is Xu County
in Yingchuan,

346
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
but I was born in Lantian, Yongzhou.

347
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,210
Magistrate.

348
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,210
W-Why don't you two chat first,

349
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,820
and we'll leave you alone.

350
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,200
Farewell.

351
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:44,790
Hu.

352
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,920
Officer.

353
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,120
You said yesterday that Chen Shubao

354
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,670
loves reading Collected Poems of Xu Ling.

355
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,320
Are you sure you didn't get it wrong?

356
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,120
Yes, I'm sure.

357
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,240
If you don't believe me,
ask our boss again.

358
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,640
I remember it was Xu Ling,

359
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,360
that poet from the Southern Dynasties.

360
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Are you certain

361
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,240
that man just now was Chen Shubao?

362
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,910
Yes.

363
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,170
I-I think so.

364
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,960
In front of his wife,

365
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,480
he acts like a decent person.

366
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,000
When he hangs out with us,

367
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,960
he's not nearly this proper.

368
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:16,990
All right.

369
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,740
Thank you for your trouble.

370
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,120
This...

371
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,630
The portrait took you all night.

372
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,830
This is extra payment from Official Lu.

373
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,970
Thank you, Officer.

374
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,850
Official Lu.

375
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,000
Just now...

376
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,090
Should I not have interrupted?

377
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,270
You did well.

378
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:36,970
Xue Huan,

379
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,210
take this portrait to Lantian

380
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,140
and investigate this Chen Qian.

381
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,550
Yes.

382
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,480
He often reads Collected Poems of Xu Ling,

383
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,790
yet he doesn't know Xu Ling's poems.

384
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,270
That's very suspicious.

385
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,850
Official Lu.

386
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,190
You're getting better and better at

387
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,480
tracking down clues these days.

388
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,770
That's because Xijun reminded me.

389
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,380
A skilled portrait artist

390
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,840
can observe and capture both

391
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,750
the form and spirit of

392
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,550
their subject in the shortest time

393
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,960
This man's appearance is right,
but his spirit is wrong,

394
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,490
isn't it?

395
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,430
It's just a feeling I had.

396
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,450
So it's because Xijun was

397
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,240
helping you secretly.

398
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,550
Yin.

399
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,480
I am the Emperor,

400
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,720
yet often I have no freedom.

401
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,550
In this palace,

402
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,800
there are few people I can truly trust.

403
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,360
Is something on your mind, Your Majesty?

404
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,820
Please feel free to ask me.

405
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,670
You're so clever.

406
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,840
I've heard

407
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,930
there's a good place in Xiuzhen District

408
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
called the Relief-from-Woes Shop.

409
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,550
I want to visit

410
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,760
but don't want too many people to know.

411
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
After all, bringing too many guards

412
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,380
would take away the goodness

413
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,230
from this good place.

414
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,400
But I'm not certain if this
Relief-from-Woes Shop

415
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,750
is safe.

416
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,320
Understood.

417
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,880
I, Yin, will scout ahead for Your Majesty.

418
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,080
The gastrodia powder brewed today

419
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,480
was especially fragrant and sweet.
