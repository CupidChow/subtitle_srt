[Episode 12]

3
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,150
"Plum blossoms are outside the window."

4
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,010
"They bloom in all four seasons."

5
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,789
You've been here before.

6
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,870
They can recognize you.

7
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,150
So all you need to do is go get

8
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,480
a golden mask yourself.

9
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,110
It's his first time here.

10
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,950
Today, only iron masks are left.

11
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,039
"A dappled steed
with iron coins arrayed comes."

12
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,370
"A gallant youth from Chang'an arrives."

13
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,150
When you're there,

14
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,950
a masked man

15
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,560
will quote Yang Jiong's poem,
"The Dappled Horse."

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,229
You need to respond
with a poem of Luo Binwang's.

17
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,039
But remember,

18
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,070
your response must share at least one word

19
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,470
with the poem he recites.

20
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,920
It doesn't sound like
exchanging code words,

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,520
but playing a drinking game.

22
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,680
But that's the rule.

23
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,310
"Beacon fires are a warning
at the frontier pass."

24
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,000
"Gallant roaming knights
cross the river fast to fight."

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,590
So you're an honored guest of the Master.

26
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a shame that there are limited places
for gold members.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,800
My apologies.

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,000
It's fine.

[Abode of Transcendence]

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,090
Now you can

31
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,900
turn over the wooden tablet
in front of you.

[Abode of Transcendence]

35
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,420
Almighty Master,

36
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,860
I'm suffering!

37
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,530
My husband has left me.

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,950
My shop is closed.

39
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,400
And my two sons,
who I raised with so much hardship,

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,030
have also deserted me.

41
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,410
Master,

42
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,460
this woman is truly hateful.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,530
I thought of divorcing her,

44
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,000
yet her paramour

45
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,530
is like a ferocious demon.

46
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,590
I don't mind putting my life at stake,

47
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,520
but I'd hate to endanger my family.

48
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,340
Perhaps I shouldn't have fallen in love.

49
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,040
Or maybe love doesn't exist in this world.

50
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,590
Almighty Master,

51
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,360
please tell me which path to take.

52
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,000
How tragic!

53
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:44,630
Tragic...

54
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,470
The one holding
the wooden tablet numbered four

55
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,070
may come forward to confess.

56
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,650
My surname is Fei, given name Qiao,
and courtesy name Yingjun.

57
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,810
I'm also known as the Chicken Master.

58
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,110
Years ago,

59
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,680
I was a handsome young man

60
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,360
with great ambitions.

61
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,260
At first, I wanted to save the world,

62
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,390
but peace and order
had long been restored.

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
So I resolved to save lives

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,850
and become

65
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,720
the best physician on this land.

66
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,720
Then, I started

67
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,630
learning from the old King of Medicine,
Sun Simiao,

68
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,890
as a close student of his.

69
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,040
The moment I completed all the training,

70
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,690
I was extremely excited

71
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,130
and highly ambitious.

72
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,600
I aspired to open a clinic

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,690
and make it the best in Chang'an,

74
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,920
where I would practice medicine.

75
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,720
[Abode of Transcendence]

76
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,680
I even planned to set up branches

77
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,950
in Luoyang,

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,320
Yangzhou,

79
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,920
Chengdu,

80
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,550
and every other prefecture.

81
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,310
Alas, I developed a passion for one thing—

82
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,160
alcohol.

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,630
Part of the blame was
on the overly hospitable Chang'an people.

84
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,500
When I cured a patient,

85
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,390
he or she would treat me to drinks.

86
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,390
This kept happening. Gradually...

87
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,650
I got addicted to alcohol.

88
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,680
Every time I woke up from a hangover,

89
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,510
my heart would be filled with regrets.

90
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,070
I did swear to quit drinking

91
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,830
several times.

92
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,510
But I just couldn't resist

93
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,780
delicious fine wine.

94
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,240
I spent 20 years in a drunken haze
in Chang'an,

95
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,430
idling away my time.

96
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,630
How miserable!

97
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,110
What?

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Don't you think that was miserable?

99
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,310
Master,

100
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,270
I was truly in misery!

101
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,560
Go on with the confession.

102
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,790
Fine.

103
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,700
I'll continue then.

104
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,310
Though I got in a drunken stupor

105
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,580
all the time,

106
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,430
my reputation for excellent medical skills

107
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,890
still spread far and wide.

108
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,800
Somehow I became the target

109
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,890
of an assassin group.

110
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,630
They kidnapped me,

111
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,290
confined me in a dark dungeon,

112
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,940
and forced me to join them.

113
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,920
I would rather die than cave in.

114
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,830
But it wasn't easy... to die.

115
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,750
After all, I was once

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,120
a handsome young man with great ambitions.

117
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,450
It would've been a shame

118
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,540
if I had just ended my life, right?

119
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,830
Later,

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
I became

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,920
one of them.

122
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,890
I developed poisons for the assassins

123
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,970
to kill people with.

124
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,960
Good heavens.

125
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,360
That must be

126
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,720
the biggest irony in the entire world.

127
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,120
I then came to realize

128
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,430
what feels worse than death.

129
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,950
Finally,

130
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,040
I found an opportunity

131
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,560
and escaped,

132
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,070
which resulted in the deaths
of many disciples

133
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,560
of the King of Medicine.

134
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,120
I still feel remorse till this day.

135
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,480
Thereafter,

136
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,750
I settled down in the dark Ghost Market,

137
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,920
dragging out

138
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,920
an ignoble existence.

139
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,980
Surprisingly,

140
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,270
in my declining years,

141
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,190
I met two talented young men,

142
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,000
a clever young lady,

143
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,460
a heroine from the martial world,

144
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,980
and a valiant youth.

145
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,690
Together we traveled south

146
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,710
and west,

147
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,360
crossing mountains and rivers
throughout the Tang Empire.

148
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,270
I was finally

149
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,950
given a chance to treat patients
and save lives again.

150
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,870
People called me Miracle Doctor Fei.

151
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,250
Patients regarded me as their father,

152
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,480
for giving them a second chance at life.

153
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,950
I was thrilled at those moments.

154
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,720
Unexpectedly,

155
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,770
as I'm back in Chang'an now,

156
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,600
that assassin group has targeted me

157
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,430
again.

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,730
If that terrible part of my life

159
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,680
is revealed,

160
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,120
what will my friends think of me?

161
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,030
It's terrifying.

162
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,030
I find it too horrible
to even contemplate.

163
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,080
How miserable!

164
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,810
The one
holding the wooden tablet numbered five

165
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
may come forward to confess.

166
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,440
I'd like to tell a story
about a princess, an assassin,

167
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,370
and a child.

168
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,200
The assassin tried every means
to approach the princess

169
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,460
with the purpose of killing the emperor.

170
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,690
The princess learned about it

171
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,510
and helped the emperor kill the assassin
by a trick.

172
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,960
She then discovered

173
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,080
she was pregnant

174
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,840
with the assassin's baby.

175
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,080
I don't know how the princess

176
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,610
struggled to make a choice.

177
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,150
But in the end,

178
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,270
she decided to have the baby.

179
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,640
Yet fearing the empress,

180
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,130
she couldn't acknowledge her son.

181
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,500
The child was kept and raised in a temple,

182
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,830
until his uncle took him away.

183
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,240
That was when

184
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,600
the child learned

185
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,270
that his father's family

186
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,260
was a prestigious clan

187
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,130
with a history of 500 years.

188
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,270
His family

189
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,120
had always upheld Confucian traditions.

190
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,830
They saw the then empress,

191
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,750
namely the princess's mother,

192
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,620
as their enemy.

193
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,530
The uncle taught the child to read

194
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,080
passed down the family lore to him,

195
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,760
and began teaching him martial arts.

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,790
He had the boy tutored
by renowned masters from everywhere

197
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,140
and told him
that he must avenge his father

198
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,910
when he finished studying.

199
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,480
Later,

200
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,940
the child arrived at the capital.

201
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,270
The former empress had passed away.

202
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,520
The only one alive and accountable
for his father's death was the princess,

203
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,240
who was also

204
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,580
his mother and next of kin—

205
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,040
from whose blood and flesh he was born.

206
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,150
The child was about to make

207
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,470
a tough choice.

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,730
But I believe,

209
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,300
enmity can always be dissolved

210
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,670
by a kind heart

211
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,190
and the devotion for the greater good.

212
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,960
Essentially, the princess and her son,

213
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,320
who she had with the assassin,

214
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,630
were no different
than any other mother and son

215
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,120
in the world.

216
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,150
Should they finally reconcile and return

217
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,390
to being a loving mother and dutiful son,

218
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,510
they would probably join hands

219
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,510
to usher the empire into a golden age,

220
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,010
and the pride of that 500-year-old family

221
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,760
would eventually merge

222
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,120
with the glory of the empire.

228

I determine the one bearing
the greatest suffering tonight is...

229
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,320

How is that right?

232
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
The story I told was someone else's,

233
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,110
which had a perfect ending.

234
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,960
Was there any suffering at all?

that this Demon of Woes
