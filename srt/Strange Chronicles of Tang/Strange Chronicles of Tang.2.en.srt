00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,270
Looking to rent?

192
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,030
This is a fine property.

193
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,020
Right!

194
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,320
If you want to rent a house,

195
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,670
Xiuzhen District

196
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,750
is just the place.

197
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,910
It feels a bit remote, sure—

198
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,960
but even if it's remote,

199
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,390
it's still in the northern part
of the city.

200
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,810
Better rent soon.

201
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,360
More and more people are coming

202
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,390
into the district
to cultivate immortality—

203
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,910
prices are about to go up.

204
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,720
Exactly.

205
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,730
I'm not here to rent.

206
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,850
May I ask you three ladies—

207
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,000
does the person

208
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,550
who lived here go by the name Xie You?

209
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,240
Oh, not a tenant—

210
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,150
you're looking for Scholar Xie.

211
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,080
He…

212
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,600
has already moved away.

213
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,530
Do you recall when exactly he left?

214
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,020
About 3 or 4 months ago.

215
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,730
Could you be more specific?

216
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,480
Young man,

217
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,770
there's no need to be so fierce.

218
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,500
Xue Huan.

219
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:45,600
[Yongzhou Prefecture
Command Authority]

220
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
This is an official investigation!

221
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,030
A blood letter pleading for help

222
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,150
was found in a robe sold

223
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,530
at a secondhand shop.

224
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,480
It may have been written

225
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,890
by this Scholar Xie.

226
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,600
Do you know

227
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
where he moved to?

228
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,360
A plea for help…

229
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,440
in blood?

230
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,150
Why—is something wrong?

231
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,960
Well…

232
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,600
we neighbors

233
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,120
find it hard to believe.

234
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,390
How could anything
have happened to him?

235
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,320
He was such a kind person.

236
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,070
Exactly.

237
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,150
He's a scholar of such standing,

238
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,510
yet not arrogant in the least.

239
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,120
Right,

240
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,670
he often helped us with chores

241
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,080
and even wrote poetry for me.

242
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,210
We often made him delicious meals too.

243
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,000
He was from Nanzhou Prefecture,

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,320
and had a fondness for mushrooms.

245
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,840
This year, for his birthday,

246
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,360
we made a special trip to Leyouyuan

247
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,130
to gather some

248
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,860
and prepare a soup just for him.

249
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,240
For his birthday?

250
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,210
It sounds like you were all

251
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,330
on very good terms.

252
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Hush now—

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,210

254
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,650
Sorry, my tongue runs away with me.

255
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,270
What are your names, please?

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,750

if you have any leads
regarding Scholar Xie,

263
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,850
report them
to the district office immediately.

264
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,280
Let's go.

265
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,850
Official Lu,

266
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,440
please have some tea.

267
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
District Head Li,

268
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,550
you recognize the Xie You

269
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,120
I mentioned earlier?

270
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,720
Of course—

271
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,720
how could I not know a candidate scholar

272
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,780
in my own district?

273
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,150
What if he places high one day?

274
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,000
Wouldn't it be too late

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,330
to get acquainted then?

276
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,690
That makes sense.

277
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,000
What kind of person was he?

278
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,090
A good man.

279
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,200
[Li Changgeng. Head of Xiuzhen District]

280
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,860
Otherwise,

281
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,130
why would they call him "Woe-Reliever"?

282
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,780
What does "Woe-Reliever" mean?

283
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,840
Well,

284
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,510
even though he was a tenant,

285
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,150
he was

286
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,200
warm-hearted

287
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,090
and loved helping others.

288
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,750
So the women

289
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,600
in the neighborhood

290
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,600
gave him that nickname.

291
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,090
The women in the neighborhood?

292
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,030
I met some today.

293
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,850
Scholar Xie

294
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,340
rented Manniang's house.

295
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,870
And—coincidentally—

296
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,870
all the neighbors

297
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,120
around that house

298
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,250
were widowed women.

299
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,600
Scholar Xie

300
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,200
often helped them write letters,

301
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,190
compose poems,

302
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,270
sometimes

303
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
even did heavy work for them.

304
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,390
But when it came to the dirtier,
tougher tasks,

305
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,250
the neighbors wouldn't let him
overexert himself.

306
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,880
So yes, you might say

307
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,820
he was a good man—to them.

308
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,590
But as for me…

309
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,840
What?

310
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,110
He wasn't respectful to you
as the district chief?

311
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,770
Oh, he was respectful enough—

312
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,120
but he made a fool of me

313
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,560
and left me in an awkward position.

314
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,630
Could you explain in detail?

315
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,720
Well,

316
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,230
he once asked me

317
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,730
to help him find a diviner,

318
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,150
to see if he might succeed

319
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,890
in the next year's exams.

320
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,120
So I brought him

321
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,910
the best diviner

322
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,150
west

323
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
of Zhuque Avenue.

324
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,510
The diviner told him
he would pass with flying colors.

325
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,840
He was so overjoyed

326
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,360
he practically danced on the spot

327
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,740
and arranged a feast

328
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,870
to thank me

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,320
and the diviner on his birthday.

330
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,870
hen he vanished—

331
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,030
cleared out without a word.

332
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,840
And that diviner

333
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,640
held me to the promise of a feast!

334
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
I was out of pocket

335
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,270
for the whole affair.

336
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,600
His birthday?

337
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,320
He moved away before his birthday?

338
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,310
That's right.

339
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,490

340
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,560
I heard it—

341
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,250
the timing doesn't match.

342
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
What's your move?

343
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,600
Take them in.

344
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,000

346
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,320
Quick, get me out

347
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,090
of this cage—

348
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,600
let me walk around a bit.

349
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,200
I was in the wrong yesterday,

350
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,210
but it's not that I didn't want to try—

351
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,770
I was just too tired.

352
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,310
Don't punish me anymore.

353
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,730
Let me out of the cage

354
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,100
and let me rest in bed
for a couple of days.

355
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,480
Once I've recovered my energy,

356
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,240
I promise I'll…

357
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,040
Promise what?

358
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,150
Promise to be good to her, is that it?

359
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,210
Then what about me?

360
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,440

364
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,140
Perfect—

365
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,630
please, I beg you, let me go.

366
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,240
I really can't take it anymore.

368
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,030
So you've been wanting
to leave all along,

369
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,200
and that's why
you wrote the plea in blood,

370
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,060
hoping someone would rescue you.

371
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:48,440
[Xie You, Scholar Candidate]

372
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,800
I'm just curious—

373
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,600
how exactly did you manage

374
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,200
to get that blood letter out?

375
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,000
Now that all three of us are here,

376
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,850
speak up.

377
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,670
Who helped you

378
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,840
deliver it?

379
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,230
Tell us,

380
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,480
