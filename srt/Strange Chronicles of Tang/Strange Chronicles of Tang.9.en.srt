[Episode 9]

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,330
The one holding
the wooden tablet numbered three

4
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,130
may come forward and confess.

00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,280
[Three]

6
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,230
You both have such difficult lives.

7
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:25,990
I originally thought

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,590
that being born into the martial world

9
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,000
meant my fate was that of a wanderer—

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,120
I should wield my sword freely

11
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,150
and ride through mountains and rivers.

12
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,410
Yet, I never expected,

13
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,039
through twists of fate,

14
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,020
to find the love of my life.

15
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,479
My beloved

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,640
is one of the greatest minds of this age.

17
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,340
Though

18
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,610
he is not very attentive toward me,

19
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,640
he's acceptable, I suppose.

20
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,280
Yet... Yet I too have sorrows.

21
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,840
My sorrow is this:

22
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,009
can he give me the home

23
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,950
I desire in my heart?

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,479
If he can,

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,320
could he please hurry up?

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,590
If this drags on much longer,

27
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,120
I'll be old before I know it!

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,790
To put it plainly,

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,630
I hope to break free

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,760
from

31
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,240
the shackles of this dreamlike Chang'an
and ride away

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,900
on horseback with my beloved.

33
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,680
Would he be willing to do so?

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,050
If so,

35
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,550
on what day

36
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,960
and in what year?

37
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,530
That's all.

38
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,790
I still haven't had it as hard as you two.

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,920
Thank you, Master.

40
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,160
I've come many times

41
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,590
and finally have gotten the chance
to confess.

42
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,310
I'm different from the others.

43
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,750
I shall begin my confession

44
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,750
with a story.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,080
Once upon a time,

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,630
there was a country

47
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,030
called the Huai Kingdom.

48
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,390
In this country lived a man named Xinba,

49
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,520
who prided himself on his talents.

50
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,710
After 10 years of arduous study,
he finally became a jinshi scholar

51
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,240
and was appointed to office
in the capital.

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,430
The capital was divided into

53
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,430
northern and southern prefectures.

54
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,680
Xinba served as prefect

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,630
of the south.

56
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,560
However, the northern prefecture
had superior conditions:

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,680
it was naturally endowed with
wealth and prosperity.

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,710
The southern prefecture was impoverished,

59
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,170
with no signs of vitality.

60
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,800
When Xinba first took office,

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,200
he worried day and night,

62
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,870
determined to revitalize
the southern prefecture.

63
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,840
He then performed his duties diligently,

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,970
worked tirelessly,

65
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,590
attended to every matter personally,

66
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,920
and fulfilled all his responsibilities!

67
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,840
However,

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,079
simply because the south was
less prosperous

69
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,590
and tax revenues fell short,

70
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,230
his superiors

71
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,310
turned a blind eye to his dedication

72
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,440
and criticized him for incompetence!

73
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,150
He treasured the common people,

74
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,030
yet not a single one of them

75
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,090
took him seriously as their prefect!

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,520
After two years,

77
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,430
Xinba was exhausted

78
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
and unable to sleep at night.

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,870
He often dreamed of
dying from overwork at his post,

80
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,310
with no one to mourn him!

81
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,120
Such suffering!

82
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,680
Indeed, suffering...

83
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:26,120
-Suffering indeed.
-Suffering indeed.

84
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,290
The one
holding the wooden tablet numbered five

85
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,990
may come forward to confess.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,920
Once you enter the palace,
it's as deep as the sea.

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,240
Guards!

88
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,750
Take Su Wuming

89
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,470
away

90
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,360
and beat him to death with clubs!

91
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,020
In the past,

92
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,900
there was a dynasty.

93
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,960
Behind a pillar in the court

94
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
stood an obscure little eunuch.

95
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,040
People say all eunuchs are treacherous,

96
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,390
that their incomplete bodies

97
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,750
make them wicked.

98
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,920
However,

99
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,800
history has seen many eunuchs
who were loyal and virtuous.

100
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,240
During the reign of Emperor He of Han,
there was Zheng Zhong,

101
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,300
who helped the emperor eliminate
the Dou consort clan,

102
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,360
ushering in a prosperous era
for the Han dynasty.

103
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,600
There was also Cai Lun,

104
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,630
who invented paper,

105
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,490
benefiting generations to come.

106
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,050
That little eunuch behind the pillar,

107
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,890
though starting from nothing,

108
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,600
was righteous

109
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,120
and had great ambition.

110
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
He wished to assist the Emperor

111
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,570
in creating a golden age

112
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,830
and to overturn the world's

113
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,540
prejudice against eunuchs!

114
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,450
However,

115
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,070
helping the Emperor

116
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,950
requires one who is wise, resolute,

117
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,190
decisive, and efficient—

118
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,590
one who acts when needed.

119
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,470
But instead, the Emperor

120
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,830
hesitated,

121
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,370
wavered,

122
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,830
and time and again

123
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,360
missed his opportunities!

124
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,720
This led to power slipping away.

125
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,020
Even his throne

126
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,630
was in jeopardy.

127
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,380
That eunuch,

128
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,240
though loyal, brave,

129
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,890
insightful, and strategically skilled...

130
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,830
had no chance to put his talents to use.

131
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,040
Instead, he suffered slander

132
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,480
and even

133
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,750
accusations of usurping power.

134
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,720
He faced the threat of execution
at any moment.

135
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,480
Tonight at the Confession Assembly,

136
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,890
five confessors

137
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,050
have all finished their confessions.

138
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,950
Master, please decide the final winner.

139
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,070
Tonight, the one
who bears the greatest suffering is...

140
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,720
Lady Flatbread.

141
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,270
Thus,

142
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,630
the Demon-Slaying Ritual

143
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,830
will be performed by Lady Flatbread.

exceeds that of the other confessors.

152
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,270
Therefore, the Master

153
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,320
has bestowed upon you the luck to slay

154

the Demon of Woes!

155

Step forward

156
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,320
and swing your sword to cut off its head!

157
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,410
It's the Demon of Woes,

158
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,810
a great evil!

161
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,320
stem from this demon!

162
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,670

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,010
By the time we reached
the Ascension Forest,

193
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,210
there was no one left!

194
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,390
The body was gone as well,

195
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,390
devoured by the Ghost Birds!

196
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,120
Only a few bone fragments remained.

197
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,270
Along with pieces of black

198
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,240
and red clothing!

199
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,170
So frightening!

200
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,560
What's frightening?

201
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,120
It's definitely not as terrifying

202
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,520
as what we've witnessed!

203
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,240
Official Lu,

204
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,670
you should gather the officers

205
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,870
and destroy the Relief-from-Woes Shop!

206
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,440
What?

207
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,440
Yingtao,

208
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,390
don't talk nonsense.

209
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,850
But the one they killed...

210
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,510
Can't you tell?

211
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,000
Of course, I can tell.

212
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,000
Official Lu,

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,800
tonight Yingtao and I were at...

214
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,630
W-Why is there
such a strong smell of medicine?

215
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,640
It's Mr. Fei.

216
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,490
Who is Uncle Fei treating?

217
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,130
He's not treating anyone.

218
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,650
He's treating himself.

219
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,500
Treating himself?

220
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,360
Replenishing blood isn't

221
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,220
something that happens quickly.

222
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,680
Xue Huan,

223
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,840
go get another blanket and cover him.

224
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,390
Keep him warm

225
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,810
so he can sleep longer.

226
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,490
Alright.

227
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,440
Yingtao.

228
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,780
You can go keep an eye on
that place later. Now go.

229
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,960
Xijun, you've worked hard.

230
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,120
Why don't you take a break?

231
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,630
No need.

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,020
In another hour,

233
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,670
I'll complete

234
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,070
Chen Shubao's portrait.

235
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,390
I'll get back to drawing now.

236
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,810
What Relief-from-Woes Shop?

237
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,360
It's nothing but a place to
trick people out of their money.

238
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,440
How did they manage to
swindle your gold coins?

239
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,040
Su Wuming,

240
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,510
you're not that old.

241
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,240
How did you become so muddle-headed

242
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,570
and let others fool you?

243
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,750
You think the Yongzhou Prefecture Office

244
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,950
is full of gold coins?

245
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,240
This is the first time

246
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
I've used gold coins

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,120
since I became Chief of Secret Agents!

248
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,910
What's more, this Relief-from-Woes Shop

249
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,390
is definitely not as simple as you said—

250
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,150
merely a place to fleece people.

251
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,530
There's something very strange about it.

252
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,870
How strange exactly?

253
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,840
Just their identities—

254
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,390
some of those

255
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,600
who come seeking relief

256
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,720
are

257
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,440
beyond imagination.

258
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,780
Oh, right.

259
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,030
This shop opens once every three days.

260
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,630
Why don't we go together next time?

261
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,480
I have a feeling

262
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,120
that the word "Relief-from-Woes"

263
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,150
on that blood letter

264
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,550
refers to the Relief-from-Woes Shop.

265
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,080
It was just never finished.

266
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,100
If what you say is true,

267
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,360
then the Relief-from-Woes Shop

268
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,620
may indeed have caused multiple deaths.

269
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,480
But when the office made its circuit
to Xiuzhen District,

270
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,340
the only report

271
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,580
came from Lai, who is now missing.

272
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,120
No...

273
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,550
No, you...

274
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,330
W-What do you people want now?

275
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,470
Murder for money, is that it?

276
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,840
I'm telling you,

277
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,420
I'll yell for help!

278
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
I'll report you to the authorities!

279
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,630
Don't you know

280
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,440
he is with the authorities?

281
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,000
Still, you can't break into
private residences

282
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,930
and kill people!

283
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,320
You scammed us out of our gold coins,

284
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,960
and now you're acting innocent?

285
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,290
When did I ever scam you?

286
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,910
You paid for

287
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,480
the gold memberships willingly!

288
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,320
One gold coin

289
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,200
for two spots.

290
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,610
I'm the one losing out here!

291
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,760
Let me ask you,

292
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,960
what exactly did you say at the time?

293
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,600
What do you mean?

294
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,550
Gold membership spots

295
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,570
are limited.

296
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,480
According to the rules,

297
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,390
only those who have paid for 100 visits

298
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,190
qualify to compete for one spot.

299
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,920
But I have some connections,

300
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,170
so I can

301
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,320
use worldly possessions—

302
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,840
like gold and silver—

303
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,210
to help those who want to vent publicly

304
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,600
and unburden their hearts

305
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,800
become gold members.

306
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,550
I didn't say anything wrong!

307
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,210
I never said

308
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,510
that becoming a gold member

309
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,510
guaranteed you a chance to confess!

310
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,570
Quibbling!

311
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,430
I'll cut out your tongue! Try me!

312
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:16,910
I...

313
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,200
Come on, come on, come on!

314
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,650
Go ahead, cut it. Cut it!

315
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,750
If you cut out my tongue,

316
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,840
I'll write a blood letter!

317
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,600
I'll go report you to the Emperor!

318
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,440
You've written a blood letter before?

319
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,240
Well, no.

320
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,460
That would hurt terribly.

321
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,390
Yingtao.

322
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,330
I just remembered.

323
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,840
He really didn't guarantee

324
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,560
that everyone would have a chance
to confess.

325
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,390
What?

326
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,960
Su Wuming, you...

327
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,550
You know what?

328
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,440
You're actually quite reasonable.

329
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,440
A gentleman desires wealth
but acquires it properly.

330
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,060
You've tricked me twice already.

331
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,390
But I admit you got me fair and square.

332
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,480
You're becoming more and more reasonable.

333
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,030
I almost want to be friends with you.

334
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,760
That's exactly why I came—
to be friends with you.

335
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,550
Last night, I didn't get a chance
to confess,

336
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,910
and I couldn't sleep at all
after I went home.

337
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,440
So,

338
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,870
I want to go there again.

339
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,030
Sure.

340
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,630
Gold members

341
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,320
enjoy this privilege for life.

342
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,120
I want to...

343
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,360
bring more people with me.

344
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,520
They all want gold memberships?

345
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,120
One gold coin

346
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,240
for each spot.

347
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,610
You're not being much of a friend.

348
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,270
Officer,

349
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,870
friendship is one thing;

350
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,360
business is another.

351
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,320
But I, Sheng, value loyalty above all.

352
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,180
How about this?

353
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,670
One gold coin

354
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,950
for two spots.

355
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,980
How's that?

356
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,910
You're forcing my hand here.

357
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,550
I...

358
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,630
Yingtao,

359
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,700
I'll leave this man to you.

360
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,970
Dump the body

361
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,080
in Ascension Forest after dark.

362
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,780
The body...

363
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,700
Hold on!

364
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,069
Fine! You win!

365
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,790
I'll do as you say!

366
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,400
Happy now?
