00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,260
Under the flames,
speak your true thoughts.

5
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,289
All present today
shall be sincere inside and out.

6
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,400
Let lips speak and hearts dance
to dispel the eternal night.

7
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,940
I'm an 80-year-old man.

8
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,990
I've served 4 dynasties
with unwavering loyalty.

9
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,860
Yet I was framed

10
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,870
and nearly lost my life in prison!

11
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,789
In my youth,

12
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,350
I was once

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,070
the top courtesan
in the Pingkang District.

14
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,680
When I got married,

15
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,400
I had half a chest of gold and silver

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,759
and countless jewels.

17
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,430
But I gave my life to the wrong person

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,310
and ended up all alone.

19
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,810
I should never have become a merchant.

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,150
I was never destined to make money.

21
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,759
Despite my vast knowledge,

22
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,560
I never found someone
who recognized my talents.

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,220
I am like a diamond in the rough

24
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,830
with no one to unearth me!

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,400
What's the use

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,540
of writing good poems?

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,980
In all 110 districts of Chang'an,

28
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,720
only vulgar verses are popular!

29
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,960
I was wrong to marry so young.

30
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,910
And being born this beautiful

31
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,300
was my fatal flaw.

32
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,260
The phrase "to make fish sink
and birds alight with one's beauty"

33
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,520
was totally made for me.

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,710
How could people say it refers to
the 2 beauties, Xi Shi and Zhaojun?

35
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,360
How tragic.

36
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,430
Tragic.

37
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,230
Fortune has always smiled on me.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,810
Throughout my life,

39
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,970
I've always met benefactors.

40
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,640
All I've said

41
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,440
are merely my speculations.

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,190
But Your Majesty, your safety

43
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,080
is tied to the fate of the Tang Empire.

44
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,950
Therefore, I humbly beg you

45
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,480
to cancel this journey.

46
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,329
If it is ultimately proven

47
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,360
that I have been seeing shadows,

48
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,430
I'll willingly accept punishment
for deceiving the emperor.

49
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,120
Enough.

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,750
I have indeed heard

51
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,480
of the assassin group called Crimson Pact.

52
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,990
Since it's for my safety,

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,250
what crime have you committed?

54

However,

55
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,170
my heart has been troubled for many days.

56
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,760
How should I express it?

57
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,380
Your Majesty, you can speak here,

58
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,650
and let Official Lu relay your words.

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,570
I've spoken out of turn.

60
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,790
That's not a bad idea.

61
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,860
I'll share a story,

62
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,280
a story of a distant kingdom.

63
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,530
There was a prince

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,940
of little importance.

65
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,990
I say this

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,280
because he had many brothers

67
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,279
and even more cousins.

68
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,750
[Benign Governance with Ease]

69
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,750
His powerful grandmother

70
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,810
ruled the kingdom.

71
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,440
His grandmother despised his father,

72
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,960
so the prince's childhood

73
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,200
was spent confined in the deep palace.

74
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,000
His mother was falsely accused

75
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,640
of casting evil Gu spells
and was executed.

76
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,630
The prince didn't even know

77
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,830
where his mother was buried.

78
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,090
After his grandmother abdicated,

79
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,310
his uncle became king.

80
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,970
But the power

81
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,830
fell into the hands of his aunt-in-law

82
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,090
and his female cousin.

83
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,630
Courtiers flattered shamelessly,

84
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,600
while the court sold official positions.

85
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,990
The court was in chaos.

86
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,590
The prince coldly observed everything

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,410
until his aunt found him.

88
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,920
Later,

89
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,360
some said he was bold and determined,

90
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,560
with great ambition.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,840
But that was just hindsight wisdom.

92
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,630
I enjoy riding and archery,

93
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,960
but I love musical instruments even more.

94
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,810
If I were to speak my true aspiration,

95
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,160
I would want to become

96
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,820
the best musician in the world

97
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,840
to spend afternoons by the lake,

98
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,450
following my own rhythm

99
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,090
to gently strike the jiegu drum,

100
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,430
watching the sun slowly set,

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,260
and living out my days.

102
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,200
That was my greatest desire.

103
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,070
However,

104
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,510
fate

105
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,010
pushed me

106
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,440
into the eye of the storm.

107
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,140
On the night of Tanglong,

108
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,630
before giving the order
for the final battle,

109
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,250
I was trembling all over.

110
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,270
I could feel my heart pounding violently,

111
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,330
as if it would burst through my chest.

112
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,270
At that moment, I knew

113
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,580
once the arrow was released,

114
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,530
there would be no turning back.

115
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,400
After the great battle,

116
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,000
the prince was named heir to the throne

117
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,830
and became king 2 years later.

118
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,830
But the real power

119
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,190
remained in his aunt's hands.

120
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,920
She was the one

121
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,810
who loved me most in my childhood,

122
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,000
or rather,

123
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,450
the only elder who ever showed me warmth.

124
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,010
I could respect her

125
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,490
and even follow her guidance.

126
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,820
But now I am the Emperor.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,330
I can't be manipulated.

128
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,470
The Tang Empire must enter a golden age.

129
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,430
For this,

130
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,830
in the court,

131
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,240
I have to have absolute authority!

132
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,870
The prince never cared about power,

133
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,120
yet was pushed onto the throne.

134
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,620
He had few followers,

135
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,070
while his aunt

136
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,480
was surrounded
by civil and military officials.

137
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,360
The blame lies only in

138
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,680
my misfortune of being born
into the imperial family.

139
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,160
The court gained

140
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,120
a puppet emperor full of ambition

141

but with no way

142
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,270
to realize it.

143
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,480
Meanwhile, the music world

144
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,600

a uniquely gifted musical genius.

146
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,070
Life is truly a sea of suffering.

147
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,159
And on each step,

148
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,240
there is suffering unique to that step.

149
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,170
I struggle to reach the shore,

150
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,920
but the shore

151
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,950
grows ever more distant.

152

The former prince

153
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,800
struggled to swim out of
the sea of suffering,

154
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,920
yet he drifted further from shore.

155
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,120

Slay the Ultimate Evil!

192
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,520
Everyone, calm down!

193
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,280
We've been deceived.

194
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,360
Look carefully.

195
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,600
He is clearly human!

196
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,570
That so-called Master

197
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,550
tricked us into killing a man.

198
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,840
He's the real evil!

199
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,890
I really am human.

200
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,360
My name is Fei Qiao,
courtesy name Yingjun,

201
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,870
also known as the Chicken Master.

202
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,320
And

203
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,200
the Princess even appointed me

204
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,860
as the Chicken Master of Tang.

205
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,480
What's going on here?

206
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,810
-You're lying!
-No way!

207
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Listen to Master.

208
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,350
Kill him!

209
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,550
-Kill!
-Kill!

210
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,240
Come with me!

211
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,970
Quick, take cover.

212
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,680
Be careful then.

213
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,890
Don't mind the old man.

214
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,380
Kill the young one!

215
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,700
Grand General!

216
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,920
You've arrived just in time.

217
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,480
Thanks to Xijun for drawing the map—

218
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,340
this place was truly hard to find.

219
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,870
Protect Fei!

220
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,930
-Yes!
-Yes!

221
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,000
District Head?

222
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,790
Li Changgeng!

223
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,350
Where do you think you're going?

224
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,410
Light the fire!

225
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,380
These Ghost Birds fear fire the most.

226
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,980
Burn them with fire!

227
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:09,750
Yes!

228
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,730
Take off your mask now!

229
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,670
If I'm not mistaken,

230
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,140
the so-called Master's voice

231
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,320
was yours, wasn't it?

232
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,210
To produce

233
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,200
such an old and strange voice,

234
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,490
I'm curious

235
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,550
about what kind of face you have.

236
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,390
Ascension Forest.

237
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,870
I never thought

238
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,360
this place where I grew up

239
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,520
would be my final destination.

240
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,790
Chen Qian.

241
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,030
With your ancestral home
in Xu County, Yingchuan,

242
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,720
you were born in Lantian, Yongzhou.

243
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,920
That's not you, is it?

244
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,440
Of course not.

245
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,120
The day when I couldn't respond to

246
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,240
your Southern Dynasty love poems,

247
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,080
I knew I had given myself away.

248
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,870
I planned to leave Chang'an after tonight.

249
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,730
Unexpectedly,

250
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,670
you came here.

251
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Shouldn't it be the Emperor of Tang?

252
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,800
His Majesty is wise.

253
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,960
How could he fall for your schemes?

254
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,760
Something went wrong after all.

255
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,090
But where was the mistake?

256
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,480
You...

257
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,600
You're the new leader of the Crimson Pact?

258
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,960
You old man.

259
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,840
I saw you when I was a child.

260
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,970
I found you amusing;

261
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,270
otherwise, I wouldn't have let you

262
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,210
live until today

263
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,330
to play the role of the Ultimate Evil.

264
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,190
What a pity.

265
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,120
I was still too arrogant.

266
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,480
But don't be too pleased with yourself.

267
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,410
The next leader of the Crimson Pact

268
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,720
will come for you.

269
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,710
So you've tacitly admitted it—

270
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,400
you are the leader of the Crimson Pact.

271
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Tacitly admit it?

272
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,720
I openly acknowledge it.

273
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,870
Don't think that after I die,

274
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,730
the Crimson Pact will disappear.

275
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,120
Just like after Beacon Fire

276
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,380
and Silent Ember died,

277
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,270
others would naturally replace them

278
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,600
to become
the new Nine of the Crimson Pact.

279
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,480
The same applies to the leader.

280
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,240
As long as there's no Crimson Decree

281
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,910
after 3 years in the martial world,

282
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,670
the Nine will elect

283
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
a new leader.

284
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,450
You're so young,

285
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,400
yet fearless in the face of danger.

286
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,160
I deeply admire you.

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,829
But there's one thing I don't understand,

288
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,300
and I wish to ask in person.

289
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,430
This Relief-from-Woes Assembly began

290
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,339
2 months ago,

291
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,240
which took considerable effort,

292
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,160
yet sought no gold or silver.

293
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,960
It was all for today's situation,
wasn't it?

294
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,400
You're a clever person.

295
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,110
I admit it.

296
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,590
Everything about the Relief-from-Woes Shop

297
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,870
was my scheme

298
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,970
and had nothing to do with others.

299
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,350
Since you plotted against His Majesty,

300
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,880
who instructed you to do so?

301
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,820
Or rather,

302
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,560
who hired the Crimson Pact
for assassination?

303
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:50,880
Well,

304
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,270
I can't say.

305
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,460
After all, this is the rule of assassins.

306
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,480
But you kill

307
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,810
in the name of exorcism.

308
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,750
What kind of rule is that?

309
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,550
All those who died

310
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,240
in the Relief-from-Woes Shop

311
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,480
over these 2 months were evil people.

312
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,720
Some harmed their husbands,

313
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,960
some abused their wives,

314
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,350
some beat and cursed their parents,

315
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,550
some poisoned others,

316
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,070
or some trafficked children.

317
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,510
All deserved to die.

318
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,150
Therefore, after they died,

319
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,770
no one would report it to the authorities.

320
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Isn't that right?

321
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,270
Except for today's traitor.

322
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,400
Everyone,

323
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,530
I must take my leave.

324
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,110
If fate allows us to meet again
in the next life,

325
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,240
remember me.

326
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,420
Stop him!
