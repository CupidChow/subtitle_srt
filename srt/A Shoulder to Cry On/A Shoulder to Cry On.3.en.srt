00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,300
(A Shoulder to Cry On)

2
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:05,648
Episode 3. Gym equipment warehouse

3
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,862
What the heck!

4
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,283
Hey, is anybody out there?

5
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,494
Jeez, are we locked in here?

6
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,101
Hello.

7
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,491
Stop it. I bet Jang
Won-kyung did this.

8
00:01:56,788 --> 00:01:57,914
It might've been someone else.

9
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,204
Nobody except him would do
this kind of prank at our school.

10
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,332
I didn't bring my phone.

11
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,317
Same here.

12
00:02:06,482 --> 00:02:08,794
If we don't show up in
class, somebody will come to find us.

13
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,706
It can't be…

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,361
What can't be?

15
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,390
Listen, is anyone there?

16
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:26,896
Hey, gosh, you're being loud.
Stop making a scene and sit here.

17
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,451
Dang, this is ridiculous.

18
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:46,082
How can you make jokes
in such a bad situation?

19
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:49,299
Why not? It's fun.

20
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,008
You really seem like you
have Bipolar disorder sometimes...

21
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,762
Bipolar disorder? That's absurd. I'm
just happy to have an excuse to skip class.

22
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,474
An excuse to skip?

23
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:09,355
It's clear we didn't lock ourselves in here.
I'm sure other teachers can't blame us.

24
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:37,133
I don't know about Cho Tae-hyun.

25
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,972
Whether he is a good guy.

26
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:50,654
Or a bad guy.

27
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:56,694
It's obvious that I don't
know anything about him.

28
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:08,888
Although I have so many questions in mind,
all I can ask him is...

29
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,458
Look!

30
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:23,304
Are you dating Jang Won-kyung?

31
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,931
Pardon?

32
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,854
The two of you in
school infirmary before...

33
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,630
Do you really want to know?

34
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,944
Cho Tae(-hyun)!

35
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,417
Guess what this is!

36
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:47,390
A mosquito bite?

37
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:53,751
A hickey!
I finally had sex for the first time.

38
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,339
Don't kid. You don’t
know what a real hickey is.

39
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,303
I'm not bluffing. Guess who?

40
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,347
You will be shocked when hear who it was.

41
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,524
What if we get caught by a school nurse?

42
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,401
Shh. Shut up.

43
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,246
Nice. Nobody is here.

44
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,166
Did you freak out?

45
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:40,494
I won't get in trouble.

46
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:44,635
If I get caught, I can make an excuse
like being bitten by a huge mosquito.

47
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:52,352
Let me show you for real.

48
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,021
What a lunatic!

49
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,025
Stop tickling me.

50
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,363
We are in school infirmary, you crazy brat.

51
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,781
Stay still.

52
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,200
Don't do it on a visible part of my body!

53
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:12,663
Are you curious?

54
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:18,969
I thought you didn't care about
anything other than archery.

55
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:30,139
Can I show you?
How to make a hickey?

56
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:51,910
Hey.

57
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:56,966
Why did you stay still?

58
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:03,671
Hey!
Why aren't you avoiding me?

59
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:11,597
- You... by any chance... like men...
- What are you talking about?

60
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:16,433
How long were you locked up? For 1 hour?

61
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:17,113
Yes.

62
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:22,498
Can I count on you? You didn't make trouble
like before in the school infirmary?

63
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:27,587
Oh my, sir.
Have I ever lied and skipped class?

64
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:29,020
Please trust me.

65
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:33,179
Anyways, he seems nice,
so I get along well with him these days.

66
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:37,349
Do you? You have no clue who did it?

67
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,628
No. We were shut in while organizing stuff.

68
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:47,289
He smelled nice at that moment.

69
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:48,732
Lee Da-yeol.

70
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:54,822
Lee Da-yeol! Why are you blushing?
Are you feeling off?

71
00:07:56,301 --> 00:08:02,640
No, it was too hot in storage just now.

72
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:09,113
Okay. In any case, I'm glad nothing
terrible happened to the two of you there.

73
00:08:09,403 --> 00:08:10,821
- Right?
- Yes.

74
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,036
What's the matter with me?

75
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,290
I got it. Get going.

76
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,541
Thank you.

77
00:08:32,393 --> 00:08:35,021
If it wasn't for the janitor,
we wouldn't out of the storage.

78
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,391
Tell me about it.

79
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,426
By the way, do you use perfume?

80
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,234
No! Why?

81
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,611
Just wondering.

82
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,994
- You've done good work.
- Thank you.

83
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,162
See you.

84
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:05,044
(Lee Da-yeol)

85
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,761
I'm home.

86
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,137
Are you home, my son?

87
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:19,180
What's that smell?

88
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:21,539
What's wrong, does my foot smell bad?

89
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:23,515
No, not yours.

90
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:30,084
Aha, I'm boiling Kimchi stew right now.
Do you want some?

91
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,729
No, I'm not hungry.

92
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:47,712
Are you sure?

93
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,630
Yes, I'm sure I'm not hungry!

94
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,642
Let me show you.

95
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,940
Why aren't you avoiding me?

96
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,118
Should I eat all alone?

97
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,953
Gosh! Dad!

98
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,655
Phew, got it, got it.

99
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,073
I'm heading out!

100
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:12,001
Da-yeol, shall we go somewhere?

101
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,007
Good morning, Da-yeol.
You look so great today.

102
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,888
There's a smell in the air, is it lavender?

103
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:23,648
Where do you want to go?
We're almost at school.

104
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,048
There is a popular place nearby. If we get
there too late, everything will be sold out.

105
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,368
Da-yeol, can you even eat food
like that if you're an athlete?

106
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:34,443
No, archers don't have that kind
of restriction, but going right now?

107
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:37,785
Join us, okay?

108
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,243
Let us go.

109
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:51,627
It's weird, this one seems
even tastier in the morning.

110
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:55,485
The stupid Shin Ye-bum hasn't tried this
one because he's always late for school.

111
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:56,746
Yummy?

112
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:04,014
It's great to see you enjoying this,
I've always wanted to take you here.

113
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,851
Kang So-young is flirting again.

114
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:10,187
Is it true that this is your first
time trying a rice-cake skewer?

115
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,566
Yes. I've been kept
from having street food.

116
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:16,152
Gosh, if I were you, I would've
had it a hundred times already.

117
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,739
Da-yeol wouldn't even think of it,
because he's only loyal to himself.

118
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,676
What does that mean?

119
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:29,039
You don't even know that?
Wow, Da-yeol, you are way too naïve.

120
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:33,561
Are you teasing me?

121
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,797
You're right. Tae-hyun is teasing you.

122
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:40,434
How come you've been just on Da-yeol's side
all along? Do you like him?

123
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,096
What the hell! It's just called
having manners, isn't it, Da-yeol?

124
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:47,317
Manners? Let me teach
you what manners really are.

125
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:49,311
Ouch, stop it.
You're hurting me.

126
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,688
- I will poke you with this skewer.
- (A sweet scent.)

127
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:04,967
Heimlich Maneuver.
When something is stuck in our throat,

128
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:09,413
the Heimlich Maneuver is the most effective,
so you should definitely remember it.

129
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,831
What should you keep in mind?

130
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,067
Heimlich Maneuver.

131
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:16,313
I need two volunteers. Class leader?

132
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,383
And one more. Anyone?

133
00:13:24,132 --> 00:13:26,959
No one else wants to try?

134
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,644
If there's no volunteers, then it'll
be random. What day is it today?

135
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,772
- It's 9th.
- Okay, 9th. Number 9!

136
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:44,156
Number 9. Come up right now.

137
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,997
Huh? You are…

138
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,379
Look at me. I will demonstrate first.
Spread your legs and bend forward.

139
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:08,514
Be silent and pay attention.
Three times. One, two, three.

140
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,184
- Then why don't you try this time?
- Yes.

141
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,770
Keep silent and pay attention here.

142
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,731
Get behind him and hug under the armpit.

143
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,331
And press between solar plexus and navel.

144
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,792
(Sound of students' jeering)

145
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:44,675
Considering a patient's pain, you shouldn't
press softly. This is urgent, try again!

146
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,468
Aww!

147
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:53,576
Oh, my. Are you okay?

148
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,435
My rib.

149
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,231
You shouldn't hit your friend.

150
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,902
If this was real,
the class leader might just save your life.

151
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,738
Are you really okay?

152
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,031
Yes, I'm totally fine.

153
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,033
Come and apologize to him.

154
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,749
My dear friend, thank you for
saving my life and I love you.

155
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,000
Sorry?

156
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,377
Gosh, just say it.

157
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,301
My friend, thank you for saving my life.

158
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:34,475
I love…

159
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:43,859
I was reluctant to say the word...
I didn't want to say it...

160
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,071
I like you.

161
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,533
In the end I said
something even more weird.

162
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,036
Okay.

163
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,548
Look, settle down. Attention!

164
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:21,230
Practice and skill aren't enough.
It's not enough, Da-yeol.

165
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,732
I'm sorry.

166
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,756
Give it up. You've made too many mistakes.
Then you had better…

167
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,508
No way.

168
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,011
There's no point in
whatever you're insisting on.

169
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,513
Don't you think you
should yield to Da-yeol?

170
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,890
I'll keep practicing.

171
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,778
Why did you prank them like that?
They could've died from the heat!

172
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,489
Seeing them be
together, I couldn't help it.

173
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,160
Why do you hate Da-yeol way so much?

174
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,953
I have no idea. I just hate his eyes.

175
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:19,578
Are you crazy?

176
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:25,757
By the way, I'm fond of
Da-yeol. He's a bit nerdy but so funny.

177
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:28,778
Is he?

178
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,352
He was so funny in a class. The school nurse
normally embarrasses students like always.

179
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:37,448
Da-yeol played up to her at that time
and confessed to Ta-hyun.

180
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:40,659
Jeez, what a mood killer!

181
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:47,850
Jang Won-kyung, I know it was you.

182
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:52,232
You scared me! Sneaking up behind us,
what did you hear?

183
00:17:52,296 --> 00:17:55,007
Anyway, where is Da-yeol?
Don't the two of you usually hang out?

184
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,552
I don't know. He must be so ashamed
that he's avoiding me.

185
00:17:57,639 --> 00:17:59,141
Hey, what happened then?

186
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,056
I love…I like you…!

187
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:05,684
Gross!

188
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,228
What the hell! We didn't do that.

189
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,813
Cho Tae(-hyun), did your heart race?

190
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:12,358
- Are you crazy?
- Oh, he must have blushed.

191
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:17,863
Huh? Da-yeol.

192
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:18,322
Yes?

193
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,907
Did you hear the news?

194
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:20,783
Huh?

195
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:23,372
Your next match will be with Min-jung.

196
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:24,578
Pardon?

197
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:27,915
Your original opponent was hurt, so
we need to compete amongst ourselves.

198
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,193
I see. Thanks for letting me know.

199
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:43,931
Min-jung.

200
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:47,184
Lee Da-yeol.

201
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:49,144
Did you hear?

202
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:51,438
Yes.

203
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:54,316
Let's do our best.

204
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:58,737
Competing, right? Anyway, you are my rival.

205
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,657
Try harder.

206
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,869
I won't cut you any slack.

207
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:12,251
Your weak concentration lately
means it won't be easy to beat me.

208
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:19,133
Da-yeol must feel burdened.

209
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,927
Min-jung, the top archer at our school
will definitely win.

210
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,513
Da-yeol can only be in second place.

211
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:26,056
I can't decide who I should root for.

212
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:29,184
We'd better not root for either of them.
Let's stay calm.

213
00:19:56,886 --> 00:20:04,643
Lee Da-yeol, X-10! Great!
I'm so proud of you, my friend Lee Da-yeol!

214
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,972
- What are you doing here?
- I'm your senior so be nice.

215
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:10,768
Lee Da-yeol!

216
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:16,732
Who on earth is he? He looks
familiar, though. Do you know him?

217
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:20,319
He's a friend from my class.

218
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:22,154
Friend?

219
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:24,364
Yes.

220
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,373
- I’ll just get going.
- Yes.

221
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:49,723
You said you're leaving.
Will you practice more?

222
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,726
Yes… I will.

223
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:58,774
Don't push yourself too hard.

224
00:20:58,774 --> 00:20:59,942
Listen, Min-jung.

225
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,949
If your arrows often wobbled,
what would you do?

226
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:09,284
What do you mean by that?

227
00:21:11,578 --> 00:21:16,667
What I mean is… if it's
hard to concentrate… then...

228
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:20,337
Are you asking to me, your rival?

229
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:23,674
If you wouldn't mind...

230
00:21:31,306 --> 00:21:32,182
Avoid it.

231
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,017
What if I can't avoid it?

232
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:37,855
Calm yourself, leave only
the target in front of you.

233
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,606
The target?

234
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:42,359
I'll get going.

235
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:58,855
Hi...! Are you a member of an archery club?

236
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,421
Do you know when
Da-yeol will finish practice?

237
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,672
I don't know.

238
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:05,966
Understood.

239
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:53,555
Lee Da-yeol! Come with me.

240
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:55,432
So-young, you are early.

241
00:22:55,891 --> 00:23:00,187
I love…I like you…!

242
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,734
I'm so sorry but it was so funny.

243
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,236
I promise I won't laugh anymore from now.

244
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:09,696
You have a match soon, right?

245
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,073
Yes.

246
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,407
Would you like me to go root for you?

247
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:27,005
Hey, Cho Tae! What are you doing here?

248
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,634
Hey!

249
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:42,112
Poems can include
free verse, lyric, verse...

250
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:43,628
What else?

251
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,886
Today's school lunch is awful.

252
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:18,181
Finished already?

253
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,475
Yeah, I gotta go practice.

254
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,812
Leaving so early? You haven't had a lot.

255
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:26,023
See you later.

256
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:29,651
What's wrong with him?

257
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:33,113
Is it maybe because what happened
in the class yesterday?

258
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,003
Lee Da-yeol~

259
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:12,751
(A sweet scent.)

260
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,353
I like you.

261
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:20,755
Cho Tae-hyun,

262
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:25,000
you're like a sudden
gust of wind. But...

263
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,349
are you kind that'll help me or the
kind that will hurt me?

264
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:52,025
(Uncle)

265
00:25:55,862 --> 00:25:56,947
What's up?

266
00:25:57,612 --> 00:25:59,074
-I heard your aunt paid you a visit.

267
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:00,617
Yes.

268
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:06,630
-I don't know how she found your school,
but it won't happen again.

269
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:11,753
Didn't you hear that she almost killed me?

270
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:16,133
-Try to understand her.
You know she has problems.

271
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:17,426
Yes.

272
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:22,954
-If you need anything, call me.
Let's keep in touch. And my son...

273
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:31,064
Liar.

274
00:26:41,074 --> 00:26:48,206
If he really thinks of me as his own son,
he wouldn't leave me here alone.

275
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,001
Get up and go have lunch.

276
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:53,211
- Lunch time?
- Yes.

277
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,213
Da-yeol, let's go.

278
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,009
I'll skip today. The two
of you can go ahead.

279
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:00,677
Goodness, skipping lunch?

280
00:27:01,178 --> 00:27:02,846
Being too full makes it
hard for me to concentrate.

281
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:04,848
Then, only the two of us will go eat?

282
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,808
Where is Tae-hyun?

283
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:08,852
Well, he might've gone ahead already.

284
00:27:09,352 --> 00:27:12,355
Da-yeol, practice hard till we're back.

285
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,235
- What's for lunch?
- It's Jja-jangbob.

286
00:27:17,777 --> 00:27:18,570
What?

287
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:41,551
Running away again?

288
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:42,844
Why are you avoiding me?

289
00:27:43,553 --> 00:27:44,471
That's not true.

290
00:27:44,554 --> 00:27:46,556
Come on, it's true.

291
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:47,390
Step aside, please.

292
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,228
Jeez, I think you practice too much.
Let's go to a snack bar. Let me treat...

293
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,274
Go with someone else.
You have a lot of friends.

294
00:27:56,441 --> 00:28:01,321
Acting like this again? Are you still
embarrassed because of the school nurse?

295
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,364
God, I told you not to bother me.

296
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:07,744
Bothering you?

297
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:14,626
I meant I have an important
match pretty soon. Let's talk later.

298
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,547
Damn, stop being haughty.

299
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,677
What?

300
00:28:24,344 --> 00:28:28,640
You are too serious all the time, if
you have a problem with me just say it.

301
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,767
I don't, and watch what you say.

302
00:28:31,268 --> 00:28:32,811
Now that I'm nicer to you,
you can just walk all over me?

303
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:33,728
Hey, Cho Tae-hyun.

304
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:38,066
When it comes to athletes, is it a natural
disposition? Or are you just nonsocial?

305
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:39,401
Stop it.

306
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:41,736
Now you're making me
out to be the weird one.

307
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:46,324
Actually, you're the weirdo.

308
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:53,373
Lying, pretending to be close
and playing me like a toy. Most of all…

309
00:28:53,373 --> 00:28:54,541
Most of all?

310
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:01,756
…murder…

311
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:05,427
Ah, that.

312
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:11,474
You really that curious about it?
You should've asked earlier then.

313
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:21,067
Did you…really kill…a person?

314
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:28,325
Seems like it.

315
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:08,365
(Next Episode) - Are you that curious about it?
- Did you kill a person?

316
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,826
Da-yeol? Did you guys have a fight?
Have you cut him out of your life?

317
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:14,037
- Mom!
- Tae-hyun!

318
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:20,794
Does everything I like, everything
I wish for, have to end up like this?

319
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:22,796
Did you do that on purpose?

320
00:30:22,962 --> 00:30:25,674
Hey, hey, Cho Tae-hyun! Cho Tae-hyun!

321
00:30:26,132 --> 00:30:27,884
- Honestly, I'm relieved.
- Ouch, too cold.

322
00:30:27,884 --> 00:30:29,469
- Switch it.
- No?

323
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:32,555
You are not that bad as much as I thought.

324
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:33,890
Stop.

325
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,435
I won't have any regrets from
now on. Archery or whatever.
