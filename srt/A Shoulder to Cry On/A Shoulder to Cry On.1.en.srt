Da Yeol, have breakfast.

Gosh, samgyetang <i>(ginseng chicken soup)</i> for breakfast?

26
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:56,809
You're in your senior year now. It's an important time, so you should fill up your energy.

27
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:01,214
Being too full makes it harder to focus.

28

Stop being a baby and eat up.

29
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,190
Eat up.

00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,607
If you win in this competition, you'll be a member of the national team.

It's nothing but a friendly match… There's still a long way to go.

00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,887
Another chicken drumstick?

33
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:22,301
I can't even finish what you gave me.

34
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,836
Okay.

35
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,052
I'm going!

36
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:49,662
Have a good day, my son!

37
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,340
You're here early.

38
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,350
I thought I'd be the earliest today.

39
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,136
When did you get here?

40
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:44,358
I've been here a while.

41
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:05,945
Are you hurt?

42
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:09,176
No, it's nothing.

43
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,489
You should have warmed-up before starting.

44
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:14,848
It can become a serious injury later on.
Go to the school infirmary.

45
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:18,834
It's alright. I'll be fine in no time.

46
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:25,124
I'll let the coach know, so go.

47
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:55,220
- I'm a straight-A student so it's fine.

48
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,190
- That tickles

49
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:02,002
<i>What are they doing?</i>

50
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:04,514
<i>It's definitely two guys...</i>

51
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:10,946
- Hey, we're in the health center.
- I'll teach you everything.

52
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:13,498
<i>I guess these kinds of things actually happen.</i>

53
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,000
What the heck!

54
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,828
Oh, sorry.

55
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,384
Wait a minute.

56
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,606
Hey, where do you think you're touching?

57
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:23,810
I didn't mean to.
My arrow feather is missing.

58
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,627
What are you doing?

59
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,000
What are you doing!?

60
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,860
<i>He's handsome.</i>

61
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:53,857
What are you two doing?

62
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:55,490
Wow.

63
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,645
- It's not like…
- Teacher, help me, please.

64
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,607
I told him no,
but he suddenly came at me.

65
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,847
Hey, what the hell are you talking about?

66
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,538
Are you really okay? Huh?

67
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,602
You two, follow me.

68
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,723
Have you lost your mind? Huh?

69
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,266
Are you insane?

70
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:41,529
How can you cause such big trouble
on the first day of the semester?!

71
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:44,956
- It was all misunderstanding.
- Misunderstanding?

72
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:47,492
The truth is… I lost something valuable.

73
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,680
There's a witness here,
are you going to keep denying what you did,

74
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,190
you brat?

75
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:58,296
When you missed morning classes, I let it slide
because you were working hard on your archery, right?

76
00:08:58,296 --> 00:09:00,289
Am I right or wrong?

77
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,719
Won-kyung, tell me exactly what you saw.

78
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,252
Okay.

79
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:08,310
After hearing his stomach was upset, I took Tae-hyun to the school infirmary.

80
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,590
I was about to leave, but...

81
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,018
All of a sudden, he...

82
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,887
Hey, tell the truth!
The two of you were doing something funny!

83
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,048
You brat, I'm right here in front of you.

84
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:21,467
See? As you know, he's a member of an athletic club.

85
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,895
I tried my best to stop him.

86
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:25,831
Yet, take a look at here.

87
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,878
Jeez, this is driving me nuts.

88
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:34,267
I was scared to death,
I didn't have a chance to stop him.

89
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:37,435
What? When did I do such a thing?

90
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:39,160
Enough!

91
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,680
Da-yeol, if you keep denying like this,

92
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,139
Mr. Kwon, I'm so sorry.

93
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:54,376
I'll talk to Da-yeol,
so could I take him?

94
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,296
Yes, go ahead.

95
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,246
Get going.

96
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,543
My, what the hell!

97
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,269
- Lee Da-yeol.
 -Yes.

98
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:15,722
Are you out of your mind?

99
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:20,500
You must have plenty of time to be doing such a ridiculous thing, don't you?

100
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,831
-Coach, that's not what happened-
- I don't care what the truth is.

101
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,317
Apologize, or beg, or whatever,

102
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:28,953
but quietly take care of it and just focus on practice.

103
00:10:28,953 --> 00:10:31,914
Yes, I'm very sorry.

104
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:37,352
What matters to me is
not whether it was your fault or not.

105
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:39,563
Do you understand what I'm saying?

106
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,218
Answer me!

107
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:55,454
Excuse me, teacher.

108
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,449
Hello.

109
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,509
My name is Cho Tae-hyun.

110
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:03,437
Are you all right?

111
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:05,650
I was a bit startled...

112
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:10,030
but this is an important period for Da-yeol and I.

113
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,788
I hope to reconcile with him and put it behind us.

114
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:15,310
Thank you.

115
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,036
Nothing good would come from Da-yeol being disciplined at this time.

116
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:23,270
Right. So, if Da-yeol doesn't mind...

117
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,650
I'd just like to concentrate on my studying.

118
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,564
<i>I wanted to spit in his face.</i>

119
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,918
<i>However, I had no choice.</i>

120
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,313
Again.

121
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,871
Just remember that feeling.

122
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,141
Get rid of all the other unnecessary things.

123
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,206
I'm sorry.

124
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,910
Hey. Hey!

125
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,954
The more I think about it,
I can't stand for this unfairness.

126
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,554
Yeah?

127
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,475
- So what?
- Go back.

128
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:34,269
Go back to the coach and tell the truth.

129
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,740
Should I go back and tell her

130
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,575
that not only did you attack me,
but now you're threatening me?

131
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:43,229
Should I say "he's so scary, I'm afraid he'll retaliate,
so please suspend him"?

132
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,757
It was just an accident, it's not my fault.

133
00:12:45,757 --> 00:12:48,925
If it wasn't for you, I would have been in a big trouble.

134
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,700
What the heck?

135
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
Who the hell are you?

136
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:56,082
I don't know.

137
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:58,301
I'm curious too.

138
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,163
You just wait.

139
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:02,647
I'll reveal who you really are.

140
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,524
Who I really am?

141
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,440
What do you mean?

142
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,401
You're quite cute.

143
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,386
<i>He's smiling?</i>

144
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:19,723
<i>Is this funny to him?</i>

145
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:25,270
<i>I'm sure he doesn't feel guilty at all.</i>

146
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,516
<i>Doesn't he have a conscience?</i>

147
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,719
<i>What a sociopath!</i>

148
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,380
Try it.

149
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,520
Who would believe you...

150
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,241
when there's a witness who saw everything?

151
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:42,488
Anyways, didn't you say you lost something?

152
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,715
Spin or something?

153
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,143
I'm telling you, I didn't see anything like that here.

154
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:59,629
Just in case… it's just really valuable to me.

155
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:06,795
You're wrinkling up the blanket that I tidied up.

156
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:08,430
I'm sorry.

157
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,240
For what?

158
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:12,610
For messing up the school infirmary.

159
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,111
Is that all?

160
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,530
Pardon?

161
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,599
What you did here…

162
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:24,488
Did you know that it was rude to both Tae-hyun and I?

163
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,874
I'm sorry for that.

164
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:28,792
Then it's fine.

165
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:32,737
If I find it, I'll keep it safe here.

166
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:36,258
Thank you so much.

167
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,295
Get out now.

168
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,800
Too slow.

169
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,890
Aim and shoot right away.

170
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,521
- Let me try again.
- Relax your body.

171
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:01,050
Why are you so late?

172
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,593
I'm sorry.

173
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:05,304
Are you going to keep getting distracted?

174
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,737
No, I won't.

175
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,334
Do you want to quit now?

176
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:15,255
You're already a senior,
you need to set an example for your juniors.

177
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:19,427
My mistake. I'll focus on it.

178
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,603
Follow Min-jung, he's a good example.

179
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,403
I'm home.

180
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,416
Dad...

181
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,870
Sleep in the bedroom.

182
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,430
Dad.

183
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,906
Go, go.

184
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:27,053
<i>X-10 points!</i>

185
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,721
<i>Lee Da-yeol takes the gold medal.</i>

186
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:35,680
<i>Da-yeol, do you know what this is?</i>

187
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,606
<i>This is what professional archers use, it's called an arrow fletch.</i>

188
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:42,417
<i>I'll give it to you as a gift,
be sure to take good care of it.</i>

189
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,718
<i>Take it.</i>

190
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,569
<i>You just wait.
I'll reveal who you really are.</i>

191
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,371
We'll see...?

192
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:16,977
<i>Come on teacher!</i>

193
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:19,647
Why, why, why, why?
Do you hate group assignments?

194
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,774
<i>Yes, we hate it! We hate it!</i>

195
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:25,210
I see…
Then would you like to take a quiz every week instead?

196
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,038
<i>No! We hate that too!</i>

197
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,690
What? What is it? You just hate everything.

198
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,028
You're coming now? When class is almost done?

199
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:36,380
I'm sorry?

200
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,100
I'm sorry.

201
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,959
Go take your seat.

202
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,042
Anyway, the ethics teacher will be checking these group assignments,

203
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:52,087
when you're finished, gather everything
and the vice president will make sure to pass them on safely.

204
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,766
Every group will take one unit each and...

205
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:59,211
<i>In the same class with that jerk? I'm ruined.</i>

206
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,546
Class president?

207
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,029
Yes.

208
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:03,107
<i>He's the class president?</i>

209
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:05,025
You should report the results later.

210
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,753
- Yes, I will.
- Okay?

211
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,304
<i>Yes.</i>

212
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:09,471
That's it.

213
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:11,140
I think I've gained too much weight lately.

214
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:13,839
Then you should go on a diet.

215
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,400
Ah, Da-yeon.

216
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Fu...

217
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,364
Do you know him?

218
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,867
"Fu?"

219
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,112
"Fu" what?

220
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:28,915
What's with the face? Do you have something to say?

221
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:31,452
Is he the guy in the school infirmary?

222
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:36,214
Just say it if you have something to say instead of being
passive-aggressive, you creepy bastard.

223
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,600
Hey, hey… don't pick fights.

224
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,422
This bastard keep glaring at me.

225
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,091
Maybe he just has a ferocious face.

226
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:52,723
Hey, where are you going?
I'm not done talking.

227
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,058
Leave him alone. Let's just go to the cafeteria.

228
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,263
Wait for me.

229
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,525
You look awesome when you're exercising.
Drink this and good luck.

230
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,222
He's seriously drinking that?!

231
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:46,117
You look awesome when you're exercising.
Good luck, Da-yeol.

232
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,594
Group assignments for 'Life and Ethics'

233
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,901
Da-yeol.

234
00:20:41,381 --> 00:20:42,958
Bye-bye.

235
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:52,967
He's so funny, isn't he?

236
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,010
<i>I shouldn't be distracted.</i>

237
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,375
<i>Forget it all and focus on the practice.</i>

238
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,810
<i>Because the time I spend being distracted
is time wasted without an arrow in my hand.</i>

239
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:21,955
<i>If I lose my touch, it's the end.</i>

240
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,309
Then let's do our best.

241
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:28,203
By the way,
I'm in the same group with Kang So-young again.

242
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,547
I know right? I'm so sick of it.

243
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:33,590
I'm also freaking sick of it.

244
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:37,970
I meant I liked it, how harsh...

245
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,107
Yes, yes, of course you did.

246
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,444
And I meant that I don't like it.

247
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,256
Da-yeol and I will take care of the presentation- 
 - I-I-I...

248
00:21:49,256 --> 00:21:51,685
will research with So-ra.

249
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,900
So-ra.

250
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,200
So-ra? My name is So-young, Kang So-young.

251
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,100
Oh, sorry.

252
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,940
I agree, it's not like So-young is a rare name.

253
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,640
How would anyone remember your name?

254
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,749
I think you're too self-conscious.

255
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:08,050
Do you want to die?

256
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:12,113
Then do you know what his name is? Take a guess who he is.

257
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,592
I have no idea.

258
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:21,640
Da-yeol, I heard you have a match in two weeks.

259
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,580
The presentation should be easier than researching.

260
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,588
My, did you already know each other?

261
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:30,515
Well, I'm planning to get to know him moving forward.

262
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,817
What the heck!

263
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:36,620
Da-yeol,

264
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,259
if you're busy practicing,
I think doing the presentation will be better, like Tae-hyun said.

265
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,686
Ye-bum and I are really good at doing research.

266
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:45,222
Hey, I hate researching!

267
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:51,402
Alright then, let's go with that,
do our parts well, and give a good presentation.

268
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:55,300
<i>Smiling like that...</i>

269
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,530
<i>What a brazen asshole!</i>

270
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,669
<i>I'm dying to beat him up.</i>

271
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:04,316
What is it?

272
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,149
Emergency poop?

273
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:15,830
Take your time, we'll be waiting here.

274
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:35,355
<i>I'd better drop out of the group assignment.</i>

275
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:52,981
Number.

276
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:54,074
Pardon?

277
00:23:54,074 --> 00:23:55,647
Give me your phone number.

278
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:56,952
For what?

279
00:23:56,952 --> 00:23:59,555
We wrapped the meeting up because you made it awkward.

280
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:03,726
The presentation part is on us,
we should at least know each other's phone number.

281
00:24:03,726 --> 00:24:05,060
I won't do it.

282
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,313
Are you still angry with me?

283
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:09,805
Still?

284
00:24:09,805 --> 00:24:12,009
Do you know what I went through
because of the two of you?

285
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:15,542
You made me a total moron,
and you're saying "still"?

286
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,355
That's not great…

287
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:21,625
Have you considered So-young and Ye-bum's
grades for the group assignment?

288
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:26,315
- What?
- The presentation is already next Monday.

289
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:28,580
The other group members will be at a disadvantage because of you...

290
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,610
Not that it matters to me.

291
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:47,268
Yes! Success in getting the phone number.

292
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,321
Hold on.

293
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,360
Hello?

294
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,281
Hello?

295
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:01,114
Who is it?

296
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,253
That's hilarious.

297
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,700
It's obviously me!

298
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,990
You've never exchanged phone numbers, have you?

299
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,576
"Hello?"

300
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,118
He really is funny.

301
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,890
<i>Hamster</i>

302
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:34,300
Hey.

303
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,900
What are you smiling about?

304
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,452
- Oh, nothing special.
- Let's go to a PC center after school.

305
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:41,782
Go by yourself, I'm going home.

306
00:25:41,782 --> 00:25:44,376
Come on. What are you going to do?

307
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,020
Something incredibly funny.

308
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,521
Incredibly funny? Let me in then.

309
00:25:48,521 --> 00:25:52,241
You don't need to know.
You're not even in the same class with me.

310
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:53,884
What is it?

311
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:58,054
- What the heck is it?
- Come on.

312
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,364
<i>New Message</i>

313
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:40,273
<i>Sociopath: Are you free tomorrow?</i>

314
00:26:40,273 --> 00:26:43,260
<i>I arranged research materials
so you just need to read them.</i>

315
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,988
<i>I'd like to meet up and practice it once.</i>

316
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:47,722
<i>No way.</i>

317
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:59,570
<i>New Message</i>

318
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,352
<i>No way?</i>

319
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:09,385
<i>Where is that?</i>

320
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,382
<i>Are you going to come now?
I'll text you the address.</i>

321
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,462
You're here. That was so quick.

322
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:20,088
Give it back right now.

323
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:23,591
I will, so come in for a second.

324
00:27:35,345 --> 00:27:37,563
It's probably not there.

325
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,091
Bring it, now.

326
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:43,160
You haven't seen many movies, have you?

327
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,360
Would I put it somewhere so easy to find?

328
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,430
What are you up to?

329
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:51,450
Why do you keep talking to me, bothering me, and pretending to be close with me?

330
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,400
I already told you. It's because you're cute.

331
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,200
That's it. Give it to me right now.

332
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,830
Come on, don't hate me so much.

333
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:06,200
I'm even writing you the script for your convenience. All you have to do is read it.

334
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,360
Is this fun for you?

335
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,420
Or... are you interested in me?

336
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,520
It's like...

337
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,440
When I see something cute, I want to push it
into a corner and hit it with a toy hammer.

338
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,988
Stop talking nonsense,
and give me back my arrow fletch.

339
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,509
It's not in my pocket.

340
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,360

341
