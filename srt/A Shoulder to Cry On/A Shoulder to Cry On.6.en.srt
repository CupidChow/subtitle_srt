00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,300
(A Shoulder To Cry On)

2
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,939
(Episode 6. A shoulder to cry on)

3
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,586
What I have learned is.

4
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,923
10 is a safe zone.

5
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,134
The rest of the zones...

6
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,806
I thought they might kill me.

7
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,646
I have nothing but archery.

8
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,023
Da-yeol startled me…

9
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,608
Wow, he shot how
many 10s consecutively…?

10
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,152
Honestly, I thought that he
would lose by a huge margin.

11
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,404
I have no idea what's
going to happen.

12
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,251
Without it, you might mess up your match...?

13
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,586
It doesn't matter anymore.

14
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,382
Don't bother me about
giving it back later.

15
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,260
By the way, Tae-hyun.

16
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,302
Huh?

17
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,180
I have something to ask you.

18
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:20,890
What is it?

19
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,687
…No…Later.

20
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,439
Later? What is this about?

21
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,778
Return my spin feathers later. Let's go.

22
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,073
What is it?

23
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,037
My entire life had been on target.

24
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,875
I had put away all other things.

25
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:51,504
I had no passion and desire for winning.

26
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,550
At some point, I was scared of
archery. That's why I had to carry on.

27
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:01,623
There was nothing left
for me except archery.

28
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:08,021
Tae-hyun, if I didn't meet you,

29
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,857
I really wouldn't have known.

30
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,736
I've only ever seen you smile
brightly when you're doing archery.

31
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:20,491
What I truly want is...
I'd like to be honest from now on.

32
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,452
Without any regrets.

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,121
Cho Tae-hyun.

34
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,168
I…I like you.

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,759
I like you.

36
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,678
What do you think of me?

37
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,003
Cho Tae(-hyun)

38
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,130
Still bad at basketball.

39
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,715
Where is your pet?

40
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:26,140
A lucky shot… didn't
he say anything to you?

41
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,934
About what?

42
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:31,096
You seem to try to draw a line
between the two of you but it didn't take.

43
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,689
So I educated him instead.

44
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,694
Educated him? What the
heck are you talking about?

45
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,948
He likes you.

46
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,284
What a lunatic, you brat!

47
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:49,872
Hey, is he insane? Considering what we did
to him, is it possible for him to like me?

48
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,375
Hell no, he would leave you alone.

49
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,584
See?

50
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,547
Still though, why didn't he?

51
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:00,920
So odd, right?

52
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,556
A normal guy may try to get
you back and keep his distance.

53
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:08,562
As if...

54
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,315
In my point of view,
you're not (normal) either.

55
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,033
Poor Da-yeol…he just barely lost.

56
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,119
He's still amazing to
have advanced to the final.

57
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,039
Even so, he prepared so hard for the final.

58
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,000
Now that he he's sad,
he might not come to school.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,295
Don't say things like that!

60
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,422
What on earth is wrong with her?

61
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,093
Hi.

62
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,481
Why are you all staring at me?

63
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,443
Da-yeol, are you all right?

64
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,571
Hmm…yes, I'm all right.

65
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,740
Depressed, right?

66
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,160
No, I'm totally okay.

67
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:15,708
You must be pretty upset.

68
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,670
Why are you crying instead of me?

69
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,089
He's fine.

70
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,700
(Math)

71
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:49,043
*gay gasp* Wow, math really
isn't your strong suit, is it...

72
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:49,698
Don't look...

73
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:50,927
I guess God doesn't
give with both hands...

74
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,286
What did you get?

75
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,082
'I don't know…math…is too difficult.

76
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,086
By the way, since you're a student athelete
it doesn't really matter, does it?

77
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,421
Should I have a tutor?

78
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,526
Me! Me! Me! Let me
do it! I'm good at math!

79
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,259
- Really?
- Yes, I can do that for you. What do you think?

80
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,471
58! Hey, Kang So-young,
you'd better take care for your studying~.

81
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,099
- Seeing your score, who can you teach?
- Hey, give it back.

82
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,225
Will you study one more year?

83
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,602
- Give it back right away!
- No way.

84
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:21,399
Da-yeol, if you don't mind,
can I teach you math?

85
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,789
- (See you at 2 in the library tomorrow.)
- (Okay.)

86
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,126
I'm leaving home now.

87
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,423
Dad, see you!

88
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:56,784
In a trigonometrical function, it's easier
to see an upper circle on the graph…

89
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,062
The point on the
basis of XY graph..

90
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,649
Hey, Kang So-young.

91
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,443
I wasn't asleep!

92
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,488
Nodding off and not studying,
why did you come here with us?

93
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,198
I came here to study as well.

94
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,558
Clean up the drool from
your mouth and tell us.

95
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:17,914
It's because I hit the books all night…
I'd better drink some coffee.

96
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,749
Would you like some?

97
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,666
No, thank you.

98
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,043
Me neither.

99
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:32,178
Let's carry on. To solve this question,
use the formula I mentioned just now..

100
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,559
Can you concentrate on this?

101
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:45,358
It's not difficult, Da-yeol.
Using the formula will be solved...

102
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,864
What in the world are you looking at,
not the question?

103
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,552
What the heck are you doing?

104
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:13,928
Sorry.

105
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,474
Let's take a break for a minute.

106
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,811
Tae-hyun.

107
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,855
Jang Won-kyung.

108
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,491
My goodness, I got to see the whole damned shit.

109
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,410
When did you get here?

110
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,037
It was great, why
didn't you keep going?

111
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,125
Hi, Da-yeol?

112
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,128
Jeez, you are so pathetic.

113
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,715
Da-yeol, I told you
that you're nothing but a pet to him.

114
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,803
Am I right, Tae-hyun?
You said Da-yeol is your pet.

115
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,180
Hey, watch your mouth.

116
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,685
Damn it. I just told you the truth.

117
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,521
Isn't it, Tae-hyun?

118
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:07,889
Are you serious?

119
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,318
Tell me, please.

120
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,368
So, what are you going to do now?

121
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:31,929
Hey, Cho Tae-hyun..was
when he said true?

122
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,884
Why did you do such a thing just now?

123
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,385
- That's…
- Hey~.

124
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,928
Why did you come out?

125
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,515
Don't talk to me ever again.

126
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,778
What's wrong? What happened?

127
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:07,737
Let's have a talk.

128
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,803
What's the matter?

129
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,470
Jeez.

130
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,222
You keep avoiding me.

131
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:22,973
Let go of me.

132
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,394
I'm sorry. My mistake.

133
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,229
I don't even want to
hear anything, you brat!

134
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,348
Are you taking revenge on me now?

135
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,274
Revenge?

136
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,653
As for what I did to you before,
is this how you're paying me back?

137
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,363
No…I didn't mean by that.

138
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:42,118
Then, just stay out of my sight, please!

139
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,671
I'm filthy because I like you?

140
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,220
I also know I'm
being really annoying.

141
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,561
That I like you..it makes me so angry and upset.

142
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:12,507
I have no clue what to do…

143
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,234
You..

144
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,903
Can you hate me for good?

145
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,010
Can you do that?

146
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,122
Even if there was someone that
committed suicide because she hated me...

147
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,832
I told you it was just an accident…

148
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,501
What if another accident happens again?

149
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,796
I don't care..I…

150
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,798
I do care.

151
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,096
Having hung out with you until now,

152
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,265
I was testing myself.

153
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,853
Whether I feel guilty or not,
after being such a garbage person.

154
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,815
In order to make sure,
I just took an advantage of you, moron brat.

155
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,654
…is that all you have in mind?

156
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:08,972
What am I to you?

157
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,294
Nothing peculiar.

158
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,044
So, stop liking me.

159
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,864
What am I to you?

160
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:48,488
Right... what kind of person was he to me?

161
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,582
On the surface, he's been serious every time.

162
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,459
Let me reveal your true face in public.

163
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,669
Hey.

164
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,004
He's been desperate in some ways.

165
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,466
Bullying and making fun of you,

166
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,888
was so much fun for a while.

167
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,808
With a glum face,

168
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:12,993
a picky eater like an child…

169
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,770
Hey, how come you picked out beans?
Are you a kindergarten boy?

170
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,729
None of your business.

171
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:21,711
If I didn't know he was an athelete,
he would just be a regular student.

172
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,113
Yummy?

173
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,658
I liked him in such trivial ways.

174
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,037
Despite being a loner without friends,

175
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,082
Will you not come to school?

176
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,126
He was the only one
that ever came to see me.

177
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,628
Da-yeol, did you take
notes in Life and Ethics?

178
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:42,606
Can I borrow them?
Let me treat you in a snack bar later.

179
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,362
- No problem.
- Are you serious?

180
00:14:44,387 --> 00:14:47,970
I'll get you anything you want. I won't be
messy and I'll give it to you straight after.

181
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,638
Bye~.

182
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,392
Why did you pinch me?

183
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,977
I was annoyed.

184
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:56,837
What made you annoyed?

185
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,066
How come?

186
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,359
Leave me alone.

187
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,278
How come?

188
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,738
Why~.

189
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:10,284
Right. What made me annoyed?

190
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:19,767
It's useless to figure it out now...

191
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,171
Because I ended everything myself.

192
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:28,122
Maybe I wasn't confident enough
to be hated by you?

193
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,887
I don't care.. I…

194
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,971
I do care.

195
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:41,273
I was afraid that now you were the only one...

196
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,067
who came and comforted me.

197
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,198
Hey, Cho Tae-hyun! Cho Tae-hyun!

198
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,491
It was not your fault.

199
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,909
Afraid to...

200
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,869
Here?

201
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,372
Lose you.

202
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,505
Da-yeol's house?

203
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:08,858
Yes…he hasn't been in touch.

204
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,303
He hasn't come to school for several days.

205
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:14,320
There is his previous house address
in a school record book but…

206
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,059
Sure, I will let you know.

207
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,269
Thank you.

208
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,024
You are… Da-yeol's friend, right?

209
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,987
Huh? Yes…

210
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,410
After the final,

211
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,130
Da-yeol quit archery.

212
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,541
Sorry?

213
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,543
Do you mean it? Are you really quitting?

214
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,336
Yes.

215
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,425
Owing to the mistake you made?

216
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,093
No, it's not the reason.

217
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,809
What on earth are you
going to do instead of archery?

218
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:01,895
...Quitting archery won't
make my life ruin at any rate.

219
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,480
And…

220
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,152
There is something
I'd like to pour my heart into.

221
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,199
I truly appreciate what you've done for me.

222
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,067
Without it, you might
mess up your match...?

223
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,111
It doesn't matter anymore.
I have something to ask you.

224
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,989
Not now, later.

225
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,365
Did Da-yeol come to school?

226
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,132
Tae-hyun.

227
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,762
Today is the last day
Da-yeol is at school.

228
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,806
What are you talking about?

229
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,480
- You've done good work.
- Well-done.

230
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,943
Wait...

231
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,571
Da-yeol! Wait!

232
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:42,412
Lee Da-yeol! Hear me out, please.

233
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,502
What is it?

234
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,880
Better late than never…

235
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:55,201
Too late, though…

236
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,323
Maybe I was scared to be abandoned by you.

237
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,144
You may disappear just as others.

238
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,940
Perhaps…I like you but..

239
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,820
Frankly, I don't know exactly
what my true heart is.

240
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,865
Maybe…I need you..

241
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,244
Hey…hold on.

242
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,833
- Are you kidding me?
- Huh?

243
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,626
You are not sure whether you like me or not.

244
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,837
Even so, you need me?

245
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,199
You told me not to like you?

246
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:37,858
Didn't you just say you
took advantage of me?

247
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:40,397
Was it not enough to hurt me?

248
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:44,892
Da-yeol..I'm sorry. I said it wrong.

249
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,937
Gosh…you're damn humiliating me till the end.

250
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,567
Don't go.

251
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:59,239
Don't go...

252
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,952
What the hell…

253
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:06,717
Since you try to solve all your
problems with that sad look...

254
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:17,841
I... I can't handle you anymore.

255
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,471
Please don't leave me.

256
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:24,765
Cho Tae-hyun.

257
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,521
If there's someone else
who likes you next time...

258
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,318
Like him back, for once.

259
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:03,572
(TWO YEARS LATER)

260
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:52,704
Hello? I just woke up. I'm leaving right away.

261
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:06,968
Are you coming? No…well..I don't know.

262
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,304
It' said that selection test for National team
is harder than Olympic Games in the long run.

263
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,222
Just a moment.

264
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,890
("ARCHERY NATIONAL PREMATCH"
CHOI TAE-WOOK'S BRILLIANT PLAY)

265
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,393
This year, athlete Choi Tae-wook’s
play definitely stood out.

266
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,188
He scored X-ten in the final round,
widening the gap with his competitors.

267
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,357
Nothing special. See you later.

268
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:40,168
If electrons gather here, then this part, a
P-type semiconductor, this carrier becomes a hole.

269
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:49,344
- Are you following me? That's all for today.
- Thank you.

270
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,687
Jeez…I'm worn out. Isn't he crazy?

271
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,897
To change lecture time
on his own authority.

272
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,899
So, I filed a complaint.

273
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:09,368
Already? Creepy brat. You look like a
cold-blooded person every once in a while.

274
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:12,650
But still, I feel good
because you did that.

275
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,910
See?

276
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,998
Gosh, it's gonna take forever
to finish this assignment.

277
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,125
Hang in there.

278
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:24,546
Huh? How come you look relaxed?

279
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,673
Because I've finished already.

280
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,550
You should have done it in advance as well.

281
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,344
Such a traitor…by the way.

282
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,806
I heard there are so many pretty girls
among freshmen this year.

283
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,391
Let's go crazy at
the opening party.

284
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,392
I'm busy.

285
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,811
How come, you'd finished your assignment.

286
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,646
I should study for the next class.

287
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:45,025
Don’t you feel sorry for me
to mess up a blind date?

288
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,277
I don't get it.

289
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,863
Without you, girls wouldn't
go for a blind date with me.

290
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:53,783
Why are you wasting your beautiful youth?
Are you a monk or something?

291
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,410
Or is there anyone that you are fond of?

292
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,207
I'm not interested at all.
Take care of your own business.

293
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,752
Please…let’s go together!

294
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:07,980
Hello?

295
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,382
Done for the day?

296
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,258
Yes.

297
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,026
(Introduction of Police Science)

298
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,094
Then see you there.

299
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,137
Okay.

300
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,014
(Lee Da-yeol)

301
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,317
Lee Da-yeol!

302
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,944
Waiting long?

303
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,487
No, I just got here.

304
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,657
Tada! How do I look?

305
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,116
You look great.

306
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,119
You also look like a college student.

307
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,998
Really? Where shall we go?

308
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,459
Food or drinks?

309
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,504
- Drinks?
- Both. Okay?

310
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,531
Kang Sso.

311
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,787
What's up?

312
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,456
Cho Tae-hyun, where are you?

313
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,958
I'm at school.

314
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,169
Can you come over now?

315
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,131
For what?...Are you drunk?

316
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,636
Of course, I am…by the way…
guess who I am with right now?

317
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,138
I have no idea.

318
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,724
I'm with Da-yeol.

319
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:41,850
What?

320
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,022
He kept calling your name…looking for you…

321
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,441
Where are you?

322
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,490
If there's someone else
who likes you next time...

323
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,455
Like him back, for once.

324
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,171
Hey, where in the world are you?

325
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,922
Cho Tae!

326
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,512
Come on.

327
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,766
What's going on?

328
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:30,732
I will let you in on an amazing scoop.
Check out the tear stains.

329
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,526
What's going on here? What's wrong with him?

330
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,864
Yet another scoop is that
even though he only got 52 in math,

331
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:41,785
he could go into Police Administration
because there are no enrollment requirements!

332
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,621
Stop joking me. Tell me what's wrong with him?

333
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,666
It's impossible for me to know that.

334
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,591
I wont be a fool,
getting stuck between the two of you.

335
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,559
What the heck are you doing? Take him.

336
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:16,236
Hello?
The park across from Se-woon intersection.

337
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,572
Turn right and you can see the park.

338
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:24,209
Hello? Hello?

339
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,458
Darn it. Too heavy.

340
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:46,625
Lee Da-yeol, the reason
you're going through it like this...

341
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,603
is because you still like me, right?

342
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,607
Is that right?

343
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:07,328
Da-yeol, I also hope to like you.

344
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:14,586
If someone likes me, I hope it's you.

345
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,219
Even if I am still problematic…

346
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:30,852
In spite of too many things I feel
sorry for you… I'd like to go for it.

347
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:37,942
If the moment comes,

348
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:41,701
Would you be with me?

349
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,850
Let me walk. I can walk on my own.

350
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,461
I can wait for you.

351
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,597
I will wait for you…

352
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,730
Give me a proper confession
when the moment is right.

353
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,000
(Next Episode) In high school, it was archery.
Now it's the police exam.

354
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
When am I really free to meet up with you?

355
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,500
We've arrived.

356
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,700
No one can disturb us here.

357
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,400
- Stay there!
- No!

358
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,300
- I said stay there!
- I will not!

359
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,300
If it's going to disappear anyway,
maybe it's better not to know.

360
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,300
I want to kiss you.

361
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,200
You always notice me before I do.

362
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,300
It's not hard if you like it.

363
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,800
I can't believe you know how to do
such a great thing.

364
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
Don't mind me.

365
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Would you like to eat this?
