Epilogue of &lt;A Shoulder to Cry On&gt;

3
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,500
(2 years later)

4
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,708
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,500
(Police officer exam D-45)

6
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,666
(Da-yeol)

7
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,083
You're here.

8
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,666
Sorry to ask you to meet me here.

9
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,791
Don't mind me.

10
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,791
Don't mind me.

11
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,458
What are you doing?

12
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,375
I'm looking at you.

13
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,458
Are you not bored?

14
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,416
Want to see a mirror?
It's funny.

15
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,291
What?

16
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,333
Wanna go eat?

17
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,041
You have no plan other than meeting me today, right?

18
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,458
Yes.

19
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,166
- Pack your things.
- What?

20
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,333
Let's go.

21
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,791
To where?

22
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,833
What is that?

23
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,875
Supplies for our love on the run.

24
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,166
We've arrived.

25
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,666
You could've told me beforehand.

26
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,625
If so, would you have come?

27
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:23,850
I think you would've said to
go later because you're busy.

28
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,458
In high school, it was archery.
Now it's the police exam.

29
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,875
When am I really free to meet up with you?

30
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,916
I want to be with you.

31
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,791
Let's do everything like others do.

32
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,791
Am I childish now?
I don't like it.

33
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,500
Yeah, very childish.

34
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,958
Just a day.

35
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,375
No one can disturb us here.

36
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,166
And you look tired because
you are studying these days.

37
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,041
- All this for you...
- Are you sure? Is this for me?

38
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,166
It seems like it's for you.

39
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,291
Oh my, you got me.

40
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,166
Let's go see the sea!

41
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,000
I like it.

42
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,791
Me too.

43
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,666
Why don't you stop looking at me and
look at the sea?

44
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,041
Seeing you looking at the sea makes me feel like
I'm looking at the ocean.

45
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,041
Tae-hyun!

46
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,583
What are you doing?

47
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,791
Hey, why are you running away
after telling me to come?

48
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,583
Why are you running so terribly?

49
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,791
- Stay right there!
- No!

50
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,833
- Stay there!
- No!

51
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:30,833
- I said stay there!
- I will not!

52
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,208
Stay!

53
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,416
- What do you think?
- It's so nice.

54
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,333
Right?
I think I picked a nice place.

55
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,458
And it's nice weather too.

56
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,458
It that a bedroom?

57
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,041
- Let's go see.
- What?

58
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,291
I like it.

59
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,666
Me too.

60
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,458
I can't believe you know how to do
such a great thing.

61
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,666
Give me credit.

62
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,333
Why are you in such a hurry?

63
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,541
What?

64
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,291
I know you want to do.
But...

65
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,583
I will do it later.
I'm hungry now.

66
00:09:24,858 --> 00:09:26,149
I'm not.

67
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,833
Hang in there.

68
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,833
I'm really not.

69
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,625
Then why did you close your eyes?

70
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,833
Because I was sleepy.

71
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,166
Suddenly?
At that moment?

72
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,125
Yes, I am really sleepy now.

73
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,625
See?

74
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, I see.

75
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,416
I'm telling you.

76
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,458
Oh, okay.

77
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,041
I'm innocent!

78
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,750
You'd better wait quietly.

79
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,666
I might completely change the menu.

80
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,583
You'll change the menu?

81
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,958
Yeah, menu.

82
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,208
I could cook something else.

83
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,083
You came here on purpose, right?

84
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,750
When will it be done?

85
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,625
Just wait a minute.

86
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,208
I'm starving.

87
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,333
Almost done.

88
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,958
Let's dig in!

89
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,125
Looks yummy.

90
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,000
- How's the taste?
- It's tasty.

91
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm glad you like it.

92
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,625
Help yourself.

93
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,791
Are you still not eating vegetables?

94
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:32,643
You should be more balanced in how you eat.

95
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:35,458
It's worse to force yourself to eat something
you don't want to eat.

96
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:37,351
I'm sighing.

97
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:40,937
Here's a carrot.
Eat it.

98
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:43,770
- Hey, open your mouth.
- I don't like carrots.

99
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,625
Eat it.

100
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:47,546
Do it.

101
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,291
What do you want to do after eating this?

102
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,708
Should we finish what we were doing earlier?

103
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,416
A... are you insane?

104
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,416
We were looking at the sea
before we came in.

105
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,125
I was thinking of
going to look at the sea more.

106
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,333
Is it that insane?

107
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,750
I didn't know that.

108
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,750
You... you!

109
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,833
- Eat this.
- I don't want it.

110
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,416
- Hurry up.
- I don't want it.

111
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,916
- It's just apple.
- I won't eat it.

112
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,750
You're so picky.

113
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:37,250
By the way, what did you bring in that bag?

114
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:39,493
Ah, that bag?

115
00:12:40,544 --> 00:12:44,127
What did you say?
For our love on the run...

116
00:12:44,152 --> 00:12:45,777
Okay, hold on.

117
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,666
Ta-da!

118
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,291
Pajamas.
What do you think?

119
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,666
Hold on, hold on.
I'm so confused now.

120
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,791
I've been waiting for today.

121
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,875
What's all that?
Like you've never been in a relationship.

122
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,208
You didn't know that?
You are my first.

123
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,166
No, no.
I can't.

124
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,625
- It's cute.
- I can't.

125
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,250
Just do it on your own.

126
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,583
Hey!

127
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,500
I bought this for you.

128
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,208
It looks good on you.

129
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,833
What's this?

130
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,791
You said it was a trip for me...

131
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,500
I think it seems like a trip for you.

132
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,791
- Then what do you want to do?
- Me?

133
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,500
Now?

134
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,083
Yeah, now.

135
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,083
- Da-yeol!
- Yeah?

136
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,000
You are quite high maintenance.

137
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,250
Do you want to maintain anything other than this?

138
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,375
Wait for me.

139
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,833
- It's cold!
- Of course, it's winter.

140
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,208
Is the water warm?

141
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,833
You will know when you go in!

142
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,208
Are you out of your mind?

143
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,875
It's warm.

144
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,416
How could you go into the pool
in your pajamas?

145
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:54,458
- Why not? Come on in!
- No way. I’ll never go in.

146
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,166
Why not?
Come on in.

147
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,833
Please.
Come on in.

148
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,250
Come on in.

149
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,833
- It's warm, right?
- I came in because of you.

150
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,000
Isn't it warm and nice?

151
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're right.
I like wet Da-yeol more.

152
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:30,916
What are you doing?

153
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,541
- Don't come close.
- Come here.

154
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,083
I actually don't like winter.

155
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,583
Why?
Because it's cold?

156
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,333
No.

157
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:56,845
Pretty things disappear quickly.

158
00:16:57,673 --> 00:17:00,673
You won't even know it's pretty if it's forever.

159
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:08,044
If it's going to disappear anyway,
maybe it's better not to know.

160
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,958
Don't worry.
I'm only pretty to you.

161
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,041
I will not disappear.

162
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,583
What?

163
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,666
Aren't you cold?

164
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,500
- It's cold.
- Let's go inside.

165
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,333
No, only my face is cold.
My body is warm.

166
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,416
How is it?
Is it warm?

167
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,375
How is it?
Are you warm now?

168
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,541
I want to kiss you.

169
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,750
- What are you doing?
- Huh, what are you talking about?

170
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,166
How dare you!

171
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,333
You're teasing me
whenever you have time!

172
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,375
Hey, you don't even give me a chance.

173
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,750
- What's in your head?
- It's you! You're in my head.

174
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,333
I'm out.

175
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:04,617
If you get caught, I wont let you go.

176
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,050
Don't come over.

177
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Don't come... don't move!

178
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,791
It's cold.

179
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,333
I told you.
Why were you thinking of swimming in winter?

180
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,750
You'll catch a cold if you don't dry your hair properly.

181
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,166
I'll be okay.

182
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,458
I'll dry your hair.

183
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,833
Come here.

184
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:55,234
Don't.

185
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,083
Why don't you stop it?

186
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,250
Would you like to eat this?

187
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,291
Would you let me go now?

188
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,250
Why do you close your eyes?

189
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,833
Open your eyes!

190
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,666
Open your eyes!

191
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,083
I want to see you all day long.

192
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,416
I miss you even more
when I close my eyes to sleep.

193
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,416
I want to see you even if I close my eyes.

194
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,583
Is there anything you're looking forward to?

195
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,625
I'm just sleepy.
I'm sleepy.

196
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,250
You said you were sleepy all day today.

197
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,708
- I hate you.
- Why's that?

198
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,708
- Stop it.
- For what?

199
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,291
Does it tickle?

200
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,875
Tell me.

201
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,000
About what?

202
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,875
About you.

203
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,416
Something what you really like,

204
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,916
Something you like moderately.
Something you don't like in moderation.

205
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,291
Everything, even the things you hate so much.

206
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,000
I hope there's nothing
I don't know about you.

207
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,625
- You're greedy for that.
- I'm a pot of greed.

208
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,916
Then let's do it together.

209
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,875
Flat soda.

210
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:10,000
No way!
You like flat soda?

211
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,875
How delicious!
It's bland and sweet!

212
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,208
What about you?

213
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,916
Me?

214
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,083
Gimbap without vegetables.

215
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,500
You'll be in big trouble
if you keep being picky.

216
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,000
If you keep saying that,
I'll put you in a category I hate very much.

217
00:21:33,383 --> 00:21:35,258
Oh, I'm sorry.

218
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,666
Wearing two socks in the winter.

219
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,833
- Brushing your teeth and eating.
- Cup noodles and onigiri.

220
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,666
Crayon Shin Chan.

221
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,541
Act your age!

222
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:49,465
Are you still watching it?

223
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,958
- I will keep watching it.
- That's ridiculous.

224
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,291
- Then what are you watching?
- I watch Yu-Gi-Oh!

225
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,583
Yu-Gi-Oh is fun.

226
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,666
- I used to play with cards a lot.
- Oh, you did?

227
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,750
I don't want to fall asleep...

228
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,666
Just sleep comfortably.

229
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,583
Leaving you in front of me like this?

230
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,791
I can't.

231
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,166
It's a shame.

232
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,666
I'm sleepy.

233
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,916
Thank you.

234
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,458
I was just running forward.

235
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:11,125
I didn't even know I was exhausted.

236
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,875
You always notice me before I do.

237
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,458
Back then,

238
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,541
Even now.

239
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,708
It's not a big deal.

240
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:29,958
It's not hard if you like it.

241
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,166
I forget everything when I'm with you.

242
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,625
The impatience to do something.

243
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,833
Even other useless thoughts.

244
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:49,916
It feels like I'm running away from reality
and forgetting everything for a while.

245
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,208
It's true that we ran away.

246
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,500
Why did you bring me to the sea?

247
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:07,708
Winter, the sea and Da-yeol.

248
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:13,291
Because my three favorite
things are gathered in one place.

249
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:21,250
Don't you feel ashamed when you say that?

250
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:25,833
You've never seen a guy like this before?

251
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,666
It's my first relationship, but...
I'm a natural, right?

252
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,000
No wonder.

253
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:38,458
You were really weird from that
school infirmary back in the day.

254
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:45,541
At the time, I didn't know
we would be like this.

255
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,875
I like you a lot.

256
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,666
So do I.

257
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:44,291
Even if one day we fall out again...

258
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:53,458
Come back to me like this.

259
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:05,458
And as always,

260
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:15,625
A shoulder to cry on.

261
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:59,400
Thank you so much for watching.
