Episode 2. A Friend Like a Friend, Not a Friend

15
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:13,874
An unpleasant thing is happening again...

16
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:16,500
No it's not!

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,727
What's not?

18
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:21,940
What you did in the school infirmary was an unpleasant thing.

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,275
Aha, that one.

20
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:27,762
I'm not interested in anyone, not even in women.

21
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:30,031
Jeez, what a dull life!

22
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:33,560
I have an important match soon
and I almost couldn't be in it because of you.

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,880
Hey, it worked out in the end.

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:44,020
Credits

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,930
Leaving so early?

26
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,384
What about the presentation rehearsal?

27
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:51,393
Figure it out yourself.

28
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,405
Return my arrow fletches when you're done.

29
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:57,591
Don't worry about it.

30
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:14,583
I wonder what this means to him...

31
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,692
Like different personalities,
thoughts of sex and love may be all different.

32
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:28,381
Ye-beom has a kind of conservative disposition,
while So-young is a centrist.

33
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,591
And when it comes to Da-yeol's case...

34
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:46,990
In my opinion, on the contrary, even without love,

35
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,934
having sexual intercourse isn't an issue.

36
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,072
Because having sexual intercourse is joyful.

37
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,168
<i>Cool! Woo!</i>

38
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:07,504
Quiet!

39
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:09,504
Quiet!

40
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:15,220
As you can see, since thoughts of sex are different individually,

41
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,890
we should have open mind and act thoughtfully.

42
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,470
This is all for group 6's presentation.

43
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:22,385
Thank you.

44
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,036
He got me again.

45
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,096
Hey.

46
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:49,195
Are you going to shoot me?

47
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,881
Give it back before I actually kill you.

48
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,850
What's your deal? Why are you acting like this?

49
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,852
None of your business.

50
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:01,741
How scary...

51
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,845
Do you think this is a joke?

52
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:08,388
Shoot me.

53
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:12,818
<i>This isn't working.</i>

54
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:16,547
<i>This asshole is different from others.</i>

55
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:22,980
Forget it.

56
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,180
Just keep it.

57
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,717
Throw it away or whatever.

58
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,962
Are you really okay with that?

59
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:33,614
Let's not get involved in each other's business anymore, please.

60
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,643
Hey.

61
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:47,103
I'll really give it back.

62
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:48,379
I said I don't need it.

63
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:52,091
Are you sure?
Then I'll throw it away down the drain.

64
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:57,296
Seriously, you bastard...!

65
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,762
How can you be living so well and carefree like this?

66
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,399
It's been a while, aunt.

67
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,394
Smiling?

68
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,080
What's so funny?

69
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,530
You killed everybody!

70
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:28,940
Bring them all back, you shameless bastard! You murderer!

71
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,500
Bring them back!

72
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,990
Then...

73
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,500
should I just die?

74
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Would that fix everything?

75
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,890
If I died?

76
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,330
Die.

77
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,990
Go to the hell! Just die!

78
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,860
Die!

79
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,760
Die!

80
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:04,238
When analyzing modern poetry,
what's the most important aspect?

81
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,370
Instead of trying to analyze the whole line,

82
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,330
the last part of the sentence that reflects the poet's feelings, is more...

83
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,120
<i>Since that day, Cho Tae-hyun hasn't come to school.</i>

84
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,928
It's crucial to understand what the poet is trying to convey.

85
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:31,720
♫ <i>You handed it over all alone</i> ♫

86
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,890
♫ <i>In the spot there used to be pain</i> ♫

87
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,590
♫ <i>You'll mournfully cry</i> ♫

88
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,300
Don't play and you'll just lose. Rock-paper-scissors.
♫ <i>Like as if it was made up</i> ♫

89
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,260
♫ <i>You can rest here before you go</i> ♫

90
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,566
You're buying.

91
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,881
Da-yeol, are you going to practice?

92
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,600
Yes.

93
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,470
You're...

94
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,621
Don't you remember my name?
I told you before.

95
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:04,973
Kang So…

96
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:10,053
- Young.
- Right! You do remember my name.

97
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:16,627
By any chance, do you know why Cho Tae-hyun
is absent from school?

98
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:21,023
Tae-hyun? I have no clue.
He hasn't replied to my messages for three days.

99
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,730
Is Tae-hyun not at school? So that's why I couldn't find him.

100
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,670
Could it be you used your arrow and...?

101
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,057
Jang Won-kyung,
are you really a friend of Cho Tae?

102
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,476
So what? He's probably fine.

103
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:34,880
Don't worry. Tae-hyun disappears from time to time.

104
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,490
It's the first time he didn't come to school though.

105
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,769
I'm not worried. Thank you anyway, So-young.

106
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:45,614
Aren't you going to say hi to me?

107
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,768
We're not close enough
to greet each other, are we?

108
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,600
How annoying...

109
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,590
Bye Da-yeol. Good luck at the practice.

110
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,843
You can sure hold a grudge!

111
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:12,349
I think arrows are really honest.

112
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:17,787
It shows clearly how much you are distracted.

113
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,617
Is it obvious?

114
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:25,248
Are you concerned about something?

115
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,234
There's a guy I really hate.

116
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:34,290
I haven't seen him for a while,

117
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,660
and that's a good thing,

118
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,620
but I keep thinking about him.

119
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:42,261
It's like the wind.

120
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,880
I don't know what to do,

121
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,020
but then, I want to do something.

122
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,975
Just shoot.

123
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:58,370
Do as you wish.

124
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:14,378
Be quiet.

125
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,760
I don't have any special message to give you,

126
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,580
but as all of you know, the class president has been absent from school for three days.

127
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:27,313
Does anyone know if anything's going on with Cho Tae-hyun?

128
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:31,003
Then, is there anyone who can visit his home?

129
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,863
Don't you know he lives?

130
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,241
I don't. And I need to be home early
for an ancestor ceremony.

131
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,834
As if... You're just going to go to a PC room.

132
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,645
I mean it.

133
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,372
Then why don't you visit him?

134
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,082
I don't know where Tae-hyun's place is. 
 - How would I know?

135
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:45,918
No one?

136
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,368
Da-yeol.

137
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,154
Will you?

138
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:15,390
<i>Gosh, I'm crazy.</i>

139
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,730
<i>I even skipped practice.</i>

140
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,320
<i>Let's just check if he's alive.</i>

141
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,905
Hey, Cho Tae-hyun.

142
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,340
Hey, Cho Tae-hyun!

143
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,000
Cho Tae-hyun!

144
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,340
What? It's Da-yeol.

145
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,120
What is it?

146
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,547
Why aren't you coming to school?

147
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:16,232
Come on in.

148
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,851
Would you like something to drink?

149
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,895
- What do you have?
- Water.

150
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,605
Then, why did you ask?

151
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,340
What's that?

152
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,596
For the exam. Kang So-young asked me to give it to you.

153
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,396
So-young did?

154
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:46,730
Can I use your bathroom?

155
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,339
Over there.

156
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:17,220
<i>Now that I think about it, Cho Tae-hyun seems to be living alone.</i>

157
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,970
<i>That's not common at our age.</i>

158
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,968
Do you live alone?

159
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:26,420
Yes.

160
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,349
Your house looks nice.

161
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,620
Isn't there anyone who tells you to go to school?

162
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:41,309
<i>You murderer!</i>

163
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,944
<i>Wait.</i>

164
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,139
<i>No way…</i>

165
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,716
Do you want some fruit?

166
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:11,549
What's wrong?

167
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:13,742
I asked if you wanted some fruit.

168
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,970
Oh, sorry. I choked on my water.

169
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:35,450
Tears? He cried?

170
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,380
That guy?

171
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,210
There's nothing fresh.

172
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,150
This one is best.

173
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,426
You laughed at me when I exchanged
phone numbers for the first time.

174
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,786
I'm the only one who came?

175
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,320
I still have more friends than you.

176
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,390
Want to see my text messages?

177
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,781
What about you?

178
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:19,358
What brings you here?

179
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,785
As you mentioned, none of my friends came to see me.

180
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:25,480
<i>I was worried that you were dead.</i>

181
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:53,420
<i>He bothers me.</i>

182
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,600
<i>What's he doing?</i>

183
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,384
<i>He's smiling so brightly.</i>

184
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,700
By any chance...are you concerned about me?

185
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:11,268
No, I'm not.

186
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:14,180
What then?

187
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,010
Why did you come?

188
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,285
Are you going to continue skipping school?

189
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:21,904
So you are concerned about me.

190
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,197
No way!

191
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:25,860
Hey, you told me not to talk to you.

192
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,020
Doesn't that mean that you don't want to be my friend?

193
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,400
Would you want to
if you were in my shoes?

194
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,425
Visiting each other's house is generally what friends do.

195
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,394
So what?

196
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,650
You're just playing around with me anyways, aren't you?

197
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,300
Saying things like wanting to hit me with a toy hammer...

198
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,679
Did I?

199
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,360
Yeah you did.

200
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,382
You're just treating me like a toy.

201
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:54,200
If I feel like bugging and teasing you
because you're adorable,

202
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
can we not be friends?

203
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,732
Suit yourself. Be friends with me or whatever.

204
00:15:59,732 --> 00:16:01,443
You'll do whatever you want anyways...

205
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,962
Oh, do you mean it?

206
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,450
I'm leaving.

207
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,890
I don't care if you're coming to school or not.

208
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,959
Da-yeol.

209
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:22,688
See you tomorrow.

210
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,677
What's the subject for the first class?

211
00:16:43,677 --> 00:16:46,513
Isn't it Korean literature? Korean literature?

212
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,299
Ah, I'm tired.

213
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,203
Going to school is the hardest.

214
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:57,107
When can we be adults?
I want to go for a drink.

215
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,275
- Hey, Cho Tae.
- What is this?

216
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,661
- What took you so long? Where did you go?
- Did you miss me?

217
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,400
What have you been doing?

218
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,590
What took you so long to come to school?

219
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,831
<i>Ever since that day, something's changed.</i>

220
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,497
<i>Healthy food for an archer (Not bluffing)</i>

221
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,430
<i>Hey, is it yummy?</i>

222
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:15,785
Yum, sausage.
But they only give three pieces.

223
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,594
Hey, how come you picked out the beans?
Are you a kindergartner?

224
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:25,337
An athlete shouldn't be a picky eater.

225
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,937
Mind your own business.

226
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:29,483
Open your mouth, baby boy.

227
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,901
Put that away.

228
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,900
He doesn't want to eat with you.

229
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,000
Can I sit next to you, Da-yeol?

230
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,924
Me too, me too.

231
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,812
We can finally eat comfortably.

232
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:45,970
Starting in the 10th grade, I couldn't eat lunch comfortably because of them.

233
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,750
They kept stealing my food. So annoying...

234
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,170
Are you including me?

235
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,672
Absolutely.

236
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,220
We didn't steal, we shared among friends.

237
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,230
Right?

238
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,450
Lovely Da-yeol, you wouldn't do
such a shameless thing.

239
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,050
Right?

240
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,644
Have the three of you been in the same class
since 10th grade?

241
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,910
Yes. And now that we're in the same class this year too,
I'll have seen their faces for three years straight.

242
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,717
I'm sick of it.

243
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,170
I'm glad that we don't have Jang Won-kyung at least.

244
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,155
Lunch time was like war when he was around.

245
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:20,834
Why didn't you just abandon us and have lunch
with Da-yeol in the first place?

246
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:23,486
Right. I'm planning to do that from now on.

247
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:26,962
Hey, shouldn't you ask for Da-yeol's opinion too?

248
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,343
I'm okay with it.

249
00:19:29,343 --> 00:19:33,996
See? Da-yeol is very nice, unlike you two.

250
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:35,724
Have one more of my sausages.

251
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:38,376
- Hey!
- What?

252
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:40,010
Give me one.

253
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,513
I should take yours.

254
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,090
Leave it, or I'll hit you with my sausage.

255
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,570
Have you ever even slapped someone?

256
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,540
- Yes I have! Do you want to feel it?
- Try me, try me!

257
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,460
I will make red marks on your cheek.

258
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,600
Hey.

259
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,678
No practice tonight?

260
00:19:56,678 --> 00:20:00,381
Yeah, I want to conserve my condition for tomorrow's match.

261
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,866
How far are you going to follow me?

262
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:13,761
I'm not following you.
I'm on the way to the stationery store.

263
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:24,472
A cheering gift from your friend.

264
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,604
Good luck on tomorrow's match.

265
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,830
Do your best.

266
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,020
Yes, I will.

267
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,577
<i>Gyeyang Asia Archery</i> Good work today.

268
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,400
However, you didn't win because of your own skills.

269
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,410
The other players were awful.

270
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,243
Yes.

271
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:24,032
Keep the tension and don't get distracted.

272
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:28,644
Focus on getting some rest until Thursday. I'll see you at school.

273
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:31,347
Thank you.

274
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,060
<i>Lee Da-yeol becomes a semifinalist at the 12th National High School Archery Competition.</i>

275
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,694
Oh, Da-yeol!

276
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:49,958
Hey, let's go play basketball.

277
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,458
You want to?

278
00:21:57,257 --> 00:21:58,467
Where are you going?

279
00:21:58,467 --> 00:21:59,840
Hey, let's play basketball together.

280
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,770
Later. Bye.

281
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,278
Hey!

282
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,992
Going to practice?

283
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,070
Yes. What about you?

284
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,230
We've been told to rest until Thursday.

285
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,741
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

286
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,341
See you tomorrow.

287
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,000
Da-yeol.

288
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,732
What's up with your reflexes?

289
00:22:39,732 --> 00:22:41,533
Did you win yesterday?

290
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,100
Do you want to know?

291
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,500
You must have lost...

292
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,157
I won.
Why are you trying to pick a fight?

293
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:49,883
You have practice today too?

294
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:52,400
No practice until Thursday.

295
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,300
That's sweet.

296
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,940
You're on the way to the classroom, right? Let's go together.

297
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,338
You should eat it before it melts.

298
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,814
What?

299
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:12,766
I'm going to take classes in this seat today.

300
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,343
Go back to your own seat.

301
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:17,160
The social studies teacher won't mind.

302
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,990
Besides, your seat partner likes my seat because it's right beside the window.

303
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,114
Go back to your seat right now.

304
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,765
Be quiet.

305
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:37,431
Turn to page 71. We'll start the class from there today.

306
00:23:43,347 --> 00:23:49,719
The study of social and cultural phenomena
can be divided into macro and micro perspectives.

307
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,339
<i>This is Lee Da-yeol.</i>

308
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,351
This macro perspective focuses on social system.

309
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,020
<i>Why do you keep acting like we're close?</i>

310
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,400
The micro perspective focuses on
individual relationships.

311
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,260
<i>How cruel!</i>

312
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,000
<i>Aren't we friend's now?</i>

313
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,778
<i>I still hate you.</i>

314
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:19,533
This macro perspective is...

315
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,640
Keep hating me.

316
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,270
When somebody likes me, I start to hate them.

317
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,210
<i>"NAVER."</i>

318
00:24:35,816 --> 00:24:38,216
What's so funny?

319
00:24:38,216 --> 00:24:41,810
Cho Tae-hyun, why are you sitting there?

320
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,940
Do you all think I'm a pushover?

321
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,863
Okay, everyone who switched seats return to your own seats.

322
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,963
I'm sorry.

323
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,786
Naver? Such a lunatic.

324
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,549
Hey, do you know where Tae-hyun is by any chance?

325
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,409
Why are you asking me?

326
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,611
Aren't you close?

327
00:25:14,611 --> 00:25:16,179
Me?

328
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:19,110
It's just... you two often hang out together.

329
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,670
Anyway, do you not know where he is?

330
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:25,423
He's probably sleeping in the classroom.

331
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,550
See? He is your close friend.

332
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,630
Please give this to him.

333
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,180
Bye.

334
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:46,768

Do you hate me that much?

344
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:25,900
You told me to continually hate you.

345
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,447
In any case, about the nosebleed I'm so...

346
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,549
So…?

347
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,633
...rry.

348
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:33,109
Are you trying to apologize to me?

349
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,750
Hey, lunatic. Why would I apologize to you?

350
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,650
Never!
Neither did you.

351
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,036
You've never asked me to apologize to you.

352
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,771
Let's call it even with the previous event.

353
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:48,024
Call it even with the previous one?

354
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,714
How can you say that so easily?

355
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:53,771
What now?

356
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,600
Do you really think I am a fool, because I'm holding back?

357
00:27:57,565 --> 00:28:00,903
Have you ever apologized to me even once?

358
00:28:00,903 --> 00:28:04,206
Is it necessary to say sorry between friends?

359
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,443
I don't think I can be friends with you.

360
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:11,110
Okay.

361
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,770
If I apologize, can we be friends?

362
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,550
You don't mean it.

363
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,496
What makes you think that?

364
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,098
Seriously?

365
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:23,160
Think of what you did.
Because of you, I almost couldn't compete in the match.

366
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,080
If I fail this, it's like being expelled to me.

367
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:36,254
I didn't know you liked archery that much.

368
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,925
What?

369
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,090
I just never see it.

370
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,020
You smiling brightly...

371
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,100
when you do archery.

372
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,987
<i>Have I?</i>

373
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,280
What are you doing?

374
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:12,675
Hey, come on, Shin Ye-beom.

375
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,490
Hey, where are you going?

376
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,590
Where are you going? So-young, do you know where he's going?

377
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:26,910
Ouch, too hot.

378
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,640
I thought it was a hot pad.

379
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:32,420
Why isn't anyone helping you out?

380
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:36,775
If you're doing this because you feel sorry for me,
you don't have to.

381
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,370
You're not seeing my sincerity.

382
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,320
I regret helping you.

383
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,523
I didn't ask you to give me a hand.
