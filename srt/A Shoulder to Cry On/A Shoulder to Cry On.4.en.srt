(A Shoulder to Cry On)

2
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:05,632
Episode 4. An arrow of no regrets

3
00:01:08,426 --> 00:01:09,344
Tae-hyun.

4
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:27,153
If you don't feel like talking, why
don't you try to paint your favorite?

5
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:45,088
What's this? Is it your favorite?

6
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,658
Are you that curious about it?
You should've asked earlier then.

7
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:22,751
Did you really kill a person?

8
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,799
It seems so.

9
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:42,599
I know that look all too well.

10
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:45,792
When someone feels so much disdain,

11
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,396
that their whole person starts to distort.

12
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:59,913
(10 years ago, Sky Orphanage)

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Tae-hyun.

14
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:17,347
You can take it.

15
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:22,560
Tae-hyun.

16
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:24,813
You can take them.

17
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:30,819
Tae-hyun, I'm fond of you, how about you?
How about living with my husband and me?

18
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:33,655
Really?

19
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:42,301
At first, there used to
be just the three of us.

20
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:46,793
It's amazing. So I prepared this~.

21
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:49,379
- It's pretty, right?
- Yeah, it's so pretty.

22
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,173
Until my family became four.

23
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:06,194
Auntie…when is Mom coming back?

24
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:08,940
Pretty soon.

25
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:26,916
Gosh, your drawing is terrible.
Is that you in the middle?

26
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,045
Hey, by the way, why
are you not painting me?

27
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:33,339
Because you don't live with us.

28
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:42,189
How come you didn't paint the baby that's
about to be born? Draw the baby right now.

29
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:57,405
If the baby is born,
should I go back to an orphanage?

30
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,698
I have no idea.

31
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:06,623
If you are a good boy and wait for Mom
nicely, you wont have to go back there.

32
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,919
I don't want a baby sister or brother.

33
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:17,759
Hey, don't say that.
Where did you learn such language?

34
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,929
I just want the baby sister or brother..

35
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,097
To die and disappear…

36
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:26,756
Are you crazy?

37
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:30,855
I told you not to talk like that! My
sister tried so hard to get pregnant.

38
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,651
Hey! Where are you going? Hey!

39
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:38,613
Unlock the door right now!

40
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:50,500
Tae-hyun, I'm home.

41
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,210
Are you home?

42
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:54,068
Where is Tae-hyun?

43
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:56,172
He's in his room.

44
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,175
You should wake up.

45
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:01,496
Tae-hyun.

46
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:08,017
He's not in his room.

47
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,604
What? He's not here, either.

48
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:17,026
What on earth did were you doing?
You didn't notice that he wasn't here?

49
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:19,654
Well, I scolded him just before, though..

50
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,283
Sister!

51
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:41,050
It's my fault, please don't leave me...

52
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:50,518
Tae-hyun!

53
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:01,654
Mom… Mom.

54
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:09,162
Tae-hyun.

55
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:13,666
Mom!

56
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,182
Tae-hyun!!!

57
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,106
Mom.

58
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:47,570
Even though my head was hurt, I felt
nothing. I was totally fine... really, but...

59
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,202
How come I'm constantly reminded of
the way he looked at me?

60
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,480
I think it's time for
me to start dating girls.

61
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:09,258
So many girls are lining up to
date me, but I don't like any of them.

62
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:11,677
Da-yeol?

63
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:18,518
What's going on? Whats with this vibe?

64
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,228
Nothing really.

65
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,831
Just a few days ago, you two
were like two peas in a pod.

66
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:30,154
This cold silence, did you two have a
fight? Or did you cut him out of your life?

67
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:31,322
Or did he cut you out?

68
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:33,699
I don't know, asshole.

69
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,119
You must've gotten cut off. How sad!

70
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:43,417
You didn't draw a bow until
the very end, that's not right, is it?

71
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:46,462
- Sir, I'll get going.
- Okay, well done.

72
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:47,547
See you tomorrow.

73
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:50,299
Do your best for tomorrow's match. Go, go!

74
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,242
-It's Sunday at the
Gae-yang Archery Stadium.

75
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:20,705
-Two athletes who won the quarterfinals
are competing in the semi-finals.

76
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:22,832
-It's quite windy.

77
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:25,751
-Right, the athletes
should really factor that in.

78
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,100
-You're right. First of all, Kwon
Min-jung from Saehyun High school

79
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:32,758
-...will compete with Lee
Da-yeol from the same school.

80
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,812
-120 athletes from 32
high schools had have competed,

81
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:39,473
and now there's
only 8 boys and girls left.

82
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:46,147
-Right. Let's keep an eye
on how they perform today!

83
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:47,023
-Yes.

84
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:55,823
-Lee Da-yeol gets ready to shoot first.
He's had a lot of ups and downs lately.

85
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,432
-He's about to shoot the
very first arrow for the final.

86
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:05,791
- X-10!
- Yes, X-10.

87
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,420
-Lee Da-yeol marks an X-10,
catching his breath.

88
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:18,012
Does everything I want and desire,

89
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:21,599
have to end up like this?

90
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,144
-Both athletes are tied with
two sets each this round.

91
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:29,273
-Kwon Min-jung is about
to shoot the third arrow.

92
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,014
The wind is stronger than
4 meters (a second) now.

93
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:32,818
-That's right.

94
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:35,237
-He's showing a bit of hesitation...

95
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:38,199
- X-10!
- Yes.

96
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:41,160
-Kwon Min-jung gets another
consecutive X-10 in this semi-final.

97
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,204
-He shot X-10 five shots in a row.

98
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:48,793
- Yes, right. 2 shots for the first
set and 3 shots for the second set.

99
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:51,070
-In this situation, Lee Da-yeol
must be feeling the pressure.

100
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:53,255
-Yes, he must be.

101
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:57,343
-After Kwon Min-jung, the
next arrow is being drawn.

102
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:04,183
- X-10! Lee Da-yeol is hot on the trail.
A bold shot in such a brief amount of time.

103
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,437
-Kwon Min-jung is about to
shoot the last arrow of the third set.

104
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:16,278
-X-10! A gets a bullseye! Amazing!

105
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:17,947
-Yes, amazing concentration.

106
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:21,283
-The more sets in, the
better Kwon Min-jung gets.

107
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:22,743
Stay steady.

108
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:25,079
-Can Lee Da-yeol keep up?

109
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:31,460
- 8…Jeez…Lee Da-yeol gets an 8.
- Yes.

110
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:36,841
In this circumstance, Kwon Min-jung is
1 point ahead, taking the third set.

111
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:07,955
If my head was really injured back then...

112
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,375
could I ever go back
to the way I was before?

113
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,682
-Lee Da-yeol is preparing the
most important shot for the fourth set,

114
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:41,784
and the gap between the two
contenders is relatively small.

115
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:59,673
- Did you…indeed kill a person?
- Are you really that curious about it?

116
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:01,717
You should've asked earlier then.

117
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,887
Aiming takes a bit longer.

118
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,065
This is all because of..

119
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,193
Lee Da-yeol.

120
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:28,661
- Ouch, he missed it.
- He hit the 6.

121
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:33,958
- He's been keeping up so far,
shooting 9s and 10s consecutively.

122
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,378
-He should've shot more
than 8…because it's too windy.

123
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,447
- Yes, it must have affected a lot.

124
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:43,808
- The last shot will decide
who goes to the final.

125
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:48,639
- If he hits over 6, he's going to the final.
- Yes.

126
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:00,109
- He's shaking too much.
- Yes, he doesn’t look so good, either.

127
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:00,651
Oh!

128
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:03,821
Foul!

129
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,538
Hey, Kwon Min-jung.
What the hell are you doing?

130
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:13,497
What the heck! Come on. Go inside.

131
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:14,707
Are you kidding me?

132
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,041
Min-jung, go inside.

133
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,753
- Hey, hey, where the hell are you going?
- Go inside!

134
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:21,171
Hey, Kwon Min-jung!

135
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:43,569
It hurts. It's not OK at all.

136
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:56,908
Hey, Kwon Min-jung! Did you screw up
on purpose because the coach told you to?

137
00:16:58,834 --> 00:16:59,710
What on earth are you talking about?

138
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,880
I heard everything,
don't try to deny it!

139
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,176
Why the hell did you do?
I don't get it at all. Why?

140
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,095
I will quit.

141
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:11,680
What…?

142
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,144
I will quit archery.

143
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:24,610
I didn't screw up on
purpose. I did my best.

144
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:26,802
Even so, why are you quitting?

145
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:32,701
Da-yeol, my shoulder is blown.

146
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:35,120
What?

147
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,584
I should have noticed much earlier.

148
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:45,005
It's not your fault.

149
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:50,135
Attending a match will be too hard.
Better go into rehab.

150
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:56,308
I will attend the next match
and then quit archery.

151
00:17:56,725 --> 00:18:01,563
Drop it. You've made too many mistakes.
You'd better...

152
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:03,232
No way.

153
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:11,757
Go to rehab, then.
Afterwards, you can start over.

154
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:12,449
No.

155
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:24,420
This is what I'm capable of. Quitting
archery won't ruin my life or anything.

156
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:29,049
Are you sure
you won't regret your today's decision?

157
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:41,562
Da-yeol, is there even one arrow you
shot today that you have regrets about?

158
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:50,362
For me, there's none.
Because I did my best till the last arrow.

159
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:57,327
Even though they weren't excellent
like normal ones…

160
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,296
I'll get going.

161
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:19,892
Lee Da-yeol, congratulations.
Since you beat me and advance to the final,

162
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:22,394
You should win in next match for sure.

163
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:51,320
Sociopath: Because of you...

164
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:53,175
Because of you…?

165
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:00,933
Hello?

166
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,230
Is it fun?

167
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:09,900
Because of you…Lee Da-yeol…

168
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,319
What the heck!

169
00:20:12,736 --> 00:20:17,699
I used not to be like this…I was fine.

170
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:20,869
Cho Tae-hyun?

171
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:23,956
I feel dizzy…I'm bleeding..

172
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:28,210
What? Bleeding? Where are you?

173
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:33,715
Where is it?!!! Hello? Hello?

174
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:51,900
Cho Tae-hyun?

175
00:20:54,111 --> 00:20:55,863
Hey, Cho Tae-hyun?

176
00:20:58,198 --> 00:21:04,288
Hey! Hey, Cho Tae-hyun! What's going on?
Are you all right?

177
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:09,459
Jeez…Da-yeol again…

178
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:12,880
You did this yourself?

179
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:19,011
Why are you here? Are you worried about me?

180
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:21,763
Let's go to the hospital.

181
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,850
Are you dumb?

182
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,440
I've played you like a toy…
don't you remember?

183
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,068
Can you stand up?

184
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:41,033
I'm a murderer. I'm a damn murderer.

185
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,577
Shut up.

186
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:14,149
Are you okay?

187
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:16,777
Are you really Lee Da-yeol?

188
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:18,820
No, I'm Sam Da-yeol.

189
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:25,327
Hearing your dad-joke,
you're definitely Da-yeol.

190
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:32,626
- What did the doctor say?
- Just a flesh wound. Nothing serious.

191
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,421
What happened?

192
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:41,260
I myself hit my head with a plant.

193
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:45,180
Have you finally gone insane?

194
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:48,892
Just kidding, I accidentally fell down.

195
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:52,604
Hey, then why did you blame me?
Falling down by mistake?

196
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,774
Yes. It's all because of you.

197
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:03,156
I don't know…I just hate…

198
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:05,192
The way you looked at me with disgust.

199
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:09,538
You said you liked me one day
but suddenly decided to avoid me...

200
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:13,488
When I said, "I like you", I
felt like I was forced to,

201
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:16,128
...because of the situation. And calling
it disgusting is way too much.

202
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:25,387
What's this?

203
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:28,140
Change your blood-stained shirt.

204
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,059
Jeez… this isn't fashionable
at all. What's with the cats?

205
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,270
That shirt is new.

206
00:23:34,062 --> 00:23:35,188
It doesn't smell good either.

207
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:37,524
It's new!

208
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,209
When I said I killed someone...

209
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:14,644
I meant that it was because of me that my mom
died, well I guess you could call her my mom.

210
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:22,444
Cho Tae-hyun started talking first.

211
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:28,572
Talking about it like it
just happened,

212
00:24:29,182 --> 00:24:33,497
calm and collected like it
was someone else's story.

213
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,764
Will you go somewhere with me?

214
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,428
You really plan on dragging a patient
fresh out of the hospital somewhere?

215
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:02,359
Maybe so...

216
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:06,863
At any rate, tell me where or
this will turn into a kidnapping.

217
00:25:06,863 --> 00:25:08,115
When we get there you'll know.

218
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:20,419
Ahh, cold!

219
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,482
I think you drink way too much every day.

220
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:32,556
It was you who invited me!
Anyway, have this. It's good.

221
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:34,975
No way, let's swap, something's fishy...

222
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:36,226
No way.

223
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,024
Jeez, jocks are way too strong...

224
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,075
Damn! Are you crazy?

225
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,329
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you buy these?

226
00:25:57,914 --> 00:26:00,792
Damn, you even got some in my mouth...

227
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:06,339
Hey, wash your hands.

228
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:11,887
You're right…all sticky. Even
the shirt smells like apple.

229
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,432
I'm sorry.

230
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:23,273
You're crazy, what the hell!

231
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:24,941
Revenge, you brat.

232
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:27,027
Ah!

233
00:26:58,475 --> 00:27:00,352
How did you find this spot?

234
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,565
After working out and feeling down,
I'd often come here alone.

235
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:10,946
Did you really take a patient here
to show them this view?

236
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:20,372
Well… it's nice at least.

237
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,170
…I won today.

238
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:29,506
Wow.

239
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:35,554
But, weirdly enough, I
don't feel happy about it.

240
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,975
Ignoring me and focusing on practice,
you should feel good now.

241
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:43,520
I don't know why.

242
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,189
Before I used to be really desperate.

243
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:52,237
Maybe it's because I didn't
do as good as I could've.

244
00:27:55,365 --> 00:28:00,036
Or maybe I made the wrong choice.

245
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,416
So,

246
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:14,509
I wont have any regrets about my decisions.
For archery or for anything else.

247
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,974
I have no clue what you're talking about.

248
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,059
I know.

249
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:30,275
Cho Tae-hyun.

250
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:33,111
Yes?

251
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,990
I'm not good at comforting people.

252
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:40,368
That's why I took you here.

253
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:49,544
I know you know that I have no friends.
Just my home life, school and archery.

254
00:28:55,508 --> 00:28:58,887
Well…what I wanted to say is…

255
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:03,433
It wasn’t your fault.

256
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:05,644
Sorry?

257
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:12,651
Everything that happened
before was an accident.

258
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,075
It wasn't your fault.

259
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:37,717
Honestly, I'm relieved that
you are awful as I thought you were.

260
00:29:37,717 --> 00:29:38,760
Stop…

261
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,142
Let’s go.

262
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:59,484
(Next Episode)
It's easier to think it's all my fault.

263
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:02,237
Now what should I do?

264
00:32:03,947 --> 00:32:05,490
You like him, don't you?

265
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,908
Tae-hyun may not think the same as you.

266
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,244
I'm sorry. I came too late,

267
00:32:09,786 --> 00:32:11,287
Could it be with a male friend?

268
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:13,229
They normally hang out like that.

269
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,641
Adorable.

270
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,793
Will you keep this one?

271
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:21,381
The 12th National High
School Archery Tournament.

272
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:24,425
Today is the final day to
decide who will come out on top!
