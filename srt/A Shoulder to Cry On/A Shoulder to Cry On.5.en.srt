00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,300
(A Shoulder To Cry On)

2
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:06,191
Episode 5： Not passion, but acceptance.

3
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,748
Bye-bye.

4
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,919
…this T-shirt..?

5
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,531
Wash it and give it back to me.

6
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,680
…are you not going?

7
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,897
Yes, see you tomorrow. I'll get going.

8
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,652
(Mister)

9
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,906
Hello.

10
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,450
You used a credit card in a hospital.

11
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,452
Not much.

12
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,788
What happened?

13
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,251
Nothing, pay it no mind.

14
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,754
You remember your
mom's ritual is pretty soon, right?

15
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,550
I know.

16
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,720
How about attending this time?

17
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,599
Nobody will welcome me.
I'd better not attend.

18
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,194
How long will you avoid it?

19
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:09,606
I will hang up first.

20
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,414
It was not your fault.

21
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:41,888
He was the very
first to tell me that.

22
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,852
That's what I've wanted
to hear for a long time.

23
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,329
Since I dreamed of Joo-mong,
I knew how it would be.

24
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,542
What's this all about?
How did you know how it would turn out?

25
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,588
Since you didn't answer your
phone, I contacted your coach directly.

26
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:17,740
I heard you beat Min-jung, right?

27
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,134
Yes.

28
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,928
How come you look down!

29
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,722
…I barely beat him.

30
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,392
Whether you barely
won or not doesn't matter.

31
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,688
Winning is everything.
I'm so proud of you, my son!

32
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:34,533
You only have the final
ahead.

33
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:36,401
Since you must be tired, let
me get you some refreshing food.

34
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,405
Take a break for a while. I will set
the table and get you. Relax!

35
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,916
Thinking about how what
happened was all my fault…

36
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,794
I actually felt comfortable.

37
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,258
Hearing that it wasn't my fault,

38
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,012
How should I continue to live my life?

39
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,923
The final match will be with Choi
Tae-wook, right? He's unbeatable.

40
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,675
No one can beat him except Min-jung.

41
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,471
Hello.

42
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,143
But… maybe he'll lose.

43
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:58,459
In order to win, Da-yeol broke
Min-jung's shoulder at the previous night.

44
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,545
Crazy…is that for real?

45
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,213
- We'd better stay away from him.
- Ok.

46
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,836
Mom, I'm sorry that I
came too late to see you.

47
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,737
How impudent could
you be to come here?

48
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:12,992
Just a poor pathetic orphan who
doesn't deserve to see my sister!

49
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,536
Calm down! Jin-hee!

50
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,622
Let go of me!

51
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:23,044
Because of him…my sister died!

52
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,295
Please stop being so incessant.

53
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,255
What?

54
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:31,928
Because of your guilt, you put
the blame on me. Please stop it.

55
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,600
For what reason on Earth
should I feel guilty? You killed her.

56
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,894
You killed my poor sister…

57
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:45,149
It…was…just an accident.

58
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,070
You never kicked me out of the house.

59
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,366
I didn't intend to go out and have her
look for me and get into an accident...

60
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,117
I'm in hell because of this too!

61
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:03,626
One moment…everything is gone
it became all my fault…

62
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,171
I've lived with the thought for 10 years.

63
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,299
Damn, I also needed to be comforted…

64
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:18,975
Tae-hyun…

65
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,106
Let go of me. Now that seeing me is painful,

66
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,277
Leave me all alone... I get it!

67
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,695
No, I mean…

68
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,494
Tae-hyun...

69
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:44,917
I became someone who can't like anyone.

70
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,733
How come you didn't come to school?

71
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,073
(What are you doing now?)

72
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,577
I'm just at home.

73
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,164
(Same here...)

74
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:28,586
Are you all right?

75
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:33,215
(Thanks to you.)

76
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:38,679
When will you go to school again?

77
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:46,062
(Well…are you concerned about me?)

78
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:56,072
Yes…

79
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,287
(When I'm not wearing bandages I will)

80
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,122
(It's shameful.)

81
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,420
Yes…

82
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,383
(How are you doing?)

83
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,552
I'm doing okay.

84
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,098
(Got it.)

85
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,643
(…Da-yeol.)

86
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:42,910
Thank you.

87
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,760
(See you next week.)

88
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,387
Okay.

89
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:30,683
Hey, if your constipation is that bad,
drink some prune juice.

90
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,711
- Stop talking about that. It's gross!
- No, it hasn't happened.

91
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:42,920
- Then they go out to the school cafeteria.
- Oh, that sounds damn good.

92
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,597
Huh? Da-yeol, good morning!

93
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,433
Hey, come on.

94
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,643
Did you have breakfast? Same here.

95
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,188
What is it on you lips?
You had the rice cake skewer, right?

96
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,356
Huh? You had it alone?

97
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,237
Is there a scar?

98
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,035
Here?

99
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,454
- A bit inward.
- Here?

100
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,999
I can't see any.

101
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:17,713
Leaving such a thing on a
good-looking face, it's a national tragedy.

102
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,302
There's nothing there.
Were you really hurt?

103
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,221
Do you think I was just
putting on a show then?

104
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,601
Well… maybe you aren't that crazy.

105
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,270
What on earth are you doing?

106
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,941
You brat.

107
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,695
Damn it, you totally ignored us before.

108
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,533
Gosh, you don't have any friends
in the archery club, do you?

109
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,119
I'll get going.

110
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,625
He's only ignoring me, damn it.

111
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,961
Bye-bye, Da-yeol.

112
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,050
Hard to meet you these days.

113
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,469
My gosh.

114
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,847
You are so damn weird.

115
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,685
Don't overreact, you brat. It's just
because I have fun being with him.

116
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,480
Would you like to go play basketball?

117
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,736
Stop talking nonsense.

118
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,509
- Hey.
- Hello.

119
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,599
- He broke Min-jung's shoulder.
- Really?

120
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,933
Jeez.

121
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,529
In this poem,
the writer doesn't resist fading flowers.

122
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:12,119
Right? As providence of Great Nature,
he just accepts it stoically.

123
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,665
When a petal falls, he watches…

124
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,833
Lee Da-yeol.

125
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,859
Because he'd like to see beauty of fading
flowers, what did he do? He blew out the candle.

126
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,721
Blowing out the candle enabled shade of flowers
to be shown...

127
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,972
(Cho Tae-hyun -&gt; Damn Tae-hyun)

128
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,808
Ouch!

129
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:41,315
You brat! Lee Da-yeol, why are
you in the wrong seat? Huh? This brat.

130
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:48,757
Because of you, I'm being punished as well.

131
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,576
Hey, It was not because of me
but because you made a loud noise.

132
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,703
Gosh!

133
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,632
You shouldn't have bitten me that hard.

134
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,887
Jeez..next class is Society
and Culture and I literally hate it.

135
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,181
How come?

136
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,850
Because we won't be able to sit together.

137
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,218
Hey, what are you doing?

138
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,805
Using proffessional jargon, I'm grooming.

139
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,311
It doesn't look good enough.

140
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,987
- Hey, I can't see anything.
- Are you crazy? It's gross.

141
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,532
Hey, is it possible with a male friend?

142
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,372
He seems to bug Tae-hyun.
They hang out like that.

143
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,087
- Hey, stinky?
- Gosh, put it away.

144
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:49,485
Do you not mind using the same cup
that someone else used?

145
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,821
He is not someone else.

146
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,782
Then, who?

147
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,329
- Friends?
- Friends?

148
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:06,668
Jeez…too weird. Where is Ye-bum?

149
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,885
Hey!

150
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,155
Cute.

151
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,577
- Which part?
- What?

152
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,079
Did you not go to
the gym to practice?

153
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,082
I'm here to pack my schoolbag.

154
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,962
Da-yeol, am I cute?

155
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,341
What the hell. I'll get going. Tell a homeroom
teacher that I can't come back for the end.

156
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,844
Am I cute?!!!!

157
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:50,480
Eun-ji, am I cute? Do I look adorable?

158
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,942
What the hell...?

159
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,654
Cute?

160
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,746
Pasha.

161
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,498
What is it about?

162
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,293
Now that you face the final soon
I'm sending you energy.

163
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,837
How is it? Do you not feel invigorated?

164
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,340
Not really.

165
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,802
When you smile,
do you recognize you look amazingly naïve?

166
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,513
You shouldn't smile to anyone else.

167
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,599
Smile only to me. Got it?

168
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,602
Lee Da-yeol, how popular!

169
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,437
Jang Won-kyung.

170
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,606
I'm not here to see you.

171
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,775
Let's talk for a minute.

172
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,526
I should go to practice.

173
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,030
I want to talk about Tae-hyun.

174
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,240
What's wrong with Tae-hyun?

175
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,116
You don't have to know.

176
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,118
What's going on here?

177
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,164
Come out.

178
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,961
Hey, you two aren't
going to fight, are you?

179
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,381
Jeez, a fight? No way. We're not kids.

180
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,386
So... tell me.

181
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:08,225
Since I brought up Cho Tae-hyun, you came
out to talk with me and didn't ignore me.

182
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,644
If you keep spewing nonsense, I'll get going.

183
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,229
What on earth are you?

184
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,480
What?

185
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:14,950
What the hell are you?

186
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:20,002
Even though Cho Tae-hyun bullied you that
much, how could you still hang out with him?

187
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,659
I'm not done talking yet.

188
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,579
Let go of me.

189
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,543
I was going to beat up on you
but I waited, considering Cho Tae(-hyun).

190
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,878
You tend to brush me aside so easily.

191
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,675
I told you to let go of me.

192
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,387
Stop glowering, you brat.

193
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,306
Would I keep you from
entering the final match?

194
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:58,150
You like him, don't you?

195
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,741
Tae-hyun may not think as you think.

196
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,451
Hey, Jang Won-kyung.

197
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,370
Don't fight!

198
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,040
I'm just being courteous and
teaching him, not picking a fight.

199
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,124
Who believes that?

200
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,375
Me?

201
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,502
Go away or I'll tell the teacher.

202
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,000
God damn it.
There's no one on my side.

203
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:29,765
So-young, don't like him that much.
I'd hate to see you weeping.

204
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,476
What the heck…

205
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,521
Are you all right? Did Jang Won-kyung hit you?

206
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,773
No…

207
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,901
He is a kind of weirdo but getting worse.

208
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,278
…look, So-young.

209
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,657
When it comes to this,
can you keep between us?

210
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,327
The two of you
didn't fight anyway.

211
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,954
I got it. My lips are sealed.

212
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,582
Thank you. I'll get going.

213
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,884
Gather round!

214
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,554
Da-yeol's final is soon
and our archery team...

215
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:17,187
needs to build up their
mental training as well.

216
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:22,484
From today to this weekend, keep in mind that you
will have a physical training every early morning.

217
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,111
That's all.

218
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,780
Thank you.

219
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,996
Da-yeol, let's have a talk.

220
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,846
Trying my best isn't an issue.

221
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,365
Are you having a tough time?

222
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,517
No.

223
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,355
You don't have to be swayed
by others' words too much.

224
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,066
It's because they miss Min-jung.

225
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,237
You are bound to do
what you can do in this moment.

226
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,410
Frankly…I just…

227
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,915
I just think that if I lost that day,
what would have happened to me?

228
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:21,918
How come?

229
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,464
I guess I don't deserve it.

230
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:31,553
In a world of competition, that's nonsense.
Do you not want to win a medal?

231
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:43,148
Even if things aren't easy, you
don't seem to be acting maliciously.

232
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,274
Sorry?

233
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,571
I guess you're... exploding with passion?

234
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,410
Exploding…

235
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:00,415
At times, excessive enthusiasm or diligence…

236
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,168
may cause bad outcomes, though.

237
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,729
Nevertheless, without enthusiasm,

238
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,065
How come I'm doing this?

239
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,831
Going home alone?

240
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,000
Were you waiting for me?

241
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,753
No, I played basketball with Won-kyung.

242
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,130
Did you?

243
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:53,635
What makes you look so depressed?
Can you not concentrate on practice?

244
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,597
No, so many thoughts
are swirling in my mind.

245
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,266
What kinds of thoughts?

246
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,060
Not about you.

247
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,079
Oh~~you seem to become
more comfortable with me.

248
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,316
What are you doing this weekend?

249
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,610
Physical training…

250
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,405
Crazy…during whole weekend?

251
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,699
I have the final match so soon.

252
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:19,244
Jeez, it's too difficult to
be friends with an archer.

253
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:21,538
Tae-hyun.

254
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,961
This one.

255
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,422
Will you keep it instead?

256
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:31,923
How come?

257
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,384
Just because.

258
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:41,850
Isn't this your charm? Won't it be a jinx?

259
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,353
Take it.

260
00:26:56,497 --> 00:26:57,947
I'm home.

261
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,089
My son! I need to make a trip to Busan.

262
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,968
Never skip meals! Go, go for the final match!

263
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,533
During the entire time I've done archery,

264
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,870
I've gathered only memorable arrows.

265
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,916
Shooting well or winning…

266
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,001
Or…

267
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,799
Feeling happy.

268
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,096
I didn't have a lot of those arrows.

269
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:09,187
Thinking back, I had no special goal.

270
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:15,443
Rather than desire of winning a gold medal
or being a member of a national team.

271
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,115
Now that I had nothing but archery,

272
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:26,204
I was scared to fail.

273
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,707
Gyeyang-gu District Mayor's
Cup National Archery Competition,

274
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:14,544
now it's the final match
to determine the championship.

275
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,551
Are you ready? Then let's go.

276
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,059
Let's do our best.

277
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,500
(Next Episode)
Hasn't he said anything to you?

278
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,709
He likes you.

279
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,629
My goodness, I got to see the whole damned shit.

280
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,424
Tae-hyun, I like you.

281
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,010
Looking great, why didn't you go further?

282
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,262
Let's talk…

283
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:47,971
What's wrong with you?

284
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:53,935
I don't want to hear anything, you brat!
Please get out of my sight!

285
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,646
Da-yeol quit archery.

286
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,606
Today is the last day Da-yeol comes to school.

287
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:02,694
Lee Da-yeol! Please listen!
