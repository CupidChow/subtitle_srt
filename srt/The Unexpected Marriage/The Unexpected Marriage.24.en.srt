=Episode 24=

3
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,490
Doctor.

4
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,430
How is Jing?

5
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,940
Your Majesty.

6
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,240
His Highness's wound

7
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,870
did not hit a vital point.

8
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,810
- Very good.
- That's good.

9
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,070
Very good.

10
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,380
- Very good.
- But...

11
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,560
But what?

12
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,400
Tell me quickly.

13
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,100
The assassin's weapon

14
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,700
was poisonous.

15
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,030
Poisonous?

16
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,560
What should we do?

17
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,870
I'm afraid His Highness...

18
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,770
Changsheng.

19
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,010
Don't worry.

20
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,490
Chu Ge has been captured.

21
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,730
She'll be interrogated carefully

22
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,870
and asked to hand over the antidote.

23
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,960
Someone,

24
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,700
bring the guilty woman to trial now.

25
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,520
Whatever the method,

26
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,820
we'll make her hand over the antidote.

27
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,290
Yes.

28
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,780
Father, please

29
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,890
let me interrogate her myself.

30
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,770
Child.

31
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,160
That's a killing machine...

32
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,380
Well, calm down.

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,050
I will definitely send someone

34
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,380
to protect Changsheng.

35
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,850
No.

36
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
Father.

37
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,350
I want to interrogate her alone.

38
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,330
Dad, Mom.

39
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,430
You guys go back first.

40
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,630
Be careful, Changsheng.

41
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,610
Let's go.

42
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,430
Miss Ru Jing.

43
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,700
Get in and see him.

44
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,850
Changsheng.

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,400
Go ahead.

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
Rest assured.

47
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,330
Me, Zilv and the doctor are here.

48
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,470
We won't let anything happen to him.

49
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,100
Thank you, Aunt.

50
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,490
Rest assured.

51
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,240
I will cooperate with the doctor

52
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,080
to save His Highness.

53
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,400
Wait for me.

54
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,130
Your Highness.

55
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,820
From now on,

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,540
you can be able to rest easy.

57
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,110
It's just that

58
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,820
I can't accompany you anymore.

59
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,190
Sorry.

60
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,570
Princess Consort Qin.

61
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,110
You can go.

62
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,090
I won't give you the antidote.

63
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,800
You can use any punishment you want.

64
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,790
I am not afraid of death.

65
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,110
I don't want you to die.

66
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,020
I want Prince Qin to live.

67
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,670
Impossible.

68
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,900
You will give me the antidote.

69
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,670
Because I believe

70
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,870
we are the same kind of people.

71
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,190
You are the Princess of Fuyu

72
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,070
and Princess Consort Qin of Great Tang.

73
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,790
You have a high status.

74
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,120
But me

75
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,500
was born in a common family.

76
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,110
Now

77
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,310
I'm just a prisoner.

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,260
How could we be the same?

79
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,340
These are all external things.

80
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,820
I mean

81
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,190
we both love our husband deeply.

82
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,190
You've come to this day

83
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,700
and done all the bad things

84
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,630
not for fame or fortune.

85
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,900
You did all that for Ke,

86
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,890
right?

87
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,670
The whereabouts of Ke are unknown.

88
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,990
Do you know where he is?

89
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,930
I don't.

90
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,020
I know.

91
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,750
Yeah?

92
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,280
You're lying to me.

93
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,380
In order to help him,

94
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,020
you took desperate measures

95
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,380
and risked your life.

96
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,550
Have you ever thought about

97
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,460
he would come back

98
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,260
for you?

99
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:30,970
Impossible.

100
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,120
Otherwise who do you think

101
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,820
notified the Royal Guards

102
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,500
who appeared in time?

103
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,700
His Highness?

104
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,700
He asked His Majesty

105
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,070
to spare your life.

106
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,700
If you're willing to hand over the antidote,

107
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,160
I can let you go.

108
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,260
I won't believe it.

109
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,070
Unless I see His Highness.

110
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,410
Hand over the antidote first.

111
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,480
Prince Qin has no time left.

112
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,450
Before I see him,

113
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,760
I won't give you anything!

114
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,070
If something happens to Prince Qin,

115
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,700
I will only give you

116
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,820
Ke's body.

117
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,370
OK.

118
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,120
Then let's take a gamble.

119
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,630
See who can outlast whom.

120
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,800
You...

121
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,310
He won't come back at all.

122
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,900
I know him too well.

123
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,340
You can't fool me.

124
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,110
Liu Changsheng.

125
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,900
Just wait to collect Lv Jing's body.

126
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,810
Yes.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,700
We haven't found Ke yet.

128
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,500
But Chu Ge,

129
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,690
Lv Jing and I have never thought about

130
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,530
harming you.

131
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,870
Please let him go.

132
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,450
Okay?

133
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,940
Let him go?

134
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,500
The insects never intended to harm people.

135
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,570
But because people hate them,

136
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,750
they killed them all.

137
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,340
Not to mention

138
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,070
he was the one
who harmed you many times first.

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,550
Will you really let him go?

140
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,340
Liu Changsheng.

141
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,460
Instead of wasting time with me here,

142
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,580
it's better to spend more time with Lv Jing.

143
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,910
After all,

144
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,150
his time is running out.

145
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,700
(Liu Changsheng.)

146
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,980
(I won't give you the antidote.)

147
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,220
(Just wait to collect Lv Jing's body.)

148
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,890
The doctor said

149
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,620
Cold Farewell Dream

150
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,670
is a very difficult poison to prepare.

151
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,620
It would be fine if it was fatal.

152
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
Surviving it

153
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,940
is the greatest tragedy.

154
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,030
What does it mean?

155
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,740
Tell me quickly.

156
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,860
Cold Farewell Dream

157
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,220
can cause hallucinations.

158
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,150
The poisoned person will not die immediately.

159
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,270
But he will fall into sleep

160
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,160
and frequently experience what he fears most

161
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,220
until he dies from exhaustion.

162
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,910
His Highness woke up.

163
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,190
His Highness woke up.

164
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:28,990
(Fairness and Discernment)

165
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,850
You're awake.

166
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,100
I've been lying for too long.

167
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,320
So I came out for a stroll.

168
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,960
Can you smile a bit?

169
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,910
Now you look like

170
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,910
I'm dead.

171
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,700
Don't talk nonsense.

172
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,560
Do you think

173
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,820
I will die first?

174
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,150
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

175
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,700
Help me up for a walk.

176
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,340
If you leave,

177
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,820
that would confirm the rumor about me.

178
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,910
Who will dare to marry me in the future?

179
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,150
It's only been a few days since we got married.

180
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,820
Now you have the idea of remarrying?

181
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,250
So,

182
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,820
you have to get well soon

183
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,510
and keep an eye on me.

184
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,160
Okay.

185
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,620
Don't worry.

186
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,340
I will definitely get better.

187
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,220
Where's the doctor?

188
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,680
The royal doctors

189
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,190
disagreed on the medication.

190
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,930
Then

191
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,030
they started quarreling.

192
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,790
I found them annoying.

193
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,460
So I drove them away.

194
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,210
Really?

195

and let them fight in front of you,

198
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,220
see if you will be annoyed.

199
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,250
Forget it.

200
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,740

Because it's too cold in the north.

Wrong.

211
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,100

Impossible.

00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,150
Ke was born humble.

305
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,620
He doesn't have any relatives to help.

309
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,030
Maybe she is waiting for Lv Ke
to come back for her.

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Doesn't Chu Ge know

311
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,650

312
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,790

Now he's in the Imperial Study

318
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,550
Now that you already left,

319
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,550
why

320
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,380
did you come back?

321
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,310

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,090

Not to mention you don't believe it,

324
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,100
even I myself don't believe it.

325
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,070
But I know what she did for me.

326
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,180
So I had to come back.

327
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,420
If I left, all troubles would end.

328
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,230
I'd feel alarmed if I came back

329
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,310
and live in fear.

330
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,550
But I

331
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,900
couldn't take a step further.

332
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,270
So I came back.

333
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,660
Good.

334
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,750

You

336
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,140
should live in fear.

337
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,960
You think I don't know

338
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,380
what you and that woman did?

339
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,180
I want to give you a chance to live.

340
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,790

341
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,620
that my good will

342
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,030
almost got Jing killed.

343
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,180
Fortunately

344
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,990
on the wedding day,

345
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,420
I made preparations in advance.

346
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,790
I've said it

347
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,140
thousands of times

348
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,230

Harmony!

351
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,070
Live in harmony.

352
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,340
Can you do it?

353
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,950
Since we were children,

354
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,470
you've favored Hou

355
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,900
and doted on Jing.

356
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,210
What about me?

357
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,070
Where am I?

358
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,030
I wasn't born nobly like Hou

359
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,230
and am not as capable as Jing.

360
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,140
I have to fight

361
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,650
for what I want.

362
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,820
Is there anything wrong with this?

363
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,620
To this day,

364
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,950
I've done everything

365
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,950
and got nothing in the end.

366
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,660
If you say I'm inferior to others, I admit it.

367
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,820
If you want to kill me, I'll die.

368
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,180
But you tell me brothers
should live in harmony?

369
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,210
Father.

370
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,760
You've come this far

371
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,790
standing on this high position,

372
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,930
being all-powerful

373
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,760
and determining other people's destiny.

374
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,510
Did you live in harmony with your brothers?

375
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,100
You've lived till now,

376
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,550

with no cares.

379
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,790
Then why did you

380
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,070
force us to fight?

381
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,480
So stop asking us

382
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,410
for something

383
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,620
even you don't believe in.

384
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,650
Fine.

385
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,580
Fine.

386
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,420
Fine.

387
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,510
The moment I decided to come back,

388
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,660
I didn't plan to live.

389
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,510
Wasn't Lv Jing poisoned?

390
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,790
I can get the antidote.

391
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,770
But

392
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,310
I have one condition.

393
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,660
I have no obsessions in my heart,

394
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,180
only you.

395
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,080
Ge.

396
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,900
Sometimes I feel so lucky

397
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,090
that you didn't stand against me.

398
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,520
Marrying you

399
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,660
is my honor.

400
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,170
I don't know much.

401
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,270
I just want my husband to be happy.

402
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,280
Your Highness.

403
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,610
I will be with you

404
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,180
all my life

405
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,750
and never leave you.

406
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,140
Come on.

407
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,990
I'm ready.

408
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,310
Your Highness.

409
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,470
How did you come?

410
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,720
Go, go, go.

411
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,660
Leave.

412
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,880
Ge.

413
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,030
I came late.

414
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,140
Don't look at me.

415
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,420
Don't look at me.

416
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
Don't look at me.

417
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,100
Don't look at me. Don't look at me.

418
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,510
Let me take one last look at you.

419
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,070
Last look?

420
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,820
Are they going to execute me?

421
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,550
It's okay, Your Highness.

422
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,420
Lv Jing has been poisoned.

423
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,240
I'll take him with me.

424
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,130
I did all these things by myself.

425
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,090
It has nothing to do with you.

426
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,230
You can rest assured, Your Highness.

427
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,990
Where is the antidote?

428
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,280
Antidote?

429
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,030
The antidote is...

430
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,490
Alright,

431
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,770
you can go now.

432
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,360
Guards.

433
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,270
I will leave first.

434
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,270
Your Highness,

435
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,070
take care of yourself.

436
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,080
Let's go.

437
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:41,970
Ge.

438
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,750
You must live well.

439
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,930
Wait.

440
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,170
You can go now.

441
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,370
Go?

442
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,070
Prince Lu took all the blame for you.

443
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,340
What do you mean?

444
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,000
She committed such a serious crime

445
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,180
and is released just like that?

446
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,840
Yes.

447
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,280
Prince Lu used his freedom and the antidote

448
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,270
to save her life.

449
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,710
Let me take one last look at you.

450
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,570
What did you just mean?

451
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,310
Open the door for me.

452
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,330
What did you just say?

453
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,030
I want to see His Highness.

454
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
I want to see His Highness.

455
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,090
Open the door!

456
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,100
No.

457
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,820
No.

458
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,180
No.

459
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,850
I haven't seen

460
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,850
such symptoms before.

461
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,690
Yeah.

462
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,760
The key is that we've never seen this poison.

463
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,660
Yes.

464
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,990
Changsheng.

465
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,340
- We still need the antidote.
- I'm here.

466
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,790
- I'm here.
- His Highness woke up.

467
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,840
He woke up?

468
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,550
I'm not going anywhere.

469
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,990
What should we do?

470
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,380
How's it going?

471
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,610
Can you cure him?

472
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,620
Princess Royal.

473
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,480
Maybe Prince Qin

474
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,820
has some martial arts skills.

475
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,100
So he woke up once before.

476
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,960
But if it drags on like this,

477
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,100
I'm afraid he won't make it.

478
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,810
You must cure her.

479
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

480
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,320
Yes.

481
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,550
Brother has already said

482
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,380
if you can't cure him,

483
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,760
all of you will...

484
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,660
Aunt.

485
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,470
Don't make things hard for them.

486
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,140
I'm not.

487
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,790
The royal doctor said

488
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,370
he can be cured.

489
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,820
Yes, he can be cured.

490
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,800
He can definitely be cured.

491
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,180
Yes, yes, he can definitely be cured.

492
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,450
He can be cured.

493
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,870
Let's keep studying on it.

494
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,650
Tell me,

495
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,960
what should we do?

496
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,340
The antidote is here.

497
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,650
Lv Ke gave it to us.

498
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,490
This is the antidote.

499
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,620
Quickly let Prince Qin take it.

500
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,880
Come on.

501
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,080
Come on.

502
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,990
I won't believe anyone's words

503
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,550
but you.

504
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,370
His Highness just took the antidote.

505
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,580
He's much better now.

506
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,270
Do you want to go in and check on him?

507
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,600
No.

508
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,750
I'm here to say goodbye.

509
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,890
I've been bothering you for so long.

510
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,070
It's time for me to leave.

511
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,860
Why so sudden?

512
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,470
I have troubled you for so long.

513
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,310
How can I keep staying here any longer?

514
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,890
Don't make a sad face.

515
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,790
You should be happy that I'm leaving.

516
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,280
If you said this,

517
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,370
what else can I say

518
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,210
except that I'm happy?

519
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,580
Have a safe trip.

520
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,000
Do you know

521
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,660
that at the moment of life and death,

522
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,450
you risked your life to save him

523
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,850
but I backed off?

524
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,660
That's when I realized

525
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,710
I don't love him,

526
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,510
but myself.

527
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,900
My love is possession.

528
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,380
It's obsession like Grandpa said.

529
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,230
Isn't it easy

530
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,820
to let go of your obsession?

531
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,470
How can it be so easy to let go?

532
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,480
If it were that easy to let go,

533
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,620
it's not called obsession.

534
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,420
Even if I can't let go,

535
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,490
I will

536
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,470
put it somewhere in my heart.

537
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,470
One day,

538
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,340
I will let go.

539
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,580
It's getting late.

540
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,030
I should set off now.

541
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,690
Ru Jing.

542
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,860
Come visit us when you have time.

543
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,180
Take good care of him

544
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,510
and take care of yourself too.

545
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,040
Hurry up.

546
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,890
Make the dredging collaterals soup.

547
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,930
- This won't do.
- Hurry up.

548
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,750
He has to eat my tonic bolus.

549
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,660
No, no, yours won't do either.

550
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,850
Use my ginseng pills

551
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,330
to nourish his vitality.

552
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,170
Quick.

553
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,890
Princess Consort. Princess Consort.

554
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:43,760
What's wrong?

555
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,600
His Highness...

556
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,600
His Highness, he...

557
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,270
What happened?

558
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,020
- Princess Consort.
- Put out the flame.

559
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,880
Princess Consort.

560
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,810
His Highness was fine
after taking the antidote.

561
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,650
But suddenly he vomited a lot of blood.

562
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,930
His pulse is weak now.

563
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,450
Is this antidote actually poison?

564
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,170
I have also checked the antidote.

565
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,470
It's absolutely real.

566
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,650
Then how could this happen?

567
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,660
Maybe

568
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,410
the toxicity has been
accumulating for a long time.

569
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,580
Don't say maybe.

570
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,690
Cure him.

571
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,690
Understand?

572
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,410
Yes, Princess Consort.

573
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,790
I'm on it.

574
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,470
Hurry up! Hurry up!

575
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,300

The fire.

577
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,340
This is Sheng Tiangang's wedding gift to you.

578
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,820
He said it can only be opened in an emergency.

579
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,660
(Stay, you see the dark clouds;
Leave, you see the silver lining)

581
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,270
Go back.

582
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,330
Do you think the rumor is true?

583
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,510
First, he fell off the cliff.

584
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,480
Then on the wedding day,

585
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,790
he was assassinated.

586
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,340

I have to pick one carefully.

660
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,070
Then I will tell you about

661

the person you care about most.

662
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,080
His Highness vomited blood that day,

663
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,580
but that was the toxic blood
that had accumulated in his body.

664
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,820
(Lv Jing, Crown Prince)
He was already fine.

665
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,220
But you left because you believed the rumor.

666
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,100
His Majesty originally intended
to pass the throne to him,

667
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,830
but he refused.

668
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,350
To find you,

669
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,070
he wandered

670
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,580
around the country.

671
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,470
Where on earth have you been?

672
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,290
You've been through so much together.

673
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,260
It has long been proven

674
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,300
that the rumor is just nonsense.

675
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,660
(To Liu Changsheng)
The Lantern Festival is coming.

676
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,950

As for the solution to this problem...

684
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,210
That's my old friend.

685
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,770
Come on, sir.

686
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,620
One step forward.

687
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,180
Stretch out your right hand

688
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,370
to feel my turtle's back.

689
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,620

690
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,250

That's right.

Sir.

693
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,070
I want to tell my fortune.

694
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,970
As long as you have money,

695
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,640
I can tell your fortune as much as you want.

696
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,480
Come.

697
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,780
Write down your birthday.

698
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,370
Come on, tell your fortune.

699
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,890
Tell your fortune.

700
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:20,730
Okay.

701
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,550
Let me see.

702
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,000
Following...

703
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,210
Your Highness,

704
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,120
I won't be able

705
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,830
to make your money.

706
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,000
You still remember

707
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,330
my birthday?

708
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,560
Is it so unforgettable?

709
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,040
That's surely

710
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,950
one of a kind.

711
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,770
I don't know whether you're

712
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:48,660
a good fortuneteller or not.

713
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,200
Before, you said Yi'an

714
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,550
and I were a good match.

715
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,660
But when I was staying with him,

716
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,180
he had been through a lot.

717
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,250
No, no.

718
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,600
Divination

719
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,180
is just for people to seek comfort.

720
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,370
Don't miss a good man

721
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,950
because of this.

722
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,410
Your Highness.

723
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,100
It all depends on human effort.

724
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,100
Please take a look at this mask.

725
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,070
Let me see.

726
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,000
Is there a similar one?

727
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,520
Why don't you wear this?

728
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,360
This looks good.

729
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,130
Wait.

730
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:53,920
Sorry.

731
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,180
Xiaoke.

732
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,950
Guess the riddles

733
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,220
and you'll get two lanterns for free.

734
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,700
Come and take a look.

(A veiled sweet dream on a moonlit night)

736

(Spring breeze wafts through for ten miles)
This year's Lantern Festival

737
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:53,950
has many puzzles.

738
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,390
A veiled sweet dream on a moonlit night,

spring breeze wafts through for ten miles.

740

This is a lantern riddle.

741
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,550
Are you going to pose a puzzle?

742
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,640
This year's riddles

743
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,330
are a bit more difficult.

744
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,210
Whoever guesses the riddle correctly

745
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,780
can get two lanterns.

746
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,740
Miss, I remember you.

747
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,160
Are you going

748
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,440
to write

749
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,580
or guess riddles?

00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,870
A curtain of quiet dreams, a tree of red.
