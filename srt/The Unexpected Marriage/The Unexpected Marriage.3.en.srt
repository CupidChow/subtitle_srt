=Episode 3=

3
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,460
(Wulang, are you busy? Let's go
to the Lantern Festival together.)

4
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
Let me see.

5
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,900
No, I haven't finished it yet.

6
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,240
It's fine.

7
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,340
I'll polish it for you.

8
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,370
Then you can't laugh.

9
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,180
Raise a glass to invite the moon,

10
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,770
and the moon invites you.

11
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,830
Wulang, are you busy?

12
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,860
Let's go to the Lantern Festival together.

13
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,970
You said you wouldn't laugh.

14
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
No, no.

15
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,080
This doesn't seem sincere enough.

16
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,970
Can you use more fancy words?

17
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,580
Be more particular about the structure.

18
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,140
Fancy words?

19
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,580
Don't push yourself.

20
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,920
Your Highness.

21
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,810
You taught Shenxing how to write poems.

22
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,930
If you really want to look sincere,

23
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,620
why don't you try it yourself?

24
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,430
I...

25
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,390
Never mind.

26
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,270
No more letters.

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,650
I'll send the servant to find him.

28
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,810
There's no point in writing this letter.

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,490
I'll save my great wisdom for the future.

30
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,600
Great wisdom?

31
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,090
Combining the right time,
right place, right person,

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,620
Master Sun's Art of War,

33
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,210
and the Thirty-Six Stratagems.

34
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,320
I dare say that as long as I take action,

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,770
I will definitely win him over.

36
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,460
Win him over.

37
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,520
Right time,

38
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,900
right place and right person?

39
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,270
The right time

40
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,140
refers to the Lantern Festival tonight.

41
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,870
I'll catch him by surprise.

42
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,010
Before he has time to think about it,

43
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,950
I'll tell him

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,920
I like him.

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,040
I will only marry him.

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,650
He won't have a chance to refuse.

47
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,760
Changsheng.

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
Wulang.

49
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,640
Your Highness.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,690
Can you do this?

51
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,990
Don't worry.

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,690
Even if the first step fails,

53
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,830
there is a second step.

54
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,880
Second step?

55
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,650
Combined with the atmosphere
of the Lantern Festival

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,460
and Sheng Tiangang,

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,180
I'll make Wulang fall for me.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Why Sheng Tiangang?

59
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,340
He is the one who started the rumor about me.

60
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,190
He needs to make some contribution for me.

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,810
If the first step fails,

62
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,970
whoever started the trouble should end it.

63
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,650
Sheng Tiangang will appear

64
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,800
and make Yang Wulang believe

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,020
he and I are a good match.

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,810
A match made in heaven.

67
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,330
How can he refuse?

68
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,040
Your Highness.

69
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,120
Mr. Yang.

70
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,320
You two are a match

71
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,620
made in heaven.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,740
You should get married quickly.

73
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,040
Changsheng.

74
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,400
Wulang.

75
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,030
Your Highness, this is all your imagination.

76
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,150
Will it really work?

77
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,540
Be careful with your actions.

78
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,670
Shenxing.

79
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,720
You do not understand.

80
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,440
Sometimes fate

81
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,490
is a feeling.

82
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,910
If this feeling isn't strong enough,

83
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,750
then I still have more.

84
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,200
As long as I can

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,420
make him spellbound

86
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,780
and I show tenderness,

87
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,890
then it will work.

88
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,830
This time I must

89
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,250
make a beautiful comeback.

90
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,680
Your Highness.

91
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,000
We're being late.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,890
We have to go
to Noble Consort Xian's place today.

93
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
It's fine.

94
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,740
I'm in a good mood today.

95
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,980
Even if I'm scolded,

96
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,070
it's worth it.

97
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,810
Your Highness, Your Highness.

98
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,980
Bad news.

99
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,490
Yang Wulang suddenly claimed to be ill.

100
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,440
I'm afraid he won't be able to go out recently.

101
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,280
What?

102
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,450
Can't go out?

103
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,810
I could never have predicted this.

104
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,890
Let's go!

105
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,100
Go find Yang Wulang?

106
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,620
Go to Noble Consort Xian's place.

107
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,450
Xiao, what do you think of these flowers?

108
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,630
Very nice.

109
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,450
Wulang, what did you prepare today?

110
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,800
Beef soup.

111
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,630
I'll have a try.

112
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,980
Wulang, this soup is good.

113
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,660
I made it according to your recipe.

114
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,100
The taste is naturally excellent.

115
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,740
Xiao, take it easy. There's more.

116
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,800
I'm in a hurry.

117
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,680
I'll have to go to the palace later.

118
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,740
So I can't accompany you.

119
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,390
Are you going to the palace

120
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,930
to continue spreading
Princess Changsheng's rumor?

121
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,640
I'm being kind to others.

122
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,930
Saving people from future trouble.

123
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,810
Are you saving people

124
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,220
at the cost of

125
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,780
sacrificing yourself?

126
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,520
Wulang.

127
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,520
There is something

128
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,660
I still have to tell you.

129
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,070
Go ahead.

130
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,060
Cherish the people in front of you.

131
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,020
(Tianming Pavilion)

132
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,570
Sir, Yang Wulang

133
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,910
is the Assistant Minister of Works,

134
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,830
familiar with agricultural affairs
and water resources.

135
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,490
Fuyu does trade through waterways.

136
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,230
Maybe we can get more information from him.

137
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,300
But he avoids seeing Her Highness.

138
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,520
What can you do?

139
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,980
Who says there is no way?

140
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,780
You thought Young Master brought you here

141
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,300
just to drink tea?

142
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,330
Sir, this way please.

143
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,450
Sir, he's here.

144
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,520
Waiter.

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,910
I heard you just got

146
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,640
some Guanshan Tea from Great Tang.

147
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,590
Bring me a pot now.

148
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,560
Sorry, Mr. Yang.

149
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,450
You're a step late.

150
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,750
Guanshan Tea

151
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,890
has been reserved by the guest over there.

152
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,750
Mr. Yang.

153
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,370
Mr. Envoy.

154
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,640
I heard that you fell ill.

155
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,330
I didn't expect you to go out
just for a cup of tea.

156
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,030
May I have the honor

157
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,870
to drink with you?

158
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,750
Here.

159
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,800
- Please.
- Please.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,980
I heard that Fuyu is building a waterway.

161
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,570
- Yes.
- I wonder...

162
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,320
(Fengyi Hall)

163
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,860
His Majesty has decided to make peace
with Great Tang through marriage.

164
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,220
The candidate

165
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,330
(Goodness and Virtue)
will be chosen from you.

166
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,790
Great Tang is a country of etiquette,

167
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,150
paying attention to etiquette and rules.

168
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,440
Women especially

169
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,300
should have elegant manners.

170
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,100
So starting today,

171
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,520
your etiquette training

172
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,780
extends by two hours.

173
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,680
I will hire someone to teach you

174
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,660
Great Tang's etiquette,

175
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,560
so you won't disgrace Fuyu

176
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,250
once you get there.

177
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,430
Alright.

178
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,380
Let's start calling the roll.

179
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,630
Daughter of the Minister of Rites,

180
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,610
Wang Yueru.

181
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,280
Yes.

182
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,800
Daughter of the Minister of Words,

183
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Yang Linlang.

184
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,640
Yes.

185
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,110
Daughter of the Minister of Civil Affairs,

186
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,020
Wang Yuhuan.

187
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,310
Yes.

188
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,930
Daughter of the Minister of War.

189
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,320
Your Highness, hurry up.

190
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,420
We are late.

191
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,070
I'm tired.

192
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,400
Wait.

193
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,750
How could I know that
we would be stuck in traffic?

194
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,540
Noble Consort Xian doesn't like you.

195
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,810
It would be terrible if she caught us.

196
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,500
- Hurry up.
- It's fine.

197
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,260
Jin will help me.

198
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,320
Daughter of Marquis Guangning,

199
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,160
Zhao Pei'er.

200
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,310
Yes.

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,800
His Majesty and Noble Consort Xian's
beloved daughter,

202
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,680
with fair appearance,

203
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,800
intelligence,

204
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,990
virtue,

205
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,800
elegance

206
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,420
and charm,

207
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,900
Princess Guangde.

208
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,520
Yes.

209
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,500
Greetings, Mother.

210
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,870
May you remain beautiful

211
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,020
and young forever.

212
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,040
Next, Princess Changle,

213
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,180
Liu Changsheng.

214
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,960
Princess Changle,

215
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,810
Liu Changsheng.

216
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,240
Yes.

217
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,880
Wait.

218
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,180
(Fengyi Hall)

219
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,610
Where is Princess Changsheng?

220
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,280
She is the main candidate

221
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,560
for the peace-making marriage.

222
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,780
Don't cover for her.

223
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,280
I'm here.

224
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,500
Have you been here all along?

225
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,800
Yes.

226
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,300
I've been here.

227
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,690
Who said yes just now?

228
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,730
It was me.

229
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,180
Lying in front of me.

230
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,780
How bold!

231
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,990
Since you are so close,

232
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,900
I punish you to clean up the imperial garden.

233
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,280
Not a single fallen leaf

234
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,660
and a grain of sand or stone can be seen.

235
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,040
Otherwise,

236
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,450
the punishment will be harsher.

237
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,590
Noble Consort Xian.

238
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,060
I know I'm wrong.

239
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

240
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,260
I'm sorry, Jin.

241
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,420
Sorry for causing you trouble.

242
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Don't say that.

243
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,780
We should share weal and woe.

244
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,260
By the way, let's go
to the Lantern Festival tonight.

245
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,730
Xie Lin will come too.

246
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,810
Then you will soon be...

247
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,060
But I'm not going.

248
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,020
Didn't you ask Yang Wulang out?

249
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,160
He had already claimed to be ill

250
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,930
before I could ask him out.

251
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,780
Is there any solution?

252
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,180
Why don't I just marry your brother?

253
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,830
This way I won't have to marry far away,

254
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,730
and you don't have to be sad.

255
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,300
We'll be together for a long time.

256
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,730
My brother...

257
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,560
You know

258
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,870
what my brother is like.

259
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,900
He doesn't deserve you.

260
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,800
Let's clean.

261
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,540
Princess Changsheng is in a good mood.

262
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,870
You're about to go get married.

263
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,510
Yet you're still doing the cleaning.

264
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,830
It's really precious.

265
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,750
Princess Guangde is of noble status.

266
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,530
I heard you're also
among the candidates for marriage.

267
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,750
The envoy lives in my mansion.

268
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,900
I will always remind him of your kindness.

269
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,830
It's not certain who will go and who will stay.

270
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,330
I've always been the one left.

271
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,260
Princess Guangde, better pray for yourself.

272
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,810
How could my father bear to let me go?

273
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,540
If His Majesty doesn't send you,

274
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,280
I'm afraid you'll miss

275
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,230
the only chance to get married.

276
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,440
After all, everyone knows

277
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,380
about my rumor.

278
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,690
But you're different.

279
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,780
Everyone is guessing

280
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,990
whether you

281
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,110
have a hidden disease

282
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,040
- or look ugly.
- You...

283
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,210
How come you haven't found a husband yet?

284
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,640
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I...

285
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,210
You two have been arguing
since you were little.

286
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,160
Haven't you quarreled enough?

287
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,160
I tell you,

288
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,350
I will definitely get married before you.

289
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,830
I almost believed you. Let's make a bet.

290
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,900
Alright.

291
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,090
Whoever gets married first

292
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,080
will receive 100 taels of gold as a gift.

293
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,140
One hundred taels?

294
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,110
The loser...

295
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,600
The loser will go to the peace-making marriage.

296
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,690
- Deal.
- Deal.

297
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,950
You...

298
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,550
Go.

299
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,440
Why am I so unlucky today?

300
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,260
First, Yang Wulang claimed to be ill.

301
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,180
Then Guangde came to cause trouble.

302
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,400
If there's anything else unlucky,
just come along.

303
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,240
Alright.

304
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,670
Look, look.

305
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,540
You're talking about her, right?

306
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,470
Yeah.

307
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,680
Princess Changsheng.

308
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,610
That's her.

309
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,420
This is Princess Changsheng.

310
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,080
Princess Changsheng.

311
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,920
That's her.

312
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,920
What?

313
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,380
All pointing fingers.

314
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,520
What did I say?

315
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,900
Nothing is lucky.

316
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,830
The priority

317
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,160
is to find the right person

318
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,020
and marry you off.

319
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,300
Yang Wulang isn't the only choice.

320
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,590
Take a break.

321
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,690
Didn't I just say that?

322
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,750
Her Highness's power is unquestionable.

323
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,040
It's scary.

324
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,670
You know the third young master
of the Shen Family.

325
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,280
Yeah.

326
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,330
Your Highness.

327
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,800
Go, go, go.

328
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,780
You know the third young master
of the Shen Family.

329
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,960
He has

330
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,780
nothing to do with Her Highness.

331
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,160
Did you hear that?

332
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,520
Your Highness.

333
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,210
Thank you for your kind words.

334
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,380
I guess those people behaved abnormally

335
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,210
because of you.

336
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,520
No, no.

337
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,830
You also told

338
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,280
Yang Wulang something.

339
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,780
Illness is determined by fate.

340
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,930
Humans can't control it.

341
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,470
No.

342
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,710
You can control

343
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,300
people's life and death.

344
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,590
You...

345
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,520
Wulang.

346
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,570
How did you come?

347
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,970
Aren't you sick?

348
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,190
Why...

349
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,240
My disease

350
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,660
was cured because of you.

351
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,470
Xiao said

352
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,660
you have this capability.

353
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,060
Yang and I hit it off right away.

354
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,420
We agreed to meet up
for the Lantern Festival at night.

355
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,360
Your Highness is responsible for receiving me.

356
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,970
I guess you will go together.

357
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,180
Yang's illness healed so quickly.

358
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,440
Meeting a confidant

359
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,300
is the best cure.

360
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,850
You are not going tonight too, are you?

361
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,520
I am.

362
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,400
Why wouldn't I go?

363
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,210
I'm worried about you and Xie Lin
going out alone.

364
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,970
Mr. Envoy.

365
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,630
You and Yang Wulang

366
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,500
really hit it off by a chance encounter?

367
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,240
Or else?

368
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,420
I don't care

369
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,520
if it's true or not.

370
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,500
You helped me many times,

371
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,810
whether by accident or by design.

372
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,610
I still want to thank you.

373
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,140
I don't understand

374
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,020
what you mean.

375
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,710
In this world,

376
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,080
there were many things

377
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,020
confusing.

378
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,850
Even in the royal family,

379
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,080
I've gone through several hardships

380
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,290
in the easy matter of getting married.

381
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,070
So

382
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,420
it's better to be confused.

383
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,590
Your Highness.

384
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,900
In my view,

385
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,810
your confusion lies in deceiving yourself.

386
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,310
To be honest,

387
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,900
only by getting your mindset right

388
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,420
can you accumulate strength.

389
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,120
If you stay awake,

390
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,570
you'll be a late bloomer.

391
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,700
Thank you for your advice.

392
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,020
Let's get changed for tonight.

393
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,680
Your Highness.

394
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,130
With due respect,

395
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,130
Yang Wulang has good character,

396
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,390
but he's not

397
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,410
a good match for you.

398
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,000
Thanks.

399
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,140
(Gorgeous Vernal Scenery)

400
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,480
Your Highness.

401
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,590
Your Highness,

402
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,780
I have things to deal with.

403
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,000
You go first.

404
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,360
Later I will go meet you

405
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,200
at the Lantern Market.

406
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,520
Okay.

407
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,600
Xiao, this is...

408
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,440
Xie Lin.

409
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,810
This is Wulang.

410
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,170
This is my brother-in-law.

411
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,220
- Jin.
- Changsheng, come on.

412
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,800
Your Highness.

413
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,220
Why isn't Mr. Envoy here?

414
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,130
He will come later.

415
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,790
Mr. Xiao really has the mood

416
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,200
for the Lantern Festival?

417
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,020
I came here specifically to enjoy the lanterns.

418
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,330
Unlike some people

419
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,610
with impure thoughts.

420
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,200
I don't want to bother with you.

421
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,090
Your Highness, let's go over there.

422
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,310
Okay.

423
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,350
Please come.

424
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,710
I haven't been to Shangkang for a long time.

425
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,260
The scenery here has changed.

426
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,780
You're here at the right time.

427
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,570
Now is the peak season for bass.

428
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,440
Let's go fishing tomorrow.

429
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,460
I didn't expect you

430
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,650
are interested in this.

431
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,070
Among the noble young men,

432
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,470
Zilv is the best

433
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,700
gastronome.

434
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,220
We're wasting time like this.

435
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,580
I think the night market is quite lively.

436
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,300
I wonder if I can buy something I like.

437
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,780
If you can't buy it, so what?

438
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,460
It's just for fun.

439
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,440
Xie Lin.

440
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,310
I just spent half a day walking around

441
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,230
and didn't buy what I wanted.

442
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,310
Why don't we go somewhere else?

443
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,940
Okay, I'll follow you.

444
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,840
I think it's better this way.

445
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,880
Let's split into two groups,

446
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,720
shopping separately.

447
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,570
We'll meet at the place
to guess lantern riddles.

448
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,630
- How does it sound?
- Good.

449
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,550
Fine by me.

450
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,310
Then I won't force Mr. Xiao
to go shopping with me.

451
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,540
I'll go with Wulang.

452
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,060
Your Highness, suit yourself.

453
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,920
A group of three is fine too.

454
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,230
Let's go together.

455
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,400
Then we'll go first.

456
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,610
You three have a good time.

457
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,630
Let's go.

458
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,700
Sir, Fuyu's Lantern Festival is lively.

459
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,890
But compared with ours,

460
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,090
it's not good enough.

461
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,980
Have you investigated the route?

462
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,550
Sir,

463
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,220
I have sent someone to monitor it.

464
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,700
It's just...

465
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,700
How should we

466
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,790
get useful information

467
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,960
from Yang Wulang

468
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,130
in such a noisy environment?

469
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,540
Don't worry, give them some time.

470
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,030
Let's browse around too.

471
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,870
Okay.

472
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,520
It's really lively.

473
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,790
What's wrong?

474
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,170
I sprained my ankle.

475
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,460
You can twist your ankle even on flat ground?

476
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,740
Impressive.

477
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,700
There seems to be an ice shop over there.

478
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,890
I'll go buy some ice.

479
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,410
What happened again?

480
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,130
I lost my purse.

481
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,780
Maybe you are too stupid

482
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,040
and a thief stole it.

483
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,990
I can't walk properly now.

484
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,220
Could you help me find it?

485
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,460
Maybe I lost it somewhere.

486
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,330
Come here, kids.

487
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,680
Do you want to eat candy?

488
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,020
Yes.

489
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,200
Do you see that guy there?

490
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,060
He has candies.

491
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,700
Let's have candy.

492
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,070
What are you doing?

493
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,940
You didn't wash your hands.

494
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,690
Give me some candy.

495
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,260
Liu Changsheng.

496
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,810
- Candy.
- Give me some candy.

497
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,170
I don't have any.

498
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,580
I won't let go.

499
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,240
Your Highness.

500
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
I just asked around

501
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,790
and didn't find any ice shops.

502
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,700
I guess it's sold out.

503
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,940
No problem.

504
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,520
Where is Xiao?

505
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,570
He had something to do, so he left.

506
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,130
We can shop without him.

507
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,310
Your ankle...

508
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,440
It doesn't hurt anymore.

509
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,460
But thank you

510
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,650
for making the trip.

511
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,930
It's good as long as it doesn't hurt.

512
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,170
Do you feel

513
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,570
tonight's moon

514
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,740
looks extremely beautiful?

515
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,000
It's average.

516
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,200
Your Highness.

517
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,160
Do you know whether the envoy

518
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,000
is married?

519
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,300
I've never heard him mention it.

520
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,650
I guess he isn't.

521
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,270
Actually,

522
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,460
I thought about it for a long time.

523
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,520
Marriage

524
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,980
is about fate.

525
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,920
Without fate,

526
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,230
it's hard to find a marriage partner.

527
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,070
Yes.

528
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,310
Just like

529
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,980
me and the envoy.

530
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,610
There is a reason for everything.

531
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,090
Actually,

532
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,960
I think you and I

533
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,090
are fated too.

534
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,890
I wonder

535
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,460
if you have the same thoughts as me

536
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,460
to consider marriage.

537
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,310
Wulang.

538
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,220
Can I call you that?

539
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,160
No.

540
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,610
I am the third child in my family.

541
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,850
You have to call me

542
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,150
Sanlang.

543
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,390
What's wrong?

544
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,170
(Oh no.)

545
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,700
(It's not him.)

546
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,020
(Don't make a mistake.)

547
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,600
Look.

548
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,440
This young master.

549
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,460
Look at your face.

550
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,020
You have good luck with women recently.

551
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,460
No.

552
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,130
(Not that?)

553
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,680
Please

554
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,460
write down your birthday.

555
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,130
- Okay.
- Good.

556
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,870
Please.

557
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,550
According to your birthday,

558
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,300
the destined woman will appear this year.

559
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,750
Then where is my destined woman?

560
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,070
Right

561
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,840
in front of you.

562
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,060
Come on, sir.

563
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,150
Young Master,

564
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,600
this woman

565
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,440
is your

566
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,920
destined person.

567
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,360
No, no.

568
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,310
He is talking nonsense.

569
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,570
You don't know her birthday.

570
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,330
How can you say she is the destined one?

571
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,720
It's clearly a lie.

572
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,220
Right, it's a lie.

573
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,120
You asked a good question.

574
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,400
But you don't know

575
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,240
that this woman

576
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,850
comes to my place a dozen times a month.

577
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,880
I know her birthday very well.

578
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,550
Well,

579
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,880
you are

580
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,360
a match made in heaven.

581
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,940
Destined to be a good couple.

582
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,020
Then tell my fortune too.

583
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,360
Sir, I'm in a hurry to go home.

584
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,200
Don't mess around.

585
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,330
Sir, just help tell his fortune.

586
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,640
Maybe

587
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,170
he's someone's destined person too.

588
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,710
We agreed to do it once.

589
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,540
I'll give you more money, come on.

590
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,740
Okay, okay.

591
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,090
Then I'll tell your fortune now.

592
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,570
Come on.

593
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,960
Don't waste time.

594
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,890
You don't have a chance.

595
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,330
He doesn't have a chance.

596
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,310
You two listen to me.

597
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,890
You guys are a once-in-a-century match.

598
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,870
I...

599
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,570
What did I say?

600
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,330
What did I say?

601
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,680
This woman

602
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,920
and this young master

603
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,780
are a match made in heaven.

604
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,980
Am I right?

605
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,610
I think we've almost finished shopping.

606
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,540
Why don't we go meet up with Jin?

607
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,790
Guess lantern riddles.

608
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,920
Guess it right

609
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,540
and you'll get a lantern for free.

610
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,680
Excuse me,

611
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,060
do you want to guess the riddles?

612
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,570
It was like a veiled sweet dream
on a moonlit night,

613
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,300
gentle was the spring breeze
that wafts through for ten miles.

614
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,650
This is a lantern riddle.

615
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,810
Do you want to come up with a puzzle?

616
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,540
(A veiled dream and a tree in blossom)

617
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,160
A veiled dream and a tree in blossom.

618
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,300
They come and go mostly in the white clouds.

619
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,220
Why is the envoy here?

620
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,130
How is it going?

621
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,570
What do you think?

622
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,060
Come here, look at this.

623
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,260
- Changsheng, look!
- Look here.

624
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,360
Come and see.

625
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,300
Look here.

626
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,530
Bravo!

627
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,910
Changsheng.

628
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,070
This is the real trick.

629
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,780
Look, one, two, three.

630
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,980
Bravo!

631
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,390
Good!

632
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,340
Good!

633
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,660
Good!

634
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,120
So many birds.

635
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,780
Changsheng, look at the birds.

636
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,440
None of this is real.

637
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,280
It's ventriloquism.

638
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,940
How can it be?

639
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,270
Listen to this.

640
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,130
It's obviously real.

641
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,550
So amazing.

642
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,610
Do you see the person playing the bamboo flute?

643
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,510
I heard there are people

644
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,570
who are good at ventriloquism.

645
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,160
They can mimic

646
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,300
all the sounds in the world.

647
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,480
I think

648
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,230
the bird calls

649
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,170
we're hearing now

650
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,330
are from that ventriloquist.

651
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,740
Amazing!

652
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,330
Marvelous!

653
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,200
Good.

654
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,260
Bravo!

655
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,590
Good.

656
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,250
Good.

657
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,570
Good.

658
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,540
Bravo!

659
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,330
Good.

660
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,800
(Another assassin.)

661
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,020
(Taking action here will reveal my identity.)

662
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,500
(I have to find a way to get away.)

663
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,610
Let's go to the front.

664
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,750
Bravo!

665
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,430
Bravo!

666
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,390
Go.

667
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,830
Are you OK?

668
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,740
I'm fine.

669
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,990
Are you crazy?

670
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,130
Why did you suddenly get me up here?

671
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,300
Look below.

672
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,960
It's too messy down there.

673
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,090
Let's wait here for a while.

674
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,220
The chaos is because you suddenly...

675
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,350
Suddenly...

676
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,800
Suddenly what?

677
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,850
Listen,

678
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,030
don't do this kind of

679
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,870
weird things again.

680
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,960
Otherwise, no matter if I am a princess in Fuyu

681
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,100
or a princess consort in Great Tang,

682
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,940
I will teach you a lesson.

683
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,790
You're threatening me?

684
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,500
Don't let the threat become reality.

685
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,410
If you have the guts, give it a try.

686
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,310
I'm not as courageous as Your Highness.

687
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,370
But when it comes to courage,

688
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,370
it is indeed one of my strengths.

689
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,780
Don't move.

690
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,700
Just now you said you were brave.

691
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,040
Where is your strength?

692
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,470
A grown man

693
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,460
is afraid of spiders?

694
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,130
I'm not afraid of it.

695
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,310
I'm in awe of it.

696
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,780
In awe of spiders?

697
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,300
In awe of living things.

698
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,610
I don't want to kill a life.

699
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,640
What are you doing?

700
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,260
What's wrong with a spider?

701
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,940
Why do you find a spider scary?

702
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,130
Look, it doesn't bite.

703
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,760
I don't want to.

704
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,350
Alright, alright.

705
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,830
Go ahead,

706
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,720
you're free.

707
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,540
I don't know where they went.

708
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,460
We just came from there.

709
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,810
Let's go to the front and take a look.

710
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,740
(Peace and Contentment)

711
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,360
It's all your fault,

712
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
so slow.

713
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,460
I'm leaving the palace late.

714
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,000
Xiaohong.

715
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,830
Xiaolv.

716
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,790
Go over there.

717
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,220
- Never mind.
- Today's wine is really delicious.

718
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,020
I'll go by myself.

719
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,150
Go, go, go.

720
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,960
I'm stuffed.

721
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,410
We should go home and rest.

722
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,070
Let's go.

723
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,130
This lady is pretty good-looking.

724
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,150
Little beauty.

725
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,220
Where are you going?

726
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,440
Come on, let me touch your hand.

727
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,280
Get lost!

728
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,460
Do you know who I am?

729
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,170
I'm a princess.

730
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,590
Princess?

731
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,740
Then I am the king.

732
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,300
Let me take care of you.

733
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,550
Want to run?

734
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,830
Get lost!

735
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,070
Rogue.

736
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Stop! Go get her.

737
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,650
- Want to run?
- Don't let her get away.

738
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,220
You still want to run away?

739
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,790
Help!

740
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,840
- Don't shout.
- Help!

741
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,410
- Take her away.
- Help!

742
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,520
Take her away.

743
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,610
I think I heard Guangde's voice.
