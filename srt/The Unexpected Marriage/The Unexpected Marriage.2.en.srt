=The Unexpected Marriage=

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,660
=Episode 2=

3
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,370
What did you just see?

4
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,300
I...

5
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,430
- I saw nothing.
- So,

6
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,300
will you poke your eyes out
or die as an apology?

7
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,480
Do I have to pick one?

8
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,930
There is no use in avoiding it.

9
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,810
So what do you want me to choose?

10
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,460
I hope you choose

11
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,180
to stop the peace-making marriage.

12
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,300
Otherwise I would become Prince Qin's wife.

13
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,690
Then you'll have to pay a price

14
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,490
for what happened today.

15
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,040
But we can discuss it.

16
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,930
Try to smooth things over.

17
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,080
How about it?

18
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,090
- Well.
- Isn't this a good deal?

19
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,690
Then I will take it as a yes.

20
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,040
It's a deal.

21
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,880
Go to sleep.

22
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,480
No.

23
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
I...

24
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,250
- Sir.
- Sir.

25
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,200
Sir.

26
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
What's wrong?

27
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,590
Can you give

28
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,460
Xiaoke back to me?

29
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Xiaoke.

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Xiaoke.

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,690
Hurry up!

32
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,760
What are you two doing there?

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,920
This is Princess's room.

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,830
You can't approach here.

35
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,670
I...

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,760
We...

37
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,960
Take good care of it.

38
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,930
If you don't behave, I'll eat you.

39
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
Young Master.

40
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,550
This is Princess's room.

41
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,860
We can't just enter casually.

42
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,480
You remember clearly

43
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,930
what Shenxing said.

44
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,390
Young Master.

45
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,340
Why is your face red?

46
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
It's hot.

47
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,430
The weather in Fuyu

48
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,490
is really good.

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,640
Even in cold winter,

50
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,650
people can feel like

51
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,580
bathing in the spring wind.

52
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,760
What does it mean?

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,930
No, no, no.

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,810
I want to say

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,690
it's so late and you still don't rest.

56
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,930
You came to Her Highness's room instead.

57
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,580
I guess there's something important to discuss.

58
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,640
By the way, Young Master.

59
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,220
We've been here for two days.

60
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,420
Now living under someone else's roof

61
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,250
with Her Highness around,

62
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,180
it's hard to get

63
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,660
the information about Fuyu.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Should we

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,030
find a way

66
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,890
to get rid of Her Highness?

67
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,330
Get rid of her?

68
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,370
She's trying to get rid of us.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Your Highness.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,590
That lunatic watched you take a bath.

71
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,130
Are you really going to let him go?

72
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,860
Don't worry.

73
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,270
From that angle,

74
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,450
he can't see anything at all.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,300
It must be just a misunderstanding.

76
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,840
But if we can take advantage
of this misunderstanding

77
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,950
to dispel his idea of choosing me
for the peace-making marriage,

78
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,810
that's good too.

79
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,980
Your Highness, you're wise.

80
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,250
That's really clever!

81
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,010
Finally I can sleep well without worries.

82
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,670
Take this.

83
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,600
You'll feel warmer.

84
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,480
Your Highness, be careful.

85
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,130
It's really hot.

86
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,780
(Self-discipline and Social Commitment)

87
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,630
Jinyan.

88
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,520
Go get the envoy.

89
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,360
Yes.

90
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,120
Your Royal Highness,
we added two new dishes today.

91
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,980
Please try it.

92
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,690
Mr. Envoy has arrived.

93
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,000
Mr. Envoy.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,760
How was your sleep last night?

95
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,600
It was fine.

96
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,450
I just saw something I shouldn't have seen

97
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,810
and had a nightmare all night.

98
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
I wish

99
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,740
it won't become your eternal nightmare.

100
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,230
Come, sit down.

101
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,470
- Let's eat.
- No.

102
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,310
Please enjoy your time.

103
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,740
I have business to do.

104
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,830
It's about selecting
the right person for peace-making marriage.

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,390
After finishing your meal,

106
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,350
please go to the garden

107
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,190
and give your statement.

108
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,810
Statement?

109
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,180
Just a conversation.

110
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,910
I will record Her Highness's

111
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,180
usual living habits

112
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,420
for reference.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
Then

114
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,800
see you soon.

115
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,470
- This is...
- This is...

116
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,470
What's he doing now?

117
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,450
This envoy

118
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,860
is really stubborn.

119
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,450
I have to find a way

120
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,860
to cut off his retreat.

121
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,250
What kind of person
do you think Her Highness is?

122
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,230
She's usually

123
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,560
very stingy.

124
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,930
If a servant accidentally broke a spoon,

125
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,620
she would deduct his monthly allowance.

126
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,780
Youmou, note it down.

127
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,930
Her Highness is diligent and thrift,

128
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,180
good at managing a house.

129
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,100
No, I mean

130
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,590
she is particularly stingy.

131
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,030
And she has a very good memory.

132
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,200
She remembers

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
everything people move.

134
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,010
She will punish us later.

135
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,550
Photographic memory.

136
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,030
Paying attention to evidence.

137
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,390
This is not what I meant.

138
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,740
How about her literary skills?

139
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,620
Intolerable.

140
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,130
At best, she knows only a few words.

141
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,230
Usually she's a vulgar.

142
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,560
The only strength she has

143
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,810
is her hands-on ability.

144
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,520
To our subordinates,

145
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,010
she uses a hands-on approach.

146
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,150
She always

147
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,420
uses force to us.

148
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,320
Well...

149
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,220
Is it bad?

150
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
Yeah.

151
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,250
Not really.

152
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,060
She's just intelligent.

153
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,660
Youmou, write it down.

154
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,980
Princess Changsheng
discards overelaborate formalities

155
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,570
and breaks the routine,

156
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,540
striving to say no to the antiquate ideas.

157
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,300
She is a role model for women in Fuyu.

158
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,570
Sir.

159
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,560
(This person did it on purpose.)

160
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,740
How does she treat her family?

161
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,750
Unfilial.

162
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,220
Or even treasonous.

163
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,980
As the saying goes,

164
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,520
a dog never shuns its owner's home

165
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,910
however shabby it is.

166
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,680
But she is very picky about me,

167
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,740
and often humiliates me.

168
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,320
If God could see her actions,

169
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,200
then

170
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,320
she should be struck by lightning.

171
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,300
So touching.

172
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,010
Facing the mistakes of family members,

173
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,780
she gives timely guidance.

174
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,100
Facing the curse of the elders,

175
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,220
she bears the pain and moves forward.

176
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,420
Mr. Envoy.

177
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,830
You really don't understand

178
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,060
or are you pretending?

179
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,660
Your Highness is wise.

180
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,490
We're usually arrogant and pretentious.

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,840
After I got to know you,

182
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,520
I feel so ashamed

183
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,660
and inferior.

184
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,990
Your Highness.

185
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,490
You're the best of the best.

186
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,870
You...

187
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,270
(Xiao's Mansion)
This envoy from Great Tang

188
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,620
must be leaky-minded.

189
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,160
Changsheng.

190
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,660
These are all borrowed by Xie Lin
from Ministry of Works.

191
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,400
All the noble young men in Fuyu

192
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,240
are in here.

193
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,800
Don't worry.

194
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,280
I will help you get married

195
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,540
before the imperial decree is issued.

196
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,060
Thank you, Jin.

197
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,560
Wait until I get married,

198
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,500
I will thank you properly.

199
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,430
By the way,

200
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,970
your brother doesn't know, right?

201
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,240
Rest assured.

202
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,190
I'm very

203
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,550
tight-lipped.

204
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,830
In each of their hands,

205
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,730
there is a portrait.

206
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,420
For those you like, stay.

207
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,930
For those you don't like, stand aside.

208
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,470
This is much more fun
than throwing the embroidered ball.

209
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,070
Yeah, let's get started.

210
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,760
That one.

211
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,670
Where's Young Lady?

212
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,080
Young Lady is in the backyard.

213
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,480
She is choosing a husband for Her Highness.

214
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,300
Choosing a husband?

215
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,120
Changsheng.

216
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,750
This is my last batch.

217
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,830
If you still can't choose anyone,

218
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,020
I have no one left.

219
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,390
The first one

220
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,060
is the eldest son
of the Minister of Civil Affairs,

221
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,140
Wang Youjin.

222
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,660
He's from Chang'an,

223
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,510
has good looks

224
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,500
and is gentle and considerate.

225
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,320
He's very different

226
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,330
from the men in Fuyu.

227
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,810
Looks too fragile.

228
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,040
I don't like.

229
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,800
Second.

230
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,020
General Zhao's seventh son,

231
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,120
Zhao Huaibi.

232
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,470
Although his mother is a concubine,

233
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,730
he's gifted

234
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,110
and has both civil and military skills.

235
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,780
He's appreciated by His Majesty.

236
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,000
This is not bad.

237
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,040
But he is not in the capital.

238
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,090
This can be an alternative.

239
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,200
Third, Minister Shen's son,

240
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,040
Shen Bin.

241
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,940
Twenty years old, gifted.

242
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,110
Adept with both the pen and the sword.

243
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,450
He's the Assistant Minister of Revenue.

244
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,160
Okay, him.

245
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,000
Zilv.

246
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,470
Thank you, Your Highness.

247
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,570
Thank me?

248
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,570
Is your brother beaten stupid?

249
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,610
Zilv, are you okay?

250
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:58,950
I mean

251
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,710
thank you for showing mercy.

252
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,550
Only half my foot

253
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,020
stepped into the gate of hell.

254
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,400
Yeah.

255
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,260
The other foot is lagging behind.

256
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,280
That's why I have to thank you.

257
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,140
That foot which was holding me back

258
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,180
is thanks to you.

259
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,470
That was a long time ago.

260
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,180
You're still blaming me for breaking your leg?

261
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,430
Well,

262
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,660
what can I do

263
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,570
to make up for your injured body

264
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,500
and mind?

265
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,970
The focus is on the mind.

266
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,160
Don't think too much.

267
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,330
I heard that you're choosing a husband.

268
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,380
I wonder who's lucky enough

269
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,900
to get picked by you?

270
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,090
Shen Bin.

271
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,470
Look at the man in this painting.

272
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,730
A dignified figure.

273
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,930
Good-looking.

274
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,610
With an elegant demeanor

275
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,260
and smiles like the bright moon.

276
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
His character

277
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,260
is also one of the best.

278
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,780
His behavior

279
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,380
is also excellent.

280
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,970
Overall, he must be marriable.

281
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,380
I hope he looks just like the painting.

282
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,800
Right,

283
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,830
after all, these days,

284
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,020
there are a lot of people

285
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,160
who don't live up to their name.

286
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,350
Am I right?

287
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,190
Xiao Zilv.

288
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,670
You don't say.

289
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,320
My reputation is naturally not as good

290
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,420
as Your Highness's.

291
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,970
Shen Bin and I have been friends for years.

292
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,020
He is the only child in the family
for three generations.

293
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,140
With your legendary reputation,

294
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,020
it's hard to keep

295
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,540
their bloodline going.

296
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,680
If this rumor

297
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,730
really works,

298
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,570
I will definitely marry you.

299
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,260
Just to eliminate harm

300
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,330
for the people.

301
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,540
Your Highness, you wish to.

302
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,780
Don't you know

303
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,450
if it works?

304
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,930
But then again,

305
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,730
if you dare to marry me,

306
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,450
I will reluctantly agree.

307
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,830
Anyway, I have been punished once.

308
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,020
I don't want to involve others.

309
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,930
Just consider it a good deed.

310
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,260
Do you want to die?

311
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,550
What's the matter?

312
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,870
You're forcing me to marry you, right?

313
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,760
You can't outspeak me,
so you resort to intimidation, right?

314
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,700
Zilv, stop talking.

315
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,140
You really want to marry Shen Bin?

316
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,350
Yes.

317
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,410
Then you can be a mule.

318
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,440
You're as stubborn as a mule.

319
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,200
I won't marry you even if I become a mule.

320
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,140
Even if you want to marry him,
he may not dare to marry you.

321
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,320
- I...
- Your Highness, stop chasing.

322
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,690
With my leg, I can't outrun you.

323
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,470
Calm down, calm down.

324
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,310
Calm down.

325
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,400
Young Master.

326
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,320
Where should we start

327
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,780
to learn about Fuyu?

328
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,450
Cold feet hurt the heart.

329
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,850
People's disappointment hurts the country.

330
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,610
If we want to know a country,

331
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,500
we must first understand its people.

332
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,060
How do we do that?

333
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,630
We can't go to the streets

334
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,020
and ask some random people.

335
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,520
Fool.

336
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,730
Who is in charge of the people?

337
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,420
If we want to get information,

338
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,570
we should hear from those people.

339
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,850
Those people...

340
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,950
The Emperor?

341
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,970
It is the Minister of Revenue.

342
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,040
Through Minister of Revenue, we can understand
a country's financial strength

343
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,880
and tax revenues.

344
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,070
Young Master.

345
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,000
Her Highness is back.

346
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,930
Didn't she go to Miss Xiao's house?

347
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,420
Why come back?

348
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,040
The person we sent over reported

349
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,690
that Miss Xiao

350
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,540
was helping Her Highness select a husband.

351
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,590
I don't know what happened,

352
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,200
but she and Miss Xiao's brother

353
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,040
started quarreling,

354
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,540
and parted on bad terms.

355
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,020
So troublesome.

356
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,930
We should stay away from this person.

357
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,160
Does the husband selection have any results?

358
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,440
Her Highness selected

359
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,090
Shen Bin, Assistant Minister of Revenue.

360
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,710
It is said that Shen Bin

361
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,440
- Ministry of Revenue?
- is extraordinary talented.

362
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,810
He has a photographic memory.

363
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,510
Someone once gave him trouble

364
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,540
and raised some marginal issues,

365
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,690
but he answered them all.

366
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,920
It really is

367
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,690
an easy conquest.

368
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,160
Right.

369
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,400
What are you

370
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,710
talking about?

371
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,550
How come

372
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,850
it's an easy conquest?

373
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,060
Young Master means

374
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,280
we can't get rid of Her Highness.

375
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,060
Instead, we should follow her closely.

376
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,300
(Self-discipline and Social Commitment)

377
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,160
Changsheng.

378
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,210
Now that you have made up your mind,

379
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,590
then

380
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,440
I will hold a feast

381
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,380
in the mansion.

382
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,800
We can invite the Shens

383
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,900
over for a meal.

384
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,670
Is this

385
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,570
a bit too deliberate?

386
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,710
Nonsense.

387
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,420
You are a princess.

388
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,210
You're way out of his league.

389
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,810
Do you want to visit their house

390
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,110
together with me?

391
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,950
Dad.

392
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,160
Isn't this an extraordinary time?

393
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,450
If it weren't for the upcoming marriage,

394
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,020
I want to stay with you and Mother
for a few more years.

395
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,060
Dad.

396
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,510
Will you go with me?

397
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,900
Alright, fine.

398
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,080
Then I will

399
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,610
accompany you on this trip.

400
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,810
Dad, you are the best.

401
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,710
We still need to come up with an excuse.

402
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,470
Just say it's a normal visit.

403
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,560
Don't go straight to the point

404
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,500
to alert them.

405
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,830
After all, I only heard

406
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,810
others' comments on him.

407
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,320
I want to examine him personally.

408
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,140
Then we have a deal.

409
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,540
Just for visiting,

410
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,970
no mention of marriage.

411
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,800
Hairpin and dress.

412
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,900
Jewelry with floral scent.

413
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,300
Everything is ready.

414
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,190
Then let's go.

415
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,070
Your Highness.

416
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,710
Your Highness.

417
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,680
Where are you going?

418
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,630
You are

419
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,540
the envoy from Great Tang?

420
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,500
Hi, Miss Xiao.

421
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,690
How do you recognize me?

422
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,110
You're the only friend

423
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,180
Her Highness has

424
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,450
in Fuyu.

425
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,070
Mr. Envoy.

426
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,040
It seems that you know quite well

427
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,730
all the women of Fuyu.

428
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,830
- Jin, let's go.
- Okay.

429
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,660
It's better to have a chance encounter.

430
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,090
I want to go out for a walk today.

431
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,300
Can you show me around

432
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,500
in Fuyu?

433
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,690
I have something important to do today.

434
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,930
His Majesty ordered you to receive me.

435
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,330
I'm curious.

436
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,440
What thing

437
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,810
is more important than the Emperor's order?

438
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,330
Changsheng is going
to Minister Shen's Residence.

439
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,160
Jin.

440
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,020
Minister Shen's Residence?

441
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,680
Young Master Shen Bin is famous.

442
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,700
I have heard of his name before.

443
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,410
Can you take me with you?

444
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,610
Sorry, Mr. Envoy.

445
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,230
Today I and Young Master Shen Bin

446
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,650
have something important to discuss.

447
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,200
I am afraid

448
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,310
it's not very convenient.

449
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,600
You're refusing me again.

450
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,500
Too insincere.

451
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,830
Youyong, Youmou.

452
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,570
Let's go meet the Emperor.

453
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,110
Wait.

454
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,370
Mr. Envoy.

455
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,890
Please.

456
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,880
(Shen's Mansion)

457
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,060
Your Highness made a surprise visit.

458
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,130
It must be for her marriage.

459
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,720
(Shen Bin, Assistant Minister of Revenue)
You probably know the rumors about her.

460
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,240
Shen.

461
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,740
I advise you to make plans early.

462
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,890
What should I do?

463
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,120
After we part today,

464
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,270
I don't know whether

465
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,330
we can meet again.

466
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,280
Don't panic.

467
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,410
This is not unsolvable.

468
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,370
Xiao, do you have a solution?

469
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,610
Help me!

470
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,120
My sister and Princess Changsheng

471
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,960
are very close.

472
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,360
I've heard about

473
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,300
her preferences.

474
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,940
If you

475
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,940
can disguise yourself well,

476
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,720
I promise

477
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,260
she will never like you.

478
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,780
I'll follow your arrangements.

479
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,400
Your Highnesses,

480
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,300
our house is brightened by your presence.

481
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,940
Mr. Shen, you're too kind.

482
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,630
Come.

483
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,520
Your Royal Highness.

484
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,000
Mr. Envoy.

485
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,070
I will use tea to replace wine

486
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,910
and toast you.

487
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,220
Mr. Shen

488
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,850
raised a good child.

489
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,270
I heard that

490
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,200
your son Shen Bin

491
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,270
has achieved a lot

492
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,540
at a young age.

493
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,000
You flatter him.

494
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,940
Thank you for your kindness,

495
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,850
Your Royal Highness.

496
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,120
Princess Changsheng has also blossomed

497
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,260
into a beautiful young lady.

498
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,090
I'm telling you, you don't know

499
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,780
thousands of people propose marriage

500
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,980
to her each year.

501
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,790
- Dad.
- What's wrong?

502
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,740
Are you

503
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,600
planning to say

504
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,920
thousands of people

505
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,130
want to marry me each year?

506
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,300
I won't.

507
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,230
Didn't we agree on this?

508
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,030
Never alert them.

509
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,750
- We should keep a low profile.
- Right.

510
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,810
Slowly achieve our purpose.

511
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,840
Dad.

512
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,510
Didn't you say not to talk about these?

513
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,540
I've heard of it before.

514
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,030
I'm telling you,

515
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,680
my Changsheng

516
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,940
is a lovely girl.

517
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,840
People all say that

518
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,090
marrying her is bad luck.

519
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,170
In fact, we released

520
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,360
this news

521
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,330
by ourselves.

522
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,110
Dad.

523
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,550
What's wrong again?

524
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,600
Are you going to say

525
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,120
we were the ones

526
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,220
who spread the rumor, right?

527
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,760
No.

528
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,400
Before, some people would still believe it.

529
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
But now,

530
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,300
who'd believe it?

531
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,400
We are just afraid

532
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,460
she's too perfect to others.

533
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,500
That's why we said that.

534
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,030
Every year, the people who come to die...

535
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,870
No.

536
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,700
The people who come to propose

537
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,360
are unstoppable.

538
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,060
There are so many people.

539
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,300
- I'm so worried.
- That's a good thing.

540
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,640
By the way, is your son

541
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,780
engaged yet?

542
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,850
Let's talk about my son's marriage later.

543
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,240
Later.

544
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,910
Mr. Envoy.

545
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,780
I heard that you are here
for the peace-making marriage with Prince Qin.

546
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,280
Yes.

547
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,240
What do you think

548
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,470
of Her Highness?

549
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,360
Her Highness

550
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,540
naturally is excellent.

551
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,070
Mr. Shen.

552
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,790
Mr. Envoy

553
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,460
has heard of Young Master Shen's name
for a long time.

554
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,810
He came here today to catch a glimpse of him.

555
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,330
Why not invite Young Master Shen over?

556
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,980
Let's chat together.

557
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,540
Oh.

558
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,520
Wang Cai.

559
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,610
Is Bin busy with official business?

560
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,850
No, he's meeting guests at the backyard.

561
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,310
Then,

562
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,700
go call him over.

563
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,370
Yes.

564
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,170
Your Highness, wait a minute.

565
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
Have some tea.

566
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,810
Her Highness loves cleanliness.

567
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,960
So she definitely won't like

568
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,890
sloppy people.

569
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,230
So our first step

570
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,370
is to make you look dirty.

571
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,550
Young Master.

572
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,790
Master is calling you

573
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,780
to go to meet guests.

574
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,200
Shen.

575
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,890
Thank you,

576
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,370
Xiao.

577
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,310
I am Shen Bin.

578
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,470
Greetings, Prince Changle.

579
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,790
Greetings, Princess Changsheng.

580
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,030
I didn't know about your visit.

581
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,610
Sorry for not greeting you earlier.

582
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,700
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

583
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,130
Mr. Envoy is here too.

584
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,480
It's all my fault.

585
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,700
I was just discussing something with Shen

586
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,810
so I came late.

587
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,000
No problem.

588
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,130
(What a small world.)

589
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,170
(He's just everywhere.)

590
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,480
Sit down, everyone.

591
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,160
Just drink tea.

592
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,000
Sit, sit, sit.

593
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,910
Young Master Shen.

594
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,310
We were just chatting

595
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,780
about your talent and ability.

596
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,060
After seeing you today,

597
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,710
you do live up to your reputation.

598
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,610
You flatter me.

599
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,060
You don't think so?

600
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,990
He doesn't have talent.

601
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,370
But maybe

602
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,710
some abilities.

603
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,550
Abilities to fool people.

604
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,600
Right?

605
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,460
It's a good match for you.

606
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,270
Mr. Shen.

607
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,710
I heard you recently

608
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,400
got a new batch of calligraphy and paintings.

609
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,260
Take me to appreciate them.

610
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,070
OK.

611
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,610
Your Royal Highness, this way, please.

612
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,040
Princess Changsheng.

613
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,460
I've heard of your name for a long time.

614
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,550
I will give you a toast

615
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,410
with tea.

616
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,070
(This taste...)

617
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,220
(And he's sloppy.)

618
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,280
You flatter me.

619
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,680
Young Master Shen.

620
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,520
Very good.

621
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,440
There's magnetism between us.

622
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,740
Although it's the first time we meet,

623
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,070
I always feel that

624
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,410
I've seen you somewhere before.

625
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,570
First you have to give her
something to look forward to,

626
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,020
and then let her down.

627
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,570
When you go to the banquet later,

628
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,060
you must behave rudely.

629
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,060
Princess Changsheng hates men without manners.

630
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,850
You just have to be rude enough.

631
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,980
Then she won't fancy you.

632
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,700
Got it.

633
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,020
But how to be rude...

634
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,710
Let's drink this cup.

635
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,980
Your Highness will be my friend from now on.

636
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,470
Whenever you need me

637
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,310
in the future,

638
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,310
just let me know.

639
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,360
I'm willing to go

640
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,460
through fire and water for you.

641
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,980
Why didn't you drink it?

642
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,310
Do you think

643
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,160
Shen

644
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,330
is not sincere enough to friends?

645
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,110
Young Master Shen.

646
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,780
Today I came

647
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,990
to inquire about

648
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,680
your settlement in life.

649
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,520
Your Highness.

650
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,810
I think

651
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,710
you're out of my league.

652
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,120
You see, I am an assistant minister.

653
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,260
Actually, that was because
my father pulled some strings.

654
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,220
I don't have any real skills.

655
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,230
My father paid for painting 72 palace walls

656
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,570
to get me this job.

657
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,940
Your Highness, let's go.

658
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,200
I also think Mr. Shen

659
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,540
doesn't live up to your name.

660
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,960
If I see His Majesty,

661
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
I will report truthfully

662
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,260
what I saw and heard today.

663
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,880
Mr. Shen relies on your father's relationship

664
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,060
to come this far.

665
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,230
How much did it cost

666
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,740
to paint the 72 palace walls?

667
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,090
Check the account.

668
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,400
What's the crime

669
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,300
of buying an official position in Fuyu?

670
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,000
Wait a minute.

671
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,150
Mr. Envoy.

672
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,090
I was just joking.

673
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,240
Joke?

674
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,890
I don't find it funny.

675
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,460
There's a big problem here.

676
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,090
If we start to investigate,

677
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,460
many people involved will be implicated.

678
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,550
Just test if I have real talent or not.

679
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,060
Why bother to disturb His Majesty?

680
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,630
Your Highness.

681
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,060
Our two families have always
been on good terms.

682
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,460
Can you help me say something?

683
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,350
Sir.

684
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,070
Okay.

685
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,810
I will give face to you.

686
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,810
Confucius had three thousand disciples,

687
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,740
and 72 of them were proficient in the Six Arts.

688
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,640
Of these 72 people,

689
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,650
how many are adults

690
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,020
and how many are young people?

691
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,940
Such a simple question,

692
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,110
Mr. Shen,

693
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,310
can you answer it?

694
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,040
Well...

695
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,370
The Analects of Confucius

696
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,890
did not mention this.

697
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,680
Everyone here

698
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,940
is a talent of Fuyu.

699
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,260
Can't you answer such a simple question?

700
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,460
It seems that no one is competent in Fuyu.

701
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,900
(From "Zi Lu, Zeng Xi, Ran You,
Gong Xihua Sitting in Company") In late spring,

702
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,170
I put on spring clothing.

703
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,500
After bathing at River Yi

704
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,060
with five times six adults

705
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,370
and six times seven children,

706
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,960
we go to Wu Yu Terrace to catch some breeze.

707
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,600
Then we would be chanting songs
as we return home.

708
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,790
Five times six equals thirty.

709
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,740
Six times seven forty-two.

710
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,970
It's 72 people in total.

711
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,850
I don't know if my answer

712
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,100
is satisfactory.

713
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,850
Your Highness is really smart.

714
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,780
Fortunately, you didn't become an official.

715
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,500
Otherwise, you would be appointed
prime minister.

716
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,810
Not to mention an assistant minister,

717
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,130
you're qualified to be a minister.

718
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,650
I just wasn't ready.

719
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,230
You can deny me.

720
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,570
But you can't deny my father.

721
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,740
A warrior vanquished

722
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,200
still wants to struggle to survive.

723
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,740
Please give another question.

724
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,800
All right.

725
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,090
I have another test question.

726
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,060
Originally it was to test the women in Fuyu.

727
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,170
If Young Master Shen still can't answer...

728
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,780
Mr. Xiao and Your Highness,

729
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,230
are you afraid that Mr. Shen

730
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,130
is unable to do it?

731
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,520
No problem.

732
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,070
You can give him some hints.

733
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,940
Don't let him lose too badly.

734
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,200
No need.

735
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,300
I can do it alone.

736
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,860
(Humility and Purity)

737
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,180
(Average Annual Income Per Household in Fuyu)

738
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,300
Mr. Shen.

739
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,780
Although you have no ingenuity,

740
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,330
you still have some talent.

741
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,070
Sorry for the presumptuousness.

742
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,410
Your Highness, let's go.

743
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,020
You won't wait for His Royal Highness?

744
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,540
Mr. Envoy.

745
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,260
I guess my father wants
to talk to Mr. Shen for a while.

746
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,550
Let's go.

747
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,060
Your Highness, please.

748
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,610
Mr. Envoy.

749
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,470
Thank you for helping me out today.

750
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,310
You're welcome.

751
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,230
Today I saw

752
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,460
Your Highness' extraordinary talent.

753
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,980
I think you are the perfect choice
for peace-making marriage.

754
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,680
No, no, no.

755
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,020
What I said

756
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,300
just happened to be right.

757
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,080
I usually

758
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,130
am too lazy to even turn the pages.

759
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,300
But you helped Mr. Shen out today.

760
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,940
This shows your kindness and generosity.

761
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,810
Our peace-making marriage

762
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,150
values the personality.

763
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,360
You really are

764
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,390
appreciating...

765
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,110
Appreciating talents.

766
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,660
I'm not praising you on purpose.

767
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,520
Your Highness.

768
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,630
What a coincidence.

769
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,410
Sir.

770
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,570
Let's talk more about it later.

771
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,780
I have something

772
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,810
- to tell Young Master Xiao.
- Okay.

773
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,540
Then I'll wait for you at the door.

774
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,020
(Humility and Purity)

775
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,300
What do you want to do?

776
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,120
You and Shen Bin are not right for each other.

777
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,220
He's not right for me.

778
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,400
So you are?

779
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,610
If you insist on this,

780
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,850
I can make do

781
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,520
with it.

782
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,460
Even if all the men in the world died,

783
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,260
I won't marry you.

784
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,130
Congratulations, Shen.

785
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,130
You and Her Highness are both single.

786
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,030
You two are

787
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,680
a great match.

788
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,650
Young Master Xiao.

789
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,890
You're drunk.

790
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,040
Yes, yes.

791
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,300
Your Highness, please forgive me.

792
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,230
I mean you two

793
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,260
are a match made in heaven.

794
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,130
You made things difficult for me.

795
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,550
Are you still holding a grudge

796
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,510
for breaking your leg

797
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,740
in order to save me, right?

798
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,000
No.

799
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,060
Don't bring up old things.

800
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,990
Young Master Shen disagrees.

801
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,700
There is no need to force him.

802
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,890
You can take a horse to the water
but you cannot make it drink.

803
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,570
There's no need to

804
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,920
try to impose your will on him.

805
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,130
I didn't.

806
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,460
I'm telling you, this isn't over.

807
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,260
Next time you dare to make trouble,

808
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,890
I'll make you look bad.

809
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,200
Mr. Envoy.

810
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Your Highness, are you

811
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,410
going on a date again?

812
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,610
Sir, you misunderstood.

813
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,170
What happened today...

814
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,470
What happened today,

815
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,510
it started with feelings

816
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,730
and you controlled it with propriety.

817
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,640
Nothing is wrong with it.

818
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,740
Moreover, before the imperial decree is issued,

819
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,170
you're still free.

820
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,570
You can find your own good match.

821
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,300
Thank you, Mr. Envoy.

822
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,640
You're wise, sir.

823
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,710
We won the first battle.

824
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,200
I didn't expect that you found out

825
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,230
Fuyu's financial strength

826
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,070
(Average Annual Income Per Household in Fuyu)
so easily.

827
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,360
Ministries of Civil Office, Revenue,
Rites, War, Punishments, and Works.

828
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,620
Which shall we investigate next?

829
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,840
Next,

830
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,170
it depends on which kind of person

831
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,090
Her Highness wants to find.

832
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,920
I'm afraid that with her reputation,

833
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,650
it will be as difficult

834
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,890
as today.

835
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,680
People always believe what they hear,

836
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,610
but not what they see.

837
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,550
I think Her Highness is

838
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,460
a smart person.

839
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,870
Quite nice.

840
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,120
It seems that you want to marry

841
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,440
Her Highness.

842
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,740
You don't say.

843
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,370
Leave me, I'll change my clothes by myself.

844
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

845
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,130
Find my own good match.

846
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,980
So many people here.

847
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,780
Who is my good match?

848
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,480
How about this?

849
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,940
Young Master Chen.

850
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,090
Sixteen years old, well-mannered.

851
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,610
He's a bit young.

852
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,110
This one.

853
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,030
(Grandson of Duke Anding)
The young master in a duke's house.

854
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,160
Twenty-two years old.

855
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,300
Not married yet.

856
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,650
He looks good.

857
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,510
We've met him before.

858
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,350
That one.

859
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,370
Behaved unbridledly.

860
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,090
Yes.

861
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,680
He has a very bad temper

862
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,740
and he's self-righteous.

863
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,470
He likes to roll his eyes at people

864
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,940
and makes things difficult for his servants.

865
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,720
That won't work.

866
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,630
Another one.

867
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,870
The fourth son of the Wei family.

868
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,520
(Grandson of Duke Nankang)
This is good. This is good.

869
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,360
Talented and pretty.

870
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,660
Many girls have admired him.

871
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,200
Oh,

872
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,780
Yang Wulang.

873
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,550
How could I forget him?

874
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,390
Yang Wulang.

875
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,570
Yang Wulang?

876
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,130
Son of the Minister of Works?

877
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,740
Rumor has it that he has

878
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,800
some kind of quirks.

879
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,070
Just rumors.

880
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,010
How can you take it seriously?

881
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,200
That's it.

882
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,990
This time I'm going to make a thorough plan.

883
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,570
Make sure the time, place,
and person are right

884
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,890
and nothing goes wrong.

885
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,680
Yeah.

886
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,370
If I say I didn't mean to take revenge,

887
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,460
he probably won't believe it.
