00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,660
=Episode 6=

3
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,620
(Peace-making Marriage)

4
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,780
(Zhao Huaibi)

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,460
(Peace-making Marriage)
(Zhao Huaibi)

6
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,210
Zhao, look how beautiful the flowers are.

7
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,320
Yes.

8
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,600
What are we going to do after breakfast?

9
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,650
Go horseback riding or fishing?

10
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,040
I have some official business to attend to.

11
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,530
I can't play with you.

12
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,910
Official business?

13
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,990
His Majesty wants me
to transport salt to Yan State.

14
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,490
We will set off in the afternoon.

15
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,070
Yan State?

16
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,880
Then we won't see each other for a long time.

17
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,970
Yan State is very close to us.

18
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,390
Three days later,

19
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,690
I'll come back to see you.

20
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,390
Why don't I tell Father

21
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,370
I'll go with you?

22
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,790
Well...

23
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,530
This is probably not a good idea.

24
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,460
You don't want me to go with you?

25
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,180
The journey to Yan State is bumpy.

26
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,090
I'm afraid you'll feel ill.

27
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,600
Never mind.

28
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,020
Go get busy.

29
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,950
His Majesty trusts us

30
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,110
and leaves Muyan Forest

31
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,650
to our mansion's care.

32
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,460
Does all the salt come from these trees?

33
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,950
That's right.

34
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,630
There is also some on the ground.

35
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,230
Although most of the salt

36
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,720
is derived from sea salt refining,

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,740
the process is complicated.

38
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,550
Using Muyan trees to make salt
is a characteristic of Fuyu,

39
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,550
it's also the foundation

40
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,630
for Fuyu to establish

41
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,900
in the world.

42
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,000
It brings benefits to the country
and the people.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,160
Your Highness, the refined salt is ready.

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,090
General Zhao will send them
to Yan State in a while.

45
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,490
Your Highness.

46
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,990
General, no need for formalities.

47
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,690
The salt is ready.

48
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,230
I told them to put cover over the salt

49
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,600
to prevent it from melting.

50
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,470
Transporting salt

51
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,550
is a big deal.

52
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,140
Please be careful along the way, General.

53
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,180
Your Highness, you're thoughtful.

54
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,980
I will leave now.

55
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,540
Get ready to set off.

56
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,950
General.

57
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,160
General, bad news.

58
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,640
- Princess is missing.
- What?

59
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
When?

60
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,110
Today after Princess Guangde met you,

61
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,750
she knew you're leaving this afternoon

62
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,960
and worried you wouldn't eat
the pastry from hometown,

63
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,520
so she wanted to prepare fish cakes for you.

64
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,640
We followed her

65
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,810
but still lost her.

66
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,100
We only found her shoes by the lake.

67
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,990
Really?

68
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,720
How dare I lie about something like this?

69
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,890
Now the palace is looking for
the whereabouts of Princess Guangde.

70
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,110
His Majesty already knew

71
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,990
and sent the Royal Guards to help.

72
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,830
General.

73
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,540
Princess Guangde's lost.

74
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,490
But I have military duties
and cannot leave at will.

75
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,690
Your Highness, could you...

76
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,180
Leave this matter to me.

77
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,300
You go transport salt first.

78
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,030
The salt can be transported to Yan State
in as fast as two days.

79
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,620
I'll wait here until sunset.

80
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,670
Be relieved and wait here.

81
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,570
I'm going to the palace now.

82
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,690
If there is any news,
I'll notify you immediately.

83
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,490
Thank you, Your Highness.

84
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,270
Let's go.

85
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,440
Your Highness.

86
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,490
I'll look for her with you.

87
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,690
It'll be faster.

88
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,880
Have you seen the Princess?

89
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,030
- No.
- Go over there and take a look.

90
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,870
Go.

91
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,440
- Princess.
- Princess.

92
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,190
Princess.

93
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,110
Not here.

94
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,420
Go, quickly.

95
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,280
- Princess.
- Princess.

96
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,120
Princess.

97
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,060
Guangde.

98
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,790
- Princess.
- Princess.

99
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,670
- Guangde.
- Princess.

100
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,860
Princess.

101
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,010
- Guangde, come out quickly.
- Princess Guangde.

102
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
Guangde.

103
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,120
Are you okay?

104
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,660
I'm fine.

105
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,790
Princess Guangde

106
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,690
is so petty.

107
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,220
She went missing over such a small thing.

108
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,360
No.

109
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,660
Although she is a little willful,

110
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,220
she won't be so inconsiderate.

111
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,720
I heard from the maids in the palace

112
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,370
she wanted to make fish cakes for General Zhao.

113
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,930
Could she be in the Imperial Kitchen?

114
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,640
If she's really in the Imperial Kitchen,

115
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,060
we should've heard news.

116
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,490
I know.

117
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,030
You are really here.

118
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,670
Changsheng, why are you here?

119
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,130
I can't find you anywhere in the palace.

120
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,870
I heard you wanted to make fish cakes

121
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,190
so I wondered if you'd come here.

122
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,030
I...

123
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,060
Do you know that everyone is worried about you?

124
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,150
I am afraid

125
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,920
the chefs in the Imperial Kitchen
will help me make them.

126
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,490
So I came to our playhouse.

127
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,370
What's with the shoes by the lake?

128
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,980
Everyone thought you were drowned.

129
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,980
Shoes?

130
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,890
What shoes?

131
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,680
Maybe when I was fishing just now,

132
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,640
I'm afraid they would die

133
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,720
and became too anxious,

134
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,930
so the shoes fell off.

135
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,110
Come with me to see His Majesty.

136
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,920
The whole palace has been searching for you.

137
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,870
General Zhao is delaying

138
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,100
to transport salt for you.

139
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,630
Okay.

140
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,750
Do you want to try my fish cake first?

141
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,660
It's super delicious.

142
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,880
Come on.

143
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,640
Alright.

144
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,810
If you don't want to eat, forget it.

145
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,240
Give me.

146
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,010
I got shoes for you.

147
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,600
Thanks.

148
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,670
The shoes fell off,

149
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,080
and you're still frying fish cakes here.

150
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,310
How confused.

151
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,370
I don't know what you're thinking.

152
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,120
In my opinion,

153
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,400
Princess Guangde is missing,

154
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
and Princess Changsheng will be happy.

155
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,420
She's just pretending to be a good friend.

156
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,020
Everyone knows that they don't get along.

157
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,470
Right.

158
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,610
They had pursued General Zhao together.

159
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,610
If Princess really had an accident,

160
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,850
Her Highness can marry General Zhao.

161
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,690
She is the happiest one.

162
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,110
But General Zhao dares not to marry her.

163
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,960
How dare you

164
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,330
to talk about Her Highness behind her back.

165
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,510
- Princess, spare me.
- Guards, slap them.

166
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,210
- I was wrong.
- Or you can slap yourselves.

167
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,510
Never mind.

168
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,310
We should go meet His Majesty.

169
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,450
There's no need to get mad at them.

170
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,420
You remember,

171
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,670
what happens between Changsheng and I
is our business.

172
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,360
If you dare to gossip again,

173
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,690
I'll cut off your tongues.

174
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,030
Yes.

175
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,200
Let's go.

176
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,360
(Waves by the Sea)
Brother, don't worry.

177
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,920
We have sent people to look for her.

178
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,450
I believe there will be news soon.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,560
Among all my children,

180
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,950
this is my favorite daughter.

181
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,670
If something happens to her,

182
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,920
I won't live anymore.

183
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,800
I can empathize with you.

184
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,810
Brother.

185
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,550
Your Majesty.

186
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,500
The Princess has been found.

187
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,550
Dad.

188
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,300
You naughty girl.

189
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,070
Where have you been?

190
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,440
It's all your fault.

191
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,330
You asked Zhao to transport salt.

192
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,790
I just thought

193
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,590
he would miss my fish cakes.

194
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,690
So...

195
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,930
Zhao?

196
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,660
Zhao Huaibi?

197
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,760
Yuzhi?

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,590
Okay, okay, okay.

199
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,960
I'll go tell Zhao.

200
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,070
I'm afraid he'll be anxious.

201
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,140
Also, the fish cakes won't be tasty
when they get cold.

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Didn't he go to transport salt?

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,840
He...

204
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,850
Yes.

205
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,790
General Zhao is already on his way
to transport salt.

206
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,180
I'm afraid it's too late.

207
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,020
When did you start?

208
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,280
When he comes back,

209
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,420
do you want me to grant him a marriage?

210
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,060
Dad.

211
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,160
Your Majesty.

212
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,120
The heavy snow

213
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,450
crushed the bridge to Yan State.

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,690
That is the only way for us to reach Yan State.

215
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,560
Fortunately, Zhao Huaibi left early.

216
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,660
I guess he's crossed the broken bridge.

217
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,960
How lucky!

218
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,900
Almost affected the salt transport.

219
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,550
Your Majesty.

220
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,180
I'll return to the Muyan Forest
to make snow defense.

221
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,380
I'm leaving now.

222
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,140
I am coming too.

223
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,420
Where are we going?

224
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,020
Why did you stop me just now?

225
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,360
Make your words clear.

226
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,550
(Imperial Study)
Otherwise I won't go.

227
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,060
There are too many people here.

228
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,690
I have asked General Zhao
to wait in the Muyan Forest.

229
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,810
If you don't want him to be convicted,

230
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,550
then follow me.

231
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,020
Wait for me.

232
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,150
Zhao.

233
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,000
These are the fish cakes I made for you.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,970
You should try it soon.

235
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,550
Maybe it's a little cold.

236
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,810
But it tastes good.

237
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,430
You got lost for this?

238
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,270
Yes.

239
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,330
Didn't you say you wanted
to eat fish cakes last time?

240
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,160
I'm afraid you'll be gone for too long

241
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,730
and will miss the taste.

242
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,450
Try it and see if it suits your taste.

243
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,150
Guangde.

244
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,540
You've really made a big trouble.

245
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,970
I just made some fish cakes.

246
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,800
How did I cause a big trouble?

247
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,060
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

248
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,180
In the past, people needed to

249
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,590
set off at night for salt transportation,

250
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,830
and maybe they could make it in two days.

251
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,790
Now the snow has broken the bridge.

252
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,760
The journey can't be completed

253
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,900
in three days.

254
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Do you know

255
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,970
what will be the consequences

256
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,070
if General Zhao delayed
the transportation of salt?

257
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,910
Big deal,

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,640
I'll explain it to Father.

259
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,800
Do you think His Majesty will change his mind

260
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,920
because of your words?

261
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,140
Delaying the salt trade

262
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,850
is a capital crime.

263
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,140
What to do then?

264
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,380
What else can we do?

265
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,810
We can only think of a way

266
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,420
to deliver the salt in time.

267
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,780
So what if we can't deliver it?

268
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,570
Worst case, you won't be a general.

269
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,020
Anyway, the Prince Consort
cannot serve as an official.

270
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,470
It's only a matter of time

271
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,730
for you to take off your armor.

272
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,450
Throughout my life,

273
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,830
my only wish is to lead troops

274
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,900
to defend the country.

275
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,500
If this is true,

276
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,570
I'd rather be killed.

277
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,570
What do you mean?

278
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,140
You don't want to be a Prince Consort?

279
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,930
Now is not the time to talk about this.

280
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,790
Let's think of a solution

281
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,500
to get through this first.

282
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,970
There's no time to lose.

283
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,080
Your Highness.

284
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,550
I'll leave first.

285
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,910
More preparation may quicken
the speed in doing work.

286
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,780
Give me one night.

287
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,850
I'll think about a solution carefully.

288
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,210
Thank you, Your Highness.

289
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,970
Zhao, fish cakes.

290
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,180
Changsheng.

291
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,020
What should I do?

292
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,400
Guangde.

293
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,100
I'll send someone
to take you back to the palace first.

294
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,520
After returning to the palace,

295
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,120
you must keep your mouth shut.

296
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,550
Just tell me

297
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,880
what you need.

298
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,160
No matter what time it is,

299
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,350
send people to the palace to find me.

300
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,420
I'll be always on call.

301
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,840
Young Master.

302
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,210
God really helps us.

303
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,760
What does it mean?

304
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,690
Do you know

305
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,010
Fuyu and Yan State

306
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,830
will establish diplomatic relations
due to salt trade?

307
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,310
Once the salt transport is delayed,

308
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,180
the two sides will hold grudges.

309
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,900
Fuyu has always used salt
to manage relations with other countries.

310
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,780
We just need to add fuel to the fire,

311
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,860
and then, it'll lead to a breakdown

312
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,690
in Fuyu's relationship with other countries.

313
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,120
By then, Great Tang

314
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,300
can conquer Fuyu in one fell swoop.

315
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,040
I got it.

316
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,880
Leave me.

317
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,790
Yes.

318
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,180
Your Highness, you're still not resting?

319
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,670
Yi'an.

320
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,300
I'm looking at the map.

321
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,900
(Route Map between Fuyu and Yan State)

322
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,280
Is it for

323
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,570
General Zhao's salt transport?

324
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,550
It seems

325
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,730
Your Highness still doesn't trust me.

326
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,730
You already knew.

327
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,020
Can you keep it a secret for me?

328
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,380
If this is just a matter
between Yan State and Fuyu,

329
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,810
it's not serious.

330
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,690
But it is related to the foundation of Fuyu.

331
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,060
If there is a problem with the salt,

332
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,670
then our mansion

333
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,930
will definitely bear the brunt.

334
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,380
We will be held accountable.

335
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,930
You chose to

336
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,660
tell me such a serious matter?

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,240
You are smart.

338
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,330
If you want to know,

339
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,540
you will find out.

340
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,780
If I tell you directly,

341
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,000
perhaps

342
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,540
you'll keep it a secret for me

343
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,760
for our friendship's sake.

344
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,540
Your Highness is straightforward.

345
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,610
I will keep it a secret for you.

346
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,670
Thank you.

347
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,730
Your Highness, Mr. Envoy.

348
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,120
What's wrong?

349
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,260
General Zhao sent someone to ask

350
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,570
whether you've come up with a solution.

351
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,450
Give me a moment.

352
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,760
I'll figure it out tonight.

353
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,600
Yes.

354
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,900
Yi'an, I can't chat with you anymore.

355
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,430
I need to think about

356
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,970
a way out.

357
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,140
I'm leaving now.

358
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,980
(Pure and Jade-like Heart)

359
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,940
(Virtue and Morality)

360
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,610
Your Highness, you didn't sleep all night.

361
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,430
Have something to drink.

362
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,270
No.

363
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,130
Thank you, Yi'an.

364
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,640
Your Highness.

365
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,360
There's news from the Muyan Forest

366
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,640
that General Zhao has come to get salt.

367
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,500
What?

368
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,260
Let's go to the Muyan Forest.

369
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,160
What's the point of you going?

370
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,710
I haven't figured out a solution

371
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,570
and wasted General Zhao's time for nothing.

372
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,270
I have to see him

373
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,170
before he leaves.

374
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,070
Sit down.

375
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,740
You rest at home.

376
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,940
I'll solve it.

377
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,460
You?

378
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,890
Do you believe me?

379
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,940
It's not that I don't disbelieve you.

380
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,920
It's just

381
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,260
this matter is huge.

382
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,760
I...

383
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,460
You figured out a solution?

384
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,980
Let's discuss it together.

385
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,950
I know

386
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,640
if I don't explain why,

387
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,890
you can't be at ease.

388
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,920
Yan State is located downstream of Fuyu.

389
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,950
Usually by land,

390
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,980
it takes three days to get there.

391
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,330
What if we go by water?

392
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,170
How can I not know this?

393
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,560
It's just

394
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,920
salt melts in water.

395
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,760
We're afraid of accidents.

396
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,370
Even if we're willing to take risks now,

397
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,330
the water is frozen.

398
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,950
I sent someone to ask.

399
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,120
The ice is solid.

400
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,540
There is no way to cut through it,

401
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,260
then how can we sail a boat on it?

402
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,790
Wait.

403
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,980
Your Highness, what did you think of?

404
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,300
The ice is solid.

405
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,080
We can choose not to sail

406
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,370
- but slide.
- Right.

407
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,940
(Fuyu, 140 km)

408
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,420
(Yan State)

409
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,020
I calculated the gradient and wind direction.

410
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,950
We just need to equip the salt cart

411
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,850
with skates

412
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,410
and put a sail on it.

413
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,090
In less than two days,

414
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,410
it can reach Yan State.

415
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,240
Yi'an.

416
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,840
You are so smart.

417
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,680
Thank you.

418
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,600
From now on,

419
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,610
I will definitely believe you.

420
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,570
Jinyan, get prepared.

421
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,200
Let's go.

422
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,610
- Changsheng.
- Your Highness.

423
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,830
Don't move.

424
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,070
Lie down.

425
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,090
You've been busy all night.

426
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,460
Take a good rest.

427
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,070
All right.

428
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,350
Be careful.

429
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,460
Do you remember the method
Mr. Envoy just mentioned?

430
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,710
Your Highness, rest assured.

431
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,650
I remember every single word.

432
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,610
I'll let Youyong and Youmou go with you

433
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,750
to make a sailing ice cart together

434
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,970
and help General Zhao transport salt.

435
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,110
Yes.

436
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,030
- I...
- Don't talk.

437
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,870
Lie here.

438
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,440
By the way,

439
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,980
I have to send someone to inform Guangde.

440
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,270
It's alright now.

441
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,750
Let Princess Guangde learn a lesson

442
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,600
and worry for a while.

443
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,440
This

444
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,410
isn't good.

445
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,590
Go to sleep.

446
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,230
Sir, what you told me

447
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,260
is all done.

448
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,830
What's wrong with you?

449
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,920
- I...
- It's fine.

450
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,680
He's tired.

451
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,920
Don't stop him.

452
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,800
Speak.

453
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,890
I don't understand.

454
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,560
It was such a great opportunity.

455
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,950
It's alright if you didn't seize it.

456
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,890
Why are you helping Fuyu?

457
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,550
Youmou.

458
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,880
What do you think?

459
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,120
Sir, you're thoughtful.

460
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,410
We can't guess your intention.

461
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,840
Do you really think so?

462
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,680
Sure.

463
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,590
Sir,

464
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,120
even if you punish me, I still need to say.

465
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
Are you in love with Princess Changsheng?

466
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,880
- Youyong.
- Women are the cause of trouble.

467
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,720
Sir.

468
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,110
Let me ask you,

469
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,410
if something goes wrong
with the salt transport,

470
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,600
and Fuyu becomes our affiliation,

471
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,620
do we need to re-establish
our diplomatic relations and trade

472
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,980
with other countries?

473
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,780
Sir, do you really think so?

474
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,370
Before imperial decree is issued,

475
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,020
Your Highness is still free.

476
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,570
I think only God

477
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,130
can save me.

478
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,890
If he is willing to change my fate,

479
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,940
maybe I still have hope.

481

there are many things

483
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,160
confusing.

484
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,460
Even in the royal family,

485
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,850
I've gone through several hardships

486
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,050
in the easy matter of getting married.

487
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,810
So

488
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,570
it's better to be confused.

You will help me, right?

494
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,020
What are you doing?

495
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,570
Good swordsmanship.

496
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,840
How come you came out
wearing such thin clothes?

497
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,880
I took a nap

498
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,030
and got bit stuffy.

499
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,890
So I went out for a walk.

500
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,020
Don't catch a cold.

501
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,850
No need, I'm in good health.

502
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,240
Look.

503
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,130
You caught a cold.

504
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,510
Alright.

505
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,960
Yi'an.

506
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,300
Thank you for today.

507
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,090
There's no need to say thank you.

508
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,990
I don't know whether things are going well

509
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,020
with General Zhao.

510
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,410
He should be there soon.

511
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,940
I have sent Jinyan and Shenxing
to inform Guangde.

512
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,920
She should be relieved.

513
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
Can you stop thinking about other people?

514
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,170
Think about yourself too.

515
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,540
- For myself?
- Yes.

516
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,650
I don't want to marry into Great Tang.

517
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,980
Can you make this happen?

518
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,320
Can you tell me something practical?

519
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,560
Then think about

520
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,700
how to marry myself before this.

521
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,870
Your Highness.

522
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,670
Your Highness, we informed Princess Guangde.

523
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,890
She asked me to thank you.

524
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,020
It's rare that she thanks me.

525
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,350
Sir.

526
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,370
Your Highness.

527
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,310
Your Highness.

528
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,020
What happened to Youyong?

529
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,400
He's fine.

530
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,980
I scolded him just now.

531
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,270
He's throwing a tantrum.

532
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,240
By the way,

533
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,510
I thought of something.

534
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,650
I want to go out for a walk.

535
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,840
All along,

536
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,260
I haven't treated you well.

537
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,980
I'll be a good host tonight.

538
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,510
Let's go out for a walk.

539
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,230
You just caught a cold.

540
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,130
Go back and rest.

541
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,880
I've taken a day off.

542
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,030
I can't sleep.

543
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,710
You guys helped me so much today.

544
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,810
I should thank you.

545
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,750
Then...

546
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,590
Let's go.

547
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,940
Jinyan, Shenxing,

548
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,750
Youyong, Youmou, let's go together.

549
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,590
Okay.

550
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,600
Your Highness, put on some more clothes.

551
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,440
Okay.

552
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,220
(Candy)

553
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,270
Boss, give me one.

554
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,110
Okay.

555
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,650
- Thank you.
- Here you are. Take care.

556
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,840
There's more over there.

557
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,060
Let's go and see.

558
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,940
Pumpkin candy.

559
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,160
This is Fuyu's pumpkin candy.
Do you want to eat it?

560
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,000
You like it?

561
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,880
This is better than candied maltose,

562
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,920
not so greasy at all,

563
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,840
and also chewy.

564
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,940
I used to buy it to eat.

565
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,080
Do you want to try it?

566
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,460
You might like it too.

567
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,020
How can men like to eat candy?

568
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,880
Pretentious.

569
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,810
He's being shy.

570
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,160
Don't misunderstand.

571
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,090
I don't like candy.

572
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,020
I just enjoy the process of making candy.

573
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,510
Here.

574
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,070
Look.

575
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,020
Be careful.

576
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,460
Let's hear

577
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,980
(A Perfect Match)
a love story.

578
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,840
There is daylight

579
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,540
and the stars.

580
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:40,410
Although people get old,

581
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,230
an early marriage

582
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,980
takes our worries away.

583
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,990
Let's hear...

584
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,830
Shenxing.

585
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,800
Let's go out and play in the snow.

586
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,810
- Go.
- Go.

587
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,070
There is sky...

588
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,940
I am coming too.

589
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,350
Go.

590
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,890
It often snows in Fuyu.

591
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,650
Look how happy they are.

592
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,540
I am also very happy today.

593
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,400
Does it often snow in Great Tang?

594
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,540
Great Tang is located at the south

595
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,170
so it seldom snows.

596
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,440
What?

597
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,890
You began to hesitate?

598
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,260
By this time,

599
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,740
why do you need to ask it?

600
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,230
It is better to put aside our own goals

601
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,540
and enjoy the moment.

602
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,380
Youyong.

603
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,200
Changsheng.

604
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,940
Let's go out and play in the snow together.

606
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,020

- Okay.
- No.

622
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,260
I have to go to Noble Consort Xian
for training today.

623
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,400
Get me dressed quickly.

624
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,840
Your Highness, take a rest.

625
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,230
Mr. Envoy knows that you don't want
to show weakness in front of others,

626
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,440
so he already asked for leave

627
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,470
at Concubine Xian's place

628
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,670
on the grounds of receiving them.

629
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,510
Yi'an?

630
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,370
Mr. Envoy is both wise and brave.

with the peace-making marriage.

Prince Qin

634
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,890
is much better than me.

635
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,460
Really?

636
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,570
Take the medicine.

637
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,240

638
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,810
I don't want to take medicine.

639
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,400
You got sick.

640
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,130
You must take medicine.

641
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,810
It's a bit bitter.

642
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,090
Go get the candied fruit.

643

No.

So you won't make

646
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,090
the same mistake again.

Your medicine is effective.

651
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,570
I'm almost recovered.

652
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,220
Always staying in the house

653
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,740
will make me sick from boredom.

654
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,080
I just decocted this new medicine.

655
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,300
You should drink it while it's hot.

656

It's fine,

658
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,870
just a minor injury.

659
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,440
Wait a minute.

660
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,950
This is...

661
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,370
Poison to silence people.

662
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,700

00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,350
Okay.

666

667
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,850
Where is he now?

668
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,570
The salt has been delivered to Yan State.

669
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,080
General Zhao is reporting in the palace.

670
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,160
He sent someone to say

671
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,220
he will come to thank you in person.

672
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,370
Very good.

673
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,740
You are also a great contributor.

This way.

682
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,320
I'd better go to the lobby and wait for her.

683
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,260
You take it first.

684
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,870
Yes.

685
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,600
General Zhao, please wait a moment.

686
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,740

690
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,320
you helped Her Highness

691
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,770
come up with the ingenious idea.

692
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,460
I came to express my gratitude.

693
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,390
Where's Her Highness?

694
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,730
Her Highness is ill.

695
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,980
I am afraid...

696
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,030
General, you're here.

697
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,690
- Your Highness.
- Come and sit down.

698
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,030
I heard that you were ill.
Did you take medicine?

699
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,250
Thank you for your concern, General.

700
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,880
I took Yi'an's medicine

701
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,060
and have gotten much better.

702
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,310
That's good.

703
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,610
You helped me at the critical time.

704
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,210
I really can't repay you.

705
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,570
I'm afraid if you continue talking,

706
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,340
you'll pledge yourself to me.

707

708
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,730
you've done me a great favor.

710
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,860
I'm willing to marry you.

Your Highness.

714
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,240
General, you should go after Guangde.

715
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,080
Okay.

716
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,600

Zhao Huaibi.

718
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,110
Are you serious about what you just said?

719
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,550
I meant what I said,

720
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,630
and I said what I meant.

721
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,570
I don't allow it.

722
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,110
I know I delayed your salt transportation.

723
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,880
But I didn't do it on purpose.

724
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,250
I apologize to you, okay?

725
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,680
Moreover,

726
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,500
I just wanted to make fish cakes for you.

727
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,130
I really like you.

728
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,880
Don't marry Changsheng,

729
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,430
marry me, okay?

730
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,500
Princess, this is not the reason.

731
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,820
Then it's because

732
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,820
she helped you, right?

733
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,840
I am grateful to her too.

734
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,860
But you don't have to marry her.

735
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,590
I'll tell Father

736
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,240
not to marry Changsheng off to Great Tang.

737
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,460
- This should be okay, right?
- Princess.

738
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,500
I really can't marry you.

739
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,610
Why, Zhao Huaibi?

740
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,120
Princess.

741
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,160
It's getting late.

742
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,340
You should go back and have a rest earlier.

743
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,880
Why on earth do you want to marry Changsheng?

744
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,130
You should explain it clearly.

745
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,460
General Zhao wants to marry me

746
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,210
not because of me.

747
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,860
What is it for?

748
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,090
We have a rule,

749
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,830
the Prince Consort
is not allowed to be an official.

750
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,020
He cares about this.

751
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,030
In the beginning, he got caught up

752
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,130
and forgot about it.

753
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,130
Now he remembers

754
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,540
and can only break up with her.

755
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,020
It seems that General Zhao

756
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,120
loves the battlefield

757
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,250
more than the beauty.

758
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,030
What about you?

759
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,150
If you were him,

760
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,250
what would you choose?

761
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,590
Your Highness, I've been looking for you.

762
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,860
How come you came here first?

763
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,110
This is...

764
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,990
This is the medicine
that Princess Guangde just sent.

765
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,240
They are all medicines from the palace.

766
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,080
Your Highness, try them.

767
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,720
No need.

768
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,240
I just take Yi'an's medicine.

769
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,420
Then I'll collect it.

770
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,520
What?

771
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,340
Afraid she'll poison you?

772
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,150
Guangde is not such a person.

773
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,280
It seems that Your Highness

774
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,430
doesn't want to tell Guangde

775
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,270
General Zhao's ideas.

776
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,720
That's for sure.

777
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,090
If I tell her,

778
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,980
Guangde will make a scene in the palace.

779
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,650
His Majesty will inevitably doubt

780
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,800
General Zhao

781
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,250
is using the hard-to-get tactic.

782
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,940
By the time,

783
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,340
the consequences could be disastrous.

784
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,420
Why are you still thinking about others?

785
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,210
How do you know

786
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,860
I'm not making things up

787
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,630
and finding excuses

788
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,470
for my own selfishness?

789
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,020
(How can I not know)

790
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,420
(what kind of person are you?)

791
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,720
Come, come.

792
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,210
How about it?

793
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,390
Shush.

794
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,770
What are you doing?

795
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,900
Your Highness, this is a game in Great Tang.

796
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,030
When birds go out to look for food in winter,

797
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,430
we sprinkle a handful of millet

798
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,570
and then catch them.

799
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,820
- Got it. Got it.
- Got it. Got it.

800
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,390
Jinyan.

801
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,340
Set it free.

802
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,350
This bird is very aggressive.

803
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,770
After losing freedom,

804
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,900
it can't make it through the night

805
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,290
being locked in the cage.

806
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,200
All right.

807
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,430
What?

808
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,500
You don't like it?

809
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,240
In your eyes,

810
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,570
it's just a temporary plaything.

811
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,720
Why ruin its future

812
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,840
for a momentary interest?

813
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,820
That's too serious.

814
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,820
Now in this cold winter,

815
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,730
they can't find food outside

816
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,460
or a shelter.

817
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,900
They'll gonna freeze to death too.

818
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,390
So

819
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,460
the cage

820
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,130
is not necessarily a bad place.

821
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,920
If we look at ourselves,

822
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,940
all beings are equal.

823
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,470
If it is hungry,

824
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,210
it'll have a way to find food.

825
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,680
If it's cold,

826
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,020
there is a place it wants to go.

827
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,320
This is not something that others
can help make a decision on.

828
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,570
Maybe you think

829
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,860
the cage is a shelter.

830
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,730
But I feel

831
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,020
that's like hell.

832
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,990
Your Highness.

833
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,360
General Zhao sent a message

834
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,470
and said he wouldn't

835
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,500
break his promise.

836
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,060
(Looking for Heron)

837
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,910
Sir,

838
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,240
our return date is set.

839
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,380
Any other instructions?

840
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,640
What?

841
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,540
You are in a hurry to get back to Great Tang?

842
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,730
- Of course...
- Of course not.

843
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,800
It's up to you to decide

844
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,650
whether we stay or not.

845
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,290
I will tell His Majesty

846
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,990
we will set off in seven days.

847
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:41,830
Yes.

848
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,830
Then

849
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,610
I'll take my leave first.

850
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,420
Maybe you think

851
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,650
the cage is a shelter.

852
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,900
But I feel

853
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,090
that's like hell.

854
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,680
Sir,

855
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,360
the purposes of our visit to Fuyu

856
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,520
include the peace-making marriage.

857
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Just marry

858
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,900
whoever you like.

859
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:05,990
Don't hesitate.

860
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,040
I'll take my leave.

861
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,210
Changsheng, are you okay?

862
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,030
I came to see you many times.

863
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,030
You didn't want to see me.

864
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,460
Did I do something wrong?

865
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,540
I was busy before.

866
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,900
Something happened in the Muyan Forest.

867
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,770
Plus I'm sick.

868
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,170
- So...
- You're sick?

869
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,210
Why is everyone getting sick recently?

870
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,650
Everyone?

871
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,840
Who else is sick?

872
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,730
Guangde.

873
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,940
General Zhao refuses to marry her,

874
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,170
and Guangde fell seriously ill because of this.

875
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,360
Changsheng.

876
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,430
Don't think so much.

877
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,550
None of this matters.

878
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,590
What's important

879
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,240
is General Zhao wants to marry you.

880
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,420
Your chance has come.

881
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,690
Chance?

882
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Princess.

883
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,980
Eat something.

884
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,150
I won't, take it away.

885
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,430
If you don't eat,

886
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,160
how are you going
to compete with me for General Zhao?

887
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,940
Liu Changsheng.

888
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,860
Are you trying to piss me off?

889
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,690
Give it to me.

890
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,060
Liu Changsheng, get out!

891
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,650
I don't want to see you.

892
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,840
Anger is harmful to health.

893
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,110
Save some strength

894
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,060
to take good care of yourself.

895
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,630
Crocodile tears.

896
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,680
Don't think you saved Zhao Huaibi before,

897
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,420
so he will be grateful to you.

898
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,950
These are not

899
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,090
crocodile tears.

900
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,630
Moreover,

901
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,150
how do you know it's gratitude?

902
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,460
Maybe he's really fallen for me.

903
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,940
Zhao Huaibi likes me.

904
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,720
Like you?

905
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,760
What does he like about you?

906
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,630
He likes you when you're unreasonable

907
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,510
and interfere with his work
regardless of the occasion?

908
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,350
I...

909
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,860
I don't know why this happened.

910
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,590
But I just like him too much.

911
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,690
I can't live without him.

912
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,650
I don't want to be separated from him
even for a moment.

913
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,210
You know what does it feel like

914
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,250
when you like someone?

915
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,570
Liking someone

916
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:14,020
means unconditional dedication and sacrifice.

917
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,190
I only want him

918
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,980
to be happy and joyful.

919
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,200
Look.

920
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,210
You know too

921
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,150
that love is fulfillment,

922
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,130
rather than possession.

923
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,680
You are tricking me, aren't you?

924
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,030
You just want me to give Zhao Huaibi to you.

925
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,340
I won't give up.

926
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,630
Zhao Huaibi is not an object.

927
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,980
He has the right to choose.

928
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:37,950
I think you should not

929
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,510
drink this bowl of soup.

930
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:40,540
Just die of illness.

931
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,240
With one less choice,

932
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,510
he can only be mine.

933
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:44,350
In your dreams.

934
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,090
I'll not let you have your way.

935
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,730
I will get better soon.

936
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,720
Maids.

937
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,470
I want to eat.

938
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,360
I want to recover.

939
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,290
Okay, I'll ask the kitchen to prepare it.

940
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:22,420
(Candy)

941
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,680
How can men like to eat candy?

942
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,920
Don't misunderstand.

943
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,200
I don't like candy.

944
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,610
I just enjoy the process of making candy.

945
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,070
Boss, give me a pack.

946
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:38,910
Okay.

947
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,430
Here you are.

948
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,270
Thanks.

949
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,540
You choose.

950
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:05,470
Yi'an.

951
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,880
Haven't you rested yet?

952
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,720
Yes.

953
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,420
Didn't you just come back too?

954
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,940
Are you waiting for me?

955
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,320
I bought this.

956
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Do you want to try it together?

957
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,160
OK.

958
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,340
It's not yours.

959
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,570
You've seen Guangde?

960
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,380
She is very unhappy.

961
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,210
Then shouldn't you be happy?

962
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,690
Certainly.

963
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,340
I don't think so.

964
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,980
You don't know me that well.

965
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,770
Xiaoke has been with me for many years.

966
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,130
If I leave it,

967
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,820
I guess it will be sad too.

968
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,060
The same is true for you and Guangde.

969
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,210
Are you comparing Guangde to a duck?

970
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,340
If we look at ourselves,

971
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,860
all beings are equal.

972
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,840
This time,

973
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,090
she's really enamored.

974
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,240
You're going to give up?

975
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,210
Go with me to Great Tang.

976
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,610
How can I give up so easily?

977
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,640
Come.

978
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,610
