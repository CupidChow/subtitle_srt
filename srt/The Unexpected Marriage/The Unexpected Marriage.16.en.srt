=Episode 16=

3
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,190
Send warmth?

4
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,430
Thank you, I'm not cold.

5
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,770
Since I'm here,

6
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,260
let me in to talk for a while.

7
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,050
Please.

8
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,980
I want to sleep.

9
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
Look.

10
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,330
What are you doing?

11
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,610
I'm getting inflamed

12
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,540
and my mouth is swollen.

13
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,030
And you still took advantage of me.

14
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,130
Your Highness.

15
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,680
Is your mouth okay?

16
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,520
Why is it so red?

17
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,960
I understand.

18
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,930
What do you understand?

19
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,410
Go to the training ground and run thirty laps.

20
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,210
What's there to be shy about?

21
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,660
Is Her Highness not satisfied?

22
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,540
Run sixty laps.

23
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,120
What are you grinning about?

24
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,960
Let's go.

25
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,770
(Library)
I think you're wrong about this.

26
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,520
- Change it like this.
- Don't change it.

27
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,680
You said it before.

28
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,660
What are you saying?

29
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,840
- He said he had to change it.
- Your Highness.

30
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,050
This doesn't need to be changed at all.

31
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,560
I didn't say it.

32
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,400
Changsheng.

33
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,490
- Look at this place.
- Changsheng.

34
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,380
There is a problem with it.

35
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,420
(Library)

36
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,290
Changsheng.

37
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,800
Changsheng.

38
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,260
Your Highness.

39
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,290
Aunt.

40
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,770
How come you have time

41
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,980
to come here today?

42
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,780
Every year I come here
to check the collection of books

43
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,430
and see if there's anything I can help with.

44
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,010
I'll report to His Majesty

45
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,900
our progress tomorrow.

46
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,280
Prince Qin doesn't have to bother

47
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,440
to come here specially.

48
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,550
I'm afraid you have another intention.

49
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,260
I'm here on official business.

50
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,940
How is the damage to the books
in this year's collection?

51
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,670
This is a very troublesome matter.

52
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,970
If you want to know

53
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,670
the damage to the books,

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,970
first

55
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,360
we need to check the lists

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,430
and inventory.

57
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,730
Second,

58
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,610
we need to look through
the bookshelves carefully

59
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,020
and seal the books one by one.

60
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,990
Since you're here on official duties,

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,700
then today,

62
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,290
accompany me

63
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,580
to sort these out.

64
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,940
We need to finish all this today?

65
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,010
Certainly.

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,820
This is the daily work of Xiuwen Hall.

67
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Since you're here to perform official duties,

68
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,190
just get familiar with it.

69
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,290
But I have other official duties.

70
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,570
Today is really inconvenient.

71
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,650
Xiuwen Hall is very important.

72
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,050
Letting you know it in advance

73
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,460
can help you manage it in the future.

74
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,670
Don't you have this little time?

75
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,550
Of course I do.

76
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,090
But can I do it another day? Today is...

77
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,070
Why not today?

78
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,040
Never mind.

79
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,400
Go ahead.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,070
Your business

81
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,100
is in the compiling room in the back.

82
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,370
Aunt,

83
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,330
thank you.

84
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,080
Changsheng...

85
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,630
(What is he writing here?)

86
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,700
(Unencumbered by worldly thoughts,
with rituals as clear as a pure river)

87
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,140
(What did Lv Jing prepare for me?)

88
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,460
(Chenopodium album, plant,
its leaves are edible)

89
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,260
(It's a dictionary that explains rare words.)

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,580
He has some conscience.

91
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,700
I don't know if he's left.

92
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,630
Now that today's work has finished,

93
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,260
why are you still standing here?

94
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,600
Is it that

95
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,530
you like Xiuwen Hall now?

96
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,370
What do you know?

97
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,190
I am absorbing the natural spiritual energy.

98
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,600
Not like you,

99
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,600
slow-witted.

100
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,930
Why have you

101
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,020
always looked distracted?

102
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,500
Did something happen?

103
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
No.

104
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,430
It's so busy here,
how can I think of anything else?

105
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,450
All right.

106
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,700
You don't have to tell me.

107
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,270
I'm in a good mood today.

108
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,820
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

109
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,070
You go, I won't go.

110
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,860
I'm going to eat roasted pigeon.

111
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,040
You're not coming?

112
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,130
I'm leaving.

113
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,730
Wait.

114
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,790
For the sake of roasted pigeon,

115
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,070
I'll go with you.

116
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,390
Then I'll go get changed.

117
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,490
Okay.

118
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,680
(Library)

119
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,150
I'm exhausted every day.

120
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,770
How long do you think
it will take us to compile them?

121
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,610
Tomorrow

122
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,030
I'll copy some for you.

123
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,800
But let me be clear.

124
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,940
Today I'll order whatever I want.

125
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,000
It's on you.

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,960
No problem.

127
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,800
Changsheng.

128
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,800
Changsheng.

129
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,040
What a coincidence.

130
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,190
You haven't left yet?

131
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,200
I was just about to go out to dinner with him.

132
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,520
Just to thank him for helping me out

133
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,360
a few days ago.

134
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,210
Come over.

135
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,000
Since you invited me to dinner,

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,840
why go to him?

137
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,130
What a coincidence.

138
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,190
Today I also asked my wife out

139
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,390
to celebrate how well her work is going.

140
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,270
I suddenly feel full.

141
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,640
Maybe we can

142
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,330
skip this meal. Let's take a rain check.

143
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,170
- No.
- No.

144
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,550
What to do then?

145
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,320
Since you promised me first,

146
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,910
you can't go back on your word.

147
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,640
Who do you choose

148
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,920
between the two of us?

149
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,790
I have the final say on this meal.

150
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,270
Changsheng invited me to dinner today.

151
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,010
Of course I have the final say.

152
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,840
(Menu)
Or you can change to another table.

153
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,050
I will take care of Changsheng.

154
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,010
I will pay

155
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,850
for your meal.

156
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,550
I have known Changsheng for eighteen years.

157
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,460
Changsheng will not let me leave.

158
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,770
But you deliberately ruined our dinner.

159
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,620
What do you want?

160
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,010
You've known her for eighteen years

161
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,100
and are still her friend.

162
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,560
I thank you

163
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,480
for not marrying her

164
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,460
on behalf of my wife.

165
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,040
You...

166
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,910
Stop talking.

167
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,220
I have the final say on this meal.

168
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,270
Spicy chicken.

169
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,050
Sweet and sour pork.

170
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,150
The dishes are ready. Please enjoy.

171
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,370
Mr. Xiao.

172
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,270
You're Changsheng's friend,

173
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,860
I should toast you.

174
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,490
Thanks.

175
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,370
This is harmonious now.

176
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,210
I like it.

177
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,030
Try this.

178
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,030
Great Tang's longsnout catfish is very tender.

179
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,890
Changsheng doesn't like trouble,

180
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,220
and likes to eat processed seafood.

181
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,960
Longsnout catfish is bony.

182
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,860
Changsheng doesn't like it.

183
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,030
The spicy chicken is also good.

184
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,130
Try it.

185
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,580
Changsheng's body has much heat,

186
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,100
she can't eat spicy food.

187
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,220
It doesn't help with her heatiness.

188
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,890
Come on.

189
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:49,940
Eat some cucumbers.

190
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,680
Stop it.

191
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,100
Eating meat can't stop you from talking.

192
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,610
I also want it.

193
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,430
I'm afraid the old hand injury has recurred.

194
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,670
It hurts.

195
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,340
I'll feed you.

196
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,520
Okay.

197
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,100
Xiao Zilv.

198
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,530
What are you doing?

199
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,980
I picked this meat first.

200
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,340
My wife gave me it.

201
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,340
Of course I should eat it.

202
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,340
It's so noisy.

203
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,860
It's really a waste to eat with you.

204
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,190
I'll go out for a while.

205
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,490
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

206
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,850
- I'll go with you.
- I'll go with you.

207
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,980
To the bathroom.

208
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,860
That is Princess Changsheng from Fuyu.

209
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Is her name Li Changsheng or Liu Changsheng?

210
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,550
Liu Changsheng.

211
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:01,970
Yeah.

212
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,070
It is said that this princess

213
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,620
is hard to get married.

214
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,620
Anyone who admires her

215
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,270
doesn't end well.

216
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,550
She has a very bad reputation,

217
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,680
a very evil character,

218
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,050
a very bad temper,

219
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,220
a very shallow mind

220
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,250
and a very beautiful face.

221
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,940
Princess "Five Very".

222
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,580
Princess "Five Very"?

223
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,510
- He's quite good at making up stories.
- Is that true?

224
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,090
But Prince Qin

225
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,480
is also a tough guy.

226
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,840
He's not afraid of her.

227
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,680
Prince Qin

228
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,170
has great martial arts skills

229
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,310
but is simple-minded.

230
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,620
There are many

231
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,550
young and beautiful women in Great Tang

232
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,820
seeking a marriage with Prince Qin.

233
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,070
But Prince Qin ignored them all.

234
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,240
He was fascinated by

235
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,340
the Princess of Fuyu.

236
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,970
Let me tell you,

237
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,410
she looks young,

238
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,100
but she's already in her twenties.

239
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,370
You don't say.

240
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,480
This princess of Fuyu

241
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,440
is kind like

242
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,910
our Princess Royal.

243
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,210
Princess Royal

244
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,510
is also over twenty.

245
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,790
Speaking of which,

246
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,310
Princess Royal is talented and virtuous,

247
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,670
has good looks and a high status.

248
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,190
She's just not wise

249
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,680
in her marriage.

250
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,010
She compiles books
at Xiuwen Hall every day,

251
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,600
looking so cold and boring.

252
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,080
Which man would want her?

253
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,050
Right.

254
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,050
She's read too many books

255
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,370
to know how to serve and care for her husband.

256
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,430
Maybe Princess Royal hasn't...

257
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,670
How dare you discuss Princess Royal?

258
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,210
A bunch of commoners.

259
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,130
Judging by the voice,

260
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,210
it is Princess Changsheng.

261
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,360
You can't even compare

262
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,260
to a hair of Princess Royal's.

263
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,790
You said Princess Royal was unwise in marrying.

264
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,390
Should she marry you,

265
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,650
a bunch of losers

266
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,270
who only talk about others after drinking?

267
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,460
Is that wise?

268
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,520
And you.

269
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,210
Princess Royal concentrates on compiling books

270
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,150
and preserving classics

271
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,890
to benefit more people

272
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,930
and let the culture of Great Tang

273
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,440
passed on to the world.

274
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,280
Unlike you,

275
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,550
who only hangs out in the tavern all day.

276
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,650
How many men

277
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,030
can compare to her?

278
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,030
Who are you?

279
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,440
What does it matter to you

280
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,550
who we're commenting on here?

281
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,600
The little girl is so hot-tempered.

282
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,680
I am afraid that in the future,

283
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,320
she can't find a husband

284
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,200
just like Princess Royal.

285
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,100
Exactly.

286
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,840
Who will like her?

287
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,150
Who just said that
Princess Royal is cold and boring?

288
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,210
Princess Royal is outstanding,

289
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,100
and talented,

290
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,220
both lofty and sublime.

291
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,640
Besides,

292
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,430
Princess Royal cares for the people.

293
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,800
You bunch of vulgar people

294
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,270
don't have right to comment on her.

295
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,530
- That's right.
- Princess Royal will find a good match.

296
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,670
You don't get to judge her.

297
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,340
There are still some people who like her.

298
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,390
Have you seen Princess Royal?

299
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,920
Have you?

300
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,130
Of course we've seen her.

301
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,720
Go ask the Assistant Minister of Xiuwen Hall.

302
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,080
Who hasn't seen us?

303
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,600
Xiuwen Hall?

304
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,810
Is that a place

305
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,770
you filthy people can go?

306
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,030
Sir, it's Prince Qin.

307
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,070
Go, go, go, what Pince Qin?

308
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,600
Today, I will

309
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,530
teach these ignorant people

310
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,440
a lesson.

311
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,700
You and you.

312
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,860
Prince Qin.

313
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,440
They

314
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,440
were so arrogant just now.

315
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,940
Greetings, Prince Qin.

316
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,620
- Greetings, Prince Qin.
- Tell me

317
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,670
whose side should I take.

318
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,210
Prince Qin.

319
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,190
I mean

320
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,840
I care about Princess Royal

321
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,910
and Princess Changsheng.

322
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,010
Yeah.

323
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,930
We're just afraid

324
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,170
they're too busy

325
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,530
and have no time to settle down.

326
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,370
Your Highness.

327
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,480
How do you want to deal with them?

328
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,430
Your Highness, spare me.

329
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,560
Never mind.

330
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,280
Let them go.

331
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,270
Thank Her Highness.

332
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

333
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,200
- Thank you, Prince Qin.
- Get lost.

334
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,890
Go, go, go.

335
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,670
Prince Qin is impressive.

336
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,560
Xiao Zilv.

337
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,270
What you just said

338
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,370
can't be serious.

339
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,210
That's for sure.

340
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,070
I was helping you out.

341
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,530
I'm already grateful

342
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,070
that you didn't kick me when I was down.

343
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,580
Why are you so kind to help me out today?

344
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,190
You're not faking it, are you?

345
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,390
- Don't.
- Don't touch him.

346
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,420
He is Xiao Zilv.

347
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,170
We have delayed long enough.

348
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,130
Let's go back.

349
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,420
Trying to change the subject.

350
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,900
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

351
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,990
Mr. Xiao, please stay.

352
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,510
Princess Royal.

353
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,990
You've been here?

354
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,210
Princess Royal.

355
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,040
This is not the imperial palace.

356
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,550
Let's skip these etiquettes.

357
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,210
Yes.

358
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,730
Aunt.

359
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,580
Mr. Xiao has difficulty walking.

360
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,550
If you came by a carriage,

361
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,070
please give him a ride.

362
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,100
(Yihe Tower)

363
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,200
Princess Royal, we are leaving first.

364
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,040
See you.

365
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,000
Are they trapped?

366
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,990
Why don't they move?

367
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,030
I'm afraid my aunt
has taken a fancy to Xiao Zilv.

368
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,030
How can it be?

369
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,720
How could a woman like Princess Royal

370
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,170
fall for Xiao Zilv?

371
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,420
He's just a talking idiot.

372
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,570
Why do you think

373
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,550
she kept Xiao Zilv here?

374
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,750
Because

375
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,750
Xiao Zilv just overstepped,

376
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,380
so she wants to teach him a lesson.

377
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,750
How could my aunt be such a petty person?

378
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,340
What else could it be?

379
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,770
You can't hide

380
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,310
your feelings for someone

381
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,230
like you can't hide a cough.

382
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,140
You are just too careless.

383
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,100
I appreciate your kindness.

384
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,520
It's still early.

385
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,620
The inn is quite close to here.

386
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,750
I can return on my own.

387
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,710
Did I say I'd give you a ride?

388
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,820
I was overthinking it.

389
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,340
Then goodbye.

390
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,270
Princess Royal, is there anything else?

391
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,470
I want to ask you

392
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,900
just now you said

393
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,480
I was lofty

394
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,380
and sublime.

395
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,070
Is that what you think of me?

396
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,120
Yes.

397
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,310
The words are well-chosen.

398
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,900
Then you said

399
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,380
I care for the people.

400
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,750
That's also what you think of me?

401
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,930
I was describing what I saw
and heard at Xiuwen Hall

402
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,820
to clear your name.

403
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,420
You said you would marry me.

404
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,270
It just rolled off the tongue.

405
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,790
I meant no offense.

406
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,820
Rolled off the tongue?

407
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,520
I was being reckless.

408
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,580
In a moment of urgency,

409
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,200
my words

410
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,180
caused you to misunderstand.

411
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,560
It's my fault.

412
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,250
Misunderstand?

413
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,930
It's fine.

414
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,620
Of course,

415
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,180
how could you possibly like me?

416
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,470
What if I like you?

417
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,550
You must be joking.

418
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
So in your heart,

419
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,950
I'm just a joke?

420
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,340
Princess Royal will find a good match.

421
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,790
You don't get to judge her.

422
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,820
In a moment of urgency,

423
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,480
my words

424
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,470
caused you to misunderstand.

425
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,580
(Gentleman)

426
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,520
Princess Royal.

427
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,420
(Bitterness and Sweetness)
Xiao Zilv really went too far.

428
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,210
I just looked all over

429
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,050
and couldn't find him.

430
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,720
A few days ago, he was saying

431
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,650
how important

432
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,510
the work in Xiuwen Hall is,

433
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,030
but today he skipped work for no reason.

434
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,950
Should he be severely punished?

435
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,420
If you want to punish him,

436
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,100
I'll go to the inn now

437
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,510
and get him here for you.

438
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,250
Then I'm going.

439
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,990
He needs to be punished.

440
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,030
Going out for private gain

441
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,270
also needs to be punished.

442
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,930
Well,

443
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,410
I suddenly feel

444
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,660
Xiao Zilv is not that kind of person.

445
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,620
What do you think?

446
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,100
Shouldn't you know him better than I do?

447
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,990
Is it that

448
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,180
he offended you yesterday?

449
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,820
Or

450
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,340
something happened between you

451
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,420
yesterday in the carriage?

452
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,310
I am the Princess Royal of Great Tang.

453
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,180
He is the envoy of Fuyu.

454
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,760
What do you think

455
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,860
will happen between us?

456
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,340
Of course, it is national affairs.

457
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,370
I knew it.

458
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,550
How could she like him?

459
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,420
I confessed my feelings to him.

460
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,680
It's just a confession.

461
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,520
It's very...

462
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,750
What?

463
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,340
Confessed your feelings?

464
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,380
I like him.

465
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,900
Princess Royal.

466
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,710
You are good.

467
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,030
And then, what was Xiao Zilv's reaction?

468
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,180
Then he thought I was joking.

469
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,180
How could you be the kind of person who jokes?

470
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,180
Anyway, he turned me down.

471
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,580
Don't be discouraged.

472
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,420
I think

473
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,440
he might have been frightened

474
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,380
and didn't know how to react.

475
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,140
It doesn't necessarily mean
he doesn't like you.

476
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,620
Whether he was frightened

477
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,990
or amused,

478
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,510
anyway, he doesn't like me.

479
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,180
Not necessarily.

480
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,040
Think about it.

481
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,280
You guys usually argue with each other

482
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,180
and look incompatible.

483
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,650
But at the critical moment,

484
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,860
he spoke up for you.

485
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,900
Would you speak up for someone you don't like?

486
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,680
With his character,

487
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,520
not only he won't,

488
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,950
he will also rub it in your face.

489
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,340
So you mean...

490
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,100
I mean

491
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,650
don't be discouraged.

492
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,230
Don't worry, I will definitely help you.

493
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,620
Sorry.

494
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,420
I overstepped the boundaries.

495
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,360
No.

496
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,100
Then please help

497
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,580
set us up.

498
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,420
When love is strong,

499
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,950
and the two people

500
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,760
become inseparable

501
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,820
like glue,

502
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,180
there's no need to say more.

503
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,260
(Tanghui Inn)

504
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,100
Thanks for your kindness.

505
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,380
I, Xiao Zilv...

506
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,080
No, no.

507
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,520
Envoy...

508
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,660
Mr. Xiao, someone came to see you.

509
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,880
- Let him in.
- Yes.

510
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,450
Mr. Xiao.

511
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,860
Who are you?

512
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,660
I am the messenger sent by Princess Royal.

513
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,040
I came to inform you

514
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,710
Princess Royal invites you to an appointment

515
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,000
and specially prepared

516
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,340
your favorite roasted pigeon.

517
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,510
Now she's waiting in the tavern.

518
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,320
Mr. Xiao.

519
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,200
Go back and report to Princess Royal

520
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,460
that I will definitely meet her on time.

521
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,160
Okay.

522
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,010
I'm leaving now.

523
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,260
(I was trying to protect
the Princess of Fuyu, I didn't mean...)

524
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,480
What time is this?

525
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,900
Why hasn't Xiao Zilv come yet?

526
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,000
I finally created an opportunity

527
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,090
for them.

528
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,170
Can't waste it.

529
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,890
Your Highness, you are so anxious.

530
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,180
People might think you are meeting your lover.

531
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,000
Your Highness,

532
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,100
you're not waiting for them,

533
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,030
but are anxiously waiting to watch the show.

534
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,200
Unfortunately, the audience arrived too early.

535
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,540
The main characters haven't appeared yet.

536
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,510
Don't point it out.

537
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,820
I'm matchmaking them personally.

538
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,080
If it doesn't work,

539
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,180
I will lose my face.

540
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,270
Oh no, why is Lv Jing here?

541
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,270
If he meets Xiao Zilv,

542
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,510
the plan I worked so hard on
will definitely be ruined.

543
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,140
No, we must not let them meet.

544
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,570
Xiao Zilv had to come

545
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,580
at this time.

546
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,990
Go and hold back Youyong and Youmou.

547
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,660
- Leave Lv Jing to me.
- Okay.

548
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,100
Please come in.

549
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,770
Changsheng.

550
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,380
When you see a man in purple,

551
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,040
lead him to that room.

552
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,880
I'll pay you.

553
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,840
Go.

554
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,450
Okay.

555
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,410
Let's go.

556
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,080
Sit, sit, sit.

557
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,510
What are you doing here?

558
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,820
This question is strange.

559
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,030
Of course I came to drink.

560
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,510
What else can I do here?

561
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,770
Nothing.

562
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,890
Then you eat here.

563
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,730
I'll accompany you.

564
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,720
You don't need

565
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,610
to compile books today?

566
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,420
Who said I'm free?

567
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,030
I'm here on official business.

568
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,170
Official business.

569
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,340
In a tavern?

570
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,790
Is there anything I can do for you?

571
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,880
I'll help you.

572
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,270
I have arranged it.

573
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,790
Just don't make trouble.

574
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,080
Okay.

575
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,860
Sir, please come in.

576
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,380
Please be careful with the stairs.

577
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,950
- This way.
- Oh no.

578
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,180
Why the waiter is leading him to here?

579
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,690
Oh God.

580
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,520
Go, go, go, go.

581
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,140
- You are...
- Go in, go in.

582
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,560
Please.

583
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,080
Be careful.

Mr. Xiao.

601
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,890
Princess Royal is waiting for you
in Room No. 1.

602
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,230
This is Room No. 2.

603
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,070
I got in the wrong room.

604
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,690
Let's go.

605
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,140
What are you doing?

606
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,170
Did I do something wrong?

607
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,240
Of course.

608
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,420
Could it be that I am wrong?

609
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,900
How could your arrangement be wrong?

610
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,470
Especially the three steps just now.

611
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,200
But you know Xiao Zilv quite well.

612
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,660
I don't know how are you going to treat me?

613
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,710
I've known him for many years.

614
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,480
Isn't that normal

615
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,470
that I know him a little?

616
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,650
But it's mainly to help Princess Royal.

617
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,340
I've never treated him like that.

618
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,410
Don't get me wrong.

619
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,990
But what's learned from books is superficial.

620
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,510
Next time you give advice to others,

621
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,140
can you demonstrate it yourself?

622
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,210
You...

623
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,170
Your Highness.

624
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,040
If you are here,

625
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,750
then His Highness is also here.

626
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,240
In the cabinet.

627
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,030
He's coming out.

628
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,580
Your Highness.

629
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,420
You look accomplished now.

630
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,380
It's good that you've done it.

631
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,520
Your Highness, will you come out yourself

632
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,760
or we should help you?

633
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,620
What are you saying?

634
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,230
How can you let His Highness do it himself?

635
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,140
Your Highness, watch your head.

636
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,600
Princess Royal.

637
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,900
I'm late.

638
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:57,970
No.

639
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,310
You came just in time.

640
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,890
They just served

641
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,340
the freshly roasted pigeon.

642
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,840
No need.

643
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,380
You have something to say to me?

644
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,380
I tossed and turned

645
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,710
and thought about it for a long time.

646
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,200
I think some things are needed

647
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,510
to explain to you in person.

648
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,880
Go ahead.

649
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,620
After saying goodbye to you,

650
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,100
I thought about it for a long time.

651
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,860
About what you said that day,

652
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,990
I'm afraid

653
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,250
I can't take it.

654
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,970
First,

655
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,370
I'm making this trip

656
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,840
as the guard of Princess Changsheng

657
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,730
to ensure the smooth conduct
of the peace-making marriage.

658
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,420
Meantime,

659
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,860
I'm here to learn the medical skills

660
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,930
and etiquettes of Great Tang.

661
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,040
Second,

662
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,820
I only have respect

663
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,770
for you,

664
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,790
but no love.

665
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:45,970
If I've ever

666
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,180
offended you

667
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,990
with my words and actions,

668
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,030
please forgive me.

669
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,330
Any more words?

670
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,180
Just tell me.

671
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,410
I

672
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,470
never considered staying in Great Tang.

673
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,690
Okay.

674
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,070
I see.

675
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,900
I respect your choice.

676
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,510
Thank you, Princess Royal.

677
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,950
A woman immersed in ancient books

678
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,070
is really generous.

679
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,090
You're sensible and understanding.

680
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,820
I'm sure you can
meet a better man in the future.

681
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,580
But I don't have the luck.

682
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,650
Tomorrow at 9 a.m.,

683
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,090
a batch of Buddhist scriptures is to be sent

684
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:26,800
from Xiuwen Hall

685
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,030
to a temple in the suburbs.

686
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,030
I'm afraid we're short of manpower.

687
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,990
I can help.

688
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,410
Thank you.

689
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,550
Then I'll take my leave.

690
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,580
The roasted pigeon here

691
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,340
tastes really good.

692
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,250
Princess Royal.

693
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,000
I just came

694
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,950
to tell you my thoughts

695
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,510
personally.

696
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,410
I won't bother you anymore.
