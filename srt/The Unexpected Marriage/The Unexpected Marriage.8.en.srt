00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,180
(Self-discipline and Social Commitment)

4
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,420
Changsheng is righteous.

5
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,220
This makes me feel ashamed.

6
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,020
These gifts

7
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,260
are just a little something

8
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,460
to express my gratitude.

9
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,100
Please accept them.

10
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,020
Noble Concubine Xian.

11
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,300
Your Royal Highness.

12
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,140
Noble Concubine Xian.

13
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,140
Your Highness, you came to our mansion,

14
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,860
but I got held up.

15
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,060
Sorry for the rudeness.

16
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,340
Rules are made

17
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,620
by human beings.

18
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,780
Come to think about it,

19
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,620
I was too old-fashioned before.

20
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,460
Thank you

21
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,540
for keeping Guangde by my side.

22
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,180
She is my life.

23
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,580
I really...

24
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,500
Your daughter is your life.

25
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,740
So Changsheng

26
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,220
isn't my life?

27
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,500
We've been assisting His Majesty for many years

28
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,660
and now we need to sacrifice our daughter.

29
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,060
You are too cruel.

30
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,740
Stop talking.

31
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,580
I won't.

32
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,780
You just yell at me at home.

33
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,220
If you have the guts, go tell your brother.

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,500
Now

35
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,780
I have to say this,
even if it means taking a risk.

36
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,420
If you encounter a strong enemy,

37
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,020
you sacrifice us women

38
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,620
to defend the country.

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,900
If Changsheng is gone,

40
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,580
I won't live anymore.

41
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,160
Don't worry.

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,660
The imperial decree has not yet been released.

43
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,000
Maybe there will be a more suitable candidate.

44
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,940
My poor daughter.

45
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,420
(Self-discipline and Social Commitment)

46
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,540
Don't blame me, Your Highness.

47
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,300
My mother was sad,

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,580
so she said those things.

49
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,740
No one else will know

50
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,300
what happened today.

51
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,540
You're magnanimous.

52
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

53
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,580
Good child.

54
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,340
I used to treat you harshly.

55
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,580
I didn't expect you to forgive all that.

56
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,350
I feel ashamed.

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,220
Your Highness.

58
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,100
Don't worry.

59
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,260
I will try my best

60
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,740
to negotiate the peace-making marriage.

61
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,100
I will never let you marry far away.

62
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,180
The envoy from Great Tang

63
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,940
will leave in one day.

64
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,300
Until the last moment,

65
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,180
there is always hope.

66
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,500
You should also pay attention.

67
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,780
Thank you.

68
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,380
I heard His Majesty asked

69
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,500
Guangde and Jin

70
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
to get married together.

71
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,710
Two happy events come at the same time.

72
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,140
Has the date been set?

73
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,580
It's already set.

74
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,100
I am afraid

75
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,900
I can't go to congratulate them.

76
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,540
Please send my blessings.

77
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,260
God is unfair.

78
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,340
How come

79
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,500
a person like you is...

80
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,140
Be careful, Your Highness.

81
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,180
It's fine.

82
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,700
Stop here.

83
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,980
Your kindness touched Noble Consort Xian.

84
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,580
General Zhao and Guangde are a perfect match.

85
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,540
I just helped them.

86
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,460
What's your plan

87
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,260
for the peace-making marriage?

88
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,220
I'm the only candidate

89
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,540
for the peace-making marriage.

90
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,420
If I don't go,

91
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,140
His Majesty will look bad.

92
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
If war breaks out,

93
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,740
I am the sinner.

94
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,660
If I go,

95
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,580
with a husband I've never seen

96
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,700
and the frightening rumors,

97
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,980
I will surely suffer.

98
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,020
That's true.

99
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,260
Prince Qin is so evil

100
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,300
and ugly.

101
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,100
It's hard not to worry.

102
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,980
But I'm still happy

103
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,180
to see you.

104
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,060
By the way,

105
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,260
you're good at painting.

106
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,620
Why don't you draw me

107
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,980
a portrait of Prince Qin?

108
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,940
Okay.

109
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,100
Then I'll go first.

110
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,300
Changsheng.

111
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,580
You still have a choice whether to go or stay.

112
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,180
Could it be that you hesitated?

113
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,620
Just stop crying.

114
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,140
It gives me a headache.

115
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,260
My daughter is going to leave.

116
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,500
What's wrong with me crying a little?

117
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,460
I know

118
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,420
you have disliked her since she was born.

119
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,620
But she is my daughter.

120
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,580
How come I never liked her

121
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,140
since she was born?

122
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,580
She's my baby girl, too.

123
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,500
You tell me.

124
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,820
Prince Changle's Mansion,

125
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,100
Muyan Forest.

126
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,900
She handled everything

127
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,740
perfectly well.

128
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,460
If anything happens to her
after marrying Prince Qin,

129
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,100
I won't live anymore.

130
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,820
If you're not going to live,

131
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,700
I won't live either.

132
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,460
You don't have to say this in front of me.

133
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,820
If you are determined to die,

134
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
go tell your brother now

135
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,380
that he can choose whoever he likes

136
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,060
for the peace-making marriage.

137
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,460
Even if Changsheng

138
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,220
never gets married her whole life,

139
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,740
it's good for her to stay with me.

140
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,660
Your Royal Highness.

141
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,820
Just have pity om me.

142
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,100
Okay, I'll go.

143
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,540
You get up.

144
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,660
Get up quickly, get up.

145
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,780
Stand up.

146
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,780
I'll go now.

147
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,820
(Waves by the Sea)

148
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,740
Are you telling me

149
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,540
I can't let Changsheng go?

150
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,100
Yes, Father.

151
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,540
Do you know the consequences?

152
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,140
- I...
- Your Majesty.

153
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,260
Even though our army only has 78,000 soldiers

154
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,180
against millions
of strong soldiers of Great Tang,

155
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,020
and after three days and three nights,

156
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,860
we die on the battlefield,

157
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,500
I have no regrets.

158
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,180
Your Majesty.

159
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,180
Just one word from you,

160
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,340
and I am willing

161
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,540
to lead my men in a charge

162
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,020
and sacrifice my life.

163
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,420
- You...
- Zhao.

164
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,900
You can go without worries.

165
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,060
If you died in battle,

166
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,420
I'll follow you

167
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,580
and never let you go to death's door alone.

168
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,540
Let's meet again in the nether world.

169
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,820
I'm so pissed off.

170
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,180
I'm furious.

171
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,980
Yesterday Yang Wulang

172
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,860
came here with Shen Bin.

173
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,940
Today you came too.

174
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,020
Have you discussed it to come in turns?

175
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,180
Who else is there?

176
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,460
Come together.

177
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,900
Noble Consort Xian is here.

178
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,820
Your Majesty.

179
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,580
You're not here to persuade me, are you?

180
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,020
Certainly

181
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,020
not.

182
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,780
I'm here to bring soup to you.

183
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,620
Look at this.

184
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,140
How sensible

185
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,340
Noble Consort Xian is.

186
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,660
Learn from her

187
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,140
and don't always make trouble for me.

188
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,380
Thank you for your praise.

189
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,820
If you're reluctant to let Changsheng go,

190
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,180
she doesn't have to get married.

191
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,300
Why you're mentioning this too?

192
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,420
It's what everyone wants.

193
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,980
Prince Changle is here.

194
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

195
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,380
You don't have to say it.

196
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,460
They've all come to persuade me.

197
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,140
So this is really what everyone wants.

198
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,740
Fine.

199
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,300
I've decided

200
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,700
to make an expedition personally.

201
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,300
Even if we have to start a war,

202
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,420
even though our army only has 78,000 soldiers,

203
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,860
we'll fight them
for three days and three nights

204
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,940
and die on the battlefield

205
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,340
with pride.

206
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,860
Are you satisfied with this?

207
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,260
I have decided

208
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,820
to send Changsheng to Great Tang.

209
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,540
What did you say?

210
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,580
Now the peace-making marriage
between Fuyu and Great Tang

211
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,540
is for the benefit and safety

212
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,540
of all people.

213
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,420
Changsheng was born in the royal family.

214
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,580
She's been favored by many people.

215
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,540
Now is a time for Fuyu.

216
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,220
How could she back down

217
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,340
and implicate Fuyu?

218
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,180
You...

219
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,060
Do you mean it?

220
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,340
I have decided.

221
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,420
I hope Your Majesty will agree.

222
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,420
(Imperial Study)

223
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,220
Changsheng.

224
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,740
Dad.

225
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
Changsheng.

226
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,980
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,020
Is the portrait finished?

228
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,620
Yes.

229
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,460
You're fooling me again.

230
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,620
I didn't.

231
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,220
Although the painting is a bit rough,

232
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,980
and not as good-looking as himself, it's...

233
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,700
It's too insincere.

234
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,100
I asked you to draw Prince Qin's portrait,

235
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,340
you drew a self-portrait

236
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,460
and made yourself look so handsome.

237
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,820
That's too much.

238
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,540
I look better in person.

239
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,420
Come here.

240
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,900
Changsheng.

241
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,140
Changsheng.

242
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,500
- Changsheng.
- Dad.

243
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,420
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,540
What's wrong with you?

245
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,420
Your Royal Highness.

246
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,580
Have you done

247
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,900
what I told you?

248
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,700
Tell me

249
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,020
these are the tears of success,

250
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,540
of joy,

251
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,180
and of fulfillment.

252
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,420
These are the tears to shut you up.

253
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,460
How useless.

254
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,700
Mother.

255
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,260
What happened to Dad?

256
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,580
Don't mind him.

257
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,420
The priority

258
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,340
is to keep you here.

259
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,380
I have a solution.

260
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,820
Follow me.

261
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,220
What?

262
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,340
Let Yi'an marry into our family?

263
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,180
Mother,

264
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,940
are you kidding?

265
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,220
I've never been so serious.

266
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Mother.

267
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,140
You are confused.

268
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,580
This is the first time I'm so sure

269
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,500
and came up with this ingenious idea.

270
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,260
He is the envoy of Great Tang

271
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,820
and Prince Qin's confidant.

272
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,620
Marrying into our family.

273
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,180
This is a bad idea.

274
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,020
You are a princess of Fuyu

275
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,460
and the glory of our mansion.

276
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,980
Why can't he marry you?

277
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,980
Moreover,

278
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,580
I could tell

279
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,540
you have feelings for him.

280
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,460
I'm just at my wit's end.

281
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,020
This is the only solution.

282
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,980
Young Master, everything has been arranged.

283
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,660
Do you have any other instructions?

284
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,020
Young Master, our trip to Fuyu

285
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,310
has been fruitful.

286
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,700
I believe when the war starts,

287
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,180
we will be invincible.

288
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,180
If I don't go,

289
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,940
His Majesty will look bad.

290
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,740
If war breaks out,

291
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,380
I am the sinner.

292
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,380
If I go,

293
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,020
with a husband I've never seen

294
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,100
and the frightening rumors,

295
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,180
I will surely suffer.

296
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,900
Who is it?

297
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,100
It's me, Mr. Envoy.

298
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Come in.

299
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,260
Mr. Envoy.

300
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,820
What are you doing?

301
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,260
I'm packing my luggage.

302
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,780
In my opinion,

303
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,850
it'll be a long journey.

304
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,380
Why don't you stay?

305
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,860
Stay?

306
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,700
Yes.

307
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,100
Fuyu is a small country,

308
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,380
but we have abundant resources.

309
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,540
Mr. Envoy.

310
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,940
Would you like to stay?

311
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,180
Stay...

312
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,180
Yes, as long as

313
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,020
you treat Changsheng well.

314
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,460
What do you think of Changsheng?

315
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,480
Princess Changsheng

316
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,840
is endowed with civil and martial virtues

317
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,180
and she's beautiful.

318
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,100
She is really...

319
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,660
She's really overrated.

320
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,940
Just keep these things to yourself.

321
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,420
Don't tell outsiders.

322
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,380
What do you want to say?

323
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,700
Just tell me.

324
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,220
Come here.

325
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,500
Marry into your family?

326
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,260
You're so excited.

327
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,220
I was right about you.

328
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,580
Wait here.

329
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,020
I'll get Changsheng for you.

330
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,780
You two can have a good chat.

331
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,140
Have a good chat.

332
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,580
Wait here.

333
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,860
He agreed?

334
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,900
Yes.

335
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,220
You don't know how happy he is.

336
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,100
He was so excited that he shouted.

337
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,580
When I was leaving,

338
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,260
he was still being shy.

339
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,220
Mother.

340
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,140
You're not exaggerating, are you?

341
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,340
Am I that kind of person?

342
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,940
There's a reason for his reaction.

343
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,100
What you need to do now

344
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,340
is to let him know a whole new you.

345
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,140
Whole new me?

346
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,540
Yi'an.

347
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,820
Why are you laughing?

348
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,140
This is...

349
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,740
Am I ugly?

350
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,300
- You are...
- I am leaving.

351
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,140
I'm fine.

352
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
I can do it.

353
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,620
Your Highness.

354
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,380
That's really good.

355
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,460
Come and sit.

356
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,540
My mother said

357
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,500
she told you

358
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,820
to marry into our family.

359
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,540
Yes.

360
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,740
What do you think?

361
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,100
Don't be silly.

362
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,180
I can marry someone else

363
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,860
to avoid the peace-making marriage.

364
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,740
You are the envoy of Great Tang,

365
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,020
and Prince Qin's confidant.

366
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,660
If you did this,

367
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,540
Prince Qin wouldn't let you go.

368
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,700
The situation will only get worse.

369
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,740
You're thinking for me again.

370
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,580
I don't want to

371
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,020
implicate other people.

372
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,820
Your Highness.

373
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,540
Maybe during these days

374
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,460
we spent together,

375
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,260
you think I'm a good person

376
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,660
and have some feelings for me.

377
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,940
So what if I do?

378
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,100
Please restrain yourself.

379
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,660
I've made the decision

380
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,380
to go to the peace-making marriage.

381
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,700
There's no turning back.

382
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,900
This may not be right.

383
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,580
But I still want to ask you,

384
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,940
if you have a chance to turn back,

385
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,620
what would you choose?

386
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,780
Is there an if in life?

387
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,700
What if there is?

388
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,460
Do you have to wait for my answer?

389
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,300
Yes.

390
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,860
You know what you're doing now

391
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,940
is out of line?

392
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,780
I know.

393
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,660
Unless you feel embarrassed

394
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,020
and don't know how to answer.

395
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,060
Otherwise, I need an answer.

396
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,140
Okay.

397
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
Let me answer you.

398
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,380
I still think

399
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,460
there is no if in life.

400
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,500
But I believe

401
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,340
there is an afterlife.

402
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,700
We can make up for the regrets
in the next life.

403
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,500
That's all

404
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,060
I have to say.

405
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,940
Do you understand what I mean?

406
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,900
That's enough.

407
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
Your Highness is really unconventional.

408
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,540
I can hear you.

409
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,660
What do you mean unconventional?

410
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,620
I've past the point of no return.

411
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,140
Young Master, you're in a good mood today.

412
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,460
You actually went out shopping.

413
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,220
Is there something happy about it?

414
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,300
No.

415
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,620
I want to buy a mirror

416
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,660
as a gift for Her Highness

417
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,180
before I leave.

418
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,020
Mirror?

419
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,340
Her Highness entertained us for so long.

420
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,220
On the occasion of parting,

421
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,820
it's nice to pick a gift for her.

422
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,020
Young Master, what do you want?

423
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,020
A mirror, doesn't need to be too big.

424
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,140
What material do you want?

425
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,220
What is the difference?

426
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,380
A gold mirror represents wealth.

427
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,220
A jade mirror is the best to express love.

428
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,340
I don't know what you want.

429
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,660
I want you to shut up.

430
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,140
Okay.

431
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,340
Naughty girl.

432
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,540
You dared to run away.

433
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,700
You're getting married to Mr. Zhou tonight.

434
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,220
You have to marry whether you want to or not.

435
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,060
Dad.

436
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,900
I have someone I like.

437
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,500
I know the salt shop is in trouble

438
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,260
and needs to be supported by the Zhou Family,

439
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,660
but I would rather die than marry him.

440
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,020
Come back with me first.

441
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,940
Let's go back and talk.

442
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,860
I don't want to.

443
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,700
Let's go.

444
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,740
This young lady has a strong personality.

445
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,340
Not inferior to Her Highness.

446
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,220
If she can't marry the person she likes,

447
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,460
she would rather die.

448
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,260
Let it go.

449
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,820
This bird is very aggressive.

450
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,500
If it loses freedom,

451
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,700
it can't make it through the night

452
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,980
being locked in the cage.

453
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,340
(Liyun Pavilion)

454
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,820
(Peace-making Marriage)
(Zhao Huaibi)

455
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,980
Are you still awake?

456
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,820
What?

457
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,860
Not feeling happy?

458
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,620
Is Prince Qin really bloodthirsty?

459
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,140
Prince Qin

460
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,420
is quite ruthless.

461
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,940
Is he really ugly?

462
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,620
He is intolerable to the eye.

463
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,260
Is Prince Qin marriageable?

464
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,620
He may abuse his wife

465
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,900
and abandon her in the end.

466
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,860
I'm serious.

467
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,180
I believe you.

468
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,780
You won't hurt me.

469
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,420
Do you think

470
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,780
Prince Qin will like me?

471
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,620
Yes.

472
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,380
You didn't tell me the truth.

473
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,500
You are not Prince Qin.

474
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,020
How do you know he will like me?

475
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,940
You are not me.

476
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,860
How do you know that
I don't know he will like you?

477
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,460
That's true.

478
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,100
After all, I am the one chosen by you.

479
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,220
I remember

480
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,340
all your strengths.

481
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,820
It's too numerous to be listed.

482
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,140
This is not the way to use this phrase.

483
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,460
Maybe two or three close friends

484
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,780
are enough in life.

485
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,500
We can talk cheerfully

486
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,140
and enjoy the time.

487
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,820
I hope life

488
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,380
can always be wonderful

489
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,700
like this.

490
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,340
(Virtue and Morality)

491
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,780
(I've made up my mind.)

492
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,500
(The peace-making marriage)

493
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,500
(is going to settle.)

494
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,820
(Wang Zhaojun)
(Zhaojun embarked on the journey.)

495
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,380
(Tears wetting her cheeks.)

496
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,180
(Today, she is still a member of the Han Palace.)

497
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,900
(Tomorrow, she will be the concubine
of a barbarian.)

498
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,460
(Zhaojun embarked on the journey)

499
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,660
(Zhao Huaibi)

500
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,940
(Peace-making Marriage)

501
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,260
Young Lady.

502
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,780
Leave me.

503
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,460
Jin.

504
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,060
What are you thinking about?

505
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,540
Zilv.

506
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,140
Why do you look even more unhappy than me?

507
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,620
Changsheng is the girl you like

508
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,210
and also my friend.

509
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,260
Now she is going to marry far away.

510
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,150
Guangde went to His Majesty to plead for mercy.

511
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,200
But I can't do anything.

512
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,340
This princess

513
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,380
is so stubborn.

514
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,350
She could just marry me.

515
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,660
How can a woman

516
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,380
propose marriage first?

517
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,740
If you really like her,

518
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,970
why don't you take the initiative?

519
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,460
I've always been proactive, okay?

520
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,300
I asked her to marry me,

521
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,040
but she refused.

522
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,830
She wanted to marry someone else,
and I tried to stop her.

523
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,060
Now I can only hope that
the prodigal will regret it.

524
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,460
Prodigal?

525
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,540
The prodigal girl.

526
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,060
It's the same.

527
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,620
I took many proactive actions

528
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,660
just wanting her to know

529
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,860
that as long as she wants,

530
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,940
I would like to marry her.

531
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,260
Who would have thought she was so stubborn?

532
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,630
She would rather marry to Great Tang.

533
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,760
Have you told her your thoughts?

534
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:10,820
Of course I've told her.

535
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,860
Seriously,

536
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,100
without making jokes.

537
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,420
Forget that you are friends.

538
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,140
You have to look at her as a woman you like.

539
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,020
Zilv, go ask Changsheng to marry you.

540
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,100
I... I...

541
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,820
If Changsheng really leaves,

542
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,660
you...

543
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,980
You'll have to use alcohol

544
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,380
to drown your sorrows.

545
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,020
I've thought about it.

546
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,140
I shouldn't have listened to those rumors.

547
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,460
If you two like each other,

548
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,660
I should support you.

549
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,580
This is what you really want?

550
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,420
Yes.

551
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,660
But

552
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,620
is it too late now?

553
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,980
As long as she hasn't left,

554
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,780
I still have a chance.

555
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,140
Good luck.

556
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,420
Marry me?

557
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,220
Yes. What do you think?

558
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,540
Tell me,

559
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,060
is this

560
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,340
some kind of trick again?

561
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,820
No, I came here to propose marriage sincerely.

562
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,820
As long as you agree,

563
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,360
I will go to the palace to discuss this

564
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,330
with His Majesty immediately.

565
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,660
I see.

566
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,840
So your answer is?

567
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,780
Nice try.

568
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,700
Don't think I don't know

569
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,420
as long as I agree,

570
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,980
you'll start laughing at me right away.

571
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,550
Then wait for me to leave,

572
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,900
you'll smear me in Fuyu.

573
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,820
Xiao Zilv.

574
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,340
I've fought you for so many years.

575
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,700
I definitely can see through

576
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,940
your little trick.

577
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,100
I'm serious.

578
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,900
Shenxing.

579
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,900
See him out.

580
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,380
Liu Changsheng.

581
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,580
You'd rather leave here than marry me?

582
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,820
I'm not kidding, I'm serious.

583
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,860
Putting aside our friendship,

584
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,100
I really like you.

585
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,300
What are you waiting for?

586
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,770
Mr. Xiao, please.

587
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,060
Changsheng.

588
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,780
I know poetry and also medicine.

589
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,700
I promise you,

590
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,620
after marriage,

591
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,880
I will be devoted to you.

592
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,580
See Mr. Xiao out.

593
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,460
Mr. Xiao.

594
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,020
Please.

595
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,140
Changsheng.

596
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,800
It's a long way to Great Tang.

597
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,380
Prince Qin is no pushover either.

598
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,160
I really don't want you to suffer.

599
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,140
I hurt my leg because of my own carelessness.

600
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,780
I never really blamed you.

601
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,780
I know I joke with you a lot.

602
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,500
No matter what I say today,
you won't believe it.

603
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,250
But I know my own heart.

604
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,420
I really want you to stay in Fuyu,

605
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,500
and stay with me.

606
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,980
If you agree to marry me,

607
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,820
I will treat you wholeheartedly.

608
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,940
If you change your mind,

609
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,940
keep me informed.

610
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,100
I will always wait for you.

611
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,420
Your Highness.

612
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,740
I think Mr. Xiao

613
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,780
is serious this time.

614
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,060
I only treat him as a friend.

615
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,380
I have no feelings for him.

616
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,980
If I cause him to disobey the imperial decree

617
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,660
and implicate the Xiao family,

618
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,940
then I'm ruthless and heartless.

619
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,980
It's too late.

620
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,900
If I have to sacrifice,

621
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,980
I'd rather to do it in a dignified way.

622
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,220
Yi'an.

623
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,660
Your Highness, please come in.

624
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,380
Your Highness, do you regret it

625
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,620
and want to ask for my help?

626
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,460
You'll leave the day after tomorrow.

627
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,820
I've prepared something for you.

628
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,420
You're so considerate.

629
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,220
There is one thing

630
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,460
I would like to ask you.

631
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,380
Go ahead.

632
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,690
You agreed with the peace-making marriage

633
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,020
in order to protect Fuyu.

634
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,660
What if

635
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,500
Prince Qin attacks Fuyu in the future?

636
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,220
The day the war begins

637
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,980
is when I die for my country.

638
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,980
What if you can protect Fuyu without marriage?

639
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,220
Really?

640
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,510
I mean if.

641
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,540
There's no if

642
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,980
in the world.

643
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,180
You do look on the bright side of things.

644
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,700
Here

645
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,060
are all the specialties of Fuyu.

646
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,460
Take it back and let Prince Qin have a taste.

647
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,380
This is really well thought out.

648
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,660
This one

649
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,180
is Soul-Stirring Powder.

650
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,220
A chronic drug.

651
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,940
It kills people without being noticed.

652
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,260
Even the imperial physician couldn't find out.

653
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,300
Your Highness.

654
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
What is...

655
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,460
What is this?

656
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,780
This one

657
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,460
is specially made in Fuyu,

658
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,700
exclusively used

659
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,860
in the royal family.

660
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,820
Soul-breaking Pills.

661
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,140
Your Highness, I want to say

662
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,100
what do you mean?

663
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,140
I'm worried

664
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,900
Prince Qin's really as cruel as the rumors say.

665
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,460
So I should make some preparations.

666
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,300
You're really well prepared.

667
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,220
Okay, I won't tease you anymore.

668
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,900
These are pills made of mint.

669
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,380
This is hawthorn powder.

670
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,020
You'll be tired from traveling.

671
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,060
Take them both.

672
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,380
Thanks, Your Highness.

673
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,500
The air at night is so nice.

674
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,060
I'm afraid I won't be able to smell it anymore.

675
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,580
Isn't the air the same everywhere in the world?

676
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,180
Same?

677
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,700
Shenxing.

678
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,100
Do you know how many moons
there are in the sky?

679
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,420
Sixteen.

680
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,580
There is actually only one.

681
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,980
Just as the date changes,

682
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,500
the shape of the moon in the sky

683
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,860
changes accordingly.

684
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,740
In different locations,

685
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,060
the air is different.

686
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,620
A scoop of water in the hometown

687
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,500
is better than the gold of other countries.

688
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,580
Your Highness.

689
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,780
Things are unpredictable

690
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,740
in this world.

691
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,580
Don't worry too much.

692
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,140
Should we buy some?

693
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,940
Your Highness.

694
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,060
Qinxin.

695
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,740
I heard that you'll marry into Great Tang.

696
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,460
Over the years, our salt shop

697
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,780
has been under your care.

698
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,130
Please accept this makeup sharpener.

699
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,580
Thank you.

700
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,260
This young man is...

701
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,380
This is my husband,

702
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,260
Zhou Erlang.

703
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,420
But you said before...

704
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,260
Here's the thing.

705
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,860
I met Zhou Erlang at the Lantern Festival
and fell in love at first sight.

706
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,820
Unfortunately, we didn't know
each other's identity.

707
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,340
Until yesterday, I was forced to get married

708
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,660
and the groom

709
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,220
turned out to be him.

710
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,660
I see.

711
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,740
Congratulations.

712
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,060
I wish you a long life together.

713
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,540
Let's go then.

714
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,820
Your Highness, look.

715
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,980
Things are unpredictable.

716
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,980
It may take a turn

717
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,940
for the better.

718
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,820
The arranged marriage is actually fate.

719
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,100
Perhaps

720
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,500
I was really wrong.

721
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,580
Young Master.

722
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
You are right.

723
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,260
You haven't made any mistakes.

724
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,700
Whether on the battlefield
or in the court,

725
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,060
you've always been in control

726
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,900
and haven't made any mistakes.

727
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,980
You saw it that day.

728
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,980
The girl on the street

729
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
swore to die

730
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,060
to avoid the forced marriage.

731
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,220
But what does she have to do with you?

732
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,180
Young Master, are you worried

733
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,700
Her Highness will commit suicide on the way?

734
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,340
But the purpose of our visit to Fuyu

735
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,700
is to prepare for the upcoming war.

736
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,780
Young Master.

737
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,300
You can't be soft-hearted.

738
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,780
In fact, things

739
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,620
are not necessarily as bad as you think.

740
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,220
Your martial arts

741
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,820
are never meant to kill.

742
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,220
If Great Tang and Fuyu can reconcile,

743
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,180
isn't this a blessing for both countries?

744
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,460
I won't kill Boren.

745
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,740
But what if Boren died for me?

746
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,940
Boren is...

747
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,380
You fool.

748
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,780
It's Changsheng.

749
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,620
Young Master.

750
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,380
If you are really worried,

751
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,460
you can just reveal your identity.

752
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,580
If Her Highness has feelings for you,

753
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,090
it'll be

754
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,500
a good thing.

755
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,340
No.

756
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
We're still in Fuyu.

757
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,460
Once Young Master's identity is revealed,

758
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,780
even if Fuyu has no ill intentions,

759
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,160
if others know about this,

760
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,650
the consequences will be unthinkable.

761
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,560
You guys leave me first.

762
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,020
Changsheng.

763
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,060
I...

764
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,780
Changsheng, what are you doing?

765
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,140
What are you doing?

766
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,160
If you don't want to get married,
you don't have to commit suicide.

767
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,020
Commit suicide?

768
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,300
Yes.

769
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,460
I was committing suicide.

770
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,230
I have no way out.

771
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,340
Actually, I am...

772
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,580
I lied to you.

773
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,620
That was a gift from someone else.

774
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,620
You lied to me?

775
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,860
I'm going to take a rest first.

776
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,820
Concern leads to confusion.

777
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,260
You panicked.

778
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,060
(Virtue and Morality)

779
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,220
Changsheng.

780
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,460
If you don't want to get married,
you don't have to commit suicide.

781
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,020
Mother.

782
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,940
I've thought about it.
I'm going to meet His Majesty.

783
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,740
Stop.

784
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,380
If you go today,

785
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,900
I will no longer be your mother.

786
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,780
Mother.

787
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,980
You'll no longer be a son of the Xiao family.

788
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,180
Mother.

789
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,260
If I don't go,

790
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,940
Changsheng is really going to leave.

791
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,860
Zilv.

792
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,100
Do you know that if you offend His Majesty,

793
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,420
our entire family will be convicted.

794
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,980
Are you planning

795
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,780
to destroy the honor

796
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,140
we've earned

797
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,820
for three generations

798
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,060
just for a woman?

799
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,740
You can't go.

800
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,540
- You are not allowed to go.
- Mother.

801
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,220
Just let him go, Mother.

802
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,060
Mother.

803
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,500
- Mother.
- Zilv.

804
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,140
Zilv.

805
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,820
No, Mother.

806
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,660
Don't.

807
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,140
If you take one step forward,

808
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,140
I will

809
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,980
die in front of you.

810
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,260
- Mother.
- Mother.

811
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,340
Mother.

812
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,460
Mother.

813
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,540
Is honor

814
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,660
really that important?

815
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,700
Even if Zilv goes to the palace,

816
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,060
the Xiao family's honor will not be damaged.

817
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,460
But if he doesn't go,

818
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,580
Changsheng and him will regret it
for the rest of their lives.

819
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,060
I don't want them to be sad.

820
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,060
Mother.

821
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,540
If you really want to leave Zilv,

822
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,500
then let me go with you.

823
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
- Jin.
- Jin.

824
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,620
Zilv, go!

825
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,100
Meet His Majesty

826
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,660
and marry Changsheng.

827
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,300
Forget it.

828
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,380
Forget it.

829
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,180
Mr. Envoy is about to depart.

830
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,940
I have prepared the dowry.

831
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,460
But as for the candidate...

832
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,420
Your Majesty, don't.

833
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,900
Why do people always interrupt

834
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,020
at this moment?

835
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,620
Your Majesty.

836
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,430
Princess Changsheng and I

837
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,530
have been childhood sweethearts.

838
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,840
For the sake that the Xiao family

839
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,580
has served the imperial court
for three generations,

840
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,060
please grant me a marriage with Changsheng.

841
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
Prince Changle has made a decision
on this matter.

842
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,460
You don't have to say much.

843
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,180
- Your Majesty.
- Shut up.

844
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,380
Stand aside.

845
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,620
Yes.

846
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,380
Mr. Envoy.

847
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,300
It's a deal

848
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,340
for the peace-making marriage.

849
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,220
What do you think?

850
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,820
I'll listen to Princess Changsheng's opinion.

851
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,700
I, Liu Changsheng,

852
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,580
am willing to make the alliance

853
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,660
and dedicate my whole life

854
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,860
to protect Fuyu.

855
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,820
I request your permission

856
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,860
to let me go to Great Tang
to complete the peace-making marriage.
