00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,980
(Library)

4
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,680
These books are newly arrived folk classics.

5
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,720
After drying them,

6
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,830
put them all into the warehouse.

7
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,960
Aunt.

8
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,630
What are you laughing at? You look so happy.

9
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,590
Just some miscellaneous books.

10
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,500
Collection of Jokes.

11
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,610
You...

12
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,960
You'll break it.

13
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,190
You care about it so much.

14
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,310
Still denying it.

15
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,680
Duplicity.

16
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,840
Duplicity.

17
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,820
You two.

18
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,770
Your wedding is coming soon.

19
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,490
What are you doing here

20
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,930
instead of preparing for the wedding?

21
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,450
Because the wedding is coming soon,

22
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,220
we want good things to come in pairs.

23
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,500
I don't understand what you two are saying.

24
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Has Xiao Zilv

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,680
done anything recently?

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,590
Him?

27
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,030
What can he do?

28
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,640
This Xiao Zilv.

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,480
Princess Royal.

30
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,130
Princess Royal.

31
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,610
Princess Royal.

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,640
You are here.

33
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,190
Are you here to read books today?

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,590
Yes, read books.

35
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,910
This Xiao Zilv.

36
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,910
Didn't he say he'd propose today?

37
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,640
Wait for him to propose?

38
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,730
We'll have to wait till next year.

39
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,570
I'll help him.

40
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,680
Such an important and meaningful thing.

41
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,330
It's not good for outsiders to get involved.

42
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,190
I'm here to read books

43
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,070
and also to visit someone.

44
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,960
I can't believe him.

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,910
Visit someone?

46
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,450
Yes, visit someone.

47
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,290
You.

48
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,430
And Miss Lingzhi.

49
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,120
And the people in Xiuwen Hall.

50
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,700
How are you guys?

51
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,610
Okay.

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,980
Then I'll let you

53
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,970
catch up with them.

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
No.

55
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,050
Go, go, go.

56
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,100
Go after her.

57
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,640
- Why are you here?
- Is that the point?

58
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,560
Go after her.

59
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,750
- Come on.
- Go.

60
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Princess Royal.

61
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,220
Why hasn't he caught up yet?

62
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,580
Am I walking too fast?

63
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,430
Finally found her.

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,400
What to do?

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,400
Princess Royal.

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,310
You've finished catching up?

67
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,990
Yes, yes.

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,790
Then you came to the Royal Garden

69
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,820
for flower viewing?

70
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,750
Yes, yes.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,040
Except for yes,

72
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,610
can't you say something else?

73
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,870
Yes, yes.

74
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,610
No, no, no, no.

75
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,550
I mean I'll say something else.

76
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,040
Look.

77
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,120
The garden is full of

78
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,140
the beauty of spring.

79
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,630
Don't you have anything you want to say to me?

80
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,630
I do.

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,960
Say it.

82
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,870
Okay.

83
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,670
Look, the garden is full of

84
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,230
the beauty of spring.

85
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,670
Look at these lotuses.

86
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,460
They are two-in-one.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,240
Do you think it's funny?

88
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,310
So funny.

90
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,600
Princess Royal.

91
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,430
I have something else to tell you.

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,670
Well, this is...

93
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,010
A jade pendant.

94
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,820
Do you know the meaning of jade pendants?

95
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,930
Ward off evil spirits?

96
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
No.

97
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,230
A jade pendant is a love...

98
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,700
After spending so much time together,

99
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,820
I know my heart better than before.

100
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,790
Do you know my heart?

101
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,020
You know what I'm going to say, right?

102
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,990
I actually...

103
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,430
If Aunt wasn't here,

104
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,870
I really want to punch him.

105
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,260
Who do you want to punch?

106
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,440
What's it got to do with you?

107
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,280
Meddlesome.

108
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,700
If you keep talking, I will...

109
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,070
What will you do?

110
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,380
I'll punch myself.

111
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,880
Your Majesty.

112
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,940
Get up, get up.

113
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,900
Xiao Zilv is proposing to my aunt.

114
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,380
This jade pendant belongs to my mother.

115
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,440
My mother's mother gave it to her.

116
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,230
She split it into two
and gave them to me and Jin.

117
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,700
Jin is my sister.

118
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,360
My sister will also give this

119
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,940
to her husband.

120
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,790
Are you willing to accept my jade pendant?

121
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,070
Would you like to

122
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,010
take me as your wife?

123
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,890
No, no.

124
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:03,940
Would you like to

125
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,490
marry me?

126
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,690
I...

127
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,400
I...

128
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,110
Would you like to?

129
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,790
If you don't say yes,

130
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,990
I will...

131
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,310
Why are you here?

132
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,020
Aunt, don't hesitate.

133
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,430
Do you want to?

134
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,820
I do.

135
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,540
(Prince Song's Mansion)

136
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,070
This night pearl is really nice.

137
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,930
Princess Consort,

138
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,260
I'll wrap it up.

139
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,970
It does seem good.

140
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,870
But there are better options.

141
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,730
How about we choose this?

142
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,570
Hetian jade pendant.

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,840
I will...

144
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,760
I will take my leave first.

145
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,030
I'll come back once you make up your mind.

146
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,940
Okay, you guys leave first.

147
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,640
Wait a minute.

148
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,850
Leave. Leave.

149
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,670
What should I choose?

150
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,280
An umbrella.

151
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,840
Wish them a speedy breakup.

152
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,680
Are you crazy?

153
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,670
How could you give an umbrella
for Prince Qin's wedding?

154
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,940
I don't want to give him anything.

155
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,270
I bought these for you.

156
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,510
I don't want to give them away.

157
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,030
Alright.

158
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,170
If we give it away,

159
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,960
we can always buy new ones.

160
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,940
Prince Qin is no longer the same as before.

161
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,210
Now he has power

162
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,290
and the result is certain.

163
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,740
Let's not get mad at him.

164
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,890
Just take this opportunity

165
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,980
to win him over.

166
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,170
Then we'll get a chance

167
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,030
to survive.

168
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,160
No.

169
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,940
I want you to be the Empress.

170
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,790
I'll just be Princess Consort.

171
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,940
You are not cut out to be an emperor.

172
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,650
Let's just live an idle life

173
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,290
and enjoy together,

174
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,320
isn't that good?

175
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,800
I don't want to.

176
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,760
I already promised you

177
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,220
to make you the Empress.

178
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,840
Where are you going?

179
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,680
I'm going to look for Ke.

180
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,560
He has many ideas.

181
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,910
Maybe he can think of a good way.

182
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,370
Lv Hou.

183
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,890
How many times have I told you?

184
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,080
Keep away from him.

185
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,210
He's not a good guy.

186
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,770
He's a bad influence on you, you know?

187
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,760
Don't get too close to him.

188
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,860
Or I will strangle you.

189
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,250
Leave first.

190
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,270
Your Highness, you're back.

191
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,910
What did Mr. Sun and Mr. Guo say?

192
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,740
Those snobs.

193
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,760
When Jing was not around,

194
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,740
I held the power

195
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,980
and they came here every day.

196
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,460
Now Jing is in power,

197
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,070
I went to see them

198
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,030
but they avoided seeing me.

199
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,510
Your Highness, don't be angry.

200
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,720
It's human nature

201
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,700
to seek benefits and avoid harm.

202
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,770
Ge.

203
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,370
Will you...

204
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,770
Your Highness.

205
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,190
In my life,

206
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,940
I will always be with you

207
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,550
and never leave you.

208
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,970
Princess Consort.

209
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,650
Have you done the thing

210
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,360
I told you?

211
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,480
Princess Consort, rest assured.

212
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,880
I have pawned all the valuables

213
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,930
in batches.

214
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,980
We can leave tomorrow.

215
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,130
Remember

216
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,050
His Highness must not know about this.

217
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,890
I know.

218
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,210
(Ge,)

219
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,310
(have you betrayed me too?)

220
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,980
(Huadeng Pavilion)

221
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,740
(Peace and Elegance)

222
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,280
Okay.

223
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,600
Leave me here.

224
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,040
We're getting married the day after tomorrow.

225
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,790
I won't see you tomorrow.

226
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,650
Will you let me accompany you tonight?

227
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,460
We will live together from tomorrow.

228
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,210
I'm tired today.

229
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,550
Please let me rest early.

230
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,940
I'd like to see you more.

231
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,840
We see each other every day.

232
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,460
What's there to see?

233
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,790
- Changsheng.
- Changsheng.

234
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,910
Dad and Mom.

235
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,890
Changsheng.

236
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,400
Changsheng.

237
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,650
Changsheng.

238
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,580
Has our daughter gained weight?

239
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,970
I haven't.

240
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,840
Did you eat well?

241
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,220
Don't worry, Dad and Mom.

242
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm doing very well.

243
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,560
Good.

244
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,610
Thanks.

245
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,050
I was so afraid you'd chase me away.

246
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,220
Then I won't see this scene.

247
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,530
Liu Changsheng.

248
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,840
I know you're getting married.

249
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,370
I came here with a swollen belly.

250
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,980
You're going to be a mother so soon?

251
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,980
- I married well.
- Come sit down, please.

252
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,490
Let me see.

253
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,680
You didn't lose weight.

254
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,970
So you're doing well

255
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,840
in Great Tang.

256
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,100
Jin, how are you?

257
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,560
Is Xie Lin good to you?

258
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,840
He is good.

259
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,370
But you know him.

260
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,410
Too pedantic.

261
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,430
He's stubborn

262
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,620
and has many rules.

263
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,050
I just told him

264
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,830
I wanted to come to Great Tang
to watch you get married,

265
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,430
and he got worried.

266
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,090
Finally, Guangde came

267
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,030
to persuade him.

268
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,820
He's caring about you.

269
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,520
By the way, your brother

270
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,050
is marrying Princess Royal of Great Tang.

271
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,860
He used to be arrogant.

272
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,130
And he said

273
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,910
he would marry a princess.

274
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,620
You're the last choice.

275
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,670
I didn't expect that he would really make it.

276
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,740
Okay, stop the repetitious talk.

277
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,040
Oh, Changsheng.

278
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,120
This is the wedding gift for you

279
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,390
from Sheng Tiangang.

280
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,980
He said it can only be opened in an emergency.

281
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,910
I hope I never have to use it.

282
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,550
- Mother.
- Changsheng.

283
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,890
After the long journey,

284
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,730
you must be tired.

285
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,080
I'm hosting a feast in the mansion.

286
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,910
Princess Royal and Xiao Zilv
are also on their way.

287
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,340
Let's celebrate together.

288
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,290
Okay, let's have a couple of drinks.

289
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,310
- Good.
- Please.

290
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,550
- Go.
- Go.

291
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,770
Go.

292
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,480
I never thought that Mr. Envoy was Prince Qin.

293
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,790
I wanted him to marry into our family.

294
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,460
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

295
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,320
Come on.

296
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,690
- Dad and Mom, let me toast you.
- Come.

297
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,270
Then I have to have a drink.

298
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,730
Have you done the thing I told you?

299
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,070
Princess Consort, rest assured.

300
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,330
I have pawned all the valuables

301
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,290
in batches.

302
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,270
We can leave tomorrow.

303
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,530
Remember,

304
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,130
His Highness must not know about this.

305
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,980
I know.

306
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,440
Your Highness.

307
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,370
Ge.

308
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,010
Come and sit.

309
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,790
Your Highness, you're in a good mood tonight.

310
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,860
I promised you to watch the rhododendrons,

311
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,190
but I didn't make it after all.

312
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,670
You've been running around all night lately.

313
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,670
I want to treat you.

314
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,820
Then let's have a drink.

315
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,520
Why don't you drink?

316
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,320
Your Highness.

317
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,150
I have something to say.

318
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,030
This wine smells too strong

319
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,460
and I'm afraid of getting drunk.

320
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,030
Then I won't be able to say it.

321
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,400
Tell me.

322
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,440
I still remember

323
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,940
that year the Royal Garden was full of flowers,

324
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,700
(and my father was transferred back to Luojing,)

325
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,170
- (taking me to the palace to see the Emperor.)
- How bold!

326
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,830
Who are you?

327
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,450
- How dare you harm Consort De's
- (I was just having fun.)

328
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,620
carefully cultivated flowers?

329
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,480
Consort De, I didn't mean it.

330
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,530
(I picked the flowers
that Consort De had carefully cultivated.)

331
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,620
Consort De, I am...

332
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,260
- (I should've been severely punished.)
- Drag her away and beat her to death.

333
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,360
- Consort De, please calm down.
- (You were passing by)

334
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,240
(and saved me.)

335
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,080
Greetings, Consort De.

336
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,030
It's Prince Lu.

337
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,680
How did you get time to come to the palace?

338
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,790
I just got a pot of rhododendron.

339
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,170
I didn't dare to appreciate it alone,

340
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,940
so I brought it to you.

341
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,820
This is indeed a rarity.

342
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,040
Consort De.

343
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,080
I have prepared some refreshments.

344
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,740
Let's go over there and enjoy it.

345
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,930
Why don't you leave now?

346
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,790
Are you deliberately disturbing Consort De?

347
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,150
Thank you, Consort De.

348
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,230
You do love flowers.

349
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,340
Having tenderness toward beauties.

350
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,790
From that moment on,

351
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,520
I

352
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,230
have felt attached to you.

353
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,750
It was so many years ago.

354
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,730
You still remember it?

355
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,580
Of course.

356
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,030
You saved

357
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,790
my life.

358
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,070
If you want it,

359
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,950
you can take it anytime.

360
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,730
What are you talking about?

361
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,410
You can't sleep these days

362
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,760
and can't eat,

363
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,750
only thinking about how to get rid of Jing.

364
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,760
But we all know

365
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,230
that we have already lost.

366
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,420
We can't beat Jing.

367
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,420
- I can.
- Your Highness.

368
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,550
Let's go.

369
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,790
Stop fighting.

370
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,690
Our current situation is very dangerous.

371
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,550
I'm not leaving!

372
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,420
I didn't lose.

373
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,820
As long as I'm alive, I won't lose.

374
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,580
Even if I fight to the death,

375
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,960
I would rather die

376
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,100
when my life is a disgrace!

377
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,250
Your Highness.

378
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,340
I know you well.

379
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,100
But I just want you to live well.

380
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,010
So

381
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,510
please let me

382
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,270
fight to the death

383
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,620
for you.

384
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,980
(Marriage)

385
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,580
(Huadeng Pavilion)

386
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,650
Wait a moment.

387
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,030
What are you in such a hurry for?

388
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,140
You can't let them take you away so easily.

389
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,480
If you're too easy to get,

390
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,580
you'll not be cherished.

391
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,760
Let's find a way

392
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,820
to trick the groom.

393
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,070
That's not good.

394
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,030
This time I support Guangde.

395
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,810
Then don't go too far.

396
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,330
Look at you.

397
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,450
You haven't married him yet

398
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,660
and you're already taking his side.

399
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,210
I'll go tell him.

400
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,950
Your Highness, come on.

401
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,480
Our Changsheng

402
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,170
can't be taken away by you so easily.

403
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,370
What do you want me to do then

404
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,550
to take away Changsheng?

405
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,610
Poetic duet is too boring.

406
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,470
How about

407
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,960
you guess riddles?

408
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,420
OK, what's the riddle?

409
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:03,970
I...

410
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,030
I don't have any difficult riddles.

411
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,120
Liu Changsheng.

412
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,480
You're on your own.

413
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,170
You represent the prestige of Fuyu now.

414
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,100
You can't make it easy for him.

415
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,040
Let me ask you.

416
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,410
Why do swallows

417
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,950
fly south in autumn?

418
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,890
Because of the cold.

419
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,790
Wrong, because it's slow by walking.

420
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,420
What are the cloth

421
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,520
and paper afraid of?

422
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,900
Cloth and paper?

423
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,680
Of course they're afraid of fire.

424
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,790
- Right.
- Wrong.

425
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,950
Cloth fears a thousand times,
paper fears a mere one chance.

426
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,950
[*Chinese pun: Be cautious of emergency]

427
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,090
It seems that you can't

428
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,180
complete the marriage.

429
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,510
Come back another day.

430
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,750
Shut up your mouth.

431
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,750
I finally got married.

432
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,140
It took me a long time

433
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,270
to marry you.

434
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,460
(Library)

435
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,790
Princess Royal.

436
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,070
I came to pick you up.

437
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,930
Prince Consort.

438
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,510
Our princess has something to say.

439
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,090
Miss Lingzhi, please speak.

440
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,130
Princess Royal said

441
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,520
the reason why she chose to get married

442
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,410
in Xiuwen Hall

443
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,610
instead of her own palace

444
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,580
is threefold.

445
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,450
First, you two have

446
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,660
the most memories here.

447
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,210
Second,

448
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,510
this is your favorite place.

449
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,230
Third,

450
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,000
I want to ask you for a valuable item

451
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,570
on behalf of Princess Royal.

452
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,410
Valuable item?

453
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,860
Yes, it must be the most valuable.

454
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,570
Take your time to think.

455
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,860
I'll go back to accompany Princess Royal.

456
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,030
Valuable item?

457
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,750
You girl.

458
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,410
Just come up with

459
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,680
some questions to test him.

460
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,410
Why did you ask him

461
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,720
for a valuable item in my name?

462
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,710
Please don't be mad.

463
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,450
Don't you want to know

464
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,570
how valuable you are

465
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,750
in his heart?

466
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,490
Princess Royal.

467
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,560
He's coming.

468
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,460
(A whole life, a pair of sweethearts,
agonized, oceans apart)

469
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,340
What did he write, Princess Royal?

470
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,230
A promise.

You guys are outrageous.

524
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,380
How dare you team up with her
to hold me hostage!

525
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,090
Where is she?

526
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,130
I'm gonna kill her.

527
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,830
Your Highness,
you misunderstood Princess Consort.

528
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,640
She just wants to help you...

529
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,040
Princess Consort is devoted to you.

530
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,580
Your Highness.

531
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,480
Princess Consort knows that
if Prince Qin is still alive,

532
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,520
you can't live in peace.

533
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,950
So she sold all the property

534
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,480
and asked us to take you outside the border

535
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,320
to restart your life.

536
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,230
Princess Consort knew

537
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,330
she'd never come back

538
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,340
this time.

539
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,270
She is afraid of dragging you down.

540
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,550
From that moment on,

541
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:43,930
I

542
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,030
have felt attached to you.

543
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,860
If you

544
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,990
want my life,

545
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,580
you can take it anytime.

546
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,270
What happened?

547
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,490
Your Highness.

548
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,070
Three miles ahead, we will be outside Luojing.

549
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,620
You'll be safe when you leave.

550
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,310
If you don't leave now,

551
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,710
Prince Qin will not let you go.

552
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,130
And all Princess Consort's efforts

553
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,990
will be in vain.

554
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,760
Please think twice, Your Highness.

555
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,860
Please think twice, Your Highness.

556
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,230
I only have you in my heart.

557
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,000
The rhododendrons

558
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,840
are going to bloom.

559
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,930
Are you willing

560
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,680
to see the blooms with me?

561
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,660
When the rhododendrons bloom,

562
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,660
I will go with you to view them.

563
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,410
I will always

564
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,990
be with you

565
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,270
and never leave you.

00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,310
Thank you.

571
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,240
Well, Changsheng, I was...

572
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,100
Yiyi, you're welcome.

573
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,620
I offended you before.

574
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,040
Fortunately, you didn't take it to heart.

575
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
I hope we will

576
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,370
get along well in the future.

577
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,210
Yeah.

578
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,610
Get along well.

579
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,930
Me and Hou

580
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,340
will support you and Jing.

581
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,660
Get up and toast them.

582
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,560
Changsheng,

583
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,080
I'll toast you.

584
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,170
Please.

585
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,480
Today's a big day.

586
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,470
I came late.

587
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,950
Don't blame me, Jing and Changsheng.

588
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,040
No problem.

589
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,100
Ge, please take a seat.

590
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,580
Why didn't Ke come?

591
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,550
He has important matters to attend to.

592
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,170
What's wrong?

593
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,380
Don't you welcome me?

594
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,250
No.

595
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,520
Come on.

596
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,580
Hou, Yiyi.

597
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,170
Youmou.

598
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,030
- Yes.
- Keep an eye on Chu Ge.

599
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,100
She came with bad intentions.

600
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:28,770
Yes.

601
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,100
Isn't that Princess Consort Lu?

602
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,230
Why did she come here by herself?

603
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,840
Yeah.

604
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,900
I heard that Prince Lu didn't like her.

605
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,760
Others are all in pairs

606
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,860
but she's all alone.

607
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,710
Look at that empty seat.

608
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,790
Forget it, let's drink.

609
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,120
Prince Qin.

610
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,230
Didn't you say you wanted
to give Changsheng a surprise?

611
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,650
Are you going to

612
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,790
go back on your word now?

613
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:00,950
Of course I won't.

614
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,270
It's just too early.

615
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,580
The surprise I prepared

616
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:05,860
might take a while.

617
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,040
Okay.

618
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,420
If I don't see any surprises today,

619
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,750
I won't leave.

620
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:21,970
Ge.

621
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,790
Do you like this play?

622
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,510
The plays in your mansion

623
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,950
are naturally excellent.

624
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,420
Do you want to watch more?

625
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,000
I also

626
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,990
learned some plays.

627
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,770
Why don't I

628
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,240
perform a little

629
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,550
to cheer everyone up?

630
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,510
Good.

631
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,380
Father hosted a banquet

632
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,310
and wanted us to live in harmony.

633
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,360
Fireworks.

634
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,380
So beautiful.

635
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,820
This is good.

636
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,080
Look.

637
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,650
Look at that.

638
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,750
Do you like it?

639
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,360
Prince Qin.

640
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,280
Is this the surprise you mentioned?

641
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,120
Yes.

642
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,550
Changsheng.

643
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,750
Time for me to perform.

644
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,220
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

645
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:48,140
A stork's shadow flit across the chilly pool.

646
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:55,140
The spirit is buried in cold moonlight.

647
00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:00,750
Today, the shadows of two people
are in front of the red candle.

648
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:09,660
Not noticing the ghoulish hell.

649
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,290
All are spectators.

650
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,480
What is she singing?

651
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,450
It's too unlucky.

652
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,930
Smile on your face.

653
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,270
How nice.

654
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,850
It suits both refined and popular tastes.

655
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,870
Even I understood it.

656
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,560
Chu Ge.

657
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,660
I didn't expect her to be

658
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,990
so versatile.

659
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,680
But you don't know

660
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,660
that after a while,

661
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:30,780
I'll send you

662
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:36,140
to death's door.

663
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,780
Smells good.

664
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
It's like

665
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,780
the smell of fireworks.

666
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,580
How is it, Changsheng, Jing?

667
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,660
How was my performance?

668
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,880
Get them.

669
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,780
Youyong, Youmou, go.

670
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,030
Your Highness.

671
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,130
Go.

672
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,100
Your Highness, go.

673
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,530
Yi'an.

674
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,700
- Yi'an.
- Your Highness.

675
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,550
Yi'an.

676
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,620
Your Prince Qin is there.

677
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,220
Where do you want to go?

678
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,960
Kill them.

679
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,990
Protect Prince Qin and Princess Consort Qin.

680
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,180
It's the Royal Guards.

681
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,890
Rebels.

682
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,070
Surrender now.

683
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,140
Retreat quickly.

684
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,440
Yi'an.

685
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,700
Yi'an.

686
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,620
