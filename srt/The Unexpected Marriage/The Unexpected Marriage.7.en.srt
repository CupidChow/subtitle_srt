How come?

16
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,130
The snow was too slippery.

17
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,970
I wanted to help you,

18
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,090
but...

19
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
That represents

20
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,640
peace-making marriage.

21
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,520
It seems that all this is fate.

22
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,360
There seemed to be a strong wind just now.

23
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,360
We can't play pitch-pot on a windy day.

24
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,480
This must be a warning from God.

25
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,980
To let you go for the peace-making marriage.

26
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,260
Didn't you say

27
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,420
people in Great Tang

28
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,660
don't believe this?

29
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,420
You are so repulsive to the marriage?

30
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,260
If I ask you to marry a devil,

31
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,260
will you do it?

32
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,700
And he's also extremely ugly.

33
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,420
Extremely ugly?

34
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,660
Don't hide it from me.

35
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,940
I already knew.

36
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,760
Prince Qin has round eyes
and a large forehead,

37
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,980
two protruding ears,

38
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,980
and a mouth full of fangs.

39
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,260
He's just hideous.

40
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,820
He doesn't look so bad.

41
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,260
It's not his appearance that's bad.

42
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,660
It's his character.

43
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,140
He's violent

44
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,500
and likes to eat people.

45
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,140
- Eat people?
- Yes.

46
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,500
With skin and bones.

47
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,340
He also drinks blood.

48
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,000
Anyway, I definitely won't marry

49
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,100
this kind of person.

50
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,220
Is Zhao Huaibi the one
you really want to marry?

51
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,660
That is...

52
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,060
For sure.

53
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,340
If you're so sure,

54
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,580
you wouldn't hesitate.

55
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,420
I have a way

56
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,140
to let you face your inner self.

57
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,620
Do you want to try it?

58
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,980
Sure.

59
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,860
Close your eyes.

60
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,780
Don't mess around.

61
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,780
You don't dare？

62
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,780
(Virtue and Morality)

63
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,020
What are you doing?

64
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,700
You'll know if you close your eyes.

65
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,620
Fine.

66
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,140
What is love

67
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,220
supposed to be?

68
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,020
Those involved are easy to get confused.

69
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,100
Close your eyes.

70
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,380
Searching around,

71
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,700
who is the one in your heart?

72
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,180
You need to chant a spell?

73
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,700
Focus.

74
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,940
Now,

75
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,820
relax your body.

76
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,420
Take a deep breath.

77
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,220
A very

78
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,020
deep breath.

79
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,340
Imagine the air you breathe in

80
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,820
reaches every corner of your body.

81
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,660
Now

82
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,980
inhale.

83
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,020
Exhale.

84
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,220
Now your body

85
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,260
is in the most relaxing state.

86
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,180
Think carefully

87
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,620
about

88
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,460
the happiest time,

89
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,980
funniest time,

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,260
and the most touching moment.

91
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,980
Don't sleep, Changsheng.

92
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,300
Hold on a little longer.

93
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,140
Now,

94
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,020
who's the person

95
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,740
you see?

96
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,660
It's you.

97
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,860
It's me?

98
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,220
Yes.

99
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,580
I open my eyes

100
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,980
and see you.

101
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,460
I'm not blind.

102
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,220
Okay.

103
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,220
You should go to bed now.

104
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,780
No, I'm going to sleep.

105
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,580
You should leave now.

106
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,220
Hurry up.

107
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,780
He is the envoy.

108
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,060
Right.

109
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,380
I'm not going to

110
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,220
marry him.

111
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,900
Liu Changsheng.

112
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,460
Wake up.

113
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,780
Don't mistake illusions for feelings.

114
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,540
Shenxing.

115
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
You go back and rest first.

116
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,580
No, I'm not tired.

117
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,540
I will accompany you.

118
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,740
Your Highness.

119
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,780
Why are you so unhappy

120
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,780
after seeing Mr. Envoy?

121
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,620
Your Highness.

122
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,220
How could it be him?

123
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,020
What do you mean?

124
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,220
Who's he?

125
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,780
Why not him?

126
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,780
How could it be him?

127
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,860
Your Highness.

128
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,700
Why I can't understand

129
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,140
what you're saying now?

130
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,220
It's him

131
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,700
or him.

132
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,340
So is it him?

133
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,340
If not him,

134
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,260
who would it be then?

135
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,260
I was born to be burdened by the rumor.

136
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,980
I don't have any luck in love.

137
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,780
It's hard to have a marriage,

138
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,660
but I need to marry far away.

139
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,770
But Prince Qin is notorious.

140
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,980
As a last resort,

141
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,020
I just want to get married quickly.

142
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,180
Shen Bin.

143
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,060
Yang Wulang.

144
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,540
For me,

145
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,140
they're just choices to avoid the marriage.

146
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,100
General Zhao has great ambitions.

147
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,700
For me,

148
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,260
he's just suitable.

149
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,500
However,

150
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,620
he and Guangde are in love.

151
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,820
I am just

152
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,500
a passerby.

153
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,340
Thinking about it,

154
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,500
I almost made a big mistake

155
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,060
out of impatience.

156
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,300
Fortunately, Yi'an gave some good advice.

157
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,700
Then I could see my heart.

158
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,180
Your Highness.

159
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,540
(Virtue and Morality)

160
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,300
Your Highness.

161
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,020
Good morning.

162
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,540
Good morning.

163
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,600
Where are we going today?

164
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,260
We?

165
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,260
Yes.

166
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,540
Are you going to dump me?

167
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,520
Muyan Forest.

168
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,460
You have been there.

169
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,300
Let's go again.

170
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,060
It's very boring there.

171
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,280
And it's dirty and messy.

172
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,620
Let's go.

173
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,940
Although the Muyan tree looks rough,

174
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,080
it's actually very fragile.

175
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,940
We need to gently

176
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,800
sweep off the salt frost using a brush.

177
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,460
Making every move,

178
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,040
we need to feel the breathing
of the tree trunks.

179
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,200
It seems

180
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,560
the Muyan tree is no different from you.

181
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,900
It looks strong on the outside,

182
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,680
but in fact, it's delicate and fragile.

183
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,080
Let me feel it too.

184
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,960
I can feel it.

185
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,560
What did you feel?

186
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,600
I feel

187
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,200
her reluctance and unwillingness.

188
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,100
Shenxing.

189
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,080
Pass my order.

190
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,520
This batch of trees

191
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,140
can harvest salt.

192
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,060
Remember to complete it before early March.

193
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,900
Yes.

194
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,020
(Pulping Field)

195
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,200
Your Highness.

196
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,800
Lend a hand.

197
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,680
This is the pulping field.

198
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,520
Just add a little more.

199
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,500
Okay.

200
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,440
Your Highness.

201
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,440
Your Highness, let me do it.

202
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,080
It's okay, go back to your work.

203
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,140
Yes.

204
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,060
This is the pulp used
to frame paintings and calligraphy.

205
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,660
The pulp made in Fuyu

206
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,440
can make the mounting parts firmly bonded,

207
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,020
soft and smooth,

208
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,600
and it's also insect- and moisture-proof.

209
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,080
The effect is so magical.

210
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,680
Fuyu's people are not as good as Great Tang's.

211
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,320
Most of them are illiterate.

212
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,780
Even noble women

213
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,080
seldom read.

214
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,780
That is why

215
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,580
our mounting and printing technologies

216
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,560
are relatively lagged behind.

217
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,020
I researched for a long time

218
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,680
to make the pulp.

219
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,540
Paintings framed with it

220
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,440
has a long storage time

221
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,620
and will be handed down.

222
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,740
I believe

223
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,040
in time,

224
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,440
we will make everyone literate,

225
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,840
every home has a collection of books,

226
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,600
great scholars can be found

227
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,940
among court officials and common people.

228
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,020
Your Highness has a grand ambition.

229
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,080
I admire you very much.

230
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,680
To be honest,

231
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,020
the peace-making marriage

232
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,840
aims to unite the two countries
and create peace.

233
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,520
This is just one of the purposes.

234
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,200
The second is

235
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,600
His Majesty wants to use this way

236
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,180
to learn about Great Tang's culture

237
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,020
and craftsmanship.

238
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,720
In the mind of Prince Qin,

239
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,840
Fuyu must be remote and backward.

240
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,840
But even so,

241
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,040
Fuyu also wants to make its people rich,

242
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,100
attentive,

243
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,480
and honest.

244
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,600
We want no lawsuits in the country.

245
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,160
This is the powder washing pool.

246
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,440
When washing powder,

247
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,520
both refined and coarse powder

248
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,580
must be filtered through a fine sieve.

249
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,280
Its purpose is to filter out
the bran from the powder

250
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,540
to prevent gluten residue and starch water

251
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,380
from mixing together.

252
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,200
After washing,

253
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,260
add pure water

254
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,920
and knead into a dough
that is neither too soft nor too hard.

255
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,680
Come on, try it.

256
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,140
Okay.

257
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,580
(High Morals)

258
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,080
Pass the order immediately.

259
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,860
Zhao Huaibi.

260
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,460
Why General Zhao,

261
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,920
who faces death unflinchingly,

262
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,320
is so afraid of me?

263
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,440
Princess.

264
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,400
General Zhao, rest assured.

265
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,080
I didn't come here to pester you.

266
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,040
I just want to know

267
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,280
are you really ready to marry Changsheng?

268
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,900
I...

269
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,320
I have already told His Majesty

270
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,520
I wanted to marry Princess Changsheng.

271
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,860
Then

272
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,440
I wish you and Changsheng

273
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,280
a happy marriage.

274
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,740
Thank you, Princess.

275
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,440
- You...
- Princess.

276
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,160
We are not destined
to be together in this life.

277
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,080
Just wait until the next life.

278
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,540
Okay.

279
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,720
Then I'll leave first.

280
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,080
- Remember to keep up.
- Princess.

281
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,700
Princess.

282
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,840
If something really happens to you,

283
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,420
how can I live alone?

284
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,920
Anyway, I can't live

285
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,720
nor die.

286
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,100
Zhao Huaibi.

287
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,560
You're so cruel

288
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,800
to have forced me into this.

289
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,040
I failed you, Princess.

290
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,040
I'm willing to die to atone for my sin.

291
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,420
Forget it.

292
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,420
I had prepared

293
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,080
many plans before I came

294
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,840
just to make you change your mind.

295
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,560
But at this point,

296
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,320
I finally understood what Changsheng said.

297
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,680
Liking someone

298
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,400
doesn't mean to occupy him

299
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,800
or to destroy him.

300
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,320
I give up.

301
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,040
I just hope you won't let Changsheng down.

302
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,800
Don't make the same mistake again.

303
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,800
Princess.

304
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,720
General Zhao.

305
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,800
Please behave yourself.

306
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,940
Let's go.

307
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,180
Princess.

308
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,280
Princess.

309
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,980
Guangde.

310
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,980
Princess.

311
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,140
Should I ask the musician

312
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,400
to sing you a song?

313
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,940
The new musician

314
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,980
is so good at

315
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,180
singing Peach Blossom Fan.

316
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,080
The song ends and people disperse.

317
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,480
It's just a waste of time.

318
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,030
What a pleasant day and a wonderful night,
but with no mood to enjoy.

319
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,760
It just isn't meant to be.

320
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,760
Who will pity me?

321
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,380
Let's not listen to it.

322
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,220
Not this song.

323
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,180
How about

324
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,120
Autumn Wind Tune?

325
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,320
If I knew it would be so heart-wrenching,

326
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,400
I wouldn't have met you.

327
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,240
If I hadn't met Zhao,

328
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,080
why bother missing him now?

329
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,320
Not this song.

330
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,880
Didn't you love listening
to the Roadside Mulberry?

331
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,520
Let's listen to the Roadside Mulberry.

332
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,320
Zhao has his own wife,

333
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,360
yet Guangde has no husband.

334
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,320
In the end, it is a story of three people.

335
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,280
But I don't have a name in it.

336
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,320
Princess.

337
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,720
Please stop crying.

338
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,280
What should I do?

339
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,080
With an endless stream of dreamy thoughts,

340
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,080
my sadness is hard to describe.

341
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,280
Living or death breeds

342
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,280
no more gratification or frights.

343
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,480
Princess, you can't do this.

344
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,360
Say it.

345
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,160
Guangde trapped herself in the palace,

346
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,240
not eating or drinking all day.

347
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,820
No matter how I persuade her, it's useless.

348
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,460
Your Majesty and I

349
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,640
watched her grow up.

350
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,800
She has been spoiled since little.

351
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,500
Now

352
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,240
she finally has someone she likes.

353
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,280
But trapped in love,

354
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,160
she's been crying all day.

355
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,800
It really hurts

356
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,720
to see her like this.

357
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,660
Marriages

358
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,000
are arranged by parents.

359
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,880
Your Majesty, why don't you

360
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,800
grant Guangde a marriage?

361
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,120
Isn't that using power to force him?

362
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,560
I think

363
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,640
it also depends on timing.

364
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,980
Now

365
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,400
the eligible candidates

366
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,160
are only Changsheng and Guangde.

367
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,180
I've always

368
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,520
been worrying.

369
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,280
I just can't

370
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,080
stop worrying.

371
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,980
What if Guangde is selected?

372
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,640
It's such a far place.

373
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,620
I will never

374
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,840
stop worrying then.

375
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,320
Okay, okay, don't cry.

376
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,080
Forget it.

377
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,660
Gao An.

378
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,740
Yes.

379
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,560
Get Zhao Huaibi here.

380
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,740
Yes.

381
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,660
(Imperial Study)

382
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,600
Yuzhi.

383
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,160
(Waves by the Sea)
I remember

384
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,320
you are twenty-five, right?

385
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,240
- Yes.
- Yuzhi.

386
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,080
You are young and promising.

387
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,580
You're my capable assistant

388
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,620
and an incredible general

389
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,320
in Fuyu.

390
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,080
It's just

391
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,840
at this age, there is no one
to take care of you.

392
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,560
I'm really worried.

393
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,740
Unify the family first

394
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,000
and then can you pacify the world.

395
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,980
Last time I mentioned

396
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,660
Princess Guangde's marriage to you.

397
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,500
Your Majesty.

398
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,020
I...

399
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,800
I have decided

400
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,280
to marry Princess Changsheng.

401
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,600
This is so sudden.

402
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,560
Yuzhi.

403
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,560
I think you

404
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,100
are still young.

405
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,420
There is no need

406
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,340
to mention marriage

407
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,660
too soon.

408
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,500
Let's give it some time.

409
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,260
Jin.

410
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,280
You came.

411
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,500
What's wrong?

412
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,420
You're not happy about getting married?

413
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,720
Changsheng has been acting
a little weird towards me lately.

414
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,420
You had a fight?

415
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,340
No.

416
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,800
Changsheng and I didn't fight.

417
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,940
But that feeling

418
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,800
is worse than we had a fight.

419
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,740
You guys have a close relationship.

420
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,620
And you haven't had any fights,
so it should be fine.

421
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,460
Yes.

422
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
My brother helped Guangde come up with ideas,

423
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,320
and I tipped them off.

424
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,240
But since I tipped them off,

425
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,320
Changsheng has been even more strange to me.

426
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,020
Doesn't Zilv

427
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,360
like Her Highness?

428
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,320
Why is he helping Princess Guangde?

429
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,940
Because my brother

430
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,240
really likes Changsheng.

431
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,880
But Changsheng doesn't want to marry him.

432
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,460
(Respect and Prudence)

433
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,260
So my brother secretly opposed it

434
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,600
and leaves Changsheng with no choice.

435
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,320
Then she'll marry into our family.

436
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,180
Xiao can't do this.

437
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,080
My brother has broken a leg.

438
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,240
If it's true as the rumor says,

439
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,840
then after marrying Changsheng,

440
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,120
my brother will...

441
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,180
I think now I know the problem

442
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,040
between you two.

443
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,020
What's it?

444
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,860
You

445
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,940
are smart,

446
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,000
but have a fool in your sleeve.

447
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,660
What does it mean?

448
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,500
Let me ask you.

449
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,820
You tipped them off

450
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,380
to help Changsheng

451
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,580
or you're afraid that

452
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,760
Changsheng will marry your brother?

453
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,220
I...

454
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,420
I...

455
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,240
If I really can't get married,

456
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,080
I'll marry your brother.

457
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,240
Anyway, he has already broken a leg.

458
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,940
There shouldn't be any more problems.

459
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,760
You can't marry my brother.

460
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,660
Well,

461
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,340
my brother

462
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,160
is actually an embroidered pillow,

463
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,560
pleasant to the eye but of no use.

464
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,080
Usually, he looks

465
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,940
elegant on the outside,

466
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,900
but he's terrible

467
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,740
behind people's backs.

468
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,760
You don't know, Changsheng.

469
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,880
How could I not know?

470
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,480
Don't worry.

471
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,460
I won't choose

472
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,800
Xiao Zilv to be my husband.

473
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,180
Even if I have to marry into Great Tang,

474
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,240
I won't consider him.

475
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm going to apologize to Changsheng.

476
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,620
Young Lady, Princess Changsheng is here.

477
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,220
Changsheng? Let her in.

478
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,080
Yes, Young Lady.

479
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,940
Jin.

480
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,600
Last time you left in a hurry,

481
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,560
and didn't even take
the fruit I prepared for you.

482
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,640
Today I feel better,

483
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,040
so I brought it to you.

484
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,660
This fruit

485
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,040
is from another country.

486
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,660
It may not look pretty,

487
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,120
but it tastes very sweet.

488
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,860
You're going to be a bride.

489
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,960
It's a happy event.

490
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,140
Do you know how many people
want to get married

491
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,280
but can't get married?

492
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,240
Changsheng.

493
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,480
Sorry.

494
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,260
Between you and me,

495
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,420
this is the last word

496
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,320
I want to hear.

497
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,800
You have always treated me as a close friend.

498
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,320
But I only helped you

499
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,720
because of my own selfish intentions.

500
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,520
I don't deserve it.

501
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,560
What are you talking about?

502
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,160
You helped me.

503
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,500
Isn't it that you just hope

504
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,360
I can marry someone I like?

505
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,880
I'm afraid

506
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,800
you'll marry my brother.

507
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,260
Fool.

508
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,000
I didn't want to marry your brother.

509
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,940
Actually, my brother

510
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,400
really likes you.

511
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,280
He is just too embarrassed to speak up.

512
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,080
He was rejected by you before,

513
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,540
so he thought of ways

514
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,720
to ruin your dates.

515
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,040
Between men and women,

516
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,560
there's not just about love

517
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,480
but also friendship.

518
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,780
He's

519
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,560
just a friend to me.

520
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,840
It's impossible between us.

521
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,220
Fortunately, General Zhao chose you.

522
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,220
He is murderous.

523
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,320
He shouldn't be afraid.

524
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,640
Don't say that.

525
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,480
My bad. My bad.

526
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,800
Your hair is so pretty.

527
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,800
I really want to comb your hair

528
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,760
when you get married.

529
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,800
But I'm unlucky.

530
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,320
Changsheng.

531
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,560
This is the wedding gift I prepared for you.

532
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,580
I wish you and Xie Lin

533
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,520
a happy marriage.

534
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,340
Changsheng.

535
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,660
Thank you.

536
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,060
(Exotic flowers and plants,
close moon and distant mountains)

537
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,220
How bold!

538
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,920
Your Highness, please forgive me.

539
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,520
I didn't know you were coming.

540
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,800
The servants

541
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,500
are getting more and more unruly.

542
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Don't blame them.

543
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,480
I didn't allow them to say it.

544
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,780
This charcoal

545
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,320
burns really well.

546
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,260
Sit down.

547
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,720
This security bracelet

548
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,000
was given to you by Guangde.

549
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,740
Yes.

550
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,880
You said you wanted to marry me.

551
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,260
Do you still mean it?

552
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,940
I make a deal,

553
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,960
I keep a deal.

554
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,720
Then are you marrying me

555
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,400
just to honor the promise

556
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,800
or that you really like me?

557
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,100
Your Highness.

558
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,060
Your Highness.

559
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,080
What are you doing?

560
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,130
Your Highness, please forgive me.

561
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,600
Sorry for the offense.

562
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,320
I didn't plan to throw it away.

563
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,000
Since it is a precious thing,

564
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,880
you should treasure it.

565
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,080
Guangde is waiting for you.

566
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,340
Without you,

567
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,960
she will really die.

568
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,700
You fight on the battlefield

569
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,480
just to protect the ones you love.

570
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,900
If Guangde died,

571
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,080
would you really be happy?

572
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,520
Listen to the voice in your heart.

573
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,700
But...

574
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,360
But Your Highness, you...

575
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,260
Mr. Envoy

576
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,700
is discussing the marriage with His Majesty

577
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,040
in the Imperial Study.

578
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,820
Go now.

579
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

580
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,520
(It's obviously a story for three people.)

581
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,500
(Guangde,)

582
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,320
(I am the one who should not have a name.)

583
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,180
Mr. Envoy

584
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,220
will be back to Great Tang soon.

585
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,420
Have you decided

586
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,400
on the candidate for marriage?

587
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,380
Among the women of appropriate age

588
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,560
in Shangkang City,

589
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,740
Princess Changsheng and Princess Guangde

590
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,840
are both excellent candidates.

591
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,560
I don't know which

592
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,080
will Your Majesty choose.

593
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,320
I watched

594
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,940
Changsheng grow up.

595
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,500
She's dignified and virtuous,

596
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,140
endowed with civil and martial virtues.

597
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,480
To be honest, I'm really reluctant

598
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,840
to marry her to Great Tang.

599
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,880
Since you're reluctant,

600
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,800
then I choose Princess Guangde

601
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,520
for Prince Qin.

602
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,260
Guangde...

603
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,660
Guangde is naughty by nature.

604
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,760
She isn't a good choice.

605
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,940
I think

606
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,600
Princess Guangde is unrestrained,

607
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,020
innocent and lively.

608
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,500
Besides, I've heard before

609
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,800
she made a bet with Her Highness

610
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,420
that if she failed to choose a husband

611
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,080
before I leave,

612
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,000
she'll willingly go
for the peace-making marriage.

613
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,320
Now General Zhao has made a choice.

614
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,660
I am afraid...

615
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,640
Your Majesty.

616
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,420
General Zhao asks to see you.

617
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,260
I won't see him.

618
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,500
Your Majesty, sorry for the rudeness.

619
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,360
I came

620
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,000
to ask you to grant me a marriage.

621
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,580
Take him out.

622
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,580
Your Majesty.

623
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,980
Please

624
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,320
marry Princess Guangde to me.

625
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,600
General Zhao asked for permission

626
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,500
to marry me?

627
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,340
Yes.

628
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,840
How come?

629
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,040
What?

630
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,160
You don't like it?

631
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,880
What happened?

632
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,880
Liu Changsheng, did you...

633
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,340
Yes.

634
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,320
I'm incompetent,

635
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,400
and can't keep General Zhao by my side.

636
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,880
I am defeated.

637
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,900
You are not generous.

638
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,820
Your guest is here.

639
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,040
Aren't you going to give me a cup of tea?

640
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,320
Liu Changsheng.

641
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,080
Do you think I can't afford to lose?

642
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,700
I don't need you to cheat.

643
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,100
Father likes me so much.

644
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,220
He won't want to marry me far away.

645
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,940
You gave Zhao Huaibi to me,

646
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,080
what will you do?

647
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,320
The person General Zhao likes is you.

648
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,160
I just granted his wish.

649
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,740
I...

650
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,580
Don't cry.

651
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,080
I like it when you argue with me.

652
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,280
What did your storybooks say?

653
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,560
Those love stories

654
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,180
are not so amazing

655
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,120
as they look.

656
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,420
It's either

657
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,600
quarrelsome lovers

658
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,640
or childhood sweethearts.

659
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,180
First, the two people were at odds.

660
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,640
Then their fates entangle.

661
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,460
If there's no fate,

662
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,000
we can create opportunities ourselves.

663
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,120
Just pester him.

664
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,940
I'll use these tips

665
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,520
to find my destined man.

666
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,700
Changsheng.

667
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,520
Thank you.

668
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,800
Alright.

669
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,560
I told you it's a convincing defeat.

670
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,880
I didn't cheat.

671
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,560
How could I let you win?

672
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,320
There's still flexibility

673
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,120
on the peace-making marriage.

674
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,340
(Prince Changle's Mansion)

675
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,080
What's with the forced smile?

676
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,060
You became soft-hearted

677
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,900
at the last moment?

678
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,160
There will be someone waiting for me.

679
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,640
The smile is not forced.

680
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,080
Want to know what I told His Majesty?

681
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,100
No.

682
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,560
Your words cannot be taken back.

683
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,560
I have no control over my affairs.

684
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,260
It's useless to talk more.

685
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,620
Up to you.

686
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,440
I heard

687
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,560
Great Tang is particularly rich.

688
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,140
It's located in a remote place,

689
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,980
totally worthless.

690
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,120
People there

691
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,720
are literate

692
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,740
and doors are unbolted at night.

693
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,540
Not at all.

694
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,300
The people there are all unruly

695
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,160
and they lie all the time.

696
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,560
People's hearts are no longer what they were.

697
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,660
Zhaojun held the jade saddle
and embarked on the journey.

698
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,560
Tears wetting her cheeks.

699
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,040
Today, she is still a member of the Han Palace.

700
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,360
Tomorrow, she will be the concubine
of a barbarian.
