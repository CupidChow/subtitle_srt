00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,660
=Episode 10=

3
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,740
(Luojing, Great Tang)

4
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,040
- Sugar-coated haws.
- Come and take a look.

5
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,580
Prince Qin's convoy is in Wulipai.

6
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,730
Prince Qin has returned to Luojing.

7
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,850
Prince Qin's convoy is in Wulipai.

8
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,800
He's back to Luojing.

9
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,730
I have to go back home quickly

10
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,730
and let my daughter dress up.

11
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,150
Why are you running?

12
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,710
Prince Qin is back to the capital.

13
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,010
Prince Qin is back to the capital.

14
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,010
Prince Qin.

15
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,540
(Luojing)

16
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,670
Prince Qin.

17
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,530
Your Highness.

18
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,340
Your Highness.

19
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,380
Prince Qin.

20
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,380
Prince Qin.

21
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,220
(Imperial Study)

22
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,080
Father.

23
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,200
It's not that I'm spoiled.

24
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,040
It's just

25
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,470
the governor of Yuzhou

26
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,780
is such a bully.

27
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,190
I'm worried about you

28
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,710
and want to share your burdens.

29
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,800
And I still have to prevent the people

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,910
from scrounging.

31
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,520
The poverty relief work

32
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,810
is really hard for me.

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,160
Father.

34
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,320
Ke.

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,640
Your second brother really
tried his best this time

36
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,060
but it didn't work.

37
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,110
The governor of Yuzhou

38
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,530
is your mother's family.

39
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,570
You can take over this matter.

40
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,960
Don't let me down again.

41
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,800
Yes.

42
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,410
I will definitely fulfill my mission.

43
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,500
- OK.
- Report.

44
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,940
Your Majesty, the Third Prince is here.

45
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,990
Let him in.

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,010
Greetings, Father.

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,800
Rise.

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
My child, you are back.

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,640
How is it?

50
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,560
Who did you select

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,670
for the peace-making marriage?

52
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,360
She is the daughter of Prince Changle of Fuyu,

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,380
Princess Changsheng.

54
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,640
I thought it was the Emperor's daughter.

55
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,080
Princess Changsheng is the one I like.

56
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,150
Good.

57
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,080
It's rare to have a woman you like.

58
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,140
Now I am very curious

59
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,460
about my daughter-in-law.

60
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,460
I believe you will like her.

61
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,390
You've found a good match.

62
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,370
Congratulations, Jing.

63
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,070
But now

64
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,190
the countries around Great Tang

65
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,140
are all eyeing us covetously.

66
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,850
I don't know what's Fuyu attitude toward this.

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,370
During the days I stayed in Fuyu,

68
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
I learned

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,340
Fuyu is located in a fortress,

70
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,590
and its salt industry and fishery
are very developed.

71
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,830
In the future, it'll be a contested spot.

72
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,830
Then why don't you conquer this place

73
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,140
to make it work for us?

74
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,790
Having said that,

75
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,660
if we break the peace,

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,000
it will not only greatly affect the food trade

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,390
between Great Tang and Fuyu

78
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,900
but also give the border countries

79
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,970
an opportunity for exploitation.

80
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,750
I remember that you

81
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,390
advocated war against Fuyu.

82
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,220
Things have changed.

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,730
It seems that you've changed

84
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,930
because of the future sister-in-law.

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,610
I'm just being realistic.

86
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,970
I have no selfish motives.

87
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,520
Although Great Tang is dominant,

88
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,360
in fact,

89
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,560
we're facing domestic strife
and foreign aggression.

90
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,970
If we rashly send troops,

91
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,340
I'm afraid it's not good for us.

92
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,200
Since Fuyu is intended to show goodwill,

93
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,830
I guess they are afraid of Great Tang.

94
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,150
It's just their fear

95
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,230
is easy to change.

96
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,530
It's hard to say

97
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,370
whether they dare not to act rashly

98
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,700
or unwilling to play second fiddle.

99
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,050
Fuyu is trying to make nice,

100
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,910
but we want to dispatch troops.

101
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,260
That is unrighteous

102
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,700
and against people's will.

103
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,610
Father.

104
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,660
So what do you think?

105
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,610
We'll discuss this later.

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,230
Jing.

107
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,260
You have made a lot of progress
after this trip.

108
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,750
Thanks, Father.

109
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,290
You've also matured a lot in your thinking.

110
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,390
You guys

111
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,970
should go out and travel more.

112
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,610
Only by traveling the world

113
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,580
can you know the world,

114
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,390
only by understanding the people

115
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,530
can you benefit the people.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,840
We know.

117
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll take my leave first.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,840
Okay.

119
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,400
Jing.

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
Stay.

121
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,550
Ke.

122
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,310
Hou, what's it?

123
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,680
Jing holds the military power

124
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,220
and now has the support of Fuyu.

125
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,050
You don't worry at all?

126
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,900
I'm just a powerless and idle prince.

127
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,900
Hou, have you forgotten?

128
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,340
My main concern right now is

129
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,460
how to clean up your mess in Yuzhou.

130
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,040
Ke.

131
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,760
I won't beat around the bush with you.

132
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,160
Reasonably, the eldest son

133
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,560
born of the legal wife
will take the throne.

134
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,120
The late Empress had no child.

135
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,470
My mother is the highest-ranking concubine
in the imperial harem.

136
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,100
But Father hasn't appointed a crown prince.

137
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,100
If you stand on my side,

138
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,760
I will definitely give you benefits.

139
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,290
It's not that I don't want to help you.

140
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,610
I really am weak in power.

141
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,370
Ke, why can't you

142
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,460
see the situation clearly?

143
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,620
(Grand Tutor's Mansion)

144
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,480
Grand Tutor.

145
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,100
I'd like to ask you to pick a good day.

146
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,980
(Yi Jingwei, Grand Tutor of Great Tang)
Wasn't this date already set?

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,140
If nothing goes wrong,

148
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,610
she is not Liu Changsheng.

149
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,050
What did you say?

150
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,230
I said something wrong.

151
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,100
Wrong?

152
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,230
You did not know

153
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,850
I'm marrying Princess Changsheng.

154
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,440
So the day you picked

155
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,700
is naturally not the best.

156
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,260
Now the candidate has been decided,

157
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,920
shouldn't we choose

158
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,830
another auspicious day?

159
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,900
Yes, yes, yes.

160
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,070
Okay.

161
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,040
But Princess Changsheng's birthday

162
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,560
is a bit different from ordinary people's.

163
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,850
Extraordinary.

164
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,580
In three years,

165
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,190
I really can't find

166
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,480
a second auspicious day.

167
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,710
Are you saying

168
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,900
that I'm blessed?

169
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,650
That's for sure.

170
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,610
Your Highness and Princess Changsheng

171
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,830
are a match made in heaven.

172
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,440
It only happens once in a century.

173
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,300
Grand Tutor.

174
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,240
I've always disliked people

175
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,460
talking behind my back

176
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,420
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

177
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,060
You're very smart.

178
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,180
You should understand what I mean.

179
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,510
Yes, Your Highness.

180
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,720
Please pick

181
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,180
an auspicious day soon.

182
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,300
So that I don't have to avoid seeing the bride

183
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,700
three days before the wedding.

184
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,970
I will try my best.

185
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,890
She's is already on the way to here.

186
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,820
What could possibly go wrong?

187
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,300
(Wenyue Inn)

188
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,180
Doctor Liu.

189
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,510
Doctor Liu, Doctor Liu.

190
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,610
It's bad, Doctor Liu.

191
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,840
What's wrong?

192
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,680
Why are you flustered?

193
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,850
Princess Changsheng is sick again.

194
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,350
What are you stuttering about?

195
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,770
Again, again.

196
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,910
This is not the only time
she has been sick during this journey.

197
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,040
It's the sixth time.

198
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,080
That's why she's sick again and again.

199
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,250
I'm used to it.

200
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,730
Let her be sick.

201
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,070
We still need to hurry on with our journey.

202
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,370
This time it seems to be real.

203
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,890
She pretended to be real every time.

204
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,470
Prince Qin knew she would do this,

205
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,840
so he asked me

206
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,960
to accompany the convoy

207
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,230
to welcome them.

208
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,590
As expected,

209
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,800
during the way,

210
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,610
there's always been trouble.

211
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,870
So we'll leave her alone?

212
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,710
Yes.

213
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,770
That's not going to work.

214
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,880
Let's go.

215
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,180
- Take me to check on her.
- Yes.

216
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Doctor Liu.

217
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,010
He's here, hurry up.

218
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,060
Doctor Liu, please come in.

219
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,220
There's nothing I can do.

220
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,350
Your Highness, do you know

221
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,480
the wedding day

222
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,220
was selected by the Grand Tutor
based on the eight diagrams?

223
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,370
There can be no delay.

224
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,200
If you miss the time,

225
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,820
it'll be unlucky.

226
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,280
Besides, we've been

227
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,300
delaying time all the way.

228
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,510
We can't explain to Prince Qin.

229
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,470
Doctor Liu, please be careful with your words.

230
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,040
Our princess is sick now.

231
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,560
How can we just leave her like this?

232
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,100
This is Great Tang's etiquette?

233
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,350
I'm fine.

234
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,060
Maybe it's just a cold,

235
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,940
nothing major.

236
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,560
I can still take this.

237
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,540
Even if I die,

238
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,010
my body needs to be sent to Great Tang.

239
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,160
Your Highness.

240
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,960
Please let me take your pulse.

241
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,890
No need.

242
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,370
Let's continue on our way

243
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,890
in order not to delay

244
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,000
the auspicious day.

245
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,800
Doctor, please be careful.

246
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,670
This is Fuyu's princess,

247
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,370
and the future wife
of the Third Prince of Great Tang.

248
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,230
Don't be rude.

249
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,560
I am thinking

250
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,850
for Her Highness's well-being.

251
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,230
Her Highness's disease keeps relapse

252
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,970
and didn't let me take her pulse.

253
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,040
Today I am afraid that
I will delay the treatment.

254
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,180
I must take her pulse.

255
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,890
No, Doctor Liu.

256
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,610
Mr. Xiao, please step aside.

257
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,320
In case anything happens,

258
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,060
I need to report to His Majesty.

259
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,830
You...

260
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,920
Your Highness.

261
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,680
Your pulse...

262
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,970
- Doctor Liu, I'm fine.
- How come?

263
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,750
I can still take this.

264
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,590
Your Highness.

265
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,080
You're not fine.

266
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,300
You are really sick.

267
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,650
It's just this disease happened suddenly

268
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,800
and the pulse condition is strange.

269
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,540
I can't be sure now.

270
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,420
We can't delay the journey.

271
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,130
Not to mention the way to Great Tang,

272
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,970
even if it's the road to the underworld,

273
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,490
I will stick it out.

274
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,440
After all, Doctor Liu just said

275
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,420
I'm pretending to be sick.

276
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,130
And you're betting on your future

277
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,510
and life.

278
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,420
Your Highness.

279
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,420
Why is your life so miserable?

280
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,970
You're traveling thousands of miles
to Great Tang.

281
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,790
These people don't take good care of you,

282
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,010
give us a cold shoulder

283
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,890
and even don't want to treat you.

284
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,040
Your Highness, you can go first.

285
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,650
I will soon follow you.

286
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,830
Shenxing.

287
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,200
You and Your Highness just leave this world

288
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,040
and don't look back.

289
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,870
Wait until I finish an important thing,

290
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,160
I'll go join you.

291
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,010
Jinyan, what are you going to do?

292
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,370
I'm going to see His Majesty.

293
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,700
Great Tang is a country of etiquette.

294
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,400
Even if Fuyu is not as powerful as Great Tang,

295
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,870
we shouldn't be treated like this.

296
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,710
Your Highness.

297
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,320
I will make Doctor Liu fulfill his promise

298
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,870
and take his whole family

299
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,180
to die with us.

300
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,590
Your Highness, I have never felt

301
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,100
such a strange pulse.

302
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,180
Maybe I am incompetent.

303
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,430
I'll go

304
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,280
and work on the prescription.

305
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,610
I'm leaving.

306
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,400
Okay, he's gone.

307
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,240
Stop crying.

308
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,540
Xiao Zilv, good for you.

309
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,320
This medicine really works.

310
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,540
Of course I'm good.

311
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,670
Your Highness,
about the peace-making marriage...

312
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,870
About this matter,

313
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,250
I can't turn the situation around,

314
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,250
but we can change

315
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,970
the wedding day.

316
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,180
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

317
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,040
Your Highness.

318
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,590
Xiuwen Hall

319
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,010
has been built on schedule.

320
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,250
Princess Royal is in charge now.

321
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,560
Originally, the Ministry of Rites

322
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,700
had a problem with this.

323
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,580
But the Princess Royal is so amazing.

324
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,110
In less than a month,

325
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,080
she kept

326
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,370
Xiuwen Hall in order.

327
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,920
Now there's less and less

328
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,820
opposition now.

329
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,710
I know Princess Royal is capable,

330
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,280
so I feel relieved to let her be in charge.

331
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,120
Right.

332
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,700
I haven't seen her for a long time.

333
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,760
Let's go

334
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,440
to Xiuwen Hall.

335
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,280
Okay.

336
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,100
Princess Royal.

337
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,160
How will the rules of four seasons

338
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,690
be implemented?

339
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,280
(Lv Wan, Princess Royal of Great Tang)
Very simple.

340
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,680
In the specified season,

341
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,560
it is forbidden to cut trees,

342
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,180
cut water grass and burn lime.

343
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,990
Bird hunting and fishing

344
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,580
are also prohibited.

345
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,080
If there are any violators,

346
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,360
they shall be punished according to law.

347
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,670
Understand?

348
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,040
Makes sense.

349
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,220
That makes sense.

350
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,310
Princess Royal.

351
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,340
What if someone ignores the punishment?

352
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,700
It's even simpler.

353
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,130
Death penalty.

354
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,830
That's too cruel and harsh.

355
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,340
Only harsh punishment

356
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,540
can prevent people from violating rules.

357
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,530
Do you have any other questions?

358
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,200
Princess Royal,

359
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,540
when will you choose your husband?

360
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,520
Well...

361
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,400
This is most asked question

362
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,460
in the record.

363
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,360
It seems that

364
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,560
the workload I've assigned you

365
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,730
is too light.

366
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,440
- No, no.
- Actually no.

367
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,400
I organize these materials every day.

368
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,110
I'm too busy to go home.

369
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,400
Who doesn't know that I have

370
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,300
all the three meals in Xiuwen Hall?

371
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,650
I amend the laws

372
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,420
and visit from house to house.

373
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,830
We're busy.

374
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,320
Really busy.

375
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,960
- Yes.
- I'm busy.

376
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,610
Since everyone is working so hard,

377
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,540
go back and rest today.

378
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,580
Any missed work will be docked

379
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,650
from your pay.

380
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,000
Well...

381
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,170
Still not leaving?

382
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,750
These old-fashioned people

383
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,080
keep beating around that bush

384
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,370
to urge you to choose a husband

385
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,870
and then get married.

386
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,650
Then the position of supervisor will open up.

387
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,830
Why don't they see

388
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,840
who's managing

389
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,940
Xiuwen Hall so well now?

390
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,890
They just don't give up.

391
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,160
I don't know what kind of man

392
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,650
will be favored by you.

393
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,250
Go prepare some tea.

394
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,220
Prince Qin should arrive soon.

395
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,310
Yes.

396
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,280
What wonderful foresight.

397
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,610
How did you know I was coming?

398
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,610
Prince Qin, please.

399
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,590
Since you have already met His Majesty,

400
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,400
I guess you should know

401
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,460
the situation in the court.

402
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,730
Lv Hou doesn't know how to restrain himself.

403
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,180
He's had a hard time with you for a long time.

404
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,970
You don't have to worry too much about him.

405
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,060
I was attacked by an assassin in Fuyu.

406
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,680
The person behind it

407
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,610
is Lv Hou.

408
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,610
False friends are worse

409
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,170
than bitter enemies.

410
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,450
Then we should bridge

411
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,170
over the troubled water.

412
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,980
You have a lot of support

413
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,100
and are going to marry Fuyu's princess.

414
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,840
It's always right

415
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,210
to be cautious.

416
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,520
Your Highness.

417
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,520
Princess Royal.

418
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,960
We'll have to play this game another day.

419
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,920
If you're busy,

420
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,780
I'll leave first.

421
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,650
Aunt is on my side.

422
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,830
Feel free to say it.

423
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
Her Highness got sick on the way,

424
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,370
and might delay the wedding.

425
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,470
We can't talk behind people's backs.

426
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,100
We just talked about Fuyu's princess,

427
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,400
and something happened to her

428
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,340
before she even arrives.

429
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,750
You've been sick for three days.

430
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,980
When are you going to keep pretending?

431
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,130
As long as I can.

432
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,540
Let's miss the wedding ceremony first.

433
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,470
Since you don't want to get married,

434
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,820
- then why did you agree...
- Stop, stop.

435
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,160
When did I say I didn't want to get married?

436
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,200
I just want to examine the situation

437
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,780
and see what Prince Qin is like.

438
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,640
Anyway, as long as I'm not married,

439
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,930
there'll be room for wiggle.

440
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,590
So what?

441
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,210
So what?

442
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,340
If he's really like what Yi'an said,

443
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,120
then I can marry him.

444
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,360
What if he's not?

445
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,340
Then Yi'an and Prince Qin can be like this.

446
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,310
Sure enough, the most vicious

447
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,780
is woman's heart.

448
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,240
Your Highness.

449
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,470
- Bad news.
- What's wrong? Why are you so flustered?

450
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,690
Mr. Yi'an is here.

451
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,100
What to do?

452
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,790
He is the smartest.

453
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,650
What are you afraid of?

454
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,410
Aren't you guys the closest?

455
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,740
We're close,

456
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,700
but I can't pretend to be sick any longer.

457
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,920
I suddenly got some terrible illness,

458
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,080
and recovered without medical help.

459
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,200
If it gets out,

460
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,790
and people know I'm faking illness,

461
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,450
it'll affect the peace-making marriage.

462
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,630
What are you afraid of?

463
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,260
My medical skills are not fake.

464
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,170
His brain is not for show.

465
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,300
Her Highness is really sick this time.

466
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,890
The diagnosis is correct?

467
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,990
I have been practicing medicine for years.

468
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,120
This can't be wrong.

469
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,300
So Her Highness is really sick this time

470
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,510
Naturally, I can trust

471
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,840
Doctor Liu's medical skills.

472
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,930
It seems that Mr. Xiao

473
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,740
is even better.

474
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,310
His Highness doesn't want

475
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,310
Her Highness to know his identity yet.

476
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,650
Just don't reveal it.

477
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,910
Yes.

478
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,980
Make it look like it.

479
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,520
Mr. Envoy.

480
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,930
Greetings, Your Highness.

481
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,910
Yi'an.

482
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,340
How did you come?

483
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,680
I heard that Your Highness was ill.

484
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,980
Worried that you'd miss the wedding date,

485
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,060
I came to welcome you in advance.

486
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,440
When you heard that I was unwell,

487
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,960
you were worried about delaying the marriage

488
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,820
instead of me.

489
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,370
It's so inhumane.

490
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,410
I'm feeling worse

491
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,260
after hearing what you said.

492
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,030
Your Highness.

493
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,230
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

494
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,360
Actually, only two places.

495
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,200
Which two places?

496
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,130
This place

497
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,540
and that place.

498
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,370
Doctor Liu can't cure you?

499
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,400
Doctor Liu couldn't find the cause at first.

500
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,880
After taking two doses of medicine,

501
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,960
it still hasn't gotten better.

502
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,930
I'm afraid it's some rare illness.

503
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,260
Mr. Xiao's medical skills are superb.

504
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,720
Even you don't have any ideas?

505
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,780
My medical skills

506
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,830
are not worth mentioning.

507
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,020
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come
to Great Tang to learn medicine.

508
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,540
But now it seems

509
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,030
the medical skills of Great Tang

510
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,300
don't live up

511
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,980
to its name.

512
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,750
Since it can't be cured,

513
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,740
carry out an execution.

514
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,920
So cruel?

515
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,490
I am the princess
for the peace-making marriage.

516
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,710
You're going to kill me?

517
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,710
You came from afar and got seriously ill.

518
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,340
Doctor Liu was not good at taking care of you

519
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,740
and couldn't cure your disease either.

520
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,790
If he returns to Great Tang,
he will be punished by Prince Qin.

521
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,500
Why don't I punish him today?

522
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,070
Guards.

523
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,820
Drag Doctor Liu out

524
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,910
and beat him to death.

525
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,630
- Yes.
- Yes.

526
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,800
Sir.

527
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,720
Sir.

528
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,800
Wait a moment.

529
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,930
My illness was cured.

530
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,310
Your Highness was cured without treatment.

531
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,270
It's really a blessing.

532
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,750
All thanks to Doctor Liu.

533
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,960
I think his medicine took effect.

534
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,070
So with that said,

535
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,030
Doctor Liu

536
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,070
is not only innocent,

537
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,980
but also meritorious?

538
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,210
That's for sure.

539
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,750
Thank you, Your Highness.

540
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,690
Thank you, Your Highness.

541
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,960
Mr. Xiao,

542
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,020
what do you think of

543
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,820
Great Tang's medical skills now?

544
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,100
Excellent.

545
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,650
You haven't learned its subtlety yet.

546
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,540
Take your time.

547
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,890
This trip will definitely not let you down.

548
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,500
Her Highness has been like this all the way.

549
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,820
It's so hot.

550
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,170
Why don't we tell Mr. Envoy?

551
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,600
Mr. Envoy, Her Highness is sick.

552
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,750
I think she just caught a cold.

553
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,680
Can you stop and treat her?

554
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,540
Miss Shenxing,

555
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,790
Her Highness is in good health.

556
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,750
She got sick so many times along the way.

557
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,240
I guess she will be fine in a while.

558
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,160
Sir, Her Highness is really sick this time.

559
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,030
Stop the carriage quickly.

560
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,540
Her Highness is sick.

561
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,550
Sir.

562
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,480
Prepare to return

563
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,340
to the inn.

564
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,960
Sir, we don't have much time left.

565
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,740
If we can't get back to Great Tang
within two days,

566
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,170
I'm afraid the wedding date...

567
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,260
Yi'an, continue our journey.

568
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,100
You didn't hear what I just said, did you?

569
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,280
Yes.

570
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,410
Youyong, go back to the inn.

571
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,060
Go back to the inn.

572
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,680
Don't worry, Changsheng.

573
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,930
I won't let anything happen to you.

574
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,940
(Wenyue Inn)

575
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,910
Changsheng.

576
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,130
Xiao Zilv.

577
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,030
We don't need to pretend now.

578
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,070
Mr. Xiao.

579
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,610
Her Highness is really sick.

580
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,850
You are really sick?

581
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,370
It's true.

582
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,270
Every medicament has its side-effect.

583
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,370
Eating it is bad for your health.

584
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,410
Drink some ginger soup to induce sweating.

585
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,060
If it doesn't work, take medicine.

586
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,640
You can leave the rough work

587
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,130
to me, Jinyan and Shenxing.

588
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,830
Xiao Zilv.

589
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,650
You, Jinyan, and Shenxing should go out first.

590
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,610
I have something to say to Yi'an.

591
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,170
Is it still in time to leave tomorrow?

592
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,880
If we're late,

593
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,060
will it cause trouble to you?

594
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,680
Don't think about these.

595
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,850
Get well first.

596
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,540
Just leave the rest to me.

597
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,070
I struggled all the way

598
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,300
and have been sick so many times.

599
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,510
You are not afraid

600
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,940
that I'm also pretending to be sick this time?

601
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,820
I trust you.

602
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,110
Why?

603
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,780
No reason.

604
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,690
If I have to trust you for a reason,

605
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,820
then I don't really trust you.

606
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,240
Drink the ginger soup.

607
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,780
Cover yourself up to induce sweat.

608
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,020
You must take care of yourself.

609
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,890
I have some things to deal with.

610
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,550
See you in Great Tang.

611
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,230
Her Highness caught a cold.

612
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,450
Thank you for taking care of her.

613
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,300
I'll go back to Great Tang
and explain the situation.

614
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,410
Mr. Yi'an, be careful on the road.

615
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,580
Let's go, Youyong and Youmou.

616
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,960
Yes.

617
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,760
(Changsheng.)

618
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,890
(You must take good care of yourself.)

619
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,650
(I'll wait for you in Great Tang.)

620
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,990
(Luojing)

621
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,270
- Why haven't they come yet?
- Your Highness.

622
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,610
I've been waiting for so long.

623
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,210
Have you heard?

624
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,110
These gentlemen

625
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,450
are all here to welcome the Princess of Fuyu.

626
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,740
It's such a big scene.

627
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,400
Right.

628
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,880
She came from Fuyu

629
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,980
to marry Prince Qin.

630
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,130
I'm really curious about what she looks like.

631
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,300
(Luojing)

632
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,470
Do you see her?

633
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,500
She's coming.

634
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,670
Your Highness.

635
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,420
Your Highness.

636
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,580
Your Highness.

637
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,300
Your Highness.

638
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,270
My head, my head.

639
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,020
Help me take the thing off my bun.

640
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,620
My neck is almost broken.

641
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,840
Your Highness, be careful with your words.

642
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,470
I've already simplified it.

643
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,680
You are the Princess of Fuyu

644
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,230
and the future Princess Consort of Great Tang.

645
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,230
The necessary ornaments cannot be omitted.

646
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,470
But this dress is too tight.

647
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,200
Don't women in Great Tang need to eat?

648
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,230
Your Highness.

649
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,470
The Emperor of Great Tang

650
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,260
personally gifted this dress to you.

651
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,710
Your Highness, we know

652
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,960
you are nervous about
meeting your future husband.

653
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,990
It's okay, we're all here.

654
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,980
Don't be nervous.

655
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,440
Right, Your Highness.

656
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,310
You now look

657
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,350
more magnificent

658
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,310
that our Noble Consort.

659
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,440
You'll outshine all the other women

660
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,340
in Great Tang.

661
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,210
Who is nervous?

662
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,840
This is because

663
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,400
there are too many rules in Great Tang.

664
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,740
I'm just not used to it.

665
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,210
We must be going to the palace.

666
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,660
(Longevity Hall,
Peace in All the World)

667
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,890
I, Liu Changsheng, greet Your Majesty.

668
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,400
Rise.

669
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

670
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,130
Greetings, Your Highness.

671
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,930
Princess Changsheng had a long trip.

672
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,540
I heard that you caught a cold on the road.

673
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,680
Have you gotten better?

674
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,030
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

675
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,210
I'm fine now.

676
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,450
I have already prepared a banquet
in the palace

677
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,510
to welcome you.

678
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,690
Let's talk

679
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,600
when we get to the palace.

680
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,440
Yes.

681
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,130
(Which one is Prince Qin?)

682
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,610
It should be the fat guy.

683
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,100
Probably not.

684
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,850
Or that boy toy.

685
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,920
You're kidding me.

686
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,440
Are you anxious?

687
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,990
(Longevity Hall, Peace in All the World)
Now you're worried about who Prince Qin is.

688
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,650
Is it too late?

689
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,440
Your Majesty.

690
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,840
I represent Fuyu to present you a gift,

691
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,650
wishing you good health and longevity,

692
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,780
and prosperity to Great Tang.

693
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,740
(Picture of Beasts)

694
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,500
Good, good.

695
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,200
I have been searching

696
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,580
for his painting for a long time.

697
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,540
So it was in Fuyu.

698
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,780
Thank you for this.

699
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,650
I like it very much.

700
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,120
Reward them.

701
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

702
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,300
Take a seat.

703
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,170
Prince Qin caught a cold a few days ago.

704
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,790
Today he's lying in bed

705
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,980
and cannot come to welcome you.

706
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
You can see each other in a few days.

707
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,280
Yes.

708
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,850
Princess Changsheng

709
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,590
is the beloved daughter
of Prince Changle of Fuyu.

710
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,750
She traveled a long way to Great Tang
for the peace-making marriage.

711
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,060
Prince Qin got sick before I even arrived.

712
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,480
I'm afraid he's marrying me to dispel bad luck.

713
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,390
Due to physical discomfort...

714
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,110
Alright, you've started
to make things up again.

715
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,130
...and missed the auspicious day.

716
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,880
Today

717
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,690
just think of it as a common meal.

718
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,130
The welcome banquet will be held in a few days.

719
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,230
As for the enthronement ceremony,

720
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,990
we have to wait for Directorate of Astronomy

721
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,300
to choose a good time.

722
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,480
Yes.

723
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,410
Start the banquet.

724
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,480
Jinyan.

725
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,060
Have you seen Yi'an today?

726
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,750
No.

727
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,550
Maybe Prince Qin is not feeling well.

728
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,500
So he's unable to attend.

729
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,750
Mr. Envoy is a close confidant of Prince Qin.

730
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,410
Of course, he stays with him.

731
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,960
Your Highness,

732
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,780
you should care about yourself.

733
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,610
The wedding date is not yet determined.

734
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,690
We might meet Prince Qin tomorrow.

735
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,690
What if he is really as the rumors say?

736
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,780
You're right.

737
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,450
It would be nice if Yi'an was here.

738
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,210
I don't know anyone here.

739
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,070
Let me serve you some food.

740
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,960
You've been tired all day.

741
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,130
Have something to eat.

742
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,130
(I wonder)

743
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,980
(what kind of person is Prince Qin.)

744
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,300
(By now,)

745
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,820
(I have to take it one step at a time.)

746
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,820
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

747
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,680
Your Highness.

748
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,140
Your Highness.

749
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,690
Your Highness.

750
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,610
Your Highness.

751
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,700
Don't stand in the way.

752
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,500
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

753
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,690
Your Highness, please.

754
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,140
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

755
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,190
(Huadeng Pavilion)

756
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,030
Your Highness.

757
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,330
This is the side of the courtyard
of Prince Qin's Mansion,

758
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,800
named Huadeng Pavilion.

759
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,330
It's specially prepared for you.

760
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,210
The wedding ceremony has not yet been held.

761
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,380
So please stay in here for a while.

762
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,880
After officially marrying Prince Qin,

763
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,600
you can move into
the inner courtyard of the mansion.

764
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
His Highness has ordered

765
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,800
you can tell me anytime

766
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,250
if you need anything.

767
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,510
Someone!

768
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,590
I have followed His Highness 's instructions

769
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,860
and dismissed most of the servants
in the mansion.

770
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,110
Only a few stewards, nannies

771
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,070
and cooks are left

772
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,920
to serve you.

773
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,990
You can be comfortable

774
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,250
in this place.

775
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,100
Make yourself at home.

776
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,210
Thank you for

777
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,310
the thoughtful arrangement.

778
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,020
And thank Prince Qin for me too.

779
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,770
I'm a little tired today.

780
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,190
I want to rest first.

781
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,030
Yes.

782
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,500
(Peace and Elegance)

783
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,380
(Prince Qin prepared everything well.)

784
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,980
(Is it really like Yi'an said)

785
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,940
(that he's marriageable?)
