00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,660
=Episode 1=

3
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,040
(Hongluan Pavilion)
The sound of firecrackers quit the old year.

4
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,240
Gongs and drums

5
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,360
welcome the New Year.

6
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,670
On the occasion

7
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
of the annual Spring Festival,

8
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,640
it's not just spring

9
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,590
(Sheng Tiangang, Storyteller)
coming to us,

10
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,150
but also the miserable

11
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
whining

12
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
noises.

13
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,110
When the New Year's bells echo across the land,

14
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,080
a strange thing happened
in the Sun's Mansion of Fuyu.

15
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,480
- Honey, please.
- Honey.

16
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,600
Master, Madam.

17
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,920
It's the visit request letter

18
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,420
for the eldest young master

19
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,270
(Prince Changle's Mansion)

20
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,130
from Princess Changsheng.

21
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,240
What do we do?

22
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,140
(By Liu Changsheng)

23
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,470
Quick.

24
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,390
Pack up our things and leave.

25
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,480
Go, go, go.

26
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,670
- Hurry up.
- Pack up. Quickly.

27
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,160
Who's this Princess Changsheng

28
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
that makes people

29
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,720
run

30
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,960
for their lives?

31
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Keep talking.

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,800
Well, Prince Changle

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,950
has great power and authority.

34
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,070
It's a pity that he has

35
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,430
no children.

36
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,440
But twenty years ago,

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,630
Princess Changsheng was born.

38
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,870
(A Perfect Match)
Legend has it that

39
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,150
whoever admires her

40
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,840
will not end up well.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,920
Nonsense.

42
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
How can we believe it?

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,600
At that time, the people of Fuyu,

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,550
like you, didn't believe it.

45
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,590
But the admirers

46
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,920
all died

47
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,030
one by one.

48
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,550
Take Kang'an Lake for example.

49
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,550
A blind tuner died tragically.

50
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,360
And a widower from the East River.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,280
(Tomb of my beloved wife Wang Qianxue)
Why doesn't he believe in tears of blood?

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,920
The Princess is the reason

53
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,960
behind every sad story

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,080
in Fuyu City.

55
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,920
A storyteller

56
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,430
does know a lot.

57
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,630
In addition to storytelling,

58
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,960
I also know a bit

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,280
about divination and the Eight Diagrams.

60
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
You might as well have a try.

61
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,270
Come on, let me tell your fortune.

62
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,470
Come on.

63
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,920
Try it.

64
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,320
Who's this young master?

65
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,680
So handsome.

66
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,390
Look at his style

67
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,960
and charm.

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,760
He looks just average.

69
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,530
(Liu Changsheng, Princess Changle, Fuyu)
Not as good as me.

70
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,430
You are far worse than him.

71
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,790
Let me tell your fortune.

72
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,730
Come on.

73
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,480
Let me tell your fortune.

74
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,670
Forget it.

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,280
Sheng Tiangang.

76
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,790
Princess Changsheng.

77
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,000
- Princess Changsheng?
- Greetings.

78
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,460
Run, run!

79
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,860
Run!

80
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,690
Run!

81
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,340
Run!

82
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,640
Keep your voice down.

83
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,350
Didn't you see
I'm wearing men's clothing today?

84
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,710
It's to avoid unnecessary trouble.

85
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,350
Yes, yes, you are the biggest trouble.

86
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,150
What did you say?

87
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,440
I said

88
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,430
there's no trouble.

89
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,480
Your Highness, please.

90
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,230
I'm here to support your business.

91
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,710
Just forget it.

92
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,640
- My birth time.
- I...

93
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,120
(Letter of birth)
Your Highness, you've come many times.

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,750
If I could help you, I would have done it.

95
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,760
I've told you everything I should tell you.

96
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,320
Really. Nothing left.

97
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
I don't care.

98
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,640
If I can't get married this year,

99
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,710
I will marry you.

100
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,520
- No.
- Your Highness, watch your words.

101
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,560
Your Highess, watch your actions.

102
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,700
Yes, yes, Your Highness.

103
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,400
You can't threaten me like this.

104
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,310
What?

105
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,550
Am I not

106
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,230
good enough for you?

107
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,230
No, Your Highness.

108
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,230
That was not what I meant.

109
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,470
I mean, I...

110
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,720
You spread the rumors
that it's dangerous to marry me.

111
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,520
- Think of a solution.
- I will.

112
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,030
Let me think.

113
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,150
Your Highness.

114
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,190
Hongluan Pavilion.

115
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,590
Half a month later,
the Marriage Pearl in Hongluan Pavilion

116
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,640
will come onto the market.

117
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,200
According to legend, this Marriage Pearl has

118
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,310
the effect of accelerating marriage.

119
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,110
Why don't we make every possible effort

120
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,470
and give it a try?

121
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,110
(Hongluan Pavilion)
Marriage Pearl? Good.

122
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,430
Don't even mention one Marriage Pearl.

123
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,600
Even if there are ten,

124
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,960
I won't hesitate.

125
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,680
Good.

126
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,350
Very good.

127
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,940
(Longevity Hall, Great Tang)

128
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,890
Prince Qin.

129
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,830
(Lv Jing, Prince of Great Tang)
Entering the palace with armor

130
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,830
is disrespectful.

131
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,480
Please...

132
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,520
This is the sword worn by the King of Yu,

133
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,080
and also a gift from me to Father.

134
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,110
Today is Father's birthday.

135
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,230
I came late.

136
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,720
Please punish me.

137
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,560
Alright.

138
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,600
Punish you severely.

139
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,670
(Lv Shang, King of Great Tang)
I'll make you drink a few more glasses.

140
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,550
Rise.

141
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,440
Thanks, Father.

142
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,520
Lv Jing, how disrespectful.

143
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,900
(Lv Hou, Second Prince of Great Tang)

144
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,310
Father.

145
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,670
This time, Yu was pacified.

146
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,720
We've restored peace

147
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,940
and prosperity.

148
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,530
In the short term, small countries around us
will not dare to cause trouble again.

149
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,660
(Lv Ke, Fifth Prince of Great Tang)
It's a blessing for our Great Tang.

150
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,460
Right.

151
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,960
Jing.

152
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,880
I have something else to discuss with you.

153
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,720
It's related

154
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,790
to Fuyu.

155
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,080
Father, do you want

156
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,350
to follow up the victory

157
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,230
and send troops to conquer Fuyu?

158
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,550
Fuyu sent an envoy

159
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,190
to propose a marriage between us two countries.

160
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,430
Among all my sons,

161
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,280
you're the only one who hasn't married.

162
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,790
Why not take this opportunity

163
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,110
to go to Fuyu

164
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,430
and investigate the country,

165
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,880
disguised as an envoy?

166
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,920
I am willing to go to Fuyu

167
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,080
as a pretended envoy.

168
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,320
I'll set off immediately.

169
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,220
(Half a month later)

170
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,840
Everyone,

171
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,470
open your eyes.

172
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,280
Crystal clear.

173
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,430
This is

174
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,550
the most precious treasure
of Hongluan Pavilion, Marriage Pearl.

175
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,150
The bidding

176
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,230
starts now.

177
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,720
I'll give you fifty taels.

178
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,790
Good, fifty taels.

179
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,200
- Eighty taels.
- Eighty taels.

180
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,990
- One hundred taels.
- Mr. Beard offered 100 taels.

181
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,160
Do you have one hundred taels?

182
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,790
Is there a higher bidder?

183
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,230
One hundred and one taels.

184
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,640
Mr. Xiao is here.

185
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,560
(Xiao Zilv, Third Young Master)
Isn't this Mr. Xiao Zilv?

186
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,030
He is indeed the most talented person in Fuyu.

187
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,830
Xiao Zilv, a gentleman
doesn't stand in people's way.

188
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,590
Stop making trouble.

189
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,080
Mr. Xiao offered 101 taels.

190
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,430
- Anyone else?
- One hundred and fifty taels.

191
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,600
One hundred and fifty taels.

192
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,670
One hundred fifty-one taels.

193
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,660
- Mr. Xiao
- But I'm not a gentleman.

194
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,060
offered one hundred fifty-one taels.

195
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,520
- Two hundred taels.
- Two hundred and one taels.

196
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,430
Two hundred and fifty taels.

197
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,720
Two hundred and fifty-one taels.

198
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,750
Mr. Xiao offered 251 taels.

199
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,550
Three hundred taels.

200
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,400
- Three hundred taels can buy a house.
- Good.

201
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,240
- Yes.
- Any more bidders?

202
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,790
Three hundred taels goes once.

203
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,120
Three hundred taels goes twice.

204
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,280
Three hundred taels goes thrice.

205
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,120
Sold.

206
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,600
Congratulations.
Mr. Beard, please come to the stage.

207
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,880
Please.

208
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,670
Please, sir.

209
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,960
Congratulations.

210
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,550
Congratulations on getting the pearl.

211
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,030
Congratulations.

212
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,160
Fuyu is small.

213
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,000
But the people live and work

214
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
in peace and contentment.

215
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,480
Your Highness, look.

216
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,400
Young Master, look there.

217
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,430
(Hongluan Pavilion)

218
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,830
This time we came to Fuyu under the disguise
of the peace-making marriage.

219
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,280
But in fact, we're spying on intelligence.

220
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,070
Never reveal our true identity.

221
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,240
Princess Changsheng is indeed generous.

222
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,000
I admit defeat.

223
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,200
Did I hear wrong?

224
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
How come I heard Princess Changsheng?

225
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,070
Mr. Xiao has known
Princess Changsheng since childhood.

226
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,480
He will never mistake her.

227
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,430
He... He is Princess Changsheng!

228
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,760
- Run!
- No, no.

229
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,830
I'd better go back first.

230
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,630
Bad luck.

231
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,420
(Hongluan Pavilion)

232
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,430
Young Master, be careful.

233
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,070
We shouldn't be careful

234
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,150
of that place,

235
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,280
but there.

236
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,000
Xiaoke.

237
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,910
Sorry for frightening you.

238
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,240
Jinyan, Shenxing.

239
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,520
Let's go.

240
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,280
Your Highness, where are we going?

241
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,480
Looking for my love.

242
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,980
(Hongluan Pavilion)

243
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,360
Don't be afraid.

244
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,430
My marriage.

245
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,670
Careful.

246
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,000
Thanks.

247
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,600
Young Master.

248
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,640
- Young Master, are you okay?
- Young Master.

249
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,240
Your hand is bleeding.

250
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,080
Changsheng.

251
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,640
- Is your hand okay?
- This is not a place to dawdle.

252
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,710
- Let's go quickly.
- Xiao Zilv.

253
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,920
Congratulations to Your Highness.

254
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,280
Congratulations.

255
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,880
The pearl is broken.

256
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,950
The marriage is over.

257
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,870
My hand is injured too.
Why are you congratulating me?

258
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,550
No, no.

259
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,310
Your Highness, you don't know.

260
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,710
Even the pearl may not

261
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,550
help with your marriage.

262
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,640
But just now in the accident,

263
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,590
a scar

264
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,360
appeared out of nowhere in your palm.

265
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,360
This indicates there's a glimmer of hope

266
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,710
for your marriage, Your Highness.

267
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,550
I believe that soon,

268
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,750
good news will be heard

269
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,310
from Prince Changle's Mansion.

270
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,430
Good news.

271
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,470
Right?

272
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,760
Good news?

273
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,150
Good news.

274
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,980
(Yuguan Posthouse)

275
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,830
Sir.

276
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,160
Did they confess?

277
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,000
No.

278
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,120
They are tight-lipped.

279
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,600
We used all kinds of punishment.

280
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,470
Some couldn't stand it,

281
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,360
and...

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,840
Open the door.

283
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,120
Who sent you here?

284
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't want to say it, right?

285
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,310
Will you say it?

286
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,830
Sir.

287
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,950
Prince Qin.

288
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,720
You can kill me if you want.

289
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,030
I won't say anything.

290
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,760
No rush.

291
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,670
You'll be rushing to talk in a moment.

292
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,670
We brothers

293
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,550
are not afraid of death.

294
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,790
Prince Qin.

295
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,520
What kind of torture do you have?

296
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,950
Use them all.

297
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,550
We can

298
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,190
stand them.

299
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,550
Can you?

300
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,310
Speaking of which,

301
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,070
I'm a little hungry.

302
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,270
Bring it.

303
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,000
Now in the cold winter,

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,830
it's time to eat barbecue.

305
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,430
You said before

306
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,790
you'd received all kinds of punishment.

307
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,150
Have you heard

308
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,430
someone's feet were cut off,

309
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,000
and dragged by people

310
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,670
to walk back and forth

311
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,120
on this red-hot iron plate?

312
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,070
Walk a few steps

313
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,430
and your bones will be roasted.

314
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Don't think

315
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,790
we'd confess under torture.

316
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,480
We've endured

317
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,400
all the sufferings.

318
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,430
Then

319
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,760
what about the pain
of having your whole family exterminated?

320
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,760
What do you mean?

321
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,670
If I kill you directly,

322
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,280
then send your body back to Great Tang,

323
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,590
someone will naturally
get rid of your relatives

324
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,240
to avoid future trouble.

325
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

326
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,500
We are not from Great Tang.

327
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,950
You're not from Great Tang?

328
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,150
You just called me Prince Qin.

329
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,670
But I came here as an envoy.

330
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,030
No one knows my background in Fuyu.

331
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,520
According to your accent,

332
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,880
I knew you were from Hedong.

333
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,520
You might as well take a guess.

334
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,120
If I send your body back to Great Tang,

335
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,070
when will your family

336
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,760
come and claim it?

337
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,830
And how many days will it take

338
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,490
to kill all of them?

339
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,030
I'll tell you.

340
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,400
I'll tell you everything.

341
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,830
One person

342
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,070
is enough to talk.

343
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,910
Yes.

344
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,070
Sir.

345
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,960
It seems that someone wants to cause trouble

346
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,830
during your trip in Fuyu.

347
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,000
I just arrived at Fuyu.

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,790
But Great Tang couldn't wait any longer.

349
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
What are you going to do next, sir?

350
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,520
It is easy to dodge a direct attack
but hard to guard against a hidden arrow.

351
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,570
We have to hurry up

352
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,600
to spy on Fuyu.

353
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,480
Yes.

354
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,670
Didn't I just draw a picture a few days ago?

355
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,830
Why are you here again?

356
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
I'm tired to death.

357
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,670
Your Highness, watch your words.

358
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,040
How can matters of life and death be spoken of?

359
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,280
This is not what a lady
from a noble family would do.

360
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,920
Your Highness, watch your actions.

361
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,800
You should always

362
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,670
look dignified.

363
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,430
Act like a lady from a rich family.

364
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,360
You're repeating

365
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,000
the same things over and over again.

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,670
Even if you are not tired, I am tired.

367
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,760
Your Highness.

368
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,070
Your Highness, bad news.

369
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,670
There's news from Muyan Forest,

370
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,000
saying someone fell from a tree.

371
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,720
He hasn't woken up yet.

372
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,070
Your Highness.

373
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,240
The goods sent by Boss Zhang

374
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,470
are ten pounds short.

375
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,520
Your Highness.

376
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,950
Your Highness, the eagle is not eating again.

377
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,630
The kitchen said the market
is out of river shrimps.

378
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,680
There is a discrepancy in the accounts
of the seriflux factory.

379
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,830
The servant accidentally

380
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,230
broke Princess Consort's vase.

381
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,910
Should the lunch dishes be changed?

382
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,160
Go to Jimin Pharmacy and find Doctor Gongsun.

383
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,520
Let him go get treated immediately.

384
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,190
No matter what the result is,

385
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,880
our mansion will be responsible.

386
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,720
Yes.

387
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,470
Remember this.

388
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,560
Four ounces of beef and four ounces of mutton.

389
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,750
Two ounces of sesame oil.

390
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,230
Mix them together and mash them

391
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,440
into fingernail-sized meatballs.

392
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,430
Feed the eagle again then.

393
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,280
Yes.

394
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,120
Let's change it to West Lake beef soup.

395
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,960
Yes.

396
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,710
It's Liu Neng.

397
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,070
I have been observing him for a long time.

398
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,950
Ask him to return the money

399
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,990
and

400
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,080
flog him twenty times.

401
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,180
Give him some money for treatment

402
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,160
and then send him home.

403
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes.

404
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,360
Go to the west of the city to find Mr. Sun

405
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,540
and make a fake.

406
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,120
Put it there before
Princess Consort comes back.

407
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes.

408
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,950
Cut the price in half.

409
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,800
If there is a next time,

410
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,160
send him to the officials for inspection.

411
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,550
Yes.

412
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,920
Your Highness.

413
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,080
You have been drawing for a long time.

414
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,960
Let's take a break.

415
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,800
Go.

416
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,300
(Imperial Palace, Fuyu)

417
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Good news.

418
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,120
Definitely good news.

419
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,510
Great Tang already agreed

420
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,360
to ally with us

421
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,470
(Liu Shao, Prince Changle, Fuyu)
through marriage.

422
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,080
(Liu Yu, Emperor of Fuyu)
I have seen the envoy

423
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,440
and given them the book
of drawings of the women

424
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,760
of marriageable age.

425
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,360
This year, Changsheng

426
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,670
is turning twenty, right?

427
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,640
One month left.

428
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
It does not matter.

429
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,920
The thing is, do you want
to keep her by your side forever

430
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,840
and not let her get married?

431
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,790
She'll be a laughing stock.

432
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,360
Changsheng

433
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,710
is difficult to marry.

434
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,320
The whole city knows about it.

435
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,600
Since currently

436
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,800
we're just choosing an alternative...

437
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,430
Let's choose her.

438
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,080
Changsheng is hard to get married,
everyone knows it.

439
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,160
She is not preferring to be alone.

440
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,190
She can't get married at all.

441
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,230
The peace-making marriage

442
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,670
can not only marry her off,

443
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,790
also,

444
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,080
if we go to war,

445
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,310
she can help us deal with Great Tang.

446
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,840
Isn't this a win-win solution?

447
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,880
Brother...

448
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,840
It's a deal.

449
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,390
This is also Changsheng's honor.

450
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,920
Next,

451
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,950
this envoy should live in your mansion.

452
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,270
You and Changsheng

453
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,230
will receive him.

454
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,200
- Brother.
- Accept it.

455
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,070
I

456
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,480
accept the command.

457
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,230
Your Highness,
your destined man is about to appear.

458
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,680
Why are you so depressed?

459
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,470
I'm thinking

460
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,070
how to seize the opportunity.

461
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,470
I can't just sit there

462
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,070
and wait for him to come to me.

463
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,750
Why don't we

464
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,120
throw the embroidered ball again?

465
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,950
We've done it 103 times.

466
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,560
Every time I wanted to throw,

467
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,030
they fled in all directions.

468
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,070
It's like I was throwing a fireball.

469
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,320
Otherwise we can

470
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,360
hold a contest for marriage.

471
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,220
Yes, the contest.

472
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,160
It's been held 43 times.

473
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,270
I hadn't made a move yet,

474
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,870
and they were knocked off the stage
by my inner force.

475
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,000
Changsheng.

476
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,710
- Changsheng.
- Dad.

477
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,830
I'm here.

478
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,390
Dad, take a seat.

479
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,680
Why are you so flustered?

480
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,920
I have good news

481
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,320
and also bad news.

482
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,630
Which one do you want to hear?

483
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,990
Good news.

484
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,990
Your marriage

485
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,160
is going to be settled.

486
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,520
My destined man came to me himself.

487
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,630
Oh my god.

488
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,310
I haven't found a husband for years.

489
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,320
Today, he came to my door.

490
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,640
Changsheng.

491
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,230
You should listen to

492
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,270
the bad news as well.

493
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,530
His Majesty wants you to be
a candidate for the peace-making marriage.

494
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,200
With Prince Qin of Great Tang.

495
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,160
Peace-making marriage?

496
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,720
Not bad either.

497
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,990
Although the distance is far,

498
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,400
the transportation is convenient.

499
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,790
I can still come back to see you often.

500
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,080
This Prince Qin,

501
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,120
well,

502
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,960
how does he look?
What is he like? How old is he?

503
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,440
Prince Qin is said to

504
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,720
look like Zhong Kui

505
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,880
with a very bad character.

506
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,750
The most terrible thing

507
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,030
is he's cold-blooded.

508
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,430
All in all,

509
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,880
all the words added up

510
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,510
are hard to describe him.

511
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,560
This Sheng Tiangang

512
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,830
is really unreliable.

513
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,390
Dad.

514
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,080
Can you refuse that?

515
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,710
The imperial decree hasn't been released.

516
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,280
There may be room for maneuver.

517
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,430
But His Majesty arranged for us
to receive them.

518
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,230
Soon this envoy of Great Tang

519
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,990
will be living in our mansion.

520
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,670
From what I know about him,

521
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,920
he may want to let the envoy and you

522
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,880
make more contact

523
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,480
to find out their background.

524
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,670
It's all

525
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,920
the grace of the Emperor.

526
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Since His Majesty has made this arrangement,

527
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,830
then I will perform well.

528
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,820
(Prince Changle's Mansion)

529
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,940
(Self-discipline and Social Commitment)

530
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,920
Your Highness.

531
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,230
How are you going to perform in a while?

532
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,990
Otherwise I'll find some soot
to wipe on your face.

533
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,670
Easy for you to say.

534
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,390
I am the famous beauty in Fuyu.

535
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,710
Make a fool of myself?

536
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,790
Will anyone believe it?

537
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,830
Your Highness, firecrackers are used up.

538
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,680
Use double-bang firecrackers.

539
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,710
Will it be too...

540
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,800
Just listen to me.

541
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,640
Yes.

542
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,550
Your Highness, watch your actions.

543
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,120
After thinking it through,

544
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,480
this is how I decided to act.

545
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,510
Didn't you ask me

546
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,830
whether I figured out a solution?

547
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,870
This is my solution.

548
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,400
I want the envoy to be

549
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,750
very disappointed in me

550
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,030
and ask to change the candidate.

551
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,270
Your Highness, you're smart.

552
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,960
Your Highness.

553
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,880
The red silk in the warehouse
is not enough for decoration.

554
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,080
Someone has already went to buy it.

555
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,230
But it is still the New Year.

556
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,990
I'm afraid we still can't get enough.

557
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,980
There are not enough flowers too,
Your Highness.

558
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,070
Should we use Longjing

559
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,630
or Tianshan snow chrysanthemum
to prepare tea?

560
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,470
Your Highness, bad news.

561
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,730
The gold-inlaid Jade Ruyi,
which's supposed to be the gift to the envoy,

562
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,370
just has been

563
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,750
broken by Princess Consort.

564
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,960
There's nothing like it in the mansion.

565
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,000
What to do now?

566
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,920
(Self-discipline and Social Commitment)

567
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,950
Your Highness, His Royal Highness and the envoy

568
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,280
are already at the street corner.

569
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,640
Take out last year's red silk.

570
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,590
Use it if it's not enough.

571
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,470
If there aren't enough flowers,

572
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,680
replace them with green plants.

573
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,440
Neither of the two you mentioned.

574
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,080
Replace it

575
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
with Lu'an Melon Seed tea,

576
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,480
which represents peace and prosperity.

577
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,710
Go to the warehouse

578
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,160
to get a random gift,

579
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,360
not an expensive one.

580
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,630
But be careful.

581
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,360
Although I want the envoy

582
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,600
to dislike me,

583
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,790
we can't lose Fuyu's face.

584
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,670
Your Highness.

585
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,630
Go now.

586
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,480
Yes.

587
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,220
(Self-discipline and Social Commitment)

588
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,000
Your Highness, by doing these,

589
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,400
I'm afraid the envoy won't choose you.

590
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,270
Your Highness.

591
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,870
His Royal Highness has returned with the envoy.

592
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,000
Let's go.

593
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,960
Greetings, Mr. Envoy.

594
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,110
No need for formalities.

595
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,350
It's you.

596
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,620
(How could it be him?)

597
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,280
Changsheng, come.

598
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,840
Why is this silk old?

599
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,480
And it's wrinkled.

600
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,800
Mr. Envoy made a sudden visit.

601
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,440
There is not enough silk at home.

602
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,110
I think you don't mind.

603
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,960
I don't.

604
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,160
I hate bright red the most.

605
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,240
The dark red color of this old silk

606
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,990
is excellent.

607
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,310
Good that you like it.

608
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,750
There are no flowers at home.

609
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,950
I switched them to green plants.

610
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,400
I hate flowers.

611
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,830
Your Highness is thoughtful.

612
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,960
Mr. Envoy, please.

613
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,160
Please take a seat, Mr. Envoy.

614
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,030
In the following days,

615
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,880
you can stay in my house temporarily.

616
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,990
If you need anything,

617
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,920
just tell Liu Changsheng.

618
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,280
I will.

619
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,480
Serve tea.

620
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,830
Please have some tea.

621
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,950
The food is bland and the tea is coarse.

622
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,830
I guess you're not used to drinking it.

623
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,030
This is Lu'an Melon Seed tea.

624
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,200
Exactly.

625
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,760
Nonsense.

626
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,840
Go get my Tianshan snow chrysanthemum

627
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,560
and West Lake Longjing tea.

628
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,400
No need.

629
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,000
My favorite drink is Lu'an Melon Seed tea.

630
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,670
Your Highness knows

631
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,120
the preferences of an envoy so much

632
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,430
even you've never stepped out of the house.

633
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,550
It's just perfect.

634
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,230
After marrying Prince Qin,

635
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,360
you'll be a good wife.

636
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,200
I...

637
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,030
Mr. Envoy, you are overpraising me.

638
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,680
Let's have the meal.

639
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,900
(Looking for Heron)

640
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,080
All the efforts are in vain.

641
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,590
Unexpectedly, the envoy likes you.

642
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,680
Young Master.

643
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,760
Your Highness.

644
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,030
Mr. Envoy.

645
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,920
Your Highness, call me Yi'an.

646
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,120
I was being rude.

647
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,070
Previously on the street,

648
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,190
I offended you.

649
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,270
Today in the mansion,

650
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,350
I didn't welcome you well.

651
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,320
I am born

652
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,950
to be reckless.

653
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,920
Please forgive me.

654
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,920
You're considerate.

655
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,120
You've even prepared

656
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,350
my favorite drink.

657
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,230
How come you're reckless?

658
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,270
When you saw the old silk,

659
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,840
you clearly frowned.

660
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,870
It shows you don't like any old things.

661
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,230
You said you only drink Lu'an Melon Seed tea,

662
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,360
but only when cooked

663
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,470
with boiling water

664
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,790
will its color and taste appear.

665
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,600
But I

666
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,790
used warm water.

667
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,400
With your identity,

668
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,160
if you only drink this tea,

669
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,560
how can you not tell?

670
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,400
Your Highness is perceptive

671
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,350
and thoughtful.

672
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,800
I will definitely put in a good word for you

673
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,920
in front of Prince Qin.

674
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,070
You'll need to stay in the mansion

675
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,280
for a few days.

676
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,470
It's better to observe more.

677
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,510
Your Highness, are you

678
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,230
trying to get my attention

679
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,030
so you can marry into Great Tang?

680
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,430
Your understanding

681
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,270
is a little different from ordinary people's.

682
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,400
Many people say that
I can comprehend by analogy

683
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,160
and understand the truth behind things.

684
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,270
Well then,

685
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,160
I'm here.

686
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,120
Sir, I have something else to do.

687
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,280
I'll leave first.

688
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,950
This Princess Changsheng

689
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,310
is scrupulous.

690
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,160
If you are received by her...

691
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,350
I think this princess is good.

692
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,110
Just marry her.

693
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,840
Sir, the spy we sent

694
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,990
is already stationed in the city.

695
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,000
The previous assassin has been taken
back to the secret room,

696
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,130
waiting for your interrogation.

697
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,700
(Xiao's Mansion)

698
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,860
(Xiao Jin, Sixth Young Lady)

699
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,270
I'm furious.

700
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,230
This envoy from Great Tang

701
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,680
is really so abominable.

702
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,920
Right.

703
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,430
Then I'll help you scold him, okay?

704
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,680
Don't be angry.

705
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,000
Stinky turtle, bad thing.

706
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,430
Jin.

707
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,440
You are the best.

708
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,190
But cursing people

709
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,510
is hard for you.

710
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,280
You should continue to be a good girl.

711
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,360
By the way,

712
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,230
I heard that you and Xie Lin have settled down.

713
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,840
He returned to the capital
to report on his work.

714
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,110
Probably he won't leave.

715
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,160
By the way, I asked him to bring you something.

716
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,030
After you see it,

717
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,280
you'll be happy.

718
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,070
The Great Lord of Fate by Qu Yuan.

719
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,500
(The Great Lord of Fate, Nine Songs)

720
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,800
Thank you, Jin.

721
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,310
I will definitely treasure it.

722
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,870
This is a handwritten copy
by a famous calligrapher and painter.

723
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
The original copy

724
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,830
should only be available in Great Tang.

725
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,550
Great Tang again.

726
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,640
Young Lady.

727
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,230
Young Master Xiao is here.

728
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,200
Let him in.

729
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,080
Jin, it's getting late, I'll go back first.

730
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,160
What are you in a hurry for?

731
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,230
Stay with me.

732
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,270
Your Highness.

733
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,390
Why leave?

734
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,230
I can't catch up with you.

735
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,110
Zilv.

736
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,400
Young Master Xiao.

737
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,960
You like to collect

738
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,120
rare manuscripts.

739
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,950
Is it because of fate?

740
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,600
I heard that your love life is not good.

741
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,560
But you're a special lady.

742
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,440
I'm afraid that the precious jade

743
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,950
will be covered in dust.

744
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,960
Xiao Zilv.

745
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,800
Don't push your luck.

746
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,560
Last time you raised the price
of the Marriage Pearl

747
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,740
and cost me a lot of money.

748
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,840
Finally, it was broken.

749
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,320
I haven't settled accounts with you yet.

750
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,270
I was wrong. I was wrong.

751
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,290
I was really wrong.

752
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,880
There is nothing better than knowing

753
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,470
and correcting a mistake.

754
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,160
Your Highness, now your luck changed.

755
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,190
I heard that you're

756
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,360
getting married to make peace.

757
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,430
It is Fuyu's great blessing.

758
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,370
What did you say?

759
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,900
Your Highness will marry into a place far away.

760
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,320
All the men in Fuyu don't have to worry about
marrying you anymore.

761
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,510
Isn't it a great blessing?

762
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,350
You...

763
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,840
Alright.

764
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,750
Why are you two

765
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,110
arguing again?

766
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,270
For Jin's sake,

767
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,160
I'll let you go.

768
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,550
Jin, I'll go back first.

769
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,470
If you don't want to marry far away,

770
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,670
it's simple.

771
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,520
Really?

772
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,720
Tell me quickly.

773
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,800
Before the peace-making marriage,

774
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,240
you just get married first.

775
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,190
I want to get married.

776
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,190
Will you marry me?

777
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,350
It's not impossible.

778
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,480
You wish.

779
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,110
She rejected me.

780
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,590
Did you hear? She rejected me.

781
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,400
I can't hear. I can't hear.

782
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,720
You deserve to marry far away.

783
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,320
It's good that someone wants to marry you.

784
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,790
How come you're so picky?

785
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Your Highness, it's getting late.

786
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,630
I will help you get changed
and go to bed early.

787
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,030
Your Highness.

788
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,750
I'm thinking about what

789
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,790
Xiao Zilv told me today.

790
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,750
It's a solution.

791
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,720
What did he say?

792
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,240
Get married.

793
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,640
His Majesty won't force me,

794
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,480
a married woman, to get married again.

795
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,280
Although His Majesty did not issue an decree,

796
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,880
his intention

797
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,350
is known to all.

798
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,030
Besides, your reputation is...

799
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,600
Now

800
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,950
who else dares to marry you?

801
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,590
There are always a few
who are not afraid of death...

802
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,920
No.

803
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,160
There are always a few

804
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,920
who aren't afraid of power

805
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,870
and are willing to take risks.

806
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,160
I don't care.

807
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,120
I've made up my mind.

808
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,190
But...

809
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,550
You don't need to persuade me.

810
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,790
I'll take a bath and get changed.

811
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,160
Xiaoke.

812
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,000
You guys leave me first.

813
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,520
I want to be alone for a while.

814
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,680
Xiaoke.

815
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,360
So you are here.

816
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,920
(Mr. Envoy?)

817
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,000
Come out.

818
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,600
Don't force me to go in.

819
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
I'm very rude.

820
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,640
(He is coming in.)

821
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,110
If you push me,

822
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,710
I can do anything.

823
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,710
(What is he going to do?)

824
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,270
Better come out on your own.

825
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,830
Otherwise you will be in trouble later.

826
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,590
Come out.
