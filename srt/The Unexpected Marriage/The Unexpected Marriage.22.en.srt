(Imperial Study)

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,200
Jing.

5
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,560
You came back.

6
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,100
God really bless Great Tang.

7
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,350
If something really happened to you,

8
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,750
I

9
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,970
don't even know what to do.

10
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,910
I'm fine.

11
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,560
I

12
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,080
have already prepared the decree

13
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,870
to give the title of Prince Qin back to you

14
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,500
and the Langhuan jade talisman.

15
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,780
It's the same as the Crown Prince.

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,500
The locusts have gone.

17
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,050
You'll still be in charge

18
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,660
of the disaster relief.

19
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,750
Thank you, Father.

20
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,010
Brother.

21
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,540
I think Jing was assassinated this time

22
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,640
- because...
- Wan.

23
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,940
Xiuwen Hall has a lot of work to do.

24
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,590
You better go back first.

25
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,870
I still have something to say to Jing.

26
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,080
Yes.

27
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,030
I will take my leave.

28
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,400
Jing.

29
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,150
I want to talk to you

30
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,220
about Changsheng.

31
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,310
I'm all ears.

32
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,430
I know

33
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,540
you and Changsheng are in love.

34
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,100
But you have a bright future ahead.

35
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,700
The people around you

36
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,430
are also particularly important.

37
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,560
Changsheng's character

38
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,870
and rumor...

39
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,430
Father, Changsheng is innocent and lively,

40
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,770
intelligent,

41
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,080
compassionate,

42
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,920
and upright.

43
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
I'm very

44
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,700
- satisfied with her.
- But

45
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,730
do you know what people

46
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,090
say about her?

47
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,430
That's all groundless talk.

48
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,350
Aren't I standing here perfectly fine?

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,310
I don't believe those rumors.

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,960
But how could such a person

51
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,750
be the mistress of the harem?

52
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,380
I can give up on my future.

53
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,030
But I can't live without Changsheng.

54
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,190
Forget it.

55
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,700
What will be will be.

56
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,750
Now that you have decided,

57
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,900
I will respect your choice.

58
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,020
Thank you, Father.

59
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,140
He actually came back unscathed.

60
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,200
Be gentle.

61
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,930
Your Highness.

62
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,190
Jing

63
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,580
is really lucky.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,500
He even warded off death.

65
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,130
Lucky?

66
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,550
I want to see how many lives he has.

67
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,260
If I can't take revenge,

68
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,870
I can't vent my hatred.

69
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,570
Your Highness.

70
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,570
How about

71
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,380
we stop fighting?

72
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,430
I just want you to be safe.

73
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,940
No matter who you are,

74
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,630
I will always stay with you.

75
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,820
Do you think we have a way out?

76
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,200
Misappropriation of public grain,

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,230
murder the prince,

78
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,610
and collusion with powerful officials.

79
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,760
How can we turn back

80
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,970
at this point?

81
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,810
We can.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,120
As long as you are willing to,

83
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,500
I will definitely find a way.

84
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,900
You better use the time

85
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,160
to think of a way

86
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,380
of getting rid of Lv Jing.

87
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,600
But...

88
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,330
Get out.

89
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,290
You're injured.

90
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,190
Don't get angry.

91
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,750
Rest early.

92
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,630
I'll leave now.

93
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,250
Lv Jing.

94
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,500
I don't care whether you are

95
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,990
the reincarnation of a god.

96
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,230
I will take revenge

97
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,230
no matter what.

98
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,420
(Huadeng Pavilion)

99
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,160
Your Highness.

100
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,200
His Highness is here.

101
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,280

114
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,610
Where on earth did you go?

115
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,940
That day I fell off a cliff,

116
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,140
but fortunately, the vine caught me.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,010
I followed the current

118
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,070
down the river

119
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,580
and ended up in a small town near Great Tang.

120
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,130
In there,

121
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,210
I found that there was someone

122
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,110
deliberately delaying
the arrival of locust plague.

123
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,770
For this,

124
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,670
they even used 10% of the food.

125
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,040
Presumably

126
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,550
the person behind this

127
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,070
is your fifth brother.

128
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,150
Disaster caused by nature

129
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,700
can be forgiven.

130
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,150
Disaster caused by human beings
can't be forgiven.

131
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,810
It's a pity that the people involved

132
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,650
are all gone.

133
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,220
I didn't find any evidence.

134
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,810
I was worried you'd get bullied

135
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,650
alone in Great Tang,

136
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,430
so I hurried back.

137
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,790
Fortunately, I came back in time.

138
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,940
Otherwise, we wouldn't
be able to see each other.

139
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,340
His Majesty has restored your title.

140
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,050
I guess soon

141
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,670
you'll have your military power back.

142
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,440
Changsheng.

143
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
I never

144
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,860
cared about these.

145
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,340
I know.

146
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,910
But these

147
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,670
can help you

148
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,460
accomplish things you care about.

149
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,850
Changsheng.

150
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,100
In this world,

151
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,100
what I care about most

152
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,440
is you.

153
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,890
Your Highness.

154
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,340
Ru Jing wants to see you.

155
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,340
I'll be back soon.

156
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,620
(Huadeng Pavilion)

157
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,930
Your Highness, I heard you returned safely,

158
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,940
so I hurried over.

159
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,530
I feel relieved

160
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,580
seeing you're fine.

161
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,850
Thank you.

162
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,240
Your Highness, you...

163
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,080
Miss Ru Jing.

164
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,340
When are you planning to return?

165
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,460
Thanks to you

166
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,880
and Mr. Huaishan's help,

167
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,340
we alleviated the locust plague.

168
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,820
I heard that Mr. Huaishan had returned.

169
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,790
What are your plans?

170
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,400
I...

171
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,100
I'm not going to leave.

172
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,720
Then I'll find a place

173
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,740
for you to live.

174
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,510
You've been wandering outside for a long time.

175
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,980
You need a home.

176
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,410
Whatever you say.

177
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,190
I'm just busy these days.

178
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,820
I'll ask my wife to arrange it.

179
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,340
She has a keen eye for people.

180
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,340
She'll definitely find a good match for you.

181
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,670
Good match?

182
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,440
I don't want a good match.

183
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,820
I just want to be with you,

184
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,160
even if

185
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,480
without a status.

186
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,390
You must be joking.

187
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,620
I've always treated you as my sister.

188
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,530
I don't want to be your sister.

189
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,370
If you don't,

190
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,440
then we're friends.

191
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,580
If we can't even be friends,

192
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,580
then we can only be strangers.

193
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,510
What's so good about Liu Changsheng?

194
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,620
How am I inferior to her?

195
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,940
My wife

196
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,400
is great in every aspect.

197
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,430
So my heart has no room for other people.

198
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,790
It's hard to compare.

199
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,610
It's getting late.

200
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,510
My wife got frightened today.

201
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,100
I need to stay with her.

202
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,430
You should rest earlier.

203
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,340
(Youlan Pavilion)

204
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,030
With her,

205
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,940
you won't even look at others.

206
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,980
I can't beat her

207
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,150
in this regard alone.

208
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,260
(Prince Lu's Mansion)

209
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,400
Your Highness.

210
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,030
Your Highness, Prince Qin is here.

211
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,160
Let him in.

212
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,130
Yes.

213
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,940
(Cyan Mountains)

214
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,820
You're here, Jing.

215
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,570
Are your injuries

216
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,410
getting better?

217
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,390
Thank you for your concern.

218
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,250
His Highness's injuries

219
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,460
are no longer serious.

220
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,510
Not serious?

221
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,030
So I was too gentle with you.

222
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,340
This is just a lesson.

223
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,560
I hope you

224
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,980
won't forget the pain

225
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,740
once the wound is healed.

226
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,910
I remembered.

227
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,320
I came this time

228
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,700
to collect the token on the order of Father

229
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,760
and the 10% of food

230
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,820
you promised to donate.

231
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,980
You don't have to come in person.

232
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,820
I'll have someone send it to your house.

233
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,580
Then I'll go back home and wait.

234
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,510
I hope you can deliver it on time.

235
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,150
Otherwise, it would be disobedience.

236
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,940
You know best the consequences.

237
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,030
As soon as he came back,

238
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,190
Father gave him the title back.

239
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,270
Now he came to show off his power again.

240
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:25,890
It seems

241
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,030
he doesn't want to let it pass.

242
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,190
Your Highness, calm down.

243
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,290
I think Jing

244
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,700
doesn't want to pursue it.

245
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,860
What do you know?

246
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,220
Please calm down, Your Highness.

247
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,460
You only say this all day long.

248
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,010
Get out.

249
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,770
Yes.

250
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,220
(Luojing)

251
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,580
(Notes on Preventing Locusts)

252
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,390
What do you think?

253
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Open the granary-grain

254
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,860
and reassure the people.

255
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,130
(The day you were assassinated,)

256
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,030
(and your life was uncertain,)

257
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,550
(but I believed you'd come back.)

258
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,030
(So we hid 40% of the food)

259
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,580
(to prevent Lv Ke from causing trouble.)

260
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,580
(Now the plague of locusts is over,)

261
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,390
(we should distribute the food
as soon as possible)

262
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,890
(and save the people)

263
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,930
(from hunger.)

264
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,800
Thank you.

265
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,640
Thanks.

266
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,340
- Thank you.
- (That's what I meant.)

267
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,700
(I already sent Youyong and Youmou
to work on it.)

268
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,700
(Tomorrow, we will distribute the food.)

269
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,670
It's a deal.

270
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,220
Fermented glutinous rice dumpling.

271
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,110
Fermented glutinous rice dumpling.

272
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,700
Sugarcoated haws.

273
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,320
Sugarcoated haws.

274
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,560
Here you are.

275
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,400
Thanks.

276
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,060
(Good Luck and Good Fortune)

277
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,460
The locust plague has been over
for half a month.

278
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,620
Life also stabilized.

279
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,270
Jing made a great contribution
to disaster relief.

280
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,610
Come on.

281
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,100
Let's toast to Prince Qin.

282
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,130
It's said that

283
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,190
first thrive and then wive.

284
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,820
By my calculations,

285
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,220
Jing's wedding

286
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,190
is in seven days.

287
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,740
You are busy,

288
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,340
and I am not idle either.

289
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,910
I'm preparing your wedding

290
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,150
with Directorate of Astronomy.

291
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
By then,

292
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,510
I want to give you a generous gift.

293
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,700
Thanks, Father.

294
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,270
Jing, sit down.

295
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm happy today.

296
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,270
Let's tell a story

297
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,220
and experience the joy of ordinary people.

298
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,310
What do you think?

299
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,030
Once upon a time,

300
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,030
there is a family.

301
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,150
The father is old.

302
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,390
And he has

303
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,310
three sons also.

304
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,440
The three sons have

305
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,580
very different personalities.

306
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,180
The eldest son is stupid

307
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,710
but kind-hearted.

308
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,900
He just

309
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,420
likes to freeload.

310
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,850
The second son

311
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,280
is clever and quick-witted.

312
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,380
He's decisive,

313
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,880
like his father,

314
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,550
both brave and resourceful.

315
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,910
It's me.

316
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,770
Not you.

317
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,800
Listen carefully.

318
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,620
It's so obvious.

319
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,240
As if we can't understand it.

320
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,580
The third son,

321
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,710
also the youngest son,

322
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,140
is a bit radical.

323
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,330
The father pays more attention

324
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,580
to the two elder brothers

325
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,750
and the third child is somewhat neglected.

326
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,990
When the father wants to make up for it,

327
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,230
it's already too late.

328
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,140
After all, the yongest son made a mistake.

329
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,130
The father knows that he is old

330
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,550
and can't manage the house for long,

331
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,230
so he feels pretty Zen

332
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,820
about a lot of things.

333
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,170
So the father

334
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,440
called the three sons to his side,

335
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,710
and told them...

336
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,100
What is it?

337
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,420
Look at my memory.

338
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,140
I'm old.

339
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,880
Jing.

340
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,070
You've heard this story.

341
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,480
Tell them

342
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,100
what happened next.

343
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,170
Father.

344
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,580
I haven't heard this story.

345
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,400
Since you don't remember it,

346
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,030
we can let people finish writing it.

347
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,950
Father, what do you think?

348
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,750
It's late today.

349
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,030
You guys go back.

350
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,770
Goodbye, Father.

351
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,010
Let's go.

352
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,080
Ke.

353
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,180
When did you hear the story?

354
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,520
What do you think?

355
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,930
Let's go.

356
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,080
Go.

357
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,230
I haven't finished asking.

358
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,380
(Cyan Mountains)

359
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,250
Your Highness.

360
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,070
Father's story tonight

361
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,410
has a deeper meaning.

362
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,340
Father should've known

363
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,990
what we did.

364
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,660
He is asking Jing how to deal with me.

365
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,100
From what Father said,

366
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,990
could Jing's wedding gift

367
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,520
be...

368
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,550
He'll designate a crown prince.

369
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,550
The conflict between me and Jing
is irreconcilable.

370
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,230
Father told the story today

371
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,420
to test his thoughts.

372
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,100
He will never let me go.

373
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,650
And also,

374
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,950
the things we did before...

375
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,070
There is no concealing the truth.

376
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,810
Your Highness, don't worry.

377
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,860
There must be a way.

378
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,170
I'm with you.

379
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,320
Ge.

380
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,550
You have to help me.

381
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,900
You must help me.

382
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,030
Your Highness, don't worry.

383
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,420
There will definitely be a way.

384
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,070
What His Majesty said today

385
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,720
has some implications.

386
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,860
Even you understood it,

387
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,790
of course I did too.

388
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,230
Why didn't you express your opinion?

389
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,520
It's not the first time

390
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,790
that I've fought with Ke.

391
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,580
I'm used to it.

392
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,440
He deliberately plotted against you this time.

393
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,280
I am angry.

394
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,380
So I didn't want to say anything.

395
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,650
By the way,

396
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,330
I remembered one thing.

397
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,170
What's it?

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,890
Yesterday Lv Ke

399
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,750
already sent his food.

400
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
I've weighted it.

401
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,650
Now we have enough

402
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,550
disaster relief food.

403
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,100
Why are you laughing?

404
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,710
You are such a good housekeeper.

405
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,380
I should have married you earlier.

406
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,660
But there is one more thing

407
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,270
that we need to solve as soon as possible.

408
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,940
(Library)

409
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,710
He wants you to set Ru Jing up?

410
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,610
His Highness asked you

411
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,580
to set Ru Jing up?

412
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
He said he had told her several times.

413
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,760
But Ru Jing didn't listen.

414
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,620
What can you do if she doesn't listen?

415
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,230
I said the same thing.

416
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,710
But he said

417
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
I'll be managing the mansion one day.

418
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,180
Consider this as my advance practice.

419
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,380
He is right in saying that.

420
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,480
But what should I do?

421
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,550
I think

422
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,780
His Highness chose
the right person for the job.

423
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,620
Why is that?

424
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,030
You can't do anything else.

425
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,990
But you definitely have experience

426
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,550
in blind dating.

427
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,660
When you were in Fuyu...

428
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,180
What happened in Fuyu?

429
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,030
- Nothing.
- What do you mean nothing?

430
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,480
She went on lots of blind dates

431
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,760
in Fuyu.

432
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,930
She's seen all kinds of men

433
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,990
and used all kinds of methods.

434
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,760
I also know how to shut people up

435
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,340
and make them unable to talk forever.

436
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,450
Do you want to try it?

437
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,550
Okay, okay, okay.

438
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,280
You're getting married.

439
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,170
Why are you still like a child?

440
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,100
I won't argue with you anymore.

441
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,130
Aunt.

442
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,340
Your laughter...

443
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,310
My laughter...

444
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,660
It seems that you found
the right person to cure it.

445
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,140
Congratulations.

446
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,960
Stop congratulating others.

447
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,420
Think about how to deal with Ru Jing.

448
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,810
Say what you want to say now.

449
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,330
After that, leave quickly.

450
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,070
(This is my house, okay?)

451
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,510
(I haven't let you leave yet.)

452
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,340
(How could you say that to me?)

453
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,690
(Hold it.)

454
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,810
(For Mr. Huaishan's sake,)

455
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,660
(hold it.)

456
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,650
It's not a big deal.

457
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,510
I just want you to chat with you.

458
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,090
Childish.

459
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,930
I'm not interested.

460
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,280
I've been preparing for so long.

461
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,270
Give me a chance.

462
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,720
I won't.

463
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,610
You won't refuse, right?

464
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,450
Then let's play.

465
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,990
This is the game I often play in Fuyu.

466
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,750
It has portraits of single men in Great Tang.

467
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,090
Just pick

468
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,200
your favorite ones.

469
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,040
Do you understand?

470
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,720
Understood.

471
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,230
So you were so unvirtuous

472
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,790
in Fuyu,

473
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,660
picking men for fun.

474
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,710
I don't have to look at the portraits.

475
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,360
Why don't you

476
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,960
go back and read more books

477
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,950
to learn women's virtues?

478
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,700
(Huadeng Pavilion)

479
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,810
I'm furious.

480
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,040
I helped Ru Jing find a blind date
out of good intentions.

481
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,550
But she said I'm unvirtuous.

482
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,610
She just said you don't
understand women's virtues.

483
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,170
What's the difference from being unvirtuous?

484
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,270
Okay, don't be angry.

485
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,230
I really can't help it.

486
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,900
You should find someone else to do this.

487
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,440
(Pure Like Orchids)

488
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,680
You are the mistress of our mansion.

489
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,230
How could you back down so easily?

490
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,810
Whoever wants to be it can be it.

491
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,380
I just want to be a useless person.

492
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,470
How nice it is to be carefree.

493
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,580
So tell me,

494
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,800
what should we do?

495
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,650
Why don't you

496
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,420
just marry her?

497
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,140
Can you accept sharing your husband
with someone else?

498
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,710
What are you thinking about?

499
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,140
I mean

500
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,440
we pretend to move ahead

501
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,810
in order to hide the intention to retreat.

502
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,100
What does it mean?

503
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,040
The more you don't let her do something,

504
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,270
the more she wants to do it.

505
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,270
Let's do the opposite.

506
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,330
You tell her

507
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,170
you want to marry her

508
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,510
and then show your weaknesses.

509
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,850
Wait until she sees your true colors,

510
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,950
she won't want to marry you.

511
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,030
Will this work?

512
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,580
It will work.

513
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,030
Go back and recharge your energy.

514
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,550
We will fight it out with her tomorrow.

515
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,030
You don't want to chat with me?

516
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,750
Go back soon.

517
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,510
Can we chat for a longer while?

518
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,070
Go.

519
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,720
If you stay a little longer,

520
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,365
Ru Jing is going to accuse me
of being unvirtuous.

521
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,170
We'll get married in a few days.

522
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,060
By then,

523
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,280
we can see each other whenever we want

524
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,480
and do whatever we want.

525
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,620
No one will dare to say anything.

526
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,310
Now, we can do whatever we want too.

527
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,660
No one will dare to say anything.

528
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,010
What do you want to do?

529
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,360
No.

530
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,710
What did you say?

531
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,380
Go now.

532
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,340
Almost lost my reputation.

533
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,410
Time to sleep.

534
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,080
Your Highness.

535
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,860
Miss Ru Jing, you are here.

536
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,130
Your Highness invited me to come.

537
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,480
I'd come for sure, rain or shine.

538
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,850
Actually, I asked you here today

539
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,890
for one thing.

540
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:56,830
I want to discuss it with you.

541
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,620
I know what you want to say.

542
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,030
You want me to leave, right?

543
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,930
No.

544
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,310
I want you to stay.

545
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,170
What did you say?

546
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,370
You mean...

547
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,210
I want to marry you.

548
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,450
Would you agree?

549
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,520
I do.

550
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,100
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

551
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,720
I think God

552
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,230
must have heard my prayers.

553
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,070
Finally, good faith

554
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,550
moved mountains.

555
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,730
Your Highness.

556
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,340
When will we have the wedding?

557
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,170
I can inform my grandpa

558
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,000
to come hold our engagement ceremony.

559
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,840
There's no wedding.

560
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:33,930
No...

561
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,790
No wedding?

562
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,450
It doesn't matter.

563
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,820
I've said it before.

564
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,440
As long as I can marry you,

565
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,310
I don't need a title.

566
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,650
Okay, one more thing.

567
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,950
I want to make it clear to you in advance.

568
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,370
Lest you regret it after marriage.

569
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,440
If I could marry you,

570
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,340
I will never regret it.

571
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,470
You saw the dowry Changsheng brought

572
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,880
from Fuyu.

573
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,170
They could extend

574
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,480
for ten miles.

575
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,610
I will try to prepare

576
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,230
a dowry as great as Her Highness's.

577
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,280
Great?

578
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,180
That won't work.

579
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,580
Yours has to be the best.

580
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,880
You know

581
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,710
it's not my intention to marry you.

582
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,930
If the dowry is not enough,

583
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,140
I won't feel good about it.

584
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,030
And also,

585
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,660
I usually look gentle and elegant.

586
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,180
But I was actually pretending it.

587
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,450
I like to hit people.

588
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,830
I especially like to hit people close to me.

589
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,340
Including your wife?

590
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,380
You are not my wife.

591
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,180
You need to know your own identity.

592
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,360
You are a concubine.

593
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,880
Not a concubine.

594
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,310
You have no identity.

595
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,860
Just now Changsheng wanted
to stop you from entering my house.

596
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,230
I found it

597
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,890
and hit her hard.

598
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,470
She can't get out of bed now.

599
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,610
I have learned a new set of boxing.

600
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,450
Do you want

601
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,180
to try it in a while?

602
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,410
But

603
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,100
you said when you were a kid

604
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,370
that you'd treat your lover with respect.

605
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,210
I did say that.

606
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,810
But I also said,

607
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,850
"As cut as rasp,

608
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,790
as carve as polish."

609
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,840
If I don't challenge you,

610
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,030
how could we bond?

611
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,280
But

612
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,000
I don't see any injuries on Her Highness.

613
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,580
Of course you can't see it.

614
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:01,950
It's all internal injuries.

615
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,790
What now? You regret it?

616
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,840
I've made up my mind.

617
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,840
I do.

618
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,330
Follow the man you marry,

619
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,310
be he fowl or cur.

620
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,880
Your Highness.

621
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,950
Let's practice the new boxing now.

622
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,280
You can accept this?

623
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,120
No.

624
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,130
My body

625
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,380
is not as strong as Her Highness's.

626
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,370
Let me prepare some

627
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,230
metal-inflicted wound

628
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,360
and styptic powder.

629
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,930
This way I can stay with you

630
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,270
as long as possible.

631
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,890
Your Highness, wait for me.

632
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,750
I'll be back soon.

633
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,470
Even this won't scare her away?

634
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,980
(Upholding Morality)

635
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,620
Lv Ke.

636
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,420
You've done all the bad things.

637
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,690
Are you still struggling?

638
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,530
Jing.

639
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,030
I know I was wrong.

640
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,230
Let me go.

641
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,340
Ke, are you familiar with this white cloth?

642
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,860
Don't.

643
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,750
What's up, Your Highness?

644
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,040
It's okay. It's okay.

645
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,880
It's a dream.

646
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:39,930
Don't be afraid.

647
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,100
This is not a dream.

648
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,560
Not a dream.

649
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,950
Lv Jing won't let me go.

650
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,030
I want Lv Jing to die.

651
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,660
Lv Jing must die.

652
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,310
Your Highness, don't be afraid.

653
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,710
I'm with you.

654
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,860
I will surely make your wish come true.

655
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,140
(Literacy and Etiquette)

656
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,340
Your Highness, smile.

657
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:13,770
Yeah.

658
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,710
Princess Consort, you too. Look here.

659
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,840
Right, right.

660
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,180
Sort it out like this.

661
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,820
- Lend a hand.
- Princess.

662
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,280
Look at this wedding attire.

663
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,340
Should we choose this one,

664
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,950
or this one?

665
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,280
- This one.
- That one.

666
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,210
Listen to Her Highness.

667
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,410
And Jinyan,

668
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,330
be careful with your words.

669
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,230
We're getting married soon.

670
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,890
You can't keep calling her Princess.

671
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,890
Call her Princess Consort.

672
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,030
Yes, Your Highness.

673
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,370
Your Highness.

674
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,680
About Her Highness's accessories,

675
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,130
should we choose this, this,

676
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,040
or this?

677
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,880
Listen to Her Highness.

678
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,470
Marriage is a matter between two people.

679
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,760
I can't choose everything.
You should choose some too.

680
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,340
Didn't I choose you?

681
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,650
I used to think
it was difficult to get married.

682
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,330
Now I feel it is more difficult
to have the wedding.

683
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,760
All good things

684
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,600
are all like this.

685
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,550
Just because it is difficult

686
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,040
and not easy to get,

687
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,170
when we actually get it,

688
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,010
we will cherish it.

689
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,990
After obtaining it,

690
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,960
we will also feel very happy.

691
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,230

but not for a man with love to come by"?

694
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,420
So I'm the man with love?

695
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,180
Yi'an,

696
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,660

I was the Princess of Fuyu,

722
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,510
and you were the envoy from Great Tang.
