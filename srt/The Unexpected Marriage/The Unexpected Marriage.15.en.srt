=The Unexpected Marriage=

2
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,660
=Episode 15=

3
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,930
Since you said that,

4
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,070
I must know the reason.

5
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,660
I don't mean this.

6
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,500
I'm just afraid that saying this

7
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,820
will drive a wedge between you two.

8
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,630
Then I'll become a sinner.

9
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
You won't.

10
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,470
I won't punish you.

11
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,910
There are rumors recently that

12
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,350
Princess Consort Song is meant
to be the Empress Dowager

13
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,470
and Prince Song the Emperor Emeritus.

14
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,470
I'm in good health

15
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,430
and haven't yet passed my throne.

16
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,780
How could there be a Emperor Emeritus?

17
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,850
Hou.

18
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,310
Do you want to

19
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,120
overstep my authority?

20
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,960
Father.

21
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,380
I don't.

22
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,430
Her Highness must have heard some rumors

23
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,650
and came to falsely accuse me.

24
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,560
It's a false accusation.

25
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,870
It is a false accusation, Father.

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,430
I just heard Princess Consort Song mentioned

27
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,120
that a sacred stone was found

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,540
in their garden.

29
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,530
Back then, Empress Lv Zhi

30
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,730
rose to power through rumors

31
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,070
because of a stone.

32
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,910
I'm worried

33
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,070
whether

34
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,450
this matter will...

35
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,630
As long as I'm alive,

36
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,220
what happened to Empress Lv Zhi

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,050
should never

38
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,290
be repeated.

39
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,170
Father.

40
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,050
I have absolutely no such intention.

41
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,980
I have always respected you.

42
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,290
I would never do such a

43
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,680
disobedient and unfilial thing.

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Your Majesty.

45
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,820
Rumors are all hearsay.

46
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,380
If repeated often enough,

47
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,050
it is inevitable to become tweaked.

48
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,930
I believe

49
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,800
Prince Song has no intention
to fight for power.

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,030
It started because of a rumor.

51
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,150
If we take it seriously,

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,770
it will surely cause panic among people.

53
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,980
Please investigate it.

54
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,630
You are young

55
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,590
but quite bold.

56
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,100
My words don't carry much weight,

57
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,750
but I'm frank and forthright.

58
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,360
Father.

59
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,700
Jing.

60
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,770
I don't know

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,490
what did Changsheng do

62
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,350
to upset you.

63
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,540
She's new here and doesn't know the rules.

64
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,980
Please forgive her, Father.

65
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,780
I heard you were injured a few days ago.

66
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,490
Father, where did you hear this rumor?

67
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,680
I'm fine.

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,540
I didn't get hurt.

69
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,730
Lv Jing.

70
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,120
You are injured.

71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,570
Everyone is saying you're injured.

72
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,630
Where are you hurt?

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,930
My brother is so weak.

74
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,120
You can't even stand steady now.

75
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,960
Let me go.

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,080
Hou.

77
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,550
Stop messing around.

78
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,900
Jing, sit down.

79
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,530
You've heard of

80
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,880
the rumor about Changsheng, right?

81
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,720
Father.

82
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,900
I also think there is something fishy about it.

83
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,730
I think a spy

84
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,700
wants to use the peace-making marriage

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,380
to disturb people and cause disputes.

86
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,170
Then they can swoop in

87
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,340
and harm our people.

88
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,870
I wanted to find out the truth
and report it to you.

89
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,240
Who'd know this rumor

90
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,990
actually reached the palace so quickly?

91
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,530
Jing, do you have any clues?

92
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,550
Father, I think

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,630
it doesn't have to be so complicated.

94
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,670
This kind of gossip stirs up disputes.

95
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,500
Probably it's not someone from our family.

96
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,760
Wan, what do you think?

97
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,930
I think

98
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,610
even a woman knows

99
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,070
rumors should not be believed.

100
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,990
You're the Emperor

101
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,550
and is blessed by heaven,

102
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,000
naturally, you will not be fooled by villains.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,680
As for the conspiracy in the court,

104
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,450
I believe you're perceptive of the slightest.

105
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,290
Father.

106
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,870
I think this is a simple matter.

107
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,310
Since ancient times, rumors

108
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,360
cannot be fully believed.

109
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,650
But it can't...

110
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,750
Can't you give me some peace?

111
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,870
Father, this matter is groundless.

112
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,560
If you blame Hou

113
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,800
because of this rumor,

114
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,790
it's unfair.

115
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,610
Why not take this opportunity

116
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,760
to smooth things over

117
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
and let the people in the palace

118
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,020
stop relaying the erroneous information?

119
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,280
What do you think, Father?

120
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,280
Pass my order.

121
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,840
If anyone gossips

122
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,500
in the palace again,

123
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,190
they will be punished heavily.

124
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,520
Yes.

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,460
- As you wish, father.
- As you wish, father.

126
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,260
(Fine Spirits of the Universe)

127
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,290
Princess Royal.

128
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,630
Prince Qin is here.

129
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,930
Aunt, you're in a good mood.

130
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,380
People were praising Wu's landscape paintings.

131
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,550
I also liked it after seeing it.

132
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,020
So I'm copying it

133
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,310
as a relaxation.

134
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,690
Aunt.

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,380
That's a pretty good drawing of yours.

136
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,310
I know you well.

137
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,140
You know nothing
about calligraphy and painting.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,140
You do know me.

139
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,020
Why did you come here today?

140
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,560
Changsheng brought you a painting

141
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,430
as a token of gratitude.

142
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,940
I'll take the painting.

143
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,700
But no need to thank me.

144
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,990
Is there anything you want?

145
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,800
Last time I met Father,

146
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,880
you told me the palace rumors in advance,

147
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,900
and asked me to be vigilant.

148
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,050
In the Imperial Garden,
you defended Changsheng.

149
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,070
I came to thank you.

150
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,450
I'm afraid this

151
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,790
isn't all you came here for.

152
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,340
Indeed, I have another favor to ask.

153
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,990
Tell me.

154
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,410
Changsheng got out of trouble

155
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,380
in front of Father this time.

156
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,870
But I'm worried I won't protect her

157
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,410
next time.

158
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,430
The people in Fuyu are open,

159
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,500
and Her Highness is a free spirit.

160
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,050
But Great Tang is strict.

161
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,990
You should have thought
of these contradictions long ago.

162
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,750
I was careless.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,460
I thought I could protect her.

164
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,680
It's just that the situation is unstable now.

165
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,520
Danger lurks on every side.

166
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,440
If she always stays by my side,

167
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,280
there is always danger.

168
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,340
So I want to ask you

169
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,050
to help me.

170
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,430
In this case,

171
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,820
let her come to Xiuwen Hall to compile books.

172
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,090
Last time I noticed

173
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,020
she has great literary skills.

174
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,500
Coming to my place to compile books

175
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,790
can help her calm her mind.

176
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,630
It can also be a great help to me.

177
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,070
Aunt, thank you.

178
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,460
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

179
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,790
- It's done.
- Your Highness.

180
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,320
Is there anything special

181
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,750
about this painting?

182
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,020
Is it

183
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,390
a hard-to-find masterpiece

184
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,550
or the work of a great painter?

185
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:37,790
Princess Royal.

186
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,290
Invite Princess Consort Qin to the study
to appreciate the painting.

187
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,130
Yes.

188
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,670
Invite Princess Consort Qin
to appreciate the painting?

189
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,980
What happened Prince Qin?

190
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
I don't know.

191
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,480
Since yesterday

192
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,390
she returned from Princess Royal's palace,

193
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,480
he's been staring at the painting in a daze.

194
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,170
Is there anything wrong with this painting?

195
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,460
I don't see any problem.

196
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,970
Are there secrets

197
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,070
hidden inside?

198
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,790
Or

199
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,510
Princess Royal hid something in it?

200
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,740
Hid something?

201
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,960
I only asked him to thank Princess Royal.

202
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,390
Why did he bring back another painting?

203
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,940
Could it be that Princess Royal
has something to say to me?

204
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,250
After returning yesterday,

205
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,460
what else did he say?

206
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,220
He also said

207
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,460
invite Princess Consort Qin to the study
to appreciate the painting.

208
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,840
Yesterday,

209
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,460
how was your talk with Princess Royal?

210
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,820
Does she have something to tell me?

211
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,430
Is she not satisfied with my painting?

212
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,010
Or

213
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,210
she blamed you

214
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,390
for something?

215
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,790
What on earth did she say?

216
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,680
If you still don't talk,

217
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,550
I'm leaving.

218
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,800
Come and see.

219
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,670
This is Wu's landscape painting
Princess Royal copied.

220
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,390
From technique to craft,

221
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,250
everything is superior

222
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,150
for a copying work.

223
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,580
But the most rare thing is

224
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,910
it integrates the essences

225
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,670
of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism.

226
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,910
It's just wonderful.

227
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,430
Princess Royal's painting skills
are really amazing.

228
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,980
Although it is a copy,

229
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,310
it still shows ingenuity.

230
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,370
Good taste.

231
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,340
Previously, you had a hobby
of collecting rare books in Fuyu.

232
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,080
Recently, I have heard

233
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,550
you're interested in the culture

234
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,670
and craftsmanship of Great Tang.

235
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,030
Do you know

236
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,460
there is a place in Great Tang

237
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,740
where a variety of unique books are collected?

238
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,250
Where?

239
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,580
Princess Royal's Xiuwen Hall.

240
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,670
Xiuwen Hall?

241
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,460
Princess Royal is the only daughter
of the late emperor

242
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,190
and also the youngest sister of Father.

243
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,430
She is usually gentle,

244
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,340
doesn't like to compete,
only loves ancient books.

245
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,720
She developed Xiuwen Hall

246
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,910
on her own.

247
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,250
The hall

248
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,980
houses a variety of books

249
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,390
that record the history
and skills of Great Tang.

250
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,770
There is no precedent for women
serving as officials in our country,

251
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,610
but

252
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,370
she relied on her own strength

253
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,220
to gain a foothold in the court.

254
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,580
She really makes women proud.

255
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,150
She also helped me out in front of His Majesty.

256
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,980
I really should visit her in person.

257
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,410
I want to see

258
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,390
what is this Xiuwen Hall like too.

259
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,050
Princess Royal is usually busy
with the trivial matters of Xiuwen Hall.

260
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,890
She has very little free time.

261
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,550
But it's not hard to get in.

262
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,190
I can get in too?

263
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,370
Certainly.

264
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,940
Then I will meet Princess Royal tomorrow.

265
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,320
Do you think the moon

266
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,510
is round

267
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,860
or square?

268
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,410
If you say it's round,

269
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,410
it's round.

270
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,570
If you say it's square,

271
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,410
it's square.

272
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,290
If you can tell a lie vividly

273
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,270
and beautifully,

274
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,980
you can also make people believe

275
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,220
it's true.

276
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,510
Princess Royal has a gentle personality
and isn't competitive.

277
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,960
Princess Royal is talented

278
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,070
and compassionate.

279
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,340
- Tough break for Her Highness.
- Tough break for Her Highness.

280
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,490
Your Highness.

281
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,940
Arrange Her Highness
to go to Xiuwen Hall tomorrow.

282
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,700
Notify Princess Royal in advance.

283
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,010
Yes.

284
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,580
I'll leave the rest

285
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,270
to Princess Royal.

286
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,580
(Prince Song's Mansion)

287
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,310
It's over.

288
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,460
It's all over.

289
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,620
It's all over.

290
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,890
Go.

291
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,920
Leave.

292
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,580
It's all over.

293
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,770
Lv Hou.

294
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,980
You still know how to come back?

295
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,640
And you dared to drink outside.

296
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,340
What are you going to do?

297
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,100
What's wrong with me drinking a little?

298
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,030
It's because of you...

299
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,220
If it weren't for you...

300
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,100
If it weren't for you, I...

301
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,560
What's wrong?

302
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,980
The plan failed?

303
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,510
It's all your fault.

304
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,620
You had to mention the stone.

305
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,270
Now the plan is all ruined.

306
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,250
What are you saying?

307
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,460
What does Liu Changsheng have to do
with the sacred stone?

308
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,560
It's all because of you.

309
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,070
You had to tell her about the sacred stone.

310
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,450
Well, in the Imperial Garden,

311
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,690
Lv Jing and Liu Changsheng

312
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,190
just checkmated me.

313
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,410
If it weren't for you,

314
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,030
Father wouldn't fear me so much now.

315
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,860
I'm afraid that in this life...

316
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,930
In this life, I'll

317
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,030
have no chance of taking the throne.

318
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,680
Honey.

319
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,730
Honey.

320
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,550
What's wrong with you?

321
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,610
What's wrong?

322
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
Be gentle.

323
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,070
No, no, honey.

324
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,090
You don't need to feel guilty

325
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,030
about this.

326
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,560
Maybe I'm better off

327
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,510
without being the Emperor.

328
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,310
It's tiring anyway.

329
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,070
I just hope that you will

330
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,740
treat me better

331
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,670
and more gently.

332
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,030
Come on, please get up.

333
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,170
Who feels guilty?

334
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,560
I'm mad at you.

335
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,080
I'm mad at you for not being good enough.

336
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,130
You spend your days drinking and partying.

337
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,650
You're just a loser.

338
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,450
You're a lecher.

339
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,800
I'm gonna kill you.

340
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,310
Alright, honey.

341
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,010
I was wrong.

342
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,170
I really know I'm wrong.

343
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,080
This time,

344
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,940
we're just unlucky.

345
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,010
Next time.

346
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,740
Next time I'll win

347
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,670
fair and square.

348
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,800
Alright, alright.

349
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,550
Don't be angry.

350
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,140
(Huadeng Pavilion)

351
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,720
Your Highness.

352
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,680
If you still don't know
what to give Princess Royal,

353
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,840
we're gonna be late.

354
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,010
I know.

355
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,530
I originally liked this

356
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,600
agarwood bracelet the most.

357
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,200
Your Highness, that's it.

358
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,040
But

359
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,430
bracelet is jewelry.

360
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,740
Princess Royal is a heroine.

361
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,050
How about this white porcelain tea set?

362
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,290
Princess Royal is so literate.

363
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,310
She definitely drinks tea.

364
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,040
No, no.

365
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,890
Princess Royal has a noble status.

366
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,150
She must have seen all kinds of tea sets.

367
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,940
Hush.

368
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,220
That's it.

369
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,050
You scared me. What are you doing here?

370
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,670
Today is your first time
meeting Princess Royal.

371
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,390
Of course I should come see you.

372
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,100
Why choose this?

373
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,960
Is there nothing

374
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,200
more suitable for this?

375
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,580
Then why did you pick it?

376
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,340
If according to your statement,

377
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,600
Princess Royal compiles books all year round,

378
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,100
she'll use lots of
the four treasures of the study.

379
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,980
Jewelry is expensive,

380
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,940
but it must not be what she wants.

381
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,770
It's better to give her
the most practical thing.

382
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,680
It is also what she needs the most.

383
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,620
You're quite thoughtful.

384
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:34,890
Then let's go.

385
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,610
Changsheng.

386
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,980
Do you want me to go with you?

387
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,040
No need.

388
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,890
Don't worry.

389
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,890
I will make a very good first impression

390
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,620
on Princess Royal.

391
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,190
She'll feel like we're old friends.

392
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,490
Good.

393
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
(She won't feel you're her old friend.)

394
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,910
(It's more like throwing yourself
to the wolves.)

395
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,350
(Xiuwen Hall recently acquired
73 volumes of ancient medical books)

396
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,460
(Princess Royal requires an imperial physician
who is knowledgeable and hardworking)

397
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,190
What's the use of you looking at me?

398
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,190
Choose the person first.

399
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,580
This is indeed a great thing

400
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,030
for the benefit of the country and the people.

401
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,860
Doctor Ma.

402
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,790
You have always been patriotic.

403
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,990
I think you're

404
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,550
the best candidate for this.

405
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,080
I...

406
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,370
I am old and in poor health,

407
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,990
and often dim-sighted.

408
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,040
It's not suitable.

409
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,370
It is.

410
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,580
Doctor Yuan.

411
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,240
Your medical skills are superb.

412
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,170
You're also appreciated by Princess Royal.

413
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,850
Please don't refuse.

414
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,860
- No, this...
- Don't refuse.

415
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,720
Xiuwen Hall

416
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,380
is incredibly busy.

417
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,760
I have parents and children to take care of.

418
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,070
How can I manage?

419
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,970
Wait, wait.

420
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,810
Doctor Zhang.

421
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,030
You are suitable

422
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,550
for this matter.

423
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,710
Well...

424
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,380
How can I be suitable for this?

425
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,480
Zilv is here.

426
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,790
- Zilv is here.
- Zilv. Zilv.

427
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,380
Zilv, this is a big thing.

428
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,280
This is a great chance to establish your name.

429
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,520
Zilv, you are suitable.

430
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,420
- Zilv.
- Look at this.

431
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,730
What's this?

432
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,040
This is a great thing.

433
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,690
- And only you can do it.
- Yes.

434
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,280
Xiuwen Hall has a batch of medical books
to be compiled recently.

435
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Princess Royal requests
the Imperial Academy of Medicine

436
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,690
to send someone capable to compile them.

437
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,410
She specially mentioned you.

438
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,280
This is a great honor.

439
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,710
Yes, that's a good thing.

440
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,070
Xiuwen Hall has a collection of numerous books

441
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,200
and countless classics.

442
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,890
It's a good place to cultivate yourself.

443
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,210
- Really?
- Of course.

444
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,520
Of course it's true.

445
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,370
Such a good thing.

446
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,240
We all want to go.

447
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,370
- Right.
- Yeah.

448
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,380
Zilv, everyone knows

449
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,660
Princess Royal prefers you.

450
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,890
It would be most appropriate

451
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,370
for you to finish this job.

452
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,130
- That's right.
- Mr. Xiao.

453
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,410
It's a rare opportunity.

454
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,000
No more hesitation!

455
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,860
It can only be you.

456
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,570
Oh, well.

457
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,550
It's a deal.

458
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,900
(Library)

459
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,820
So this is Xiuwen Hall?

460
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,040
Come and sit down.

461
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,140
I got up late this morning.

462
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,890
If Princess Royal finds out,

463
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,890
I'll get scolded again.

464
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,090
I missed one book yesterday.

465
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,410
If Princess Royal finds out,

466
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,760
I'll get punished.

467
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,680
It's no problem.

468
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,130
I have one more copy.

469
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,310
You take it for emergency.

470
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,760
Give it back to me later.

471
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,140
Princess Royal is really amazing.

472
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,180
She could manage

473
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,860
such a large Xiuwen Hall so well.

474
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,960
Princess Changsheng.

475
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,850
I'm Princess Royal's personal maid.

476
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,070
Just call me Lingzhi.

477
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,120
Miss Lingzhi.

478
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,510
I came here today to visit Princess Royal.

479
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,280
This is the gift I prepared.

480
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,140
I want to present it to her in person.

481
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,240
Please tell Princess Royal for me.

482
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,370
Princess Royal already knew

483
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,760
you were coming.

484
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,890
But she is calling a morning meeting now.

485
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,420
Please let me pass on the gift to you.

486
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,930
Please change your clothes

487
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,820
and wait here, Your Highness.

488
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,790
Change my clothes?

489
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,950
This is the rule of Xiuwen Hall?

490
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,030
I am just following orders.

491
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,900
(Library)

492
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,260
(Library)

493
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,330
Xiuwen Hall's clothes

494
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,340
look quite impressive.

495
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,750
It looks a bit bookish when worn.

496
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,030
So many books!

497
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,890
Now that Your Highness has changed clothes,

498
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,950
let's get started.

499
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,550
Start?

500
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,040
Start what?

501
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,880
Please.

502
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,170
This is Xiuwen Hall.

503
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,070
Naturally, you should start compiling books.

504
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,820
(The Honest Supervisor Wan)

505
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,040
These two piles of books are today's work.

506
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,030
The pile on the left
needs to be sorted and filed.

507
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,680
The pile on the right
needs to be copied and proofread.

508
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,620
All necessary tools are ready.

509
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,080
Your Highness, are you ready to start?

510
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,920
Wait.

511
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,310
I am here to visit Princess Royal today,

512
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,750
not to compile books.

513
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,100
Are you mistaken, Miss Lingzhi?

514
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,990
It is indeed Princess Royal' order.

515
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,570
I don't know

516
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,750
the exact reason.

517
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,620
I know.

518
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,270
Your Highness, what do you know?

519
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,030
Is this

520
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,130
the test given to me by Princess Royal?

521
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,270
She wants to test

522
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,510
whether I'm visiting sincerely.

523
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,270
Maybe she's

524
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,820
observing me somewhere,

525
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,710
see if I can pass the test.

526
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,440
Your Highness, you're overthinking.

527
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,660
This is just a routine book compiling work.

528
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,230
It's not a test.

529
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,570
Keeping it secret.

530
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,410
I understand.

531
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,650
But Princess Royal

532
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,760
asked me

533
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,860
to specify the rules of Xiuwen Hall to you.

534
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,240
Xiuwen Hall

535
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,310
is not a place where ordinary people can enter.

536
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,410
The compilers who work here

537
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,230
were also carefully selected.

538
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,930
This time, Prince Qin
specifically required this.

539
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,850
If Your Highness does not do your best,

540
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,680
I am afraid that
we'll fail the trust of Prince Qin.

541
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,070
It will also lose Fuyu's face.

542
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,250
That's for sure.

543
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,410
(So clean.)

544
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,620
(No dust at all.)

545
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,470
(I miscalculated.)

546
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,900
(Although I'm a cultured person,)

547
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,270
(this ancient book is too old.)

548
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,570
(I know every word here,)

549
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,070
(but combined together,)

550
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,550
(I can't understand it at all.)

551
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,510
(It's all Greek to me.)

552
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,380
(Since it is a test,)

553
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,140
(what matters is my attitude.)

554
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,950
(Although I don't understand the meaning,)

555
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,340
(it's better to flip through it first.)

556
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,380
(Numerology Exploration)

557
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,660
This is too difficult.

558
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,270
Do you know what is book compiling?

559
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,380
Princess Royal.

560
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,090
I'm asking you.

561
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,180
Do you know what is book compiling?

562
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,550
It means

563
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,720
to organize books into volumes

564
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,270
for easy reading.

565
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,570
Since you don't know what is book compiling,

566
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,810
coming to my place

567
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,550
is a waste.

568
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,660
If I said anything wrong,

569
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,900
please enlighten me.

570
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,930
If you don't realize your mistake,

571
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,280
just listening to others

572
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,620
won't help you correct it.

573
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,340
Your Highness, please go back.

574
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,730
I...

575
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,580
It's all your fault.

576
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,900
Princess Royal looked down on me.

577
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,180
(Library)

578
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,900
Why did you deliberately
stimulate Her Highness?

579
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,040
She is naturally intelligent

580
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,610
but lacks patience.

581
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,180
With her status,

582
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,240
if I force her to work here,

583
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,550
it will only backfire.

584
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,320
I have to let her understand

585
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,380
what does her identity mean in Great Tang

586
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,420
and the importance of book compiling first,

587
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,310
then she will concentrate on it.

588
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,510
This is also to hone her patience.

589
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:43,990
You're thoughtful.

590
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,130
It's her first time to compile books.

591
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,380
There may be many problems.

592
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,340
Bring her to see me when she's done.

593
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,800
Yes.

594
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,820
(A trail in the green hills,
a night moon in the mountains)

595
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:05,990
Disqualified.

596
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,340
Do it again.

597
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,660
What do you think is
the most important thing in compiling a book?

598
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,280
For book compiling,

599
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,380
the most important thing is rigor,

600
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,860
the second is meticulosity.

601
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,330
And it's important to comprehend
what the ancients said

602
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,900
and make annotations on the side.

603
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,960
I'm not smart enough.

604
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,240
I could only try my best.

605
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,340
You are not smart enough.

606
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,510
I asked you this

607
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,310
because there are still mistakes.

608
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,510
If I point it out directly,

609
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,180
I'm afraid you won't remember it.

610
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,900
You have to go back
and think carefully about it yourself.

611
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,620
You can only go home
after finishing these today.

612
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,370
Besides,

613
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,960
all compilers in the hall

614
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,180
take turns doing the cleaning job.

615
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,680
Since you are here temporarily,

616
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,760
I specially adjusted
the cleaning order for you.

617
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,100
So from today on,

618
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,890
you're in charge

619
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,070
of the dusting job.

620
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,450
I have to complete

621
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,370
all these myself?

622
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,210
Certainly.

623
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,440
If you can't complete it,

624
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,180
copy the Thousand Character Classic.

625
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,790
I thought this Xiuwen Hall
was a place of books.

626
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,270
Living here for a long time
naturally broadens people's minds.

627
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,850
But as soon as I entered the door,

628
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,420
I heard such an unfair thing.

629
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,720
Are you deliberately
making things difficult for her?

630
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,620
Xiao Zilv?

631
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,760
Why are you here?

632
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,070
I am following the order
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine

633
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,660
to come compile medical books.

634
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,720
I heard by chance

635
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,310
the conversation between you two.

636
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,140
Book compiling requires
practice and concentration.

637
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,960
I'm afraid Princess Royal

638
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,270
is a bit eager for quick success.

639
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,760
What mistakes

640
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,820
did Her Highness make?

641
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,580
Please specify.

642
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,510
If you can't explain,

643
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,470
I'm afraid you're not
living up to your reputation.

644
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Mr. Xiao has a different opinion?

645
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,520
Her Highness and I both came from Fuyu.

646
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,710
We're not familiar with Great Tang.

647
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,280
Since Princess Royal has given the order,

648
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,340
naturally it cannot be changed.

649
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,550
It would be better to arrange
for the two of us to compile books together.

650
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,090
It can reduce the burden on Her Highness

651
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,750
and also speed up the progress
of book compiling.

652
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,800
Xiao Zilv, stop talking.

653
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,640
I'll help you.

654
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,810
I didn't impose

655
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,810
this job on her.

656
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,310
But she has to bear the name
of Princess Consort Qin.

657
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,470
Then she must do it by herself.

658
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,990
If Mr. Xiao thinks I am deliberately
making things difficult for her,

659
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,620
take a look at this.

660
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,000
(Book of Reference)
This book

661
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,580
records the meanings
of Great Tang's characters.

662
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,040
But Her Highness

663
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,660
wrote many characters wrong

664
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,580
and her interpretation is confusing.

665
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,420
Xiuwen Hall's work is of great importance.

666
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,180
If I don't care about these details,

667
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,040
if this book is passed on,

668
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,230
I don't need to mention

669
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,710
how serious the consequences will be.

670
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,180
Princess Royal is right.

671
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,660
I should correct my mistakes.

672
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,990
I'm going to finish it now.

673
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,270
I'll leave you two to chat.

674
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,090
What should I do if you leave?

675
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,470
Good luck to you.

676
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,090
Mr. Xiao, do you still think

677
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,470
I'm being unfair?

678
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,070
Did I say that?

679
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,340
I think you were perfectly right.

680
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,560
Just now you said

681
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,550
you wanted to learn
about Great Tang's culture.

682
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,580
In addition to compiling medical books,

683
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,340
copy the poems

684
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,030
in here.

685
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,170
Yes.

686
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,780
(Xiuwen Hall)

687
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,310
How did you come?

688
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,600
I came to pick you up.

689
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,900
How much more do you need to copy today?

690
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,270
The whole volumes.

691
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,760
I didn't do

692
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,950
my job well today.

693
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,860
There was no time for dusting.

694
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,310
So I should copy all the volumes.

695
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,550
But your aunt is scary.

696
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,310
I feel like I won't dare
to say a word in the future.

697
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,410
No.

698
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,470
I am like this now

699
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,750
all because of you.

700
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,850
I wanted to come here

701
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,270
after listening to your story.

702
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,230
Now I am half dead with exhaustion.

703
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,420
I'm telling you, I'm very angry now.

704
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,420
But I don't have the energy
to settle accounts with you.

705
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,230
Then I'll copy it with you.

706
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,070
That's more like it.

707
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,380
(The sun rises and sets
and the moon is regularly round)

708

(Huadeng Pavilion)

711
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,270
Changsheng, you had a long day.

712
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,100
I'm really exhausted.

713
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,770
But

714
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,180
everyone has something they care about.

715
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:44,690
Just like

716
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,340
if someone makes a mistake
in the Muyan Forest,

717
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,990
I won't let them off easily.

718
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,930
It's just

719
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,420
why do I feel like a farmhand?

720
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:54,650
It's like

721
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,550
I accidentally got on a pirate ship.

722
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,320
Careful.

723
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,230
Even the stairs are against me.

724
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,170
I'll help you take revenge.

725
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,550
Alright.

726
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,860
(Pure Like Orchids)

727
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,210
What's wrong?

728
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,270
My hand is sore.

729
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,450
I'll rub it for you.

730
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,420
I prepared some cakes.

731
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,090
Before you go to sleep,

732
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,230
eat them all.

733
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,270
No, I need to rest early.

734
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,550
I have to go to Xiuwen Hall earlier tomorrow.

735
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,950
You should go back now.

736
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,230
Let me rest quickly.

737
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,560
I haven't forgiven you yet

738
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,820
for lying to me.

739
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,470
I'll settle the score with you later.

740
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,520
Okay.

741

(Love sickness)

744
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,770
Princess Royal.

745
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,230
Don't be nervous.

746
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,040
I just came to see how you were doing.

747
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,890
About yesterday,

748
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,440
I was indeed reckless.

749
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,090
Last night I saw Changsheng
compiling a book late at night,

750
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,860
I realized that
you were training her on purpose.

751
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,760
She can understand the culture of Great Tang

752
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,820
and also govern her temper.

753
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,340
(Reed)

754
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,140
Green, green the reed,

755
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,750
dew and frost gleam.

756
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,320
Where's she I need?

757
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,420
Beyond the stream.

758
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,620
What do you think of this poem?

759
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,410
This poem?

760
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,330
I think it's beautiful.

761
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,340
But I feel a little sad.

762
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,310
The two people are obviously in love,

763
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,410
but a river separates them,

764
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,410
and they can't meet.

765
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,620
The road ahead is long and difficult.

766
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,270
But love is not as one wishes.

767
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,490
Love but not getting it.

768
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,710
The lost love regained.

769
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:55,820
Or loss of a loved one.

770
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,040
Only those who have experienced this

771
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,470
can write such a love poem.

772
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,790
Mr. Xiao has a similar experience?

773
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,230
In fact, the reluctance

774
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,420
is because of obsessions.

775
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,700
If two people are really
destined to be together,

776
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,770
even if they have to overcome many obstacles,

777
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,430
they will definitely stay together forever.

778
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,960
Princess Royal.

779
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,780
Your face...

780
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,070
Are you sick?

781
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,830
You are sick.

782
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,000
No.

783
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,250
Princess Royal, you misunderstood.

784
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,600
I mean you worry too much.

785
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,660
It's not good for your health.

786
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,260
She's hiding her disease.

787
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,080
My back hurts.

788
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,030
My legs are in pain.

789
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,960
And I have arm cramps.

790
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,660
From sunrise to dusk,

791
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,350
from day to night,

792
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,070
I, a princess,

793
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,510
got into such a mess.

794
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,220
It's really hard to compile books.

795
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,690
It's so difficult for me.

796
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,180
Why did Princess Royal
arrange so many things for you?

797
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,910
- How long will you finish them?
- Here.

798
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,640
Although Her Highness isn't a local,

799
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,300
she can't bully her like this.

800
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,800
Experience.

801
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,830
It's experience.

802
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,510
Be careful with your words.

803
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,520
Do you have any instructions?

804
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,890
Do you want tea?

805
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,030
Do you want some cakes?

806
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,590
Shhh.

807
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,180
Understood.

808
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,300
What does this mean?

809
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,620
You said Her Highness wants this?

810
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,430
That's serious.

811
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,870
We have to tell His Highness right away.

812
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,580
That's right.

813
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,030
- Go.
- Let's go.

814
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,060
(I'll soon come from the East, and I
should send someone to receive the emissaries)

815
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,220
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

816
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,200
Her Highness has been going out
every day at 5 a.m. recently

817
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,250
to Xiuwen Hall

818
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,250
and returns home at 7 p.m..

819
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,690
The secret bodyguards
are protecting her in the dark.

820
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,620
They dare not take it lightly.

821
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,600
How is the compiling work going?

822
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,040
From Great Tang to Fuyu,

823
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,290
in terms of the language, calendar,

824
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,440
and cultural customs,

825
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,740
there are subtle differences.

826
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,970
Even an encyclopedic mind

827
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,950
in Fuyu

828
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,810
needs to take time to study

829
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,740
in Great Tang.

830
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,160
However, Princess Royal
has high hopes for Her Highness.

831
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,730
She hopes she will dive into
Great Tang's culture

832
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,440
in a short time.

833
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,700
This is difficult for Her Highness.

834
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,260
What does she need?

835
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,620
What do you mean?

836
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,050
Your Highness.

837
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,580
When Her Highness is tired...

838
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,470
You only heard this?

839
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,160
Your Highness, rest early.

840
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,260
We're leaving first.

841
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,860
(Huadeng Pavilion)

842
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,100
Changsheng, are you asleep?

843
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,170
Changsheng.

844
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,910
Are you asleep?

845
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,330
I'm dying from all the work.

846
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,990
I was just about to take a break
and then continue,

847
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,550
but you woke me up
just as I put my head on the pillow.

848
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,100
I'm devastated now.

849
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,440
So

850
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,390
you better have something important to tell me.

851
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,620
Important. It's very important.

852
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,100
I'm here to give you

853
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,350
warmth.

854
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,870
Thank you, I'm not cold.

855
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,770
Since I'm here,

856
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,990
let me in to talk for a while.

857
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,210
Please.

858
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,780
I want to sleep.

859
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,570
