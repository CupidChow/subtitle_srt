=The Unexpected Marriage=

2
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,660
=Episode 18=

3
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,540
Young Master, don't be discouraged.

4
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,380
Even Liu Bei visited Zhuge Liang three times.

5
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,120
It's different.

6
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,150
What's the difference?

7
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,050
I'm thinking

8
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,700
how to know what Changsheng's thinking.

9
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,630
I don't understand either

10
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,850
Her Highness's thoughts.

11
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,610
I don't understand it.

12
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,150
But I know there is a place that understands.

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
What place?

14
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,958
Good Match Pavilion.

15
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,730
(Good Match Pavilion)
Couples come here when they fight.

16
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:35,600
Will Young Master

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,750
come to this kind of place?

18
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,450
He...

19
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,330
Young Master.

20
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,150
Did you make your wife angry?

21
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,700
You came to ask for a solution.

22
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,100
For sincerity.

23
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,910
Then you've come to the right place.

24
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,870
Tell me, when did she leave?

25
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,130
Last night.

26
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,750
Last night?

27
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,590
It's been just one night,

28
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,910
and you look so anxious.

29
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,470
You're newlyweds, right?

30
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,800
Just gave the betrothal gifts.

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,700
They're not married yet.

32
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,980
This is not going to be easy.

33
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,070
A little gesture.

34
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,030
Will she come back?

35
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,070
As the saying goes,

36
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,400
"A broken mirror

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,540
is hard to fix."

38
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,150
What if I want us to be closer than before?

39
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,590
Closer than before...

40
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,960
Right?

41
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,190
Enough, enough.

42
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,490
How much sincerity

43
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,050
do you want to show?

44
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,290
How much sincerity?

45
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,130
Yes.

46
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,680
The more the sincerity,

47
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,190
the bigger the scene.

48
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,730
Young Master, don't go.

49
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,570
No need.

50
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,700
No need?

51
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,800
I've received the money

52
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,940
and haven't done anything.

53
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,660
What a weirdo.

54
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,730
But I like

55
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,100
this weirdo.

56
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,970
I followed Prince Qin all the way

57
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,430
and saw him enter Good Match Pavilion.

58
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,310
Good Match Pavilion?

59
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
When couples have a fight,

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,530
and are embarrassed to make peace,

61
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,387
they mostly go to Good Match Pavilion
to seek solutions.

62
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,310
It's a really good place.

63
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,820
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

64
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,070
I wish your heart would be like mine,

65
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,940
then not in vain for you I pine.

66
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,780
(I wish your heart would be like mine,
then not in vain for you I pine)

67
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,940
(Your plan is so thorough.)

68
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,340
(How can I trust you?)

69
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,380
(How can I convince myself?)

70
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,220
(Tanghui Inn)

71
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,900
(Prince Lu's Mansion)

72
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,550
Will you tell the truth?

73
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,040
Please stop.

74
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,050
What I said is all true.

75
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,920
He told me it was a misunderstanding.

76
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,070
He didn't say anything else.

77
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,290
I just guessed

78
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,820
she ran away from home.

79
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,580
Ran away from home?

80
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,600
Misunderstanding?

81
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,650
Any other useful information?

82
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,490
No.

83
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,750
So don't keep

84
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,610
that man's life.

85
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,450
Yes.

86
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,930
Congratulations, Your Highness.

87
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,870
Why?

88
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,450
Liu Changsheng and Lv Jing

89
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,550
are always affectionate.

90
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,240
This time she ran away from home,

91
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,120
presumably

92
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,790
something big must have happened.

93
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,670
What kind of big event will happen?

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,400
It doesn't matter

95
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,240
what happens.

96
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,940
What matters is

97
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,310
it has already happened.

98
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,940
We got the wind

99
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,380
we wanted.

100
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,380
So many kites!

101
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,630
Spent so much money to please her.

102
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,500
It's obvious

103
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,750
that Jing loves Princess Changsheng very much.

104
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,370
Your Highness.

105
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,310
We were sitting still before.

106
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,460
Now...

107
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,020
Now

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,800
we can go with the flow.

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,640
Right.

110
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,020
After all, it's about
the royal family's dignity.

111
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,900
How can they tolerate

112
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,240
an unmarried woman

113
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,440
to run away from home?

114
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,820
And it's known to the whole city.

115
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,490
What a disgrace.

116
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,790
These kites alone

117
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,630
are

118
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,630
not enough.

119
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,600
Why are there so many kites?

120
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,440
Yes.

121
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,890
Your Highness.

122
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,850
Where are you taking me?

123
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,130
You will know when you go there.

124
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,480
His Highness is devoted to you.

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,492
Heaven and earth can witness it.

126
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,370
Let's go.

127
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,300
(Library)

128
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,730
Why are they all holding kites?

129
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,630
Is it a festival?

130
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,530
These kites

131
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,990
all flew in with the wind.

132
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,930
There is only one sentence written on them.

133
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,320
Your Highness, guess what's it.

134
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,340
I'm not in the mood.

135
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,460
I wish your heart would be like mine,

136
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,610
then not in vain for you I pine.

137
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,760
Although there is no signature,

138
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,310
we know who wrote it, right?

139
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,090
At first,

140
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,000
we thought His Highness's words
were monotonous.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,320
But later on,

142
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,900
other poems flew in.

143
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,610
As if he's afraid you won't know,

144
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,940
he specially added the signature.

145
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,760
His Highness is mobilizing
the people of the city

146
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,380
to show his love to you.

147
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,800
I have only heard of

148
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,480
this kind of scene in books.

149
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,580
I've never seen it before.

150
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,700
His Highness is really good to you.

151
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,310
Some have signatures,

152
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,440
and some don't.

153
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,520
Yes.

154
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,480
Some of those was written,

155
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,340
and some of those was not.

156
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,210
Oh no.

157
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,700
Concern leads to confusion.

158
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,460
These are rigged by someone.

159
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,440
Your Highness.

160
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,700
What to do now?

161
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,320
It's all your fault.

162
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,790
Why go to Good Match Pavilion?

163
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,030
We've been plotted against.

164
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,170
But

165
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,600
I didn't mean it.

166
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,510
At this point,

167
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:06,090
there's no use in pursuing accountability.

168
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,170
Your Highness,

169
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,270
what do you think should we do?

170
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,840
On the surface,

171
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,510
I'm expressing my feelings
to Princess Consort Qin.

172
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,560
But in fact,

173
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,980
I've driven her into a dead end.

174
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,267
Running away from home alone

175
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,390
can make the royal family lose face.

176
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,320
If they investigate

177
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,884
why did Princess Consort Qin
run away from home,

178
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,820
then politics are involved.

179
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,890
By then,

180
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,200
we will be in a completely passive situation.

181
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,480
So what should we do now?

182
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,050
I didn't expect that the great Prince Qin

183
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,670
is so affectionate.

184
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,460
This scene is big enough.

185
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,800
Mr. Xiao.

186
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,560
We are discussing with His Highness.

187
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,580
You came at the right time.

188
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,670
I have something to ask of you.

189
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:43,970
But

190
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,310
you can't let Changsheng know.

191
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,050
Nowadays, the people in the capital

192
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,980
all know

193
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,310
that I act capriciously

194
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,700
and don't have women's virtues.

195
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,150
At a horse raising red dust
the imperial concubine smiled.

196
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,800
Yang Guifei

197
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,940
really had no regrets in her life.

198
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,000
Princess Royal.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,700
What men do when they pursue women

200
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,550
can't let women suffer and bear the stigma.

201
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,720
But Jing has always been cautious.

202
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,600
He shouldn't have been so confused this time.

203
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,560
Someone must have fanned the flames

204
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,790
to place obstacles.

205
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,190
What you think

206
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,550
is also my concern.

207
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,720
If His Majesty knew about this...

208
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,790
Last night, Prince Qin entered the palace

209
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,910
to give up the attack on Fuyu.

210
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,940
Princess Royal, Mr. Xiao is here.

211
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,670
Just say I'm sick.

212
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,190
He's here to find Princess Changsheng.

213
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,940
For me?

214
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,820
Where are you taking me?

215
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,620
You'll know when you get there.

216
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,390
You had a quarrel with Princess Royal?

217
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,090
No.

218
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,890
Did Princess Royal

219
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,730
say anything?

220
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,940
She didn't.

221
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,860
But I always feel something is weird.

222
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,510
It was fine before.

223
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,620
But why today suddenly...

224
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,070
It's quite lively outside.

225
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,280
We've arrived.

226
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,280
Come.

227
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,820
What's the situation?

228
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,640
Look up.

229
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,010
Go quickly.

230
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,150
So many people are watching.

231
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,510
Prince Qin.

232
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,730
Changsheng.

233
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,010
The former warlike Prince Qin

234
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,940
no longer exists.

235
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,270
Now there's only Yi'an in Great Tang.

236
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,340
Can I trust you?

237
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,150
You can keep an eye on me

238
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,270
and always accompany me.

239
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,030
Let me never dare to act rashly again.

240
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,520
Changsheng.

241
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,390
I know what Fuyu means to you.

242
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,190
But I also want you to know

243
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,790
what you mean to me.

244
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,430
Now is not the time for romance.

245
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,100
Someone is using the kites to cause trouble.

246
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,270
We're in danger now.

247
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,820
This is the kite for praying for Great Tang.

248
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,270
Right now,

249
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,070
I want you to fly this kite

250
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,860
that represents prosperity.

251
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,400
Do you want to?

252
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,790
I wish I was the star and you were the moon.

253
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,340
Every night we can feel
each other's brilliance.

254
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,510
Then let's fly it in the sky.

255
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,900
(A Golden Harvest)

256
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,720
So many.

257
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,900
A golden harvest.

258
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,220
Princess, please stay.

259
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,290
If it's about what happened last time,

260
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,770
don't mind that.

261
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,030
It is about what happened last time.

262
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,430
Didn't you say that
I'm not crazy about Changsheng?

263
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,670
Today I have the answer.

264
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,070
It's unreasoning

265
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,680
passion,

266
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,010
and it's also

267
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,770
my obsession.

268
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,310
But all this has become the past.

269
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,190
I asked you to stay

270
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,620
because I want to thank you.

271
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,740
I've completely let go.

272
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,160
Thank you.

Please rise.

283
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

284
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,620
I've received the memorial.

285
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,050
Report the border issue

286
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,150
to Prince Qin.

287
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,920
Yes.

288
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,040
Your Highness.

289
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Since ancient times,

290
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,720
Great Tang and Dongpei

291
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,580
have had disputes over border issues.

292
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,960
The land of disputes

293
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,268
has been suffering from locust plagues.

294
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,390
This time I returned to Great Tang

295
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,650
specially to ask how Great Tang

296
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,860
is going to deal with this.

297
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,430
Jing, what do you think?

298
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,560
What measures

299
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,130
did Dongpei take for the locust disaster?

300
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,580
Dongpei is a vast country,

301
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,130
and the weather there is extremely cold.

302
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,080
They've sent people
to deal with it hastily several times.

303
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,250
But it was so ineffective, so they gave up.

304
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,290
But it's okay.

305
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,980
At the moment there is no locust infestation.

306
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,310
It's just for now.

307
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,215
Great Tang has four distinct seasons,

308
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,190
and is rich in rice.

309
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,813
Locusts are very likely to migrate inland.

310
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,970
By the time,

311
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,410
I'm afraid it'll be worse than Dongpei.

312
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,790
How do you think we should deal with this?

313
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,290
Father, though Dongpei and Great Tang

314
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,130
haven't been on good terms,

315
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
at present, the locust plague is serious.

316
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,699
So I beg you

317
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:55,640
to help with disaster relief

318
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,980
and defuse the conflict.

319
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,440
This will also benefit

320
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,280
Great Tang.

321
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,400
OK.

322
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,340
My son has grown up.

323
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,030
We'll do as you wish.

324
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,740
Also, you're in charge

325
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,800
of preventing locust plagues.

326
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,640
Yes, Father.

327
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,580
I will never let you down.

328
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,820
How can this be possible?

329
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,460
My careful plan

330
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,460
didn't harm Prince Qin in the slightest,

331
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,570
and Father also let him

332
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,480
be in charge of pest control and prevention.

333
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,580
It's because of my incompetence.

334
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,240
But locust control

335
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,860
is actually a hot potato.

336
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,250
I'm afraid that

337
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,530
it's just a thankless job.

338
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,910
Just because of this,

339
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,450
it's easier to show

340
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,620
his wisdom and strategy.

341
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,550
Prince Qin often fights on the battlefield

342
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,220
and is resourceful.

343
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,910
But he's not necessarily a talent

344
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,430
for pest control.

345
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,550
Have you ever heard of Mr. Huaishan?

346
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,150
You mean

347
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,430
the former prime minister

348
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,890
who helped Great Tang

349
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,800
initiate prosperity?

350
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,940
He is Jing's master.

351
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,190
Master?

352
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,310
Jing has invited him back now.

353
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,070
When Jing was young,

354
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,720
Father gave him

355
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,410
to Mr. Huaishan

356
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,550
and asked Mr. Huaishan

357
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,230
to guide him personally.

358
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,100
Even without a famous teacher,

359
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,580
you still grew up to be an outstanding person.

360
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,950
What do you know?

361
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,950
Enduring hardships for decades,

362
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,420
only I know

363
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,180
the flavor of it.

364
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,100
But I heard

365
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,930
that gentleman

366
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,310
has been traveling around for many years

367
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,040
without definite residence.

368
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,100
How did Prince Qin find him

369
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,750
in just a few days?

370
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,270
Mr. Huaishan has a granddaughter

371
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,840
named Ru Jing.

372
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,660
She grew up with Jing.

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,550
Miss Ru Jing admires Jing

374
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:38,980
and would marry no other men but him.

375
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,510
Mr. Huaishan

376
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,850
is afraid that Miss Ru Jing

377
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,100
would follow in her mother's footsteps,

378
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,420
so he took her on the trip.

379
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,810
But so many years have passed.

380
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,860
Miss Ru Jing still can't let go of Jing.

381
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,230
Everywhere she goes,

382
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,660
she writes a letter to him.

383
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,610
What happened to her mother?

384
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,900
Miss Ru Jing's father

385
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,480
is the Grand Marshal of Great Tang's army,

386
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,320
Ru Lin.

387
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:01,990
You mean

388
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,370
Marsal Lin who reclaimed

389
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,550
our homeland?

390
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,660
After recovering the homeland,

391
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,340
Ru Lin was assassinated by the enemy.

392
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,410
Soon,

393
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,140
Ru Jing's mother also passed away.

394
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,420
I didn't expect

395
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,310
there was such a history.

396
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,810
Miss Ru Jing likes my third brother.

397
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,230
Just a letter from him,

398
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,510
Mr. Huaishan

399
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,230
will definitely come back to help.

400
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,230
Since

401
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,230
you've already known this,

402
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,820
how about...

403
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,990
If it were someone else, it would be fine.

404
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,270
Miss Ru Jing has a special identity.

405
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,490
We can't do anything to her.

406
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,680
Not necessarily.

407
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,610
What do you mean?

408
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,710
It's just

409
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,820
we don't need to do it personally.

410
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,200
Fuyu's folk customs

411
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,420
is different from Great Tang's.

412
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,610
Miss Ru Jing

413
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,140
is passionately devoted to Lv Jing.

414
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,120
Her Highness

415
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,100
won't tolerate

416
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,620
to share her husband with someone else.

417
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,980
(Prince Qin's Mansion)
A few days ago, I wrote to Mr. Huaishan.

418
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,040
(By Ru Jing)
Today, he's planning

419
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,880
to return to the capital.

420
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,280
We should get prepared

421
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,470
to welcome Mr. Huaishan.

422
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,650
Okay.

423
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,690
Then

424
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,340
will Miss Ru Jing come back too?

425
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,380
Why do you have to mention this?

426
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,950
I want to make early arrangements.

427
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,660
There are boundaries between men and women.

428
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:23,790
We should separate their rooms.

429
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,600
Shut up.

430
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,930
Miss Ru Jing

431
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,770
will come too.

432
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,560
It's okay.

433
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,900
Your Highness, we are leaving.

434
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,860
It is more comfortable to live here.

435
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,650
Discuss it with me first.

436
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,890
Mr. Huaishan is coming back.

437
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,480
I don't know whether Miss Ru Jing

438
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,620
will come with him.

439
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,130
Be careful.

440
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,230
How flustered.

441
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,510
- Princess Consort Qin.
- Princess Consort Qin.

442
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,230
Yi'an, the weather is hot.

443
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,850
I prepared lotus seed soup for you

444
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,690
to cool off.

445
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,040
In a few days,

446
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,470
Mr. Huaishan is about to come to the capital.

447
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,860
I want to invite you

448
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,550
to welcome Mr. Huaishan.

449
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,750
Me?

450
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,330
You've already met the royal family.

451
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,170
Is there anything wrong

452
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,250
meeting my master?

453
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,040
Meet the royal family

454
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,180
is the procedure.

455
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,380
But welcoming Mr. Huaishan

456
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,820
feels like...

457
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,280
You're the mistress?

458
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,690
Yeah.

459
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,270
There are many rules in Great Tang.

460
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,100
I still don't understand them now.

461
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,015
If I,

462
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:28,260
the unmarried mistress
of Prince Qin's Mansion,

463
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:29,100
show any disrespect,

464
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,820
wouldn't it be a joke?

465
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,510
My master is not an outsider.

466
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,280
You are smart.

467
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,310
He will like you.

468
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,690
Should I

469
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,090
ask Princess Royal

470
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,710
to teach me the welcoming etiquettes?

471
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,170
Changsheng.

472
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,140
There is one thing

473
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,450
I haven't told you.

474
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,180
Me and Mr. Huaishan's...

475
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,490
Changsheng.

476
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,550
How did you come?

477
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,550
Aren't you supposed to be working
at Xiuwen Hall?

478
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,140
I'm here to look after His Highness.

479
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,480
His Highness is busy

480
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,370
with the locust control.

481
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,170
Being the mistress here

482
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,161
makes you look different now.

483
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:03,980
You're becoming more and more
like Princess Consort Qin.

484
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,810
If you keep talking nonsense,

485
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,820
I'll break your legs.

486
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,510
By the way, I'm not here to see you.

487
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,070
I'm here to see Prince Qin.

488
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,410
See me?

489
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,030
Let's talk in private.

490
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,620
At my house,

491
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,310
I became an outsider.

492
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,930
Come.

493
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,810
Mr. Xiao, what did you come to see me about?

494
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,790
Last time, I brought Changsheng to you

495
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,820
and helped you reconcile.

496
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,280
This time it's your turn

497
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,380
to return the favor.

498
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,130
Go ahead, as long as it...

499
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,370
As long as it doesn't go against rules,

500
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,070
doesn't violate principles
and betray the country.

501
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,230
This is a small matter for you.

502
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,520
All right.

503
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,730
Tell me.

504
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,070
Here's the thing.

505
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,250
One day,

506
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:57,550
Princess Royal and I were
compiling books at Xiuwen Hall.

507
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,680
What are you laughing at?

508
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,070
Princess Royal, this is so funny.

509
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,650
Take a look.

510
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,860
Look at this.

511
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,230
Isn't it funny?

512
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,950
Not funny at all.

513
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,660
I think it's quite interesting.

514
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,810
Princess Royal, let me add some water.

515
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,650
Okay.

516
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,710
Books are not allowed to be taken out.

517
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,140
I'll leave it here and come back later.

518
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,980
(Steamed cake and honey)

519
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,510
(What's the noise?)

520
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,950
(A pig spirit?)

521
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,970
Princess Royal.

522
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,840
She hasn't let me

523
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,280
enter Xiuwen Hall since then

524
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,510
and also her palace.

525
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,070
Why did you go to see my aunt?

526
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,690
We are friends.

527
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,550
It's natural to take care of each other.

528
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,330
No wonder you haven't
come to my mansion lately.

529
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,620
So you went to Princess Royal's palace.

530
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,410
If you are willing,

531
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,860
then I will visit you often.

532
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Anyway, Changsheng should be very free

533
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,310
and boring.

534
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,070
That's not necessary.

535
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,140
Me and Changsheng are getting along well.

536
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,946
You should go to Princess Royal's palace more.

537
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,610
The key is that I can't get in.

538
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,650
Then let her come out.

539
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,230
That's why I came to find you.

540
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,550
Why do you come to see me?

541
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,010
Go find her.

542
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,280
Don't burn the bridges.

543
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,000
When Changsheng was mad at you at that time,

544
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,470
how did I help you?

545
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,730
I know.

546
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,170
Alright.

547
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,470
I'll help you.

548
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,270
But there is a question.

549
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,673
You have to answer me truthfully.

550
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,180
Okay.

551
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,900
When Aunt was a child,

552
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,914
she was often amused to laugh
when she watched plays.

553
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,270
But she got startled once.

554
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,230
Since then, she's had
the problem you mentioned.

555
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,820
So she never smiles in front of others.

556
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,200
You don't mind that?

557
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,477
I am proficient in the art of Qihuang,

558
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:13,273
and have seen all kinds of
miscellaneous diseases.

559
00:24:13,303 --> 00:24:14,340
Of course I don't mind.

560
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,900
So you met my aunt

561
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,620
to treat miscellaneous diseases?

562
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,580
Or you have feelings for her?

563
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,130
Don't you just have one question?

564
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,040
You have asked it.

565
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,480
Just tell me whether you will help me.

566
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,340
Okay, I'll help.

567
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,660
Go back and wait.

568
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,600
OK.

569
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,650
See you.

570
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,200
One couple for a lifetime,

571
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,470
half drunk, half awake, half floating.

572
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,570
Is Mr. Huaishan going back to the capital?

573
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,970
You could know everything

574
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,330
without leaving home.

575
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,170
I'm impressed.

576
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,710
Ru Jing is coming back too?

577
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,490
Yes.

578
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,480
It was Ru Jing who helped me find Mr. Huaishan.

579
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,900
I'm afraid she has brought you back to trouble.

580
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,310
Don't worry, Aunt.

581
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,990
I have nothing to worry about.

582
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,380
After all, this is about you and Changsheng.

583
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,180
It is useless for others to say much.

584
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,510
That said,

585
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,950
I don't know how I should tell her.

586
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,990
I shall love you

587
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,030
to the end of time.

588
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,850
Till mountains crumble, streams run dry,

589
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,950
thunder rumbles in winter,
snow falls in summer,

590
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,370
and the earth mingles with the sky.

591
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,790
Not till then will I cease to love you.

592
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,510
This is what Ru Jing sang to you when she left.

593
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,970
So many years have passed,

594
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,140
and her thoughts are in tune with the song.

595
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,620
Aunt.

596
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,890
You are making fun of me.

597
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,950
I just appreciate her love for you.

598
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,990
Changsheng and I are in love with each other.

599
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,120
Say it.

600
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,250
Aunt.

601
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,100
I have something urgent to do. I have to go.

602
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,170
You take your time.

603
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,180
You called me here but you're leaving?

604
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,340
You also need someone to accompany you.

605
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,360
Princess Royal.

606
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,360
What a coincidence.

607
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,660
Indeed.

608
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,100
There is still work to do at Xiuwen Hall.

609
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,470
I'm going back.

610
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,840
I'll accompany you.

611
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,990
What do you want to do?

612
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,320
I want to go to Xiuwen Hall

613
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,340
to help you deal with things.

614
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,230
Why do you keep hiding from me?

615
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,820
When did I hide from you?

616
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,820
Then let's go together.

617
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,170
But now I

618
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,790
don't want to go to Xiuwen Hall anymore.

619
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,120
It's fine.

620
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,410
I will go with you

621
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,860
wherever you want to go.

622
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,420
(Recollections of Jokes)

623
00:27:05,518 --> 00:27:07,340
(Du Yunban, Recollections of Jokes
Chen Shijie, Guo Duhua)

624
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,531
Princess Royal, rest assured.

625
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,280
I have already replaced
"Recollections of Jokes"

626
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,610
with "Floating Dream".

627
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,470
It's not funny.

628
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,300
(Yihe Tower)

629
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,620
Please enjoy your meal.

630
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,860
(Content and Happy)

631
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,030
Do you like to eat sour food?

632
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,520
No.

633
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,860
That's good.

634
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,130
Eating sour food can nourish the liver,

635
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,310
but it hurts the spleen.

636
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,470
What about bitter food?

637
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,510
No.

638
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,270
That's good too.

639
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,760
Bitter food nourishes the heart

640
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,860
but hurts the lungs.

641
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,070
What medicine do you usually take?

642
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,140
Arsenic.

643
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,550
Arsenic is good...

644
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,950
It doesn't seem good for your health.

645
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,240
If you're free,

646
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,550
can you let me

647
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,100
take your pulse?

648
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,440
If you have nothing else,

649
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,470
I'll leave first.

650
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,690
Princess Royal.

651
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,690
Princess Royal.

652
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,360
Princess Royal.

653
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,970
Mr. Xiao, are you okay?

654
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,040
I'm fine. I'm fine.

655
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,880
Don't worry.

656
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,070
Why does this woman laugh like a pig?

657
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,320
Yes.

658
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,690
Why is there such a strange laugh?

659
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,810
It's true.

660
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,570
A young lady is laughing like this.

661
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,240
- Princess Royal.
- She laughed like a pig.

662
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,900
I was wondering where the pig noise came from.

663
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,030
Wait.

664
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,790
You stop.

665
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,790
Is the opinion of others that important?

666
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,310
So what if your laugh is not pleasant to hear?

667
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,690
You just need to be happy.

668
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,140
You don't live for others.

669
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,410
Others don't care, what about you?

670
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,520
I don't care.

671
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,480
Then you wouldn't have replaced
"Recollections of Jokes"

672
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,550
with "Floating Dream".

673
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,800
If you don't care,

674
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,960
you wouldn't think of using medicine

675
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,130
to cure my laughter.

676
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,170
If you don't care,

677
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,100
you wouldn't lie to me and say you don't care.

678
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,380
Because I care about you.

679
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,270
I know you care.

680
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,600
Princess Royal.

681
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,780
(Huadeng Pavilion)

682
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,040
Are you sure

683
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,310
this is the hairstyle
of the mistresses in Great Tang?

684
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,170
I think

685
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,750
it's almost the same as usual.

686
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,760
There is still a difference.

687
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,170
It looks

688
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,340
more vigorous than usual.

689
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,720
Yeah.

690
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,030
Wear this too.

691
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,310
The makeup is complete.

692
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,520
No, no.

693
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,470
This doesn't suit my taste.

694
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,560
I don't want it.

695
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,750
It's quite good-looking.

696
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,100
Your Highness.

697
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,710
You will be the mistress
of Prince Qin's Mansion.

698
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,180
You can't act like before.

699
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,060
Be steady.

700
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,810
I haven't married His Highness yet.

701
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,760
His Highness asked you

702
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,030
to welcome Mr. Huaishan as a mistress.

703
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,470
Your position is confirmed.

704
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,507
In Great Tang,

705
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:32,990
husband and wife share equal amounts of power.

706
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,550
You have to take good care of this home.

707
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,510
You know so much.

708
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,380
His Highness is here.

709
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,860
Your Highness.

710
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,520
You guys leave first.

711
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,360
Yes.

712
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,550
This dress makes you look more beautiful.

713
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,170
Really?

714
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,550
But with Great Tang's etiquettes,

715
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,420
it'll highlight the beauty.

716
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,240
Come, I will teach you

717
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,310
the etiquette of the mistress.

718
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,840
Like this.

719
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,890
Since you entered the mansion,

720
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,710
I've always wanted you to see something.

721
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,900
Your Highness.

722
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,000
Are you too impatient?

723
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,610
We'll see it after we get married.

724
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,720
It won't be too late.

725
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,550
No, it's been delayed for too long.

726
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,690
I can't stand it anymore.

727
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,790
You must take a look.

728
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,990
Anyway, the engagement has been made.

729
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,270
I can see it.

730
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,890
Princess Consort Qin.

731
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,790
Something terrible has happened.

732
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,280
Calm down.

733
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
Just tell me slowly.

734
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,570
After Princess Royal returned home,

735
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,750
she's refused to go out.

736
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,070
I'm worried...

737
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,840
- Lead the way.
- Yes.

738
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,030
Princess Royal's matter is important.

739
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,250
We

740
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:44,790
can take our time.

741
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,970
Okay.

742
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,580
Here it is.

743
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,990
My heart is determined

744
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,620
like this hairpin.

745
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,810
After Mr. Xiao came,

746
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,070
Princess Royal got angry.

747
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,810
She locked herself in the room

748
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,180
and wouldn't open the door.

749
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,410
She hasn't eaten anything

750
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,270
for three or four days.

751
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,140
This Xiao Zilv

752
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,030
dared to make her angry.

753
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,340
How did he make her angry?

754
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,930
This is Princess Royal's secret.

755
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,070
I dare not say it.

756
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,340
But anyway, he embarrassed
Princess Royal in public.

757
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,030
Embarrassed her in public?

758
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,280
Aunt is such a high-spirited person.

759
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,790
How can she bear such grievance?

760
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,420
(Fine Spirits of the Universe)

761
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,130
- Aunt.
- Princess Royal.

762
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,030
Aunt.

763
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,790
Princess Royal.

764
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,420
- Princess Royal.
- What are you doing?

765
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,130
Princess Royal.

766
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,380
How come you're here?

767
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,550
I should ask you this.

768
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:53,720
Princess Royal.

769
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,470
I'm so glad you're okay.

770
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,380
What could happen to me?

771
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,470
I thought...

772
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,620
The door is broken.

773
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,990
Remember to ask someone to fix it tomorrow.

774
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,280
Then

775
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,870
how did you get out?

776
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,870
Through the window.

777
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,840
Aunt.

778
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,180
Look at my new outfit.

779
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,320
How about it?

780
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,990
This is old-fashioned.

781
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,580
Lingzhi, go get my pink outfit.

782
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:28,730
Yes.

783
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,360
Get changed.

784
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,120
There is such a beautiful mistress dress.

785
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,410
How could you have this?

786
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,660
I have to look good

787
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,950
for occasional business dealings.

788
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,930
You also do business?

789
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,690
Great Tang advocates self-reliance.

790
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,180
Even the royal family is no exception.

791
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,830
I like this.

792
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,800
By the way,

793
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,210
I heard that

794
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,700
Xiao Zilv made you angry.

795
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,050
No.

796
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,620
Don't worry, Aunt.

797
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,730
Xiao Zilv

798
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,700
is just a scum.

799
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,810
Tell me, I'll get revenge

800
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,780
for you.

801
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,870
If I say no, then I mean no.

802
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,830
Your clothes are old.

803
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,700
So your etiquettes must be outdated.

804
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,890
Tomorrow,

805
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,200
can you teach me some

806
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,140
new etiquettes?

807
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,480
After all, what Jinyan

808
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,410
and Shenxing learned

809
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,470
are all old-fashioned.

810
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,050
Okay.

811
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,000
The words and deeds
of the mistress of Great Tang

812
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,660
represent the etiquette of the house.

813
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,210
If there is any mistake,

814
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,550
she will definitely lose grace.

815
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,910
I just put this hairpin on you

816
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,600
so that in the future...

817
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,620
I know, shake it with each step.

818
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,960
It looks beautiful, right?

819
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,950
No.

820
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,250
The hairpin

821
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,220
is to restrict your walking.

822
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,180
You can't shake it at all.

823
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,120
Why are you stuttering?

824
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,960
Nonsense.

825
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,740
Let's try it later.

826
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,430
Walk slowly.

827
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,350
Make sure that every step is stable.

828
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,550
Keep your head up and your chest out.

829
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,440
Lower your wrists.

830
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,520
Bend your knees.

831
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,360
Get up.

832
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,220
Lift the skirt.

833
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,570
Kneel.

834
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,780
Then put your forehead on your hands

835
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,050
like this.

836
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,390
Lift your skirt and stand up.

837
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,950
Hands clasped.

838
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,180
That'll be all.

839
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,440
Aunt,

840
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,260
what does half tea and full wine mean?

841
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,930
The mistress

842
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,950
is the role model for the house.

843
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,850
The so-called half tea and full wine

844
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,070
shows sincerity.

845
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,780
Although there are servants
helping to pour wine,

846
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,640
when we raise our glasses,

847
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,740
be careful

848
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,550
not to spill.

849
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,570
