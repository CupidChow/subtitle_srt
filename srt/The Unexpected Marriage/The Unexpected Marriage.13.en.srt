=Episode 13=

3
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,760
Pay more attention to the roots.

4
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,620
Thanks.

5
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,200
Your Highness, please go back.

6
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,260
I'll stay here.

7
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,300
Muyan trees should be kept away from rain.

8
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,600
After the heavy rain,

9
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,240
I'm afraid these saplings are...

10
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,320
Your Highness, but...

11
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,520
Say no more.

12
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,300
How did you come?

13
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,360
You didn't take an umbrella.
Your clothes are soaked.

14
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,020
Let me do it.

15
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,140
Just covering the tree with a water cloth

16
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,280
doesn't help much.

17
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,260
The soil on the ground
also needs to be covered.

18
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,090
Otherwise, the accumulated water
will damage the roots.

19
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,140
But the water cloth is not enough.

20
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,280
We can't cover them all.

21
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,020
Your Highness.

22
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,860
- Your Highness.
- I brought water cloth.

23
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,500
Youyong and Youmou,
bring the water cloth over.

24
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,300
- Yes.
- Let's save the Muyan trees together.

25
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,140
Okay.

26
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,820
You guys come with me.

27
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,760
I'll help you hold it.

28
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,860
Your Highness, teach me how to save the trees.

29
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,540
The Muyan saplings are very delicate.

30
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,340
No exposure to the sun, no water accumulation.

31
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,880
It is not fully grown until the tenth year.

32
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,600
These saplings are in the first year.

33
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,220
So for the next three years,

34
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,360
we need to take special care of them.

35
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,000
Not to mention producing salt,

36
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,320
even survival is a problem.

37
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,960
Let's go look at that tree.

38
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,100
Okay.

39
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,560
This needs to be re-tied.

40
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,780
Mr. Xiao.

41
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,400
I would like to mention one more thing.

42
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,160
If you miss someone, you miss them forever.

43
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,160
Even if you follow her to Great Tang,

44
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,760
it doesn't help.

45
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,700
Come on.

46
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,780
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

47
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,620
(Pure Like Orchids)

48
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,920
- You...
- You...

49
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,980
You go first.

50
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,700
Next time you're in this situation,

51
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,800
send someone to notify me.

52
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,060
It was raining so hard.

53
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,220
It's not safe to go out rashly.

54
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,460
It was an emergency.

55
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,760
I couldn't think so much.

56
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,140
I wanted to tell you,

57
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,360
but you were not home.

58
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
If the Muyan trees are gone,
we can plant them again.

59
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,400
But what if you get injured or sick?

60
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,820
It doesn't matter.

61
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,080
I'm in good health.

62
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,420
I won't get sick from the rain.

63
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,260
I don't allow it.

64
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,380
I'm afraid

65
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,120
you're not worried about me
getting wet in the rain,

66
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,520
but Xiao Zilv.

67
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,100
I'm just afraid

68
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,280
you'll get wet in the rain.

69
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,560
I don't want you to get too close to him.

70
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,340
Neither this nor that.

71
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,960
I want to get closer to him.

72
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,900
Changsheng.

73
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,340
Your Highness, did you

74
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,280
catch a cold last night?

75
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,640
I'm going to find a doctor.

76
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,920
No need.

77
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,340
Why?

78
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,580
It's not serious.

79
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,700
There's no need to call a doctor.

80
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,600
Let me feel the pulse.

81
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,780
My pulse is steady

82
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,880
and my breathing is smooth.

83
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,620
I'm not sick.

84
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,600
Help me get Xiao Zilv's medicine box...

85
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,080
It's just a cold.

86
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,600
Nothing serious.

87
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,200
Your Highness.

88
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,900
I'm just embarrassed.

89
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,540
We just need to get a doctor.

90
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,140
Why is it like you're getting a husband?

91
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,980
Are we really going to invite Prince Qin over?

92
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,860
Okay, I'll go to Prince Qin's Mansion now.

93
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,700
All right.

94
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,940
Well...

95
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,120
It's because of Lv Jing.

96
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,420
If he knew

97
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,420
I really got sick because of the rain,

98
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,940
that'll be embarrassing.

99
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,900
Your Highness.

100
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,220
Just because you are sick,

101
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,600
you need to tell Prince Qin.

102
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,100
We have to make him worry.

103
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,120
Otherwise, you will be sick for nothing.

104
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,760
Who wants him to worry about me?

105
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,540
Alright.

106
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,180
I'm going to sleep.

107
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,020
You guys get out now.

108
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,060
Don't bother me.

109
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,660
Go now.

110
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,220
Your Highness.

111
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,120
I'm sorry

112
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,520
for not protecting Her Highness well.

113
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,680
I know I was wrong.

114
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,160
Please punish me.

115
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,040
It's because of my thoughtlessness.

116
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,740
Get up.

117
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,840
Did Her Highness say anything?

118
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,260
Yes.

119
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,740
Her Highness

120
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,920
kept looking towards the door.

121
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,200
I asked her what was wrong,

122
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,980
and she only said

123
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,280
this tree looks nice

124
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,720
and she wants to take a closer look.

125
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,660
She asked about the species of the tree

126
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,020
and your whereabouts

127
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,240
so she could ask you personally.

128
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,820
Ask me

129
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,400
about the tree?

130
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,660
Your Highness.

131
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,720
Do you know what species this tree is?

132
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,800
Flying with no rest,

133
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,960
where shall they nest?

134
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,400
What does this mean?

135
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,420
Changsheng.

136
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,940
Changsheng.

137
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,600
Don't bother me.

138
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,120
Princess Royal, drink some snow fungus soup.

139
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,660
Princess Royal, you have bronchitis.

140
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,980
You don't rest well

141
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,460
and only take care of these books.

142
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,820
Do you still want to look after your health?

143
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,440
It was fine.

144
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,780
After hearing you say it,

145
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,080
I started coughing.

146
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,420
In my opinion,

147
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,260
you should hand over the work
to the subordinates.

148
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,290
Otherwise they still have time

149
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,420
to gossip

150
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,360
and discredit you.

151
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,880
The weather is wet.

152
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,080
If I don't iron the books, they'll be broken.

153
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,100
If I leave the work to them,

154
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,080
they will get broken faster.

155
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,600
I'll go ask Doctor Yuan to check on you.

156
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,600
You can't keep coughing like this.

157
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,960
Wait.

158
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,740
Ask Doctor Yuan

159
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,520
to take the medical official of Fuyu.

160
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,620
Yes.

161
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,420
(Cure Sickness and Save Lives)

162
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,700
(Scallop, Cassia)

163
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,060
How many times have I told you?

164
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,960
Five grams sulfur less

165
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,480
will reduce its efficacy.

166
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,980
Even one gram is related to a person's life.

167
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,840
Yuan.

168
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,440
This isn't right.

169
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,340
Your teaching method

170
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,740
doesn't work,

171
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,380
and the students are suffering too.

172
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,740
You are jealous of me.

173
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,740
Jealous of you?

174
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,160
Why am I jealous of you?

175
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,260
You are jealous that my students

176
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,360
are more talented than yours.

177
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,900
Bad news.

178
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,300
Bad news.

179
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,260
Lingzhi from Princess Royal's Palace is coming.

180
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,100
What?

181
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,060
We're done for.

182
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,700
Princess Royal must be sick.

183
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,300
Don't panic.

184
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,900
Princess Royal must be looking for

185
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,080
Doctor Yuan.

186
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,420
Yes.

187
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,940
I don't know which student of Doctor Yuan's

188
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,860
is going to suffer.

189
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,500
- Look.
- He has to go auscultating with him.

190
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,560
Doctor Yuan.

191
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,220
She's here.

192
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,960
Doctor Yuan.

193
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,540
Yuan.

194
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,160
Someone is asking for you.

195
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,040
Miss Lingzhi is here.

196
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,760
I guess it's Princess Royal.

197
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,440
Please come with me to the palace.

198
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,100
Princess Royal said

199
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,620
this time she wants
to try Fuyu's medical skills.

200
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,520
Fuyu?

201
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,760
Xiao Zilv?

202
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,380
Zilv.

203
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,960
Come here.

204
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,720
Get ready, we'll go

205
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,840
to Princess Royal's Palace together.

206
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,340
Yes.

207
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,120
Then I'll take my leave first.

208
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,180
Doctor Yuan.

209
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,300
Come with me to the mansion quickly.

210
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,340
Princess Consort Qin is sick.

211
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,220
What?

212
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,060
Changsheng's sick?

213
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,180
Yes.

214
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,740
Someone just came
and said that Princess Royal was ill.

215
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,580
Well...

216
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,660
I see.

217
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,780
Then,

218
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,540
I have to trouble Doctor Ma.

219
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,790
Princess Consort Qin is seriously ill.

220
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,540
We have no time to waste.

221
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,660
Let's go.

222
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,580
Go.

223
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,680
Princess Consort Qin
has Prince Qin to take care of her.

224
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,740
Hurry to the Princess Royal's Palace.

225
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,580
Go.

226
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,140
Mr. Yuan.

227
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,280
May I ask

228
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,860
why no one in the Imperial Academy of Medicine

229
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,800
wants to treat Princess Royal?

230
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,320
It’s a long story.

231
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,140
Princess Royal

232
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,340
is not to be trifled with.

233
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,660
She's cold

234
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,840
and doesn't usually show

235
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,540
any expressions to people.

236
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,420
Although she is His Majesty's
biological sister,

237
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,120
she seems to be older

238
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,860
than you.

239
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,880
She is young, but has a high status,

240
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,060
and has read many books.

241
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,680
She's just hard to please.

242
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,860
When you treat her later,

243
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,740
don't mention marriage

244
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,200
in front of her.

245
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,300
She often scoffs at this kind of thing.

246
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,000
Princess Royal is not married yet?

247
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,200
Are you surprised?

248
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,340
When you calm down,

249
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,000
just pretend you know nothing.

250
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,900
Okay.

251
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,540
Princess Royal specifically asked you to come.

252
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,000
Don't make any mistakes in front of her.

253
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm counting on you to be my apprentice.

254
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,520
Princess Royal asked for me?

255
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,700
Yes.

256
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,540
Let's go.

257
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,160
This smell seems a bit familiar.

258
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,040
- Smell?
- I seem to have smelled it somewhere.

259
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,100
Princess Royal.

260
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,120
Doctor Yuan is here.

261
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,760
Let him take my pulse.

262
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,540
He...

263
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,900
Today, Princess Royal

264
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,400
wants you to take her pulse.

265
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,560
Don't worry, I'll help you out.

266
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,900
Okay.

267
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,820
Princess Royal.

268
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,280
You all leave us first.

269
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,920
He can stay with me.

270
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,220
Yes.

271
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,520
Doctor, please.

272
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,060
It's you.

273
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,800
I have never seen you
in the Imperial Academy of Medicine before.

274
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,680
I just got there a while ago.

275
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,860
What's your name?

276
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,620
Xiao Zilv.

277
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,400
Where are you from?

278
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,780
Fuyu.

279
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,280
You're not afraid of me?

280
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,080
You specifically asked me to come here.

281
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,720
You must have known my last name,

282
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,120
and my background.

283
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,920
So what do I have to hide?

284
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,180
I heard

285
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,580
Great Tang and Fuyu's
medical skills are different.

286
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,100
I want to see what the doctor of Fuyu

287
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,160
is capable of.

288
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,080
Princess Royal, do you feel tired and sweaty,

289
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,440
have trouble sleeping
and wake up easily at night?

290
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,940
So what?

291
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,880
Sorry for the offense.

292
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,280
Bear with it, Princess Royal.

293
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,880
I just pressed the Taibai Gongsun acupoint.

294
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,020
Giving it a regular massage

295
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,880
can stabilize your pulse.

296
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,400
Do you feel better now?

297
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,440
It really worked.

298
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,520
Glad to hear.

299
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,640
Then I'll give you
some cold-relieving medicine.

300
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,700
Take it on time.

301
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,660
Okay.

302
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,940
Your Highness.

303
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,460
Her Highness got sick because of the cold.

304
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,860
I'm going to write some prescriptions

305
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,340
for dispelling cold and reducing fever.

306
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,360
Then she'll be fine.

307
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,040
How did you come here, Mr. Ma?

308
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,240
It took so much time.

309
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,120
I came here by carriage.

310
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,900
The horses are slow.

311
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,720
I will replace them
with some fast-running horses.

312
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,100
I am old.

313
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,420
Next time I will walk fast

314
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,840
to treat Her Highness.

315
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,880
Yes, Your Highness.

316
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:04,060
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

317
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,960
The horse is slow.

318
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,580
The job at the Imperial Academy of Medicine

319
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,680
is really hard to do.

320
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,900
(Fine Spirits of the Universe)

321
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,560
- You're out.
- Yes.

322
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,840
Are you okay?

323
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,060
What could happen?

324
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,040
Let me see. Let me see.

325
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,800
Well, well.

326
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,140
- You're fine.
- Yeah.

327
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,800
You're not hurt, are you?

328
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,680
Very good.

329
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,760
Sir, is there a way to treat it?

330
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,140
This is the prescription.

331
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,000
Take one per day for 30 days

332
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,100
without interruption.

333
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,400
This prescription was approved
by Princess Royal?

334
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,500
Sure.

335
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,740
Any problem?

336
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,540
This is what you don't know.

337
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,860
When I was prescribing medicine
for Princess Royal,

338
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,560
she always questioned me.

339
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,620
I had to explain until she was convinced.

340
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,800
I just do

341
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,140
whatever she says.

342
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,640
Patients have the right to know

343
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,640
what medicine they take.

344
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,380
I think Princess Royal

345
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,980
is responsible for her own body.

346
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,880
This attitude is correct.

347
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,500
Since Princess Royal approved,

348
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,960
I'll have to trouble you, Mr. Xiao.

349
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,980
Please.

350
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,140
What are you doing?

351
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,180
You scared me.

352
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,320
Youmou said

353
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,880
no one can disturb His and Her Highnesses.

354
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,340
You mean His Highness

355
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,760
is now in Her Highness's room?

356
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,400
I understand.

357
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,060
I'm leaving now.

358
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,780
Youmou is really thoughtful.

359
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,620
Wait a moment.

360
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,520
- Why?
- What do you mean?

361
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,920
What do you mean

362
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,060
by "thoughtful"?

363
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,060
Wait until you have someone you like,

364
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,160
you will know why.

365
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,200
How do you know I don't have one?

366
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,580
You're awake.

367
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,740
Why are you here?

368
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,580
Come.

369
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,880
Drink the medicine first.

370
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,160
Why am I so tightly covered?

371
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,880
The cold weather

372
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,120
will cause you a cold.

373
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,020
The doors and windows are all closed.

374
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,260
Where does the wind come from?

375
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,300
You still need to cover yourself.

376
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,800
Here. Don't get burned.

377
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,900
Why is this medicine still hot?

378
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,560
I kept it warm over low heat.

379
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,600
You've always been here?

380
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,680
Open your mouth.

381
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,720
All right.

382
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,320
I'm going to sleep.

383
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,960
I still feel dizzy.

384
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,300
You go to sleep.

385
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,420
Call me if you need anything.

386
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,180
I'm not used to you

387
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,760
being like this.

388
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,400
Then get used to it.

389
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,740
It's still a bit hot.

390
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,080
Sleep a little longer.

391
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,040
I'll go read the rest of the memorials.

392
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,800
Up to you.

393
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,960
Princess Royal, your medicine is here.

394
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,500
Princess.

395
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,800
You never drank medicine before.

396
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,760
I wonder how Mr. Xiao

397
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,760
persuaded you to drink medicine.

398
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,380
Princess.

399
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,920
Why is your face so red?

400
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,400
Is it because it's too stuffy in the room?

401
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,040
I'll open the window.

402
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,240
That's how it feels.

403
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,280
Princess, what did you say?

404
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,160
Nothing.

405
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,780
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

406
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,500
(Youlan Pavilion)

407
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,860
How is the taste?

408
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,280
A bit light.

409
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,220
The taste is too strong.

410
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,340
Don't eat too much of it.

411
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,200
- I want more.
- Changsheng.

412
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,160
Xiao Zilv.

413
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,980
Why are you here?

414
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,720
Shouldn't I be asking you this?

415
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,820
Sit, sit, sit.

416
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,140
You got sick.

417
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,740
Are you feeling better?

418
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,280
It's okay, a minor illness.

419
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,100
Come on, give me your hand.

420
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,940
I'll take your pulse.

421
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,540
Come on.

422
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,720
The pulse is still a little weak.

423
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,840
Don't run around these two days.

424
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,100
Take a good rest.

425
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,180
If I continue to rest like this,

426
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,440
I will lose weight.

427
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,700
When you’re better,

428
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,400
I'll take you to eat delicious food.

429
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,580
Okay.

430
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,220
Mr. Xiao is unfamiliar with the place.

431
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,820
I'm afraid you don't know
where the delicious food

432
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,740
is in Luojing.

433
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,180
Isn't that something

434
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,060
you can just ask around for?

435
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,620
You can ask around

436
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,000
but you may not be able to eat it.

437
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,140
Makes sense.

438
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,540
Yi'an is familiar with this place.

439
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,120
We can follow him.

440
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,460
Yiyi.

441
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,120
Your appetite is increasing day by day.

442
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,360
You don't know.

443
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,540
Last month,

444
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,440
Lv Hou actually went to a brothel.

445
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,580
Although I know

446
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,240
he doesn't have the guts to do anything,

447
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,560
I'm still angry.

448
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,420
I can't eat all day.

449
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
I've lost weight.

450
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,020
Now my vital energy and blood are weak.

451
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,200
I have to replenish my energies.

452
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,000
Hou is good in every way,

453
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,080
but he just likes visiting brothels.

454
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,960
I get angry just thinking about it.

455
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,980
Last time,

456
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,920
the Princess of Fuyu

457
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,500
performed a dance,

458
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,660
and Lv Hou

459
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,340
couldn't stop looking at her.

460
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,480
Princess of Fuyu?

461
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,620
You mean Princess Consort Qin?

462
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,600
That vixen

463
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,160
doesn't look like a good person.

464
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,080
Mother.

465
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,120
You have to help me.

466
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,400
Alright.

467
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,560
Princess Consort Qin
has been in Luojing for so long.

468
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,000
I haven't heard any news of hers.

469
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,060
She only stays in Prince Qin's villa

470
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,280
and doesn't even go out.

471
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,040
It's really a bit confusing.

472
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,060
Mother.

473
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,040
Why don't you summon her

474
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,600
and find out what she's like?

475
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,620
Oh no.

476
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,560
Where's my book?

477
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,100
Your Highness.

478
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,040
You are here too.

479
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,960
You climbed over the wall again?

480
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,020
Are you so anxious

481
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,380
to marry into my mansion?

482
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,480
Who said that?

483
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,140
I'm just cured.

484
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,020
So I came to walk around.

485
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,860
You climbed over the wall

486
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,140
to walk around?

487
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,260
Yes.

488
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,640
I'm tired of staying at Huadeng Pavilion.

489
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,780
I miss the unparalleled scenery

490
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,160
of your mansion,

491
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,220
that's why I came.

492
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,840
Unparalleled.

493
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,480
Did you lose something suddenly?

494
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,940
No.

495
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,480
I didn't lose anything.

496
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,820
Your Highness.

497
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,700
Well,

498
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,100
excuse me.

499
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,120
You can speak.

500
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,760
The imperial palace sent an invitation

501
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,160
to invite Her Highness over.

502
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,050
(Consort De prepared exquisite refreshments
and invites Princess Changsheng to taste them)

503
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,900
Leave us.

504
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,100
Yes.

505
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,860
What's wrong?

506
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,060
It's Consort De.

507
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,140
She invited you to the palace.

508
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,380
Me?

509
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,240
Can I not go?

510
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,840
Don't you want to see the scenery?

511
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,560
The view of the Imperial Garden

512
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,660
is the best in the world.

513
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,480
It's not the same.

514
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
If you don't want to go,

515
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,260
I'll help you refuse it.

516
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,340
Never mind.

517
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,380
What?

518
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,560
We'll see each other sooner or later.

519
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,300
I can't avoid

520
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,340
these people and things forever.

521
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,080
You are the master here.

522
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,620
You can say and do

523
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,460
whatever you want.

524
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,920
But the palace is different.

525
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,080
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

526
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,360
Consort De is the Second Prince
Lv Hou's mother.

527
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,340
She never liked me.

528
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,340
It will inevitably affect you.

529
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,020
Before, Liu Yiyi deliberately
wanted to embarrass you

530
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,860
at the welcome banquet.

531
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,200
It is also because of this reason.

532
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,720
So

533
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,280
it's another ambush?

534
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,460
That's right.

535
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,560
From what I know about them,

536
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,280
there are several situations that might happen.

537
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,560
After you enter the palace,

538
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,120
just do as I say.

539
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,980
Okay.

540
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,780
I, Changsheng,

541
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,080
pay respects to you.

542
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,560
Consort De has always been like this.

543
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,720
She likes to show her severity.

544
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,060
Normally she uses the excuse

545
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,920
that she fell asleep.

546
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,800
Princess Consort Qin is here.

547
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,440
I, Changsheng,

548
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,920
pay respects to you.

549
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,600
Get up, get up.

550
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,300
I'm old.

551
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,260
I can easily

552
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,840
take a nap anywhere.

553
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,380
The solution is simple.

554
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,200
Praise her as much as you can.

555
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,560
You must be joking.

556
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,560
With all due respect,

557
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,660
I didn't even dare to recognize you

558
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,880
when I came.

559
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,620
Because I saw the one sitting on the seat

560
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,080
was obviously a young woman.

561
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,880
Doesn't look like a mother who raised a prince.

562
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,540
You're honeymouthed.

563
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,520
Come and sit next to me.

564
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,140
I'm just telling the truth.

565
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,420
Fuyu is a small place.

566
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,540
I've never seen

567
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,680
such a radiant beauty like you.

568
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,980
Child,

569
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,180
at the banquet last time,

570
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,360
your dance was astonishing.

571
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,520
I didn't get to see you properly.

572
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,560
I heard you were sick a few days ago.

573
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,620
Are you feeling better now?

574
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,900
Just a common cold.

575
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,820
I'm much better now.

576
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,360
That's good. That's good.

577
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,260
Generally speaking,

578
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,200
Consort De

579
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,420
will then let people drink

580
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,620
bitter tea.

581
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,980
Have a taste.

582
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,760
It's our favorite flavor.

583
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,140
All the people in the palace

584
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,240
likes to drink it.

585
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,240
What do you think?

586
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,260
Looking at your expression,

587
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,360
you don't seem to like it.

588
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,800
How could it be?

589
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,740
But this tea

590
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,560
is really interesting.

591
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,540
It tastes bitter as soon as I drink it,

592
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,560
but there is a sweet aftertaste.

593
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,840
Like after suffering comes happiness.

594
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,860
I didn't expect you

595
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,520
to incorporate such ingenuity into tea.

596
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,460
I have a lot to learn from you.

597
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,500
You are so young,

598
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,880
but you know quite a lot.

599
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,080
You flatter me.

600
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,540
I heard that you and Jing
fell in love at first sight.

601
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,840
He said when he saw you for the first time,

602
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,960
he decided to make you his wife.

603
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,080
Love at first sight?

604
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,360
Could it be

605
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,800
this is not the truth?

606
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,360
In fact, there's more to it than that?

607
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,280
After drinking tea,

608
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,620
Consort De would use the way of gossiping

609
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,460
to make you relax.

610
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,560
Then she looks for flaws in your words.

611
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,160
You need to turn aside from the topic

612
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,040
to avoid being criticized.

613
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,500
Maybe there is some

614
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,120
misinformation.

615
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,580
After all, I don't know whether His Highness

616
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,190
fell in love with me at first sight.

617
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,260
But I didn't have feelings for him

618
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,720
at our first encounter.

619
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,420
It was only after that
I developed feelings for him.

620
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,160
Really?

621
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,540
Speaking of which,

622
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,360
it's kind of like destiny.

623
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,700
My first encounter with His Highness

624
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,860
was outside Hongluan Pavilion in Fuyu.

625
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,580
I had just bought

626
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,360
a Marriage Pearl
that can help me meet my husband.

627
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,560
Then I met him.

628
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,400
It seems that the Marriage Pearl really worked.

629
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,440
You two actually became a couple.

630
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,280
You don't say.

631
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,850
At that time, people said...

632
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,500
Said what?

633
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,020
Said we are a match made in heaven

634
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,980
and it only happens once in a century,

635
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,920
so I have to cherish the person in front of me.

636
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,800
Greetings, Consort De.

637
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,180
Look at you.

638
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,040
I just talked to Changsheng for a little while,

639
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,260
and you came to ask for her.

640
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,120
Sorry for the offense.

641
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,600
It doesn't matter.

642
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,080
I won't keep you either.

643
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,020
Remember to bring your wife

644
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,160
to visit me often.

645
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,920
I'm getting old.

646
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,240
Loneliness is inevitable.

647
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,500
Yes.

648
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,000
I definitely will.

649
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,000
What do you think of Consort De?

650
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,900
Seemingly caring,

651
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,880
but she was just testing me.

652
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,520
I can't make friends with her.

653
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,020
Changsheng.

654
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,600
It's dangerous to be around me.

655
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,780
Are you afraid?

656
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,500
Is it too late

657
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,340
to go back to Fuyu?

658
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,980
Yes.

659
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,380
Never mind.

660
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,540
I guess it's too late for me

661
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,380
to leave now.

662
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,880
I will protect you.

663
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,520
After all, you have feelings for me.

664
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,000
How can you take that seriously?

665
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,760
I was messing with Consort De.

666
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,540
It's true.

667
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,600
You don't think I...

668
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,800
I like you, do you?

669
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,460
I have to make it clear.

670
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,820
I definitely didn't mean that.

671
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,000
Really, I swear.

672
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,740
Hou.

673
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,900
Honey, you must be careful.

674
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,040
Look at your hair. It's messy now.

675
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,330
Why don't you pay attention when you walk?

676
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,260
You hurt me.

677
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,700
Your Highnesses.

678
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,860
People from a small place like Fuyu

679
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,960
are barbaric and unreasonable.

680
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,500
Don't think after showing off
in front of His Majesty,

681
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,860
you can be supercilious.

682
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,960
I tell you.

683
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,080
I am the daughter of the Minister.

684
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,740
On our wedding day,

685
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,580
a holy stone was found in the yard.

686
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,980
Directorate of Astronomy said

687
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,060
our wealth will be unimaginable.

688
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,360
No one can stand in our way.

689
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,700
Just you wait.

690
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,000
I will make sure
you don't look good in the future.

691
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,020
You look good.

692
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,120
What are you talking about?

693
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,060
Go.

694
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,860
How about it?

695
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,700
Are you okay?

696
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,800
You should care about your sister-in-law.

697
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,740
She

698
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,680
will be cared about by Lv Hou.

699
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,340
Is it late for me

700
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,180
to go to Fuyu now?

701
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,960
Yes.

702
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,100
(Cyan Mountains)

703
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,880
I didn't expect that Liu Changsheng

704
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,840
was so famous in Fuyu.

705
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,740
(Prince Song's Mansion)

706
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,060
I made some cakes

707
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,060
and brought them over

708
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,040
for you to have a try.

709
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,760
You are so sweet.

710
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,440
Unlike Liu Changsheng,

711
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,920
I get annoyed when I see her.

712
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,900
Yiyi.

713
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,380
Did you see the Princess of Fuyu

714
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,120
at Consort De's place?

715
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
I'm telling you,

716
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
this Liu Changsheng

717
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,300
is surely a nasty piece of work.

718
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,920
Only Lv Jing treats her like a treasure.

719
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,680
Like a treasure?

720
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,200
But

721
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,020
why I heard

722
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,780
she is notorious

723
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,200
in Fuyu?

724
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,120
Notorious?

725
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,320
Then why does Lv Jing
still treat her as a treasure?

726
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,290
How could Father let her marry here then?

727
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,820
Yiyi.

728
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,680
You can't say this casually.

729
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,520
If His Majesty knew about this...

730
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,840
Why did you stop talking?

731
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,360
I dare not say this.

732
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,420
Don't worry, there's no one else here.

733
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,260
Just say it.

734
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,220
Yiyi, I heard it's bad luck

735
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,260
to marry the Princess of Fuyu.

736
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,460
People who admire her

737
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,140
will not end well.

738
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,860
Although this is baseless talk,

739
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,120
if His Majesty knew these words,

740
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,240
there would inevitably be trouble.

741
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,100
After all,

742
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,160
calumny is dreadful.

743
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,700
Your Highness.

744
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,740
I've already told her.

745
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,580
Let's

746
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,000
wait and see the show.

747
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,180
Ge.

748
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,980
This show

749
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,120
must be fun to watch.

750
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,640
I think so too.

751
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:51,620
♪Sitting alone in the west window,
quietly watching the snow♪

752
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:59,240
