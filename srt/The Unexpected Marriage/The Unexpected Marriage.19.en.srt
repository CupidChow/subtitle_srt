=The Unexpected Marriage=

2
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,660
=Episode 19=

3
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,900
(Huadeng Pavilion)

4
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,010
Your Highness, you look great.

5
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,010
Keep your mouth shut

6
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,940
shows solemnness.

7
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,610
You have to be more solemn.

8
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,750
Don't be beneath your dignity.

9
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,010
Let's go.

10
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,380
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

11
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,890
Is this like they're showing their status

12
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,820
to everyone?

13
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,380
You talk too much.

14
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,980
There comes a bonnie lass,

15
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,350
whose watery eyes beam.

16
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,310
As this beauty I meet,
my heart feels fondly sweet.

17
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,210
Of course.

18
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,960
Our princess's beauty

19
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
is unequalled.

20
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,500
Who is she?

21
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,190
Why haven't I heard you mention her?

22
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,910
She is Mr. Huaishan's granddaughter,

23
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Ru Jing.

24
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,100
(Ru Jing, Huaishan's granddaughter)

25
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,980
Even his granddaughter is so pretty.

26
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,310
I guess Mr. Huaishan

27
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,820
must be extraordinary.

28
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,210
Master, you must have travelled a long way

29
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,050
to get here.

30
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,940
(Huaishan, Former Prime Minister of Great Tang)

31
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,030
This is Princess Consort Qin, right?

32
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,150
Greetings, Prince Qin,

33
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,170
Princess Consort Qin.

34
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,560
We're not married yet.

35
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,400
No need for that.

36
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,980
We're not married yet.

37
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,310
But soon we will.

38
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,010
Yes.

39
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,700
Master, please come in.

40
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
Go.

41
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:23,540
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

42
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,760
Master, you've come from afar.

43
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,190
Let me toast you.

44
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,490
Okay.

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,970
(Can't shake the hairpin.)

46
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,310
(Can't show disrespect to others.)

47
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,850
You can leave.

48
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,690
Let me do it.

49
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,530
You're our guest.

50
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,370
How could we...

51
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,430
Be solemn.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Since you are our guest,

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,430
we will do as the guest wishes.

54
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,630
Master, how are you doing?

55
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,990
Not bad.

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,750
If there's anything that I've done wrong,

57
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,530
please forgive me.

58
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,370
Master.

59
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,500
We'll make another toast.

60
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,250
Changsheng.

61
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,930
Sorry.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,550
Sorry.

63
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,720
Look at this.

64
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,730
It's okay, it's okay.

65
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,240
Master, please forgive us.

66
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Come on.

67
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,550
Drink two extra cups with me.

68
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,500
What should I do?

69
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,340
Changsheng, are you hurt?

70
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,110
Young Lady.

71
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,870
Princess Consort Qin
is trying to intimidate you.

72
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,870
After all, she is the mistress.

73
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,760
She has to be formidable.

74
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,790
How could Prince Qin be like this?

75
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,050
You're deeply in love with His Highness.

76
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,630
His Highness turns a blind eye to it

77
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,750
and even allowed her to humiliate you.

78
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,090
Young Lady.

79
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,930
Yunzhui.

80
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,250
Take things

81
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,330
as they come.

82
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,430
Young Lady.

83
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,240
You just sprained your ankle.

84
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,080
Why did you come here

85
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,260
instead of taking a rest?

86
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,700
I'm not that delicate.

87
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Is Miss Ru Jing alright?

88
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
I prepared some food

89
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,750
and want to apologize to her.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,930
It's not a big deal.

91
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,820
No need to apologize.

92
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,580
It's all because of this.

93
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,630
I thought I wouldn't let it shake,

94
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,870
then I got distracted

95
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,790
and made a fool of myself.

96
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,770
I'll never wear it again.

97
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,000
No.

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,460
Master just said you were cute.

99
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,940
I think it's pretty nice too.

100
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,790
But if it limits your actions,

101
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,190
you don't have to wear it.

102
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,970
But Princess Royal said

103
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,460
I should wear it on important occasions.

104
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,113
Otherwise, it will be disrespectful to others.

105
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,380
Who dares to laugh

106
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,160
at my wife?

107
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,230
You're taking advantage of me again.

108
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,700
How forgetful.

109
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,930
Princess Royal.

110
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,070
You're writing the wrong line.

111
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,440
Through the door of yearning you step in.

112
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,310
The wistful yearning for you
deep into my bones.

113
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,340
It's just right.

114
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,330
Why hasn't Mr. Xiao

115
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,380
come to visit?

116
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,940
Our palace has been so quiet.

117
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,230
If you miss him,

118
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,200
I could send you to the inn.

119
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,490
You are sending your servant girl there

120
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,110
and then you'll go yourself?

121
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,720
How dare you.

122
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,070
Sorry for the offense.

123
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,070
After being with him for a long time,

124
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,550
I even speak like him.

125
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,160
Leave me.

126
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,280
Yes.

127
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,310
Because I care about you.

128
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,670
I know you care.

129
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,820
Care about me?

130
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,030
Is that what I think it means?

131
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,130
Your Highness.

132
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,150
Miss Ru Jing.

133
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,940
I made green bean soup.

134
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,210
Please have a try.

135
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,490
No need.

136
00:09:07,684 --> 00:09:09,580
I just finished eating
the lotus seed soup made by my wife.

137
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,740
I'm full.

138
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,850
I can't eat anymore.

139
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,070
It's been a long time.

140
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,150
How have you been these years?

141
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,790
I've been doing well.

142
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,070
I practiced asking you this

143
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,100
like a hundred times.

144
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,930
Finally today,

145
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,510
I could ask you this.

146
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,700
I'm really happy

147
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,980
and pleased.

148
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,100
I don't deserve this.

149
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,400
No.

150
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,510
You do.

151
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,980
You don't know how good you are.

152
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,700
So good that

153
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,250
I still want

154
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,090
to marry you

155
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,220
even as

156
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,820
a concubine.

157
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,390
Please don't belittle yourself.

158
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,670
There are many good men in the world.

159
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,220
You will find a good match.

160
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,030
Traveling around the world

161
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,670
only made me more determined.

162
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,932
I have something else to do.

163
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,860
Please help yourself, Miss Ru Jing.

164
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,010
Your Highness.

165
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,310
Do you remember we used to

166
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,030
watch plum blossoms and falling snow

167
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,460
and listen to the rain on a boat?

168
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,860
That's our history.

169
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,270
Have you forgotten all that?

170
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,130
Yi'an.

171
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,620
Miss Ru Jing.

172
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,310
What's going on?

173
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,620
Princess Consort Qin.

174
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,580
What happened?

175
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,860
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

176
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,030
Miss Ru Jing.

177
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,980
Long time no see.

178
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,280
How are you?

179
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,620
Your Highness.

180
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,780
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

181
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,930
According to your judgement,

182
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,030
the locust plague in Dongpei

183
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,150
will sweep through Great Tang
in less than three days.

184
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,350
Then I will report to Father

185
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,200
to remind the people
to harvest food as soon as possible.

186
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,100
You shook your head.

187
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,360
Is this plan not feasible?

188
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,050
This plan is feasible.

189
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,670
But it is not enforceable.

190
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,620
Not enforceable?

191
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,460
It's not harvest time yet.

192
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,440
Forcing it will cause public resentment.

193
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,270
But if we don't harvest food now,

194
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:17,460
when the locust plague occurs,

195
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,050
then they'll reap nothing.

196
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,120
The farmers haven't seen

197
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,340
the locusts yet.

198
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,450
They will just know

199
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,460
harvesting grain now will reduce yields.

200
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,130
So Jing,

201
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,190
will it work or not?

202
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,640
There is no other way.

203
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,670
We can only take the risk.

204
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,507
It's been years since we last met.

205
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,390
Since you're already in the capital,

206
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,220
why not visit my house?

207
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,680
Your Highness is busy.

208
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,530
I dare not disturb you.

209
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,460
I'm not as busy as my third brother.

210
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,440
But now that you and Mr. Huaishan

211
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,910
have come back to help,

212
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,700
I guess he'll have some free time.

213
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,310
I'm just a woman.

214
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,100
It's good that I don't cause trouble.

215
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,670
What else can I do?

216
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,740
This is wrong.

217
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,860
A woman without talent is virtuous,

218
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,790
but having talent is even better.

219
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,150
Miss Ru Jing has extraordinary talent.

220
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,080
There is naturally a lot you can do.

221
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,940
Not like

222
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,700
the princess in Prince Qin's mansion.

223
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,560
Princess Changsheng?

224
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,270
Princess Changsheng

225
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,620
is also excellent.

226
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,130
You and her

227
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,440
are both good

228
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,340
in a different way.

229
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,580
You're talented,

230
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,550
while she only knows how to please men.

231
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,940
Before they get married,

232
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,340
Father's already dissatisfied with Jing.

233
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,290
But now that you're back,

234
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,440
I can be relieved.

235
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,600
His Majesty

236
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,680
is dissatisfied with Prince Qin?

237
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,430
Father has always liked Jing.

238
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,680
He became dissatisfied

239
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,670
because the princess
got too much attention from Jing.

240
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,940
None of this matters.

241
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,480
What matters is

242
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,100
you need to help them.

243
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,320
A hero fails to pull through the beauty pass.

244
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,530
If Jing continues to indulge in it,

245
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,510
I'm afraid the consequences are unpredictable.

246
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,460
It's inconvenient

247
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,090
for outsiders

248
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,890
to intervene in their affairs.

249
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,840
Outsider?

250
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,720
You and Jing

251
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,510
grew up together.

252
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:07,830
How can you be considered an outsider?

253
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,170
It relies on friends and family

254
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,430
to set things right.

255
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,650
I've been out for too long.

256
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,940
Grandpa will be worried.

257
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,490
Your Highness.

258
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,680
See you.

259
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,920
Okay.

260
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,070
I'll have someone take you back.

261
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,050
If you run into any difficulties,

262
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:24,980
you can come to me anytime.

263
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,400
Please.

264
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,170
With just a few words,

265
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,370
Miss Ru Jing

266
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,510
could be used by me.

267
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,550
Your Highness has great ambitions.

268
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,860
But obsession makes people crazy.

269
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,670
Do you have obsessions?

270
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,790
I don't

271
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,100
have any obsessions,

272
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,980
only Your Highness.

273
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,130
Yi'an.

274
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,790
- How did you come?
- Come here.

275
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,580
I heard that you talked
with Mr. Huaishan all night.

276
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,340
I guess you didn't have dinner.

277
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,460
So I prepared some light dishes.

278
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,850
Try it.

279
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,610
By the way,

280
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,720
I've also sent some

281
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,790
to Mr. Huaishan.

282
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,160
What's wrong?

283
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,340
No appetite?

284
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,940
It's because of the locust plague.

285
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,370
Even Mr. Huaishan

286
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,860
can't find a solution?

287
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,510
There are solutions.

288
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,790
But the solution

289
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,090
can either work

290
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,280
or not.

291
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,620
So profound.

292
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,740
Let me tell you about it.

293
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,100
You can also give some advice.

294
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,030
Tell me while eating.

295
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,310
The food will get cold soon.

296
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,390
Miss Ru Jing is back.

297
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,480
Miss Ru Jing.

298
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,860
That's where His Highness lives.

299
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,100
Your room

300
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,680
is over there.

301
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,310
I know, I have something to tell His Highness.

302
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,910
This isn't appropriate.

303
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,030
Fine.

304
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,790
Then I'll go back to my room.

305
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,580
It turns out that

306
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:38,860
you meant

307
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,820
this plan is feasible

308
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,580
but difficult to implement.

309
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,730
Then

310
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,510
what if we let the people
harvest grain on their own?

311
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,620
Harvest grain on their own?

312
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,410
I have heard my father mention

313
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,650
that Fuyu

314
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,310
was also very poor decades ago.

315
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,270
In order to fill their stomachs,

316
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,930
the people even

317
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,050
commited theft.

318
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,250
At that time, the late emperor

319
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,620
wanted to suppress it by force.

320
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,130
But my uncle, the then Crown Prince,

321
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,100
remonstrated

322
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,410
and proposed to let the people be self-reliant

323
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,420
and commend them.

324
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,070
The late emperor thought it wouldn't work.

325
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,380
Uncle asked for three days

326
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,950
to convince the late emperor

327
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,562
and then went up the mountain alone

328
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:16,890
to negotiate with the bandit chieftain.

329
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,437
A prince negotiated
with the bandit chieftain.

330
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,380
It sounds interesting.

331
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,800
Tell me quickly.

332
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,760
Then my uncle

333
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,860
convinced the bandit chieftain

334
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,240
and taught everyone to plant Muyan trees

335
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,080
to acquire wealth.

336
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,440
Then chieftain agreed?

337
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,070
At first, he was unwilling of course.

338
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,410
But who would want

339
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,850
to be a robber instead of

340
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,820
living a peaceful life?

341
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,900
It's just to earn a living.

342
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,525
My uncle

343
00:17:40,536 --> 00:17:41,510
invested a large sum of money

344
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,750
and taught them skills.

345
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,930
Not long after,

346
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,420
their profits multiplied several times.

347
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,310
Other people tried the same thing.

348
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,520
Then

349
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,570
Fuyu also prospered

350
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,420
with the help of Muyan tree.

351
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,480
A word from the wise

352
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,610
is worth ten books.

353
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,340
I just know some examples of allusions.

354
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,930
Eat some food.

355
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,170
You should eat too.

356
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,100
I won't eat.

357
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,230
I've been eating too much lately

358
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,030
and put on some weight.

359
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,650
Eat it yourself.

360
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,130
What?

361
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,650
Let me see how much weight you've gained.

362
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,490
Don't.

363
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,770
Come here.

364
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,750
What?

365
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,720
I'll just take a look.

366
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,330
Stop it.

367
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,680
Don't come over here.

368
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,570
Come and let me see.

369
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,100
Great Tang is suffering from locust plague,

370
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,030
and you're still flirting with a woman.

371
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,620
So what Lv Ke said is true.

372
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,620
Liu Changsheng

373
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,310
really is like Helen of Troy.

374
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,160
It's itchy.

375
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,220
(Imperial Study)

376
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,080
What?

377
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,620
Harvest food now?

378
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:47,930
Right.

379
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,280
Jing.

380
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,240
The crops are not yet ripe.

381
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,650
If farmers harvest food now,

382
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,410
do you know how much will they

383
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,480
reduce their harvests?

384
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,320
60 percent.

385
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,930
Since you know,

386
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,240
how can you come up with such a bad idea?

387
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,100
Father, in my opinion,

388
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,820
this absolutely doesn't work.

389
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,690
Ke.

390
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,070
What do you think?

391
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,170
I think

392
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,380
this is indeed a risky move.

393
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,560
Once implemented,

394
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,000
we'll get people's complaint

395
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,280
before the disaster falls.

396
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,040
Ke is right.

397
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,200
Jing, you're in charge of disaster relief

398
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,090
because there will not be
enough food after the locusts come.

399
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,130
But now

400
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,760
you've made yourself

401
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,100
the biggest locust in Great Tang.

402
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,320
Father.

403
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,380
According to Mr. Huaishan's judgment,

404
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,850
the locusts will come to Great Tang

405
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,100
within three days.

406
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,510
If we don't harvest the grain early,

407
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,340
there will be no harvest at that time.

408
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,440
And the national treasury used 20% of the grain

409
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,280
to support Dongpei.

410
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,510
So if this method is not implemented in time,

411
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,062
I am afraid it will delay
the subsequent grain harvest.

412
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,360
Father.

413
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,140
What Jing said makes sense.

414
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,580
During this period,

415
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,850
Jing has been dealing with Dongpei's disaster

416
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,550
and suggested to provide food support.

417
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,960
Although the results are mediocre,

418
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,760
no one knows the disaster better than him.

419
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,420
What's the use of understanding it?

420
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,000
Using the right method

421
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,080
is what matters.

422
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,920
Father.

423
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,270
Ke, you also said

424
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,515
transporting food

425
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,600
is an utterly inadequate method

426
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,888
in dealing with such a severe situation.

427
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:08,090
Now you want to harvest food in advance.

428
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,710
Jing, I have to ask you,

429
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,520
what are you going to do with

430
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,680
the 40% of food lost by the people?

431
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,970
We can't let the people

432
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,280
lose the grains in vain.

433
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,230
Open the national treasury.

434
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,040
- Open...
- Father.

435
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,280
Listen to what he said.

436
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,680
Open the national treasury.

437
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,620
That's easy for you to say.

438
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,140
Do you think the national treasury
belongs to you?

439
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,250
Certainly.

440
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,340
The treasury belongs to us.

441
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,410
But the treasury holds the food

442
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,270
for the people of the whole country.

443
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,930
You give 20% to Dongpei today,

444
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,470
and 60% to the people tomorrow.

445
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Who are you going to give

446
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,990
the remaining 20 percent?

447
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,950
Ke, go back.

448
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,880
Yes.

449
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,130
Jing, opening the treasury

450
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,180
is a huge matter.

451
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,600
Let me

452
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,550
think about it carefully.

453
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,380
Father, I only need 20%
of the food in the national treasury.

454
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,690
I will come up with

455
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,880
the remaining 40%.

456
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,070
Twenty percent is still too much.

457
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,140
What Ke said is absolutely true.

458
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
Today, Ke's been trying to share your worries.

459
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,550
I think he would be willing
to give 10% of the food

460
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,510
to fill the treasury.

461
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,410
I...

462
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,450
Father.

463
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,720
I am naturally willing

464
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,510
to share your worries.

465
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,230
OK.

466
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,480
My brothers have the people's
best interests at heart.

467
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,330
I would also follow suit

468
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,170
and contribute 10%.

469
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,860
Good, good, good.

470
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,310
Since Hou and Ke

471
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,930
are willing to solve the people’s concerns

472
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,100
together with me,

473
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,890
Father, please issue an order

474
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,750
to harvest grain.

475
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,200
This will save the loss of the people.

476
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,620
They naturally will have no complaints.

477
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,310
And it'll also avoid locust plagues.

478
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,450
Good.

479
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,500
(Prince Song's Mansion)

480
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,030
Today, Jing really was a show-off.

481
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,200
I also donated food.

482
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,330
Why did Father

483
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,100
only praise him and not me?

484
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,890
He donated 40% of the food.

485
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,380
You only donated 10%.

486
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,930
If you ask me,

487
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,900
let's just live a down-to-earth life.

488
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,130
With your brain,

489
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,340
you're no match for Jing.

490
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,340
Don't throw your own life away.

491
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,610
So you don't want to be the Empress?

492
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,760
I do.

493
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,750
But it won't happen, will it?

494
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,950
Don't I know what you're like?

495
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,890
From the beginning till now,

496
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,660
we never got any advantage.

497
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,950
No, I'm not going to swallow it.

498
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,650
In my opinion,

499
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,230
you should know when to admit defeat.

500
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,480
Today you donated 10% of the food,

501
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,950
and you can't even swallow it.

502
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,810
If one day you lose your life,

503
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,310
you won't have any chance.

504
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,550
He's no better than me.

505
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,270
40 percent of the food.

506
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,660
Even if he's rich,

507
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,310
where could he get

508
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,850
so much food now?

509
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,690
Moreover,

510
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,890
if he can't donate food,

511
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,230
he'll still be guilty of deceiving the Emperor.

512
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,230
Yes, deceiving the Emperor.

513
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,730
Your Highness.

514
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,570
This is all the food we have.

515
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,410
Is that enough?

516
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,170
How about it?

517
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,200
According to the previous
grain collection of Great Tang,

518
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,270
on the premise of ensuring our annual expenses,

519
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,360
we can only

520
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,130
take out 30% at most.

521
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,180
(Youlan Pavilion)
What to do then?

522
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,250
Don't panic.

523
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,030
I figured out a way last night.

524
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,170
Your Highness.

525
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,520
Your Highness.

526
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,940
(Account Book of the Dowry)

527
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,800
Shenxing.

528
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,960
Her Highness and I are busy here.

529
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,090
But you're slacking.

530
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,200
I'm not lacking.

531
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,070
Her Highness gave me something else to do.

532
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,280
Your Highness, I have counted.

533
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,130
The amount of your dowry that can be discounted

534
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,240
is all marked on the book.

535
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,080
What?

536
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,810
Do you want to sell your dowry?

537
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,890
This won't work.

538
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,760
This dowry was given to you

539
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,330
by His Royal Highness

540
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,410
for you to establish yourself in Great Tang.

541
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,680
You can't sell it.

542
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,520
Good.

543
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:55,600
This should be enough money

544
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,380
to buy the remaining 10%.

545
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Shenxing, follow the method I taught you

546
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,410
to have people buy it.

547
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,508
Make sure you get the amount I want

548
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:03,420
in three days.

549
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,790
Your Highness.

550
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,880
Jinyan.

551
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,750
It isn't my dowry

552
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,510
that will help me establish myself

553
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,900
in Great Tang,

554
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,490
but His Highness,

555
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,080
do you understand?

556
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,320
Go now.

557
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,650
Remember

558
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,280
don't let His Highness know about this.

559
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,120
Okay.

560
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,460
(Youlan Pavilion)

561
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,720
Shenxing left in a hurry.

562
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,560
What is she going to do?

563
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,470
I sent her to run a small errand.

564
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,250
Your Highness.

565
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,730
How did it go?

566
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,490
It's done.

567
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,990
The imperial decree will be released today.

568
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,370
Do we have enough food

569
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,230
in our house?

570
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,550
But...

571
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,170
It's more than enough.

572
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,040
Thank you.

573
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,100
(At this time,)

574
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,140
(she doesn't help out,)

575
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,810
(and only does these lovey-dovey things)

576
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,860
(to make His Highness
completely ignore the crisis at hand.)

577
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,380
He wasn't like this before.

578
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,230
If it were an ordinary family,
it would be fine.

579
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,100
But he is in the royal family.

580
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,860
He should benefit the world in the future.

581
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,420
How can he be tied down by a woman?

582
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,340
But

583
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,310
Liu Changsheng

584
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,950
just wants to have some pleasure.

585
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,510
If I could guide her

586
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,140
and expostulate with her...

587
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,990
Jing.

588
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,810
Grandpa, where's he?

589
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,650
Who?

590
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,180
You just called Jing.

591
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,900
Isn't your name also Jing?

592
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,200
He's not here. But you're here.

593
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,280
You're thinking of him

594
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,860
and forgot about yourself.

595
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,570
Too obsessed.

596
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,580
Grandpa.

597
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,710
What are you talking about?

598
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,550
I just

599
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,340
heard it wrong.

600
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,990
Have you copied the Diamond Sutra
that I asked you to copy?

601
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,000
I've been too busy these days.

602
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,510
I'll give it to you in a few days.

603
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,720
Everything with form

604
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,130
is unreal.

605
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,200
If all forms are seen as unreal,

606
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,860
the Tathagata will be perceived.

607
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,710
Ru Jing.

608
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,900
You shouldn't have come back.

609
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,420
I knows that I'm very obsessed.

610
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,200
But now he has an important responsibility

611
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,520
and is targeted front and rear.

612
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,820
One mistake and he's in a place of no return.

613
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,080
Grandpa.

614
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,950
If you really want me to leave,

615
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,890
please let me

616
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,310
help him through this difficult time first.

617
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,620
All beings suffer,

618
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,994
only self-liberation brings happiness.

619
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,810
When seeing him,

620
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,750
it's like you're in an abyss of suffering.

621
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,240
This means

622
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,410
you are already in fire and ice.

623
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,340
You worry that he will suffer,

624
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,820
but how do you know
it wasn't you who dragged him into hell?

625
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,570
I will only help him.

626
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,420
I won't hurt him.

627
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,230
Everything is predestined.

628
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,650
You guys leave first.

629
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,550
Yes.

630
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,380
Congratulations, Your Highness.

631
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,289
We contributed 10% of the food for nothing

632
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,230
to help Jing.

633
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,770
Why congratulate me?

634
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,310
Although we only

635
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,510
contributed 10%,

636
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,340
Prince Qin

637
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,950
contributed 40%.

638
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,420
Jing is rich.

639
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,380
Don't you know

640
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:58,710
our financial situation?

641
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,080
Even though Prince Qin's family

642
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,310
is large and prosperous,

643
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,130
this 40% of food

644
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,070
isn't easy to provide.

645
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,610
Moreover...

646
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,620
What?

647
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,720
Although we really can't

648
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,230
change Prince Qin's financial status,

649
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,280
we can change

650
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,750
the amount of grain harvested.

651
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,950
This year's crops are not yet ripe.

652
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,560
Yes.

653
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,620
If more crops are harvested,

654
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,180
Jing will take out

655
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,070
much more food than us.

656
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,310
Jing promised 40% of the food,

657
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,900
then His Majesty issued the decree.

658
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,990
If

659
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,030
he won't be able to provide it,

660
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,550
then he would be

661
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,950
deceiving the Emperor

662
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,480
and failing

663
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,710
the people.

664
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,210
If he fails to harvest grain,

665
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,180
when the locust plague occurs,

666
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,550
he'll be

667
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,860
the most anxious.

668
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,860
So I should congratulate you.

669
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,490
Ge.

670
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,790
Sometimes I'm glad

671
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,140
that you didn't stand against me.

672
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,440
Marrying Your Highness

673
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,790
is my honor.

674
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:22,970
Jinyan.

675
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,070
Look at those two geese.

676
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,030
- What did you think of?
- They look good.

677
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,720
What else can I think of?

678
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,790
I just think

679
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,860
they're fat.

680
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,950
Your Highness.

681
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,620
That's for viewing.

682
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,070
You can't eat them.

683
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,100
Maybe I'm hungry.

684
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,720
If you filled your stomach,

685
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,990
you'll think they're beautiful.

686
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,750
I'm starving,

687
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,510
so I want to feast on them.

688
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm not that smart

689
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,840
and can't understand it.

690
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,650
His Highness had difficulties

691
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,711
with the disaster control work.

692
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,280
By the time,

693
00:29:57,446 --> 00:29:58,480
when a bird's nest is overturned,

694
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,380
no egg can remain intact.

695
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,710
But you have to know

696
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,820
now we're a couple.

697
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,892
We are going to face difficulties together.

698
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,580
But how do you know

699
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,610
His Highness can prevent the disaster?

700
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,450
Disaster relief

701
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,810
relies on strategy

702
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,890
and benevolence.

703
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,750
No matter what,

704
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,990
I just need to believe in him.

705
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,100
Since you said so,

706
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,380
I also believe in you.

707
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,120
Your Highness.

708
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,270
I've done everything you asked me to do.

709
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,810
According to your instructions,

710
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,650
I've sent the letter

711
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,130
to General Zhao of Fuyu.

712
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,240
You and His Highness saved the general's life.

713
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,580
They will definitely help raise food.

714
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,210
At the moment,

715
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,710
we did everything we could.

716
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,250
We can only

717
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,510
wait for now.

718
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,690
Youyong.

719
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,200
Why are you in such a hurry?

720
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,170
What happened?

721
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,750
His Highness went
to talk to farmers with Youmou

722
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,840
to harvest food early.

723
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,140
But the farmers refused.

724
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,970
They said the crops are growing well this year

725
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:56,950
and asked for a high price.

726
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,570
His Highness didn't dare to promise them,

727
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,550
so the farmers surrounded His Highness.

728
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,000
I have to go there quickly.

729
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,340
Okay, go quickly.

730
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,030
How did it become like this?

731
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,650
No.

732
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,130
I have to go over there.

733
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,420
Your Highness, greetings.

734
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,810
Spare the etiquettes.

735
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,960
Miss Ru Jing, I have an emergency.

736
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,890
Please help yourself.

737
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:17,730
Your Highness.

738
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:19,470
I have something urgent to talk to you about.

739
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,750
It's about His Highness.

740
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,340
I'm also going to see His Highness.

741
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,930
Why don't we go together?

742
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:24,770
Let's talk on the way.

743
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:25,930
Your Highness.

744
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,000
When men are busy working outside,

745
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,090
we women s
ld behave ourselves

746
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:30,990
and don't make trouble.

747
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,660
How stubborn.

748
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,980
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

749
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,790
If you're worried, go check on him.

750
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,560
I won't.

751
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,040
I want to stay at home,

752
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,080
make his favorite meals

753
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,480
and wait for him.

754
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,040
You wait, I'm hungry.

755
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,880
I'll eat first.

756
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,750
Grandpa.

757
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,580
Don't be so self-constrained.

758
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,410
He's back.

759
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,520
Youyong, take good care of Her Highness.

760
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,420
I'll send them back.

761
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,030
Your Highness, you are back.

762
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,210
Your Highness.

763
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,710
How did you hurt your forehead?

764
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,660
Are you okay? Does it still hurt?

765
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,650
Your Highness.

766
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,130
I made your favorite food.

767
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:42,970
No need.

768
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,120
Are you okay?

769
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,900
I just twisted it.

770
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,240
How come these farmers

771
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,610
were so excited?

772
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,900
They couldn't listen to a word.

773
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,380
Don't go out recently.

774
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,990
It's too dangerous outside now.

775
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,040
Your Highness.

776
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,410
Eat a drumstick first.

777
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,180
No need. I'll send Changsheng back.

778
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,580
Master, please take your time.

779
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,440
Youyong, invite Mr. Xiao over.

780
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,280
Yes.

781
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,490
Your Highness.

782
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,660
You've worked the whole day.

783
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,990
Have a drumstick.

784
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,510
You've worked the whole day.

785
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,880
You've even lost weight.

786
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,170
Come on.

787
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,030
Grandpa.

788
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,230
Come and eat.

789
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,620
It's green.

790
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,080
- No.
- I mean you.

791
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,550
Your face is green with envy.

792
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,030
Grandpa.

793
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,990
These are all prepared for him.

794
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,280
Don't eat them all.

795
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,570
If no one eat it, it will be a waste.

796
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,750
The people

797
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,340
are running out of food soon.

798
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,990
We have to save food.

799
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,660
I'm really fine.

800
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,290
It didn't hurt the bones.

801
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,430
Just a scratch.

802
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,780
But you...

803
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,090
I'm fine.

804
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,440
I've been fighting outside for years.

805
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,890
This little injury is nothing.

806
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,950
Look, it's swollen.

807
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,780
I have to heal your bruises quickly.

808
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,960
It will hurt a bit.

809
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,510
Hold me and bear the pain.

810
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,030
It hurts. It hurts.

811
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,780
Be gentle.

812
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,990
It hurts.

813
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,480
Changsheng.

814
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,360
Are you okay?

815
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,510
Now I've hurt the bones.

816
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,090
Princess Royal.

817
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,280
Long time no see.

818
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,100
Mr. Xiao, long time no see.

819
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,390
I heard that you were wounded by the farmers.

820
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,070
What exactly happened?

821
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,800
It's fine.

822
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,220
Thank you for your concern.

823
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,430
Today was supposed to go well.

824
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,950
But when it comes to
the amount of compensation,

825
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,290
they asked for a considerable amount.

826
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,000
These farmers are still

827
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,840
so greedy now.

828
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,892
When the locust plague occurs,
no one will be able to eat.

829
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,030
Your leg is broken.

830
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,220
You will never recover.

831
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,210
Now the plague hasn't occurred,

832
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,830
so people still have the fluke mind.

833
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,040
But I think

834
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
someone must have instigated this.

835
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,260
The most important thing now

836
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,180
is not to find the instigator,

837
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,100
but to harvest the grain tomorrow.

838
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,580
Otherwise it will be too late.

839
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,910
Worst case,

840
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,620
we will divert the farmers away

841
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,620
and find the soldiers to harvest the food.

842
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,690
Anyway, according to Mr. Huaishan,

843
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,560
the plague will occur in the next two days.

844
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,100
Even if the people don’t understand it now,

845
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,440
when the locusts come,

846
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,560
they'll be glad

847
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,850
we harvested food early.

848
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,080
What if the locust plague
doesn't occur in these days

849
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,780
but happens in the future?

850
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,770
Your idea is like a gamble.

851
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,480
You're really annoying.

852
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,140
What Mr. Xiao said makes sense.

853
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,560
Someone must have

854
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,780
instigated this.

855
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,126
If we lose the bet,

856
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,313
and the locust plague doesn't occur,

857
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,089
this person will definitely
instigate the people

858
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,260
and blame it on Jing.

859
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,570
Jing.

860
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,220
We need to give it further thought.

861
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,220
Please stay, Jing.

862
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,550
Rest early

863
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,040
to conserve your energy.

864
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,990
There is still a tough battle
to fight tomorrow.

865
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,040
She's hooking up with another man

866
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
in front of her husband.

867
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,520
Be careful on the way.

868
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,870
How shameless.

869
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,600
Stop copying me.

870
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,260
Why? I've been walking like this for years.

871
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,160
Now you have to copy me.

872
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,870
Greetings, Princess Royal.

873
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,730
Princess Royal.

874
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,070
I prepared some midnight snacks.

875
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,640
Why not eat some?

876
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,620
No need.

877
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,660
I'm leaving.

878
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,840
Your Highness.

879
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,009
You've been chatting all night.

880
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,070
Have some midnight snack first.

881
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,780
I'm not hungry, thank you.

882
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,480
Changsheng.

883
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,100
Why don't you come in?

884
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,250
Coming.

885
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,170
What are you doing?

886
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,180
Miss Ru Jing is right.

887
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,620
We have something important to do tonight.

888
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,220
How can we do it wit
t strength?

889
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,660
I won't stand it.

890
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,780
Thank you, Miss Ru Jing.

891
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,910
Have an early rest.

892
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,400
Let's go.

893
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,550
Your Highness, take a good rest.

894
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,300
(Tonight,)

895
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,140
