3
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,940
I, Liu Changsheng,

4
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,060
am willing to go to Great Tang.

5
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,620
I'm willing to make the alliance

6
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,780
with Great Tang

7
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,020
and dedicate my whole life

8
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,300
to protect Fuyu.

9
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,180
Good.

10
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,340
You're indeed from the royal family.

11
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,420
Rise.

12
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,180
With courage,

13
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,860
ambitious and aspiration.

14
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,220
I will now draft a decree.

15
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,780
Gao An.

16
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,860
Yes.

17
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,900
Mr. Envoy.

18
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,380
What do you think?

19
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,100
It's my pleasure.

20
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,740
I will not disappoint Her Highness.

21
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,580
Your Majesty.

22
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,100
I have another request.

23
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,940
Say it.

24
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,500
I will definitely grant it.

25
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,860
Please allow me

26
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,500
to ask you a favor.

27
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,940
I hope Your Majesty will give me

28
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,580
thirty Muyan trees

29
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,020
and send them to Great Tang too.

30
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,700
I know

31
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,660
Muyan tree

32
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,220
is the core of Fuyu's salt business.

33
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,220
Since the founding of the country,
it's never been given away.

34
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,620
But if we can present thirty Muyan trees
as a gift,

35
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,260
it'll certainly express

36
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,260
our determination

37
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,540
to get along amicably with Great Tang.

38
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,820
Plus my negotiation,

39
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,220
preferably we can establish

40
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,300
trade relations with Great Tang.

41
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
It must be a good thing
for the country and the people.

42
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,460
Granted.

43
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,460
Your Highness is generous.

44
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,140
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,660
I will never let Her Highness
suffer any injustice.

46
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,020
Your Majesty.

47
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,420
I would like to ask for your permission

48
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,860
for me to go to Great Tang together

49
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,820
as the envoy.

50
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,300
You want to be an envoy?

51
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,140
Yes.

52
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,660
Absolutely not.

53
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,100
I disagree.

54
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,500
Zilv.

55
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,660
Father.

56
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,460
I've decided to go.

57
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,580
You...

58
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,420
There's only one man
in every generation of our family.

59
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,980
You are

60
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,980
the only son we have.

61
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,420
Do you know

62
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,100
the trip to Great Tang

63
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,220
will be dangerous,

64
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,380
and you may not

65
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,660
come back alive?

66
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,980
But you...

67
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,900
Father, have some tea.

68
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,140
I don't want to.

69
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,220
Therefore,

70
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,500
I should stay by her side.

71
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,860
You fool!

72
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,980
Did you read the books

73
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,060
in vain?

74
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,060
Have you forgotten about

75
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,500
filial piety?

76
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,860
I'm unfilial.

77
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,420
His Majesty has

78
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,540
granted my wish.

79
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,460
You...

80
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,980
You ungrateful child.

81
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,740
You actually used His Majesty to pressure me.

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,340
Father.

83
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,380
Father.

84
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,740
How rebellious!

85
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,220
How rebellious!

86
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,540
How could I have such an unfilial son like you?

87
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,940
Do you know how to write
the words "filial piety"?

88
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,980
Write it a thousand times!

89
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,500
(Self-discipline and Social Commitment)
Here's the imperial decree.

90
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,380
Liu Changsheng, receive it.

91
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,780
His Majesty said

92
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,620
Your Royal Highnesses don't have to kneel.

93
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,580
Thank you.

94
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,660
I'm here.

95
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,500
Pursuant to Heaven's will,

96
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,060
hereby orders,

97
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,700
Princess Changsheng

98
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,260
is born talented

99
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,980
and intelligent.

100
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,860
Go to Great Tang

101
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,260
in favor of closer relations.

102
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,820
Princess Changsheng, please accept the decree.

103
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,820
This is the gift list drafted by His Majesty.

104
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,260
Reward Princess Changsheng

105
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,140
a pair of jade pots,

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,260
- a box of red agate,
- What is all this?

107
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,180
So stingy.

108
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,020
the paintings of The Beautiful Lady Yu,

109
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,380
Bamboo Flowers,

110
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,620
Auspicious Crane.

111
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,460
Mr. Gao.

112
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,580
Stop reading them one by one.

113
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,900
Yes.

114
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,700
Anyway, I've finished reading.

115
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,940
(A pair of white jade,
A pair of Jade Ruyi)

116
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,460
Oh, and there are thirty Muyan saplings.

117
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,980
We've gotten them prepared.

118
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,780
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

119
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,740
Your Royal Highness.

120
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,700
His Majesty also said

121
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,620
the farewell banquet should be hosted by you.

122
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,060
Don't worry about the rules.

123
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,740
Just organize it as you please.

124
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,420
I lost my daughter for nothing.

125
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
He's just so stingy.

126
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,420
You brother is really...

127
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,540
That's how it is.

128
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,980
If you cough, he's still stingy.

129
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,180
I'm sorry, my daughter.

130
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,780
(Gorgeous Vernal Scenery)

131
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,100
Yi'an, why haven't you slept yet?

132
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,780
Your Highness is awake too.

133
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,540
I'm finally getting married.

134
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,460
I'm so happy that I couldn't sleep.

135
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,340
Really?

136
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,180
I've spoken my heart many times,

137
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,620
but you didn't listen,

138
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,780
didn't answer

139
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,780
and didn't allow.

140
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,020
Now you ask me whether it's true.

141
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,620
Whether it's sincere or false,

142
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,140
it's become a fact.

143
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,220
More talk is useless.

144
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Let's just drink tea.

145
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,900
I heard Xiao Zilv

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,740
is punished by Mr. Xiao

147
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,700
to write "filial piety" a thousand times

148
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,060
in the courtyard.

149
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,740
It's not cold when it snows,

150
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,100
but it's cold when snow melts.

151
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,260
Hopefully after the snow stops,

152
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,100
his determination to follow me to Great Tang

153
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,540

193
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,060
has such an honor.

194
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,900
Right.

195
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,820
Excellent?

196
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,540
Honor?

197
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,780
I've raised my daughter

198
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,940
for over ten years.

199
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,180
I don't want her to be excellent

200
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,940
or bring honor to the family.

201
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,780
I just want her to be happy.

202
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,100
I didn't sleep for three days and nights

203
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,220
to write this play,

204
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,540
"Princess Marrying Far Away".

205
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,660
Although there are many twists and turns,

206
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,780
it's still a happy ending.

207
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,460
Your Highness, today

208
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,940
I meet you

209
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,100
in my true identity.

210
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,980
In the future, you and I

211
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,340
must be together forever.

212
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,780
(Did she see something?)

213
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,260
What do you think?

214
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,980
You lied to me.

215
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,580
It's coming.

216
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,620
The best part is coming.

217
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,540
How could you lie to me?

218
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,260
I'm not afraid

219
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,140
of leaving home

220
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,020
and having a long journey.

221
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,940
I believed in you.

222
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,780
But

223
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,420
how dare you lie to me?

224
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Princess.

225
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,540
Princess!

226
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,460
This play is so...

227
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,140
So unlucky.

228
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,660
Guangde.

229
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,620
I haven't left Fuyu

230
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,980
and you already killed me.

231
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,740
You misunderstood the meaning of this play.

232
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,220
My idea is too nice

233
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,530
and my literary attainments are too high.

234
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,460
But that's okay.

235
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,820
I gave them a happy ending.

236
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,660
Why didn't Xiao Zilv come?

237
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,020
Zilv knelt in the snow for a whole night

238
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,540
and hurt his knees.

239
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,500
He already had an old injury on his leg.

240
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,980
I'm afraid he can't come today.

241
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,460
Father saw Zilv was determined to leave,

242
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,700
after beating,

243
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,540
scolding

244
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,540
and punishing him,

245
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,260
he finally agreed.

246
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,060
Changsheng.

247
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,140
You must take care

248
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,260
in the future.

249
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,020
Zilv.

250
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,860
It's Her Highness's banquet.

251
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,180
As the envoy,

252
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,020
of course I should come.

253
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,700
Mr. Xiao has a serious leg problem.

254
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,220
It's better to go back home and rest.

255
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,700
Otherwise, it'll be hard to follow Her Highness

256
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,860
to Great Tang.

257
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,740
Please rest assured, Mr. Envoy.

258
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,780
For the safety of Changsheng,

259
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,820
I will not delay the trip

260
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,940
and drag her down.

261
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,380
Don't worry, Changsheng.

262
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,660
I'm fine.

263
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,780
That's good.

264
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,660
Don't move.

265
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,540
Let me do it.

266
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,300
I'll do it.

267
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,220
Farewell, Your Royal Highness.

268
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,380
Goodbye.

269
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,220
Farewell.

270
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,980
- Your Royal Highness, I'm leaving now.
- Goodbye.

271
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,540
- Take care, Your Royal Highness.
- Take care.

272
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,380
Goodbye.

273
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,420
Goodbye.

274
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,260
Dad.

275
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,100
Changsheng.

276
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,300
- Changsheng.
- He's drunk.

277
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,260
Changsheng.

278
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,100
Mom, help Dad go back and have a rest.

279
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,300
Changsheng.

280
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,700
Let's go back.

281
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,740
I can't bear to leave you.

282
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,100
Changsheng.

283
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,580
Changsheng.

284
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,060
Changsheng, we're leaving.

285
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,340
(Self-discipline and Social Commitment)

286
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,180
Xiao Zilv.

287
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,420
I have something to tell you.

288
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,860
If you want me to elope with you now,

289
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,780
is it too late?

290
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,460
I lost my handkerchief.

291
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,180
Guangde, come with me to look for it.

292
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,860
If you lose it, just buy a new one.

293
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,340
Please go with me to look for it.

294
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,260
You can go with me too.

295
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,100
Changsheng.

296
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,580
Tomorrow I will go and ask His Majesty

297
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,940
to let you stay.

298
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,060
Liu Changsheng.

299
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,780
I'm going to Great Tang to study medicine

300
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,700
and open my eyes.

301
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,680
You're marrying Prince Qin.

302
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,940
But don't ruin my future.

303
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,780
Xiao Zilv.

304
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,820
I'm not going to Great Tang for fun.

305
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,940
I'm not playing either.

306
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,540
I'm going to study.

307
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,940
You don't know how happy my father is

308
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,060
hearing that I'm going to Great Tang.

309
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,380
He thinks I'm an honor to the family.

310
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,980
Maybe I can even marry a princess.

311
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,140
Anyway, I don't mind your business,

312
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,070
and you don't mind mine either.

313
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,060
Don't ruin my plan.

314
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,220
Your Highness.

315
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,020
Yi'an.

316
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,700
In my opinion,

317
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,900
being the envoy

318
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,860
is not Mr. Xiao's

319
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,220
only idea.

320
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,780
Whatever you think,

321
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,660
and whatever he's thinking,

322
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,860
I will still go

323
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,380
for the peace-making marriage.

324
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,700
Mr. Envoy.

325
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,900
What else is there to worry about?

326
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,340
I clearly know

327
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,740
my responsibilities.

328
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,740
I'll be devoted to Prince Qin of Great Tang.

329
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,380
As for the others...

330
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,420
Let's toast Changsheng.

331
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,780
There is none left.

332
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,020
Give me.

333
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,780
During the day, when General Zhao was here,

334
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,300
you didn't even touch alcohol.

335
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,540
Why did you become an alcoholic now?

336
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,500
He usually doesn't let me drink.

337
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,660
And you listen to him?

338
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,860
The lawless Liu Guangde

339
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,580
finally met her nemesis.

340
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,100
I'm more impressed

341
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,820
with Zhao Huaibi now.

342
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,020
Well,

343
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,180
time goes by so fast.

344
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm getting married.

345
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,780
Xiao Jin is also going to Wu.

346
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,820
You're going to Great Tang.

347
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,180
Later,

348
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,020
I'm afraid we can't

349
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,660
get together

350
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,820
and drink like this.

351
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,300
You won't let me have another drink.

352
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,660
I'll drink more.

353
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,860
I thought

354
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,100
even if I marry into the Xie family,

355
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,660
they're an open-minded family,

356
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,980
and I can still meet you once a year.

357
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,660
Now

358
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,740
you're going to Great Tang.

359
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,420
It's in a far distance.

360
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,860
Maybe

361
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,500
I'll never see you again.

362
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,100
Tell me,

363
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,580
why do women

364
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,060
always have to make sacrifices?

365
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,580
Or what?

366
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,580
Men can do this, too.

367
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,860
I think it makes sense.

368
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,460
Right?

369
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,740
In the future,

370
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,460
I will marry a man from another country.

371
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,980
Forget it.

372
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,220
I'm getting married.

373
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,020
I'm afraid there won't be a chance like this.

374
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,700
Oh,

375
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,700
Changsheng.

376
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,580
Close your eyes first.

377
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,740
I'll give you something.

378
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,660
What is it?

379
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,500
Shhh.

380
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,780
No peeking!

381
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,660
What?

382
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,940
What's this?

383
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,140
This is the dowry I prepared for you.

384
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,060
This thing...

385
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,940
I won't tell you.

386
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,780
Anyway,

387
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,060
you have to wait for the most important time

388
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,900
to open it.

389
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,500
Remember?

390
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,780
(Prince Changle's Mansion)

391
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,620
Be careful.

392
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,940
Dad and Mom are busy.

393
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,060
They can't see us off.

394
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,340
Don't be mad at them.

395
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,420
I've bothered you for days.

396
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,940
Now the mission is complete,

397
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,020
I should go.

398
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,660
I will be staying at posthouse near here.

399
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,940
If you have something,

400
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,180
come find me.

401
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,820
At this point,

402
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,180
what thing will happen?

403
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,700
Just set off with peace of mind.

404
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
You two

405
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,500
take this box to the room.

406
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

407
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,020
Sir.

408
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,420
Sir.

409
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,540
I just caught a big fish in the river.

410
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,540
Should we steam or braise it?

411
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,100
Or we can try sashimi.

412
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,500
Changsheng.

413
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,820
Changsheng is here?

414
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,980
Princess Changsheng is here?

415
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,500
Where?

416
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,700
Ask her to eat with us.

417
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,500
I don't see her.

418
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,820
Princess Changsheng

419
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,980
didn't come.

420
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,380
She never left.

421
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,220
Never left?

422
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,700
She

423
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,700
already lives in Young Master's heart.

424
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,780
This fish is good.

425
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,780
It's my fish.

426
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,100
Sir.

427
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,140
The bodyguard reported

428
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,620
that the top ten shadow warriors
will follow you back to Great Tang,

429
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,620
and the rest stay in Fuyu.

430
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,860
Is this arrangement appropriate?

431
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,700
Sir.

432
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,940
After Changsheng

433
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,300
marries into Great Tang

434
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,620
and learns about my identity,

435
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,340
how do you think she'll react?

436
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,220
A girl like Princess Changsheng

437
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,220
who's talented

438
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,100
and has her own ideas

439
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,860
can't accept being deceived by others.

440
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,300
If she finds herself being cheated,

441
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,180
and the one who cheated her

442
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,580
is someone close to her,

443
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,460
I guess she will react intensely.

444
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,580
Maybe

445
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,500
she'll use extreme means

446
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,860
to make her stand.

447
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,820
You lied to me!

448
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,020
But even so,

449
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,180
you don't have to worry.

450
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,380
With the excuse

451
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,220
of Princess Changsheng

452
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,900
turning against Prince Qin,

453
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,060
you can delcare war on Fuyu.

454
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,700
It's righteous and reasonable.

455
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,420
But it's a pity that Princess Changsheng...

456
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,740
Actually,

457
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,380
according to my observation

458
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,500
of Princess Changsheng in recent days,

459
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,700
Her Highness

460
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,220
is not

461
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,420
an unreasonable person.

462
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,380
Even if she knows your identity,

463
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,420
I guess she won't mind.

464
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,780
Do you want to reveal your true identity

465
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,100
to Her Highness?

466
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,540
Bring me a pen and ink.

467
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,900
(Yi'an)

468
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,580
Give this to Changsheng.

469
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,390
Okay.

470
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,420
Let the bodyguard come to see me.

471
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,260
Yes.

472
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,700
Let's go.

473
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:37,860
(Fengqing Guesthouse)

474
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,260
What?

475
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,420
Does Young Master think
I've been lazy recently?

476
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,860
Otherwise, why does he treat me like this?

477
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,700
He just thinks you are stupid.

478
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,700
Why am I stupid?

479
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,420
You've been with him for so long.

480
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,540
You idiot.

481
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,460
You still don't know what he's thinking.

482
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,300
(Fengqing Guesthouse)

483
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,220
Do you know there is a saying called

484
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,460
a hero is hard to resist a beauty?

485
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,620
(Gorgeous Vernal Scenery)

486
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,380
Hibiscus needs to loosen the soil
three times a day.

487
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,380
When watering it,

488
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,020
remember to avoid standing water.

489
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,140
Yes.

490
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,100
By the way,

491
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,020
pay special attention on moisture.

492
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,620
- Remember to clean up
- Yes.

493
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,560
the water in the basin in time.

494
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,700
OK.

495
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,460
It's almost the season
for begonia flowers to bloom.

496
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,740
Mother likes begonia the most.

497
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,180
Remember to take the begonia flowers

498
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,380
outside to bathe in the sun.

499
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,260
The better the sunshine,

500
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,300
the better the flowers bloom.

501
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,340
Yes.

502
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,860
Your Highness.

503
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,700
What's wrong?

504
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,820
Your Highness.

505
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,380
Young Master asked me to give you this.

506
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,740
Even though the grass withers,

507
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,300
the fallen flowers will meet again elsewhere.

508
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,700
(Yi'an)
After parting ways with old friends,

509
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,460
I only wish for you to know me.

510
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,820
I'm waiting for you.

511
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,420
Is it that

512
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,300
he can't let go of me

513
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,780
and is reluctant to leave me,

514
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,820
so he doesn't want to go back to Great Tang?

515
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,620
Where is Yi'an now?

516
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,540
Still in the posthouse.

517
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,020
(It's over.)

518
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,620
(My guess was correct.)

519
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,900
(So)

520
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,420
(is he waiting for my reply)

521
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,820
(and will not leave until I come?)

522
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,780
Tell Yi'an for me

523
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,540
that I received the letter.

524
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,220
Let me think about it.

525
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,820
She didn't say anything else?

526
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,180
After Princess Changsheng

527
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,260
received this letter,

528
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,740
I've told you

529
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,940
every expression she made

530
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,740
and every word she said.

531
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,580
Presumably,

532
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,500
she must understand what I mean.

533
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,300
Your Highness.

534
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,500
You keep walking around.

535
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,300
I've started to see double.

536
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,820
I think

537
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,180
you have to calm down.

538
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,540
I shouldn't have said these words.

539
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,140
But for your lifelong happiness,

540
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,020
I must say.

541
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,540
Throughout our life,

542
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,980
it's extremely hard to meet

543
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,940
someone who truly loves you

544
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,140
and understands you,

545
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,180
and spend the rest of life

546
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,660
with him.

547
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,740
Marriage is a big deal.

548
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,020
You are going for the peace-making marriage.

549
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,660
You're the future wife of Prince Qin.

550
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,180
If you elope with

551
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,220
an envoy of Great Tang,

552
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,540
the consequences would be disastrous.

553
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,300
I think

554
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
Mr. Envoy

555
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,700
treats you sincerely.

556
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,540
Your Highness.

557
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,740
You should be careful.

558
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,740
At this critical moment,

559
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,820
you can't make mistakes.

560
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,360
But Her Highness's happiness
is also important.

561
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,140
Stop fighting.

562
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,060
What are you talking about?

563
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,860
I can't elope with Yi'an.

564
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,980
But deep down in your heart,

565
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,380
you still want to.

566
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,380
These are two different things.

567
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,900
Shenxing.

568
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,500
This feeling is meant to become recollection.

569
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,540
What is the next sentence?

570
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,100
This feeling is meant...

571
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,100
But at the time we experience,
we didn't realize.

572
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,980
So

573
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,260
I must marry into Great Tang.

574
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,380
There's no fate

575
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,580
between him and I.

576
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,740
But Jinyan was right.

577
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,020
Yi'an treats me sincerely.

578
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,980
Anyway,

579
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,620
I should go see him

580
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,340
and explain.

581
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,780
(Yuguan Posthouse)

582
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,220
(Yuguan Posthouse)

583
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,540
Stop, what are you doing?

584
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,020
Princess Changsheng.

585
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,540
- Youyong.
- Your Highness.

586
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,860
Is Yi'an here?

587
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,900
He's in the room.

588
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,740
Then I'll go find him.

589
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,740
Your Highness.

590
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,940
Yi'an, I have something to tell you.

591
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,380
Don't come out.

592
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,460
Let's just talk like this.

593
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,580
I've been thinking for a long time.

594
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,420
These days,

595
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,180
we've been through a lot

596
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,260
and gotten close.

597
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,620
There will inevitably be some

598
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,140
feelings.

599
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,140
But we can't be together.

600
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,340
You are an envoy.

601
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,580
I am a princess.

602
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,420
I have accepted the peace-making marriage.

603
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,780
Now everything is settled.

604
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,940
Let's go back to our respective positions.

605
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,860
There's still a long way to go.

606
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,460
You have to let go of your obsession

607
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,740
- then we can be...
- Your Highness.

608
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,820
Youmou?

609
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,500
Your Highness.

610
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,540
Spare the formalities.

611
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,540
Who is this?

612
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,660
He looks a bit unfamiliar.

613
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,820
He should be Yi'an's friend.

614
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,860
How many people are in there?

615
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,060
Changsheng.

616
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,060
Sir.

617
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,300
You guys leave us first.

618
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,500
Let's go.

619
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,220
Sir.

620
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,260
What?

621
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,980
Do we need to adjust

622
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,820
the return date?

623
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,260
No.

624
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,300
We'll depart tomorrow as planned.

625
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,300
Go back.

626
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,220
Aren't you not leaving?

627
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,660
Who said I'm not leaving?

628
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,460
You said in the letter

629
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,980
that you would wait for me.

630
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,140
I will always wait for you.

631
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,100
But I'll wait for you in Great Tang.

632
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,540
Then why did you write the letter?

633
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,260
You made a mistake.

634
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,780
I don't mean anything else.

635
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,460
Just don't get me wrong.

636
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,700
(It was a big joke.)

637
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,060
Interesting.

638
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,380
- I am leaving.
- Okay.

639
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,300
Changsheng.

640
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,260
I'll walk you out.

641
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,460
No, thanks.

642
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,340
I'll walk you out.

643
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,730
Why do I feel Young Master is very happy?

644
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,940
I think

645
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,460
it's too early to be happy.

646
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,910
(Prince Changle's Mansion)

647
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,820
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

648
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,500
Aren't you not leaving?

649
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,100
Who said I'm not leaving?

650
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,380
You said you would wait for me.

651
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,460
I will always wait for you.

652
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,460
But I'll wait for you in Great Tang.

653
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,940
Changsheng.

654
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,500
Mother.

655
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,380
I knitted some colorful yarn

656
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,420
and put it in your travel box.

657
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,100
This colorful yarn

658
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,140
is only available in Fuyu.

659
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,380
I wanted to make a wedding dress for you

660
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,540
when you get married.

661
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,140
Now you are marrying to Great Tang.

662
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,620
You'll wear Great Tang's dress
on your wedding day.

663
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,180
I think it's no longer useful.

664
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,060
Mother, don't be sad.

665
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,140
I'm doing fine.

666
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,820
I can finally get married.

667
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,740
I heard from Yi'an

668
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,900
that Prince Qin is a good person.

669
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,420
He has a dignified appearance

670
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,660
and easygoing personality.

671
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,620
How can you believe his words?

672
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,620
He is Prince Qin's confidant.

673
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,220
I've heard it all.

674
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,740
Prince Qin is cruel and violent.

675
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,140
That's...

676
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,980
That's rumors made up
by people who are jealous of him.

677
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,780
Yi'an's words are trustworthy.

678
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,300
Mother.

679
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,900
Don't worry.

680
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,260
Everything

681
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,420
will be fine.

682
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,540
(Self-discipline and Social Commitment)

683
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,360
(Fun of Spring)

684
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,280
Take care.

685
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,040
Your Highness, take care.

686
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,020
This is quite a scene.

687
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,220
Your Highness, you're bored.

688
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,700
Let's take a look at the dowry

689
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,580
to kill the time.

690
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,740
- Okay.
- Jinyan.

691
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,020
Your Highness, be careful about what you do.

692
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,260
Before leaving, His Royal Highness
repeatedly reminded us

693
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,780
the treasures inside are all priceless.

694
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,620
We should watch it carefully.

695
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,460
And he also said...

696
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,580
Said what?

697
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,980
I need to keep an eye on you.

698
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,580
Don't open the box in advance.

699
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,820
It's for me.

700
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,220
Why can't I open it?

701
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,420
I want to see it.

702
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,340
Then go ahead.

703
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,060
That's what you said.

704
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,540
(Pregnant Pill)

705
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,660
Pregnant Pill.

706
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,660
Weird.

707
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,940
Nourishment Pills.

708
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,020
Absurd.

709
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,300
I thought Dad gave me some rare treasure.

710
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,140
Am I going to marry or to die?

711
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,300
So many medicines.

712
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,980
I will get sick from eating these.

713
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,060
Your Highness, watch your words.

714
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,460
No disease.

715
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,220
But I'll get sick from this.

716
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,860
Your Highness, watch your actions.

717
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,860
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

718
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,660
But we are not so sure.

719
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,300
This is what my father gave me.

720
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,820
Could he have put some poison in there

721
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,780
to kill me?

722
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,260
Come on, help me choose.

723
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,100
Which should I eat?

724
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,580
So many medicines.

725
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,620
Which one should I choose?

726
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,700
Just pick the one with a nice name.

727
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,540
Spring Pill.

728
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,340
Spring all year round.

729
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,940
This name is good.

730
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,140
This bottle.

731
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,300
This bottle is called

732
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,340
Lotus Powder.

733
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,940
Fragrance from a pool of lotus flowers.

734
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,300
This is nice.

735
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,990
This bottle is called Life Pill.

736
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,980
You will use it sooner or later.

737
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,860
It should be commonly used.

738
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,540
Take another look.

739
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,420
Is there any word in front?

740
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,260
I'll take another look.

741
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,780
There really is.

742
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,660
Life and Death Pill.

743
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,700
His Royal Highness really

744
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,100
has put everything in here.

745
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,940
