=Episode 11=

3
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,540
(Grand Tutor's Mansion)
Dry days,

4
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,020
watch out for candles.

5
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,260
Dry days,

6
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,320
watch out for candles.

7
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,300
I'm so worried.

8
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,860
The Grand Tutor has not picked
a new auspicious day.

9
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,700
We

10
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,780
don't know when we can see Her Highness.

11
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,900
What?

12
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,300
You miss her?

13
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,460
I dare not.

14
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,300
Your Highness.

15
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,300
Youyong

16
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,020
misses Jinyan.

17
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,900
Go, go, go.

18
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,860
I don't miss her.

19
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,780
Your Highness has been
reading this page for an hour.

20
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,260
Your Highness.

21
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,660
Why didn't you go

22
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,860
to welcome Her Highness?

23
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,180
Are you stupid?

24
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,940
In what identity did His Highness go to Fuyu?

25
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,900
An envoy.

26
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,340
If Her Highness knew the truth now,

27
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,140
with her temper, she'll...

28
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,900
You are smart.

29
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,820
You are smart.

30
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,580
Youyong.

31
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,940
Prepare some red bean cakes.

32
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,180
I want the good-looking ones.

33
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,740
Red bean cakes?

34
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,580
Yes.

35
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,060
Your Highness.

36
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,180
You never eat red bean cakes.

37
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,940
Yes, Your Highness.

38
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,180
You want cakes?

39
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,220
What are you thinking about?

40
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,620
Send them to Her Highness.

41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

42
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,140
Red bean cakes.

43
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,900
I also like to eat it.

44
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,860
Red bean cakes.

45
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,340
Xiaoke.

46
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,780
Do you miss her?

47
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,420
Your Highness.

48
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,170
Shhh.

49
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,340
Greetings, Princess Consort.

50
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,700
She hasn't got married yet.

51
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,940
You should call her Your Highness.

52
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,540
It's just a matter of time.

53
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,380
Your Highness.

54
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,260
Why do you come to the kitchen

55
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,300
at this late hour?

56
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,460
Well,

57
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,940
I have nothing to do,

58
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,940
so I came to chat with you.

59
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,060
Chat with me?

60
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,500
Come and sit down.

61
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,860
What does Prince Qin

62
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,340
like to do usually?

63
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,100
Chop...

64
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,580
Chop people, right?

65
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,660
Note it down.

66
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,820
Bloodthirsty.

67
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,900
Cruel.

68
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,740
No, no, no.

69
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,380
I mean

70
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,100
he usually likes to cook by himself,

71
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,540
so he likes to chop wood and boil water.

72
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,220
But when it comes to cooking,

73
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,140
His Highness's cooking skills

74
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,700
are the best.

75
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,780
Okay, okay.

76
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,460
Well,

77
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,220
what strengths does he have?

78
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,780
That's too many.

79
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,620
His Highness

80
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,500
is proficient in everything.

81
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
He works diligently

82
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,740
and doesn't have time to rest.

83
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,260
He goes to the training ground
every day to train soldiers

84
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,540
only want the people

85
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,820
to live a better life.

86
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,100
(He is indeed aggressive)

87
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,540
(and passionate about war.)

88
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,740
Your Highness.

89
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,580
His Highness

90
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,980
is truly the best of the best.

91
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,180
Marrying him

92
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,580
is really a blessing.

93
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,100
I see.

94
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,940
You must be hungry

95
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,980
coming to the kitchen so late.

96
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,220
No, I'm not.

97
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,220
Don't talk nonsense.

98
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,700
His Highness has already given instructions.

99
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,940
We, as the servants,

100
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,540
need to think what the master thinks

101
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,460
and do things that are
inconvenient for them to say.

102
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,620
Being able to cook for you

103
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,500
is my honor.

104
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,460
Then I'll cook you a bowl of noodles.

105
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,380
With braised beef,

106
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,540
some green vegetables,

107
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,020
and an egg, okay?

108
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,140
Then I want a soft-boiled egg.

109
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,060
She wants it well-done.

110
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,140
Okay.

111
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,860
Well,

112
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,100
I'll ask you one last question.

113
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,140
No problem.

114
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,140
What kind of woman

115
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,420
does Prince Qin like?

116
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,820
I know.

117
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,660
Your Highness.

118
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,380
Since His Highness left the palace,

119
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,460
he's been living in his mansion.

120
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,540
Before you came,

121
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,500
no women had ever come to Huadeng Pavilion.

122
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,660
I can guarantee this.

123
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,780
Even the servants here

124
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,740
are all eunuchs.

125
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,140
And they used to work in the palace.

126
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,820
For so many years,

127
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,660
there's been no women?

128
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,060
Please rest assured.

129
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,140
His Highness has kept his nose clean

130
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,260
and never been close to women.

131
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,140
(Imperial Study)

132
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,700
Your Majesty, the Grand Tutor has arrived.

133
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,820
Your Majesty.

134
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,980
Grand Tutor.

135
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,740
Princess Changsheng

136
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,620
got held up on the road.

137
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,380
Pick another good day

138
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,180
for Prince Qin's wedding.

139
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,580
Your Majesty.

140
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,660
I have...

141
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,620
Why are you so haggard?

142
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,940
Thank you for your concern.

143
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,220
I'm fine.

144
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,540
I was working

145
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,740
all night yesterday.

146
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,860
I've picked

147
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,240
a good date.

148
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,020
How come you already picked it?

149
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,140
I just told you to change the date.

150
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,160
You...

151
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,500
You're indeed the Grand Tutor.

152
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,020
You even foretold

153
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,500
my toughts.

154
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,180
At 3:45

155
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,460
on July 7th.

156
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,020
It's the best day

157
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,660
for Prince Qin and Princess Consort
to get married

158
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,860
in a century.

159
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,900
Okay.

160
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,220
It's a deal then.

161
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,820
The wedding and enthronement ceremony

162
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,260
will be held on the same day.

163
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,540
Ministry of Propaganda,

164
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,220
- go get ready.
- Yes.

165
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,660
I'll take my leave.

166
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,060
How is Her Highness these days?

167
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,900
Everything is prepared
according to your instructions.

168
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,260
The food and fruits

169
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,780
are all Her Highness's favorite.

170
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,620
Since the wedding has been postponed,

171
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,780
can you go visit

172
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,780
Her Highness now?

173
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,260
After all,

174
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,420
it's much more convenient

175
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,020
than letting us

176
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,900
pass the messages.

177
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,140
(She still doesn't know my true identity)

178
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,140
(is Prince Qin.)

179
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,820
(If I visit her now,)

180
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,500
(it's hard to explain.)

181
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,340
Never mind.

182
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,220
I'll go another day.

183
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,060
Not today.

184
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,420
Your Highness, look.

185
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,660
Braised lamb trotters.

186
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,740
Your favorite dish.

187
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,260
And also red bean cakes
specially prepared by the kitchen.

188
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,260
Prince Qin is really good to you.

189
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,780
How does he know I like these?

190
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,100
Red bean

191
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,820
represents lovesickness.

192
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,540
Could it be that Prince Qin

193
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,460
is expressing his feelings in this way?

194
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,980
He's never seen me.

195
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,340
What kind of feelings does he have for me?

196
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,100
Well,

197
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,620
how come they're like

198
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,140
the lamb trotter made by Wangchun Restaurant?

199
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,700
Are you homesick?

200
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,340
This is just ordinary braised lamb trotters.

201
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,180
No, no.

202
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,220
You try it.

203
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,540
The chef of Wangchun Restaurant

204
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,660
is good at using spice.

205
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,220
Their lamb trotter

206
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,700
is fresh

207
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,700
and slightly spicy,

208
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,540
not smelly at all.

209
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,380
This really tastes like Wangchun Restaurant.

210
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,540
Could it be

211
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,180
Prince Qin invited the chef

212
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,980
of Wangchun Restaurant for you?

213
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,500
Prince Qin treats you so well.

214
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,420
Unfortunately...

215
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,780
Jinyan,

216
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,820
you should be careful with your words too.

217
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,100
It's fine.

218
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,260
Let's eat.

219
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,620
By the way,

220
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,700
after dinner, help me with something.

221
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,020
Help me collect information about Prince Qin.

222
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,740
Your Highness.

223
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,900
Right now we

224
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,940
are in Great Tang.

225
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,140
You can't act as you please.

226
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,140
I want to see

227
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,860
what kind of person

228
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,100
Prince Qin is.

229
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,460
Get ready.

230
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,420
(What kind of man is Prince Qin?)

231
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,340
(I must find an opportunity)

232
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,300
(to see him.)

233
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,020
Everyone, please pay attention.

234
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,900
Be careful with the roots.

235
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,140
Water them.

236
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,010
Be sure to give it more water.

237
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,140
Mr. Xiao.

238
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Is it going well?

239
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,900
Of course.

240
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,980
I'll finish well

241
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
what Changsheng entrusted to me.

242
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,140
Where is Princess Changsheng?

243
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,620
Mr. Xiao.

244
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,100
Her Highness is not convenient
to move around in Great Tang now.

245
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,060
So she didn't come.

246
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,420
Have you met Prince Qin?

247
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,860
How does he treat Changsheng?

248
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,100
Has Changsheng suffered?

249
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,660
Her Highness hasn't seen Prince Qin.

250
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,420
But he's prepared

251
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,140
everything appropriately,

252
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,180
like he knows Her Highness's preferences.

253
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,660
Still not impressive.

254
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,660
Mr. Xiao.

255
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,100
This is Her Highness's letter.

256
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,860
Go back and tell Changsheng

257
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,980
that after the wedding banquet,

258
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,380
I will go to Prince Qin's Mansion to see her.

259
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,740
Your Highness, this is everything

260
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,220
I recorded about Prince Qin.

261
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,860
Look, it's so thick.

262
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,660
(Bloodthirsty, brutal, cruel)

263
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,420
His shortcomings

264
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,260
are too numerous to record.

265
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,820
This Yi'an.

266
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,540
I trusted him so much.

267
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,700
How could he trick me
into marrying someone like this?

268
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,180
Don't let me see him.

269
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,460
Otherwise,

270
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,460
see how I deal with him.

271
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,900
Your Highness.

272
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,460
Mr. Yi'an is here.

273
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,580
I saw him.

274
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,100
Yi'an.

275
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,820
Your Highness.

276
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,740
What a coincidence.

277
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,180
I wouldn't have noticed you
if you hadn't called me.

278
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,260
Yes.

279
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,860
You're favored by Prince Qin.

280
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,700
Naturally, you don't have to

281
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,860
take me seriously.

282
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,060
Your Highness...

283
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,060
I'm joking.

284
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,300
So you won't take it seriously.

285
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,660
Don't you often

286
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,100
joke with me?

287
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,500
Unfortunately,

288
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,740
I was so stupid

289
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,940
and innocent.

290
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,420
Your Highness, I came today

291
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,700
to tell you something.

292
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,380
It's about Prince Qin, right?

293
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,060
You know you can't hide it anymore, right?

294
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,900
You knew already?

295
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,660
These

296
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,060
are the rumors I found

297
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,700
about him these days.

298
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,740
It's nothing like

299
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,500
what you described.

300
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Nothing like it at all.

301
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,540
By the way, a few days ago,

302
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,500
he didn't come to welcome me.

303
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,340
The Emperor said he was ill.

304
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,660
Yes.

305
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,060
- It's...
- What's the disease

306
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,300
to make him too sick to welcome me?

307
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,060
He hasn't come to Huadeng Pavilion.

308
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,460
Could it be...

309
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,260
Prince Qin has already...

310
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,260
Already?

311
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,180
Is it that

312
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,660
he's already dead?

313
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,460
But why nothing happens in the mansion?

314
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,660
That is because...

315
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,540
You got it?

316
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,620
Prince Qin died of illness

317
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,020
and don't want outsiders to know,

318
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,500
so they kept it strictly confidential.

319
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,700
I understand.

320
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,460
(Huadeng Pavilion)

321
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,780
Who are you?

322
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,300
It's me! It's me!

323
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,140
Your Highness.

324
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,700
We are unfamiliar with the place.

325
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,980
What are you doing here?

326
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,540
That's why I need to walk around

327
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
to understand the situation
before I can take action.

328
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,460
But...

329
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,300
But what?

330
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,500
You don't know how dire the situation is.

331
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,820
Prince Qin is dead.

332
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,700
We might be silenced.

333
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,180
Just in case,

334
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,700
I want to understand
the layout of Prince Qin's Mansion

335
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,340
and get ready to run.

336
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,300
Your Highness, will this work?

337
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,260
You don't understand, I'll tell you later.

338
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,100
Keep it confidential.

339
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,500
Hurry up.

340
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,460
Be careful.

341
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,380
Be careful.

342
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,820
I know.

343
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,700
Who's it? An assassin!

344
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,980
Inform Prince Qin that there is an assassin.

345
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,860
You can't escape.

346
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,940
Surrender now.

347
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,300
(Oops,)

348
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,180
(there are so many people.)

349
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,300
(I should save my life.)

350
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,460
Okay.

351
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,660
I surrender.

352
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,980
- Just surrendered like this?
- I surrender.

353
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,460
Please take me to see Prince Qin.

354
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,700
I won't resist.

355
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,740
Little thief,

356
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,020
you must have ill intentions.

357
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,500
Could it be that you'd fight to the death

358
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,660
until you meet Prince Qin?

359
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,620
Makes sense.

360
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,860
You can't meet His Highness

361
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,860
as you want.

362
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,740
Put her in the dungeon first

363
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,740
and wait for the order.

364
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
- Yes.
- Wait, wait.

365
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,860
Gentlemen,

366
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,180
you misunderstood.

367
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,620
By now,

368
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,260
I have to reveal my true identity.

369
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,860
In fact, I am Princess Changsheng from Fuyu,

370
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,540
and your future Princess Consort.

371
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,100
You are the Princess Consort?

372
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,220
Then I'm the Prince Consort.

373
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,060
Right.

374
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,340
I heard that Fuyu's princess is beautiful

375
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,340
and gentle.

376
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,340
She's a model of a noble lady.

377
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,260
Look at you again.

378
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,940
You're out at night in nocturnal clothing.

379
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,980
You surly can talk big.

380
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,740
I really am Liu Changsheng.

381
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,580
Look at me.

382
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,740
Gentle.

383
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,060
Beautiful.

384
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,780
Can you feel it?

385
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,140
Go get her.

386
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,460
Wait.

387
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,420
There's a Mr. Yi'an

388
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,980
in Prince Qin's Mansion.

389
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,820
He knows me.

390
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,180
What Yi'an?

391
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,460
I'm Er'an.

392
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,300
Bros.

393
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,500
I think she is just talking nonsense

394
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,420
to delay time.

395
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,100
- Let's get her.
- Don't come over.

396
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
It's Prince Qin.

397
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,660
Back off, back off.

398
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,380
Yi'an.

399
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,500
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

400
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,180
(Oh no.)

401
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,500
(This situation...)

402
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,740
(If this gets out,)

403
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,860
(Yi'an will...)

404
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,660
I am really Princess Changsheng.

405
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,540
If you dare to hurt me today,

406
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,860
His Majesty will not forgive you.

407
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,580
I advise you not to act rashly.

408
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,260
(I'm domineering.)

409
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,460
Are you scared? Leave quickly.

410
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,780
Greetings, Prince Qin.

411
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,740
Okay, get up.

412
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,980
You...

413
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,860
She's indeed Princess Changsheng from Fuyu,

414
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,340
my future wife.

415
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,180
She's the mistress

416
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,260
of my mansion.

417
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,420
Greetings, Your Highness.

418
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,300
Alright.

419
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,380
Be careful next time.

420
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,220
Don't offend her.

421
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,780
Strengthen the guard

422
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,260
to protect Her Highness's safety.

423
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,900
And don't tell others

424
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,260
what happened tonight.

425
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,100
Yes.

426
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,380
(He is actually Prince Qin.)

427
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,340
You...

428
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,420
They just said

429
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,860
they don't know someone named Yi'an.

430
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,700
Yi'an is my pet name.

431
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
After I became Prince Qin,

432
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,620
no one knows that.

433
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,660
They call you Prince Qin.

434
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,500
Yes.

435
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,740
So

436
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,340
Yi'an is Prince Qin.

437
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,580
Prince Qin is...

438
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,900
The violent and murderous freak

439
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,340
who has quirks

440
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,340
and likes to kill people.

441
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,420
Now you believe it?

442
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,220
I...

443
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,500
- You believed those people.
- But...

444
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,940
You don't believe me.

445
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,460
I don't disbelieve you.

446
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,660
But before you were Mr. Envoy,

447
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,260
- and now...
- In Great Tang,

448
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,140
there are many rumors

449
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,980
and slanders.

450
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,180
From now on,

451
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,620
don't believe what others say.

452
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,100
Just trust me.

453
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,820
You...

454
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,820
What are you going to do?

455
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,020
What do you think?

456
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,300
I haven't killed anyone in a long time.

457
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,660
You don't have to do it.

458
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,260
I will end my own life.

459
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,660
You are so repulsive to the marriage?

460
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,700
Prince Qin has round eyes
and a large forehead,

461
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,740
two protruding ears,

462
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,900
and a mouth full of fangs.

463
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,140
He's just hideous.

464
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,340
It's not his appearance that's bad.

465
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,940
It's his character.

466
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,380
He's violent

467
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,780
and likes to eat people.

468
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,940
Anyway, I definitely won't marry

469
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,340
this kind of person.

470
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,140
It's so embarrassing.

471
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,020
(Bright as Jade)

472
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,940
Your Highness.

473
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,020
Jinyan and Shenxing...

474
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,340
They

475
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,780
kicked me out again.

476
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,940
She still won't see me?

477
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,700
This time Princess Changsheng
seems to be really angry.

478
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,100
Your Highness, you are on your own.

479
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,460
According to the report from the cleaner
in Huadeng Pavilion,

480
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,460
Princess Changsheng now

481
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,900
refuses to see anyone

482
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,980
and hasn't stepped out of her room

483
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,700
in three days.

484
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,860
Am I pushing too hard?

485
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,980
But according to the fat guy
in the back kitchen,

486
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
Princess Changsheng

487
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,780
still has three meals a day.

488
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,180
Last night,

489
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,540
she even ordered a duck

490
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,380
for midnight snack.

491
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,100
Your Highness.

492
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,060
Where are we going?

493
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,340
Where else can we go?

494
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,940
She is waiting for me to apologize first.

495
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,700
Your Highness.

496
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,820
You haven't forgiven Yi'an...

497
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,060
Prince Qin?

498
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,700
I just feel a little embarrassed.

499
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,100
I said so many bad words

500
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,460
about Prince Qin

501
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,580
in front of him.

502
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,900
It's better not to see him.

503
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,740
You can't hide from Prince Qin forever.

504
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,220
He is your husband.

505
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,140
The wedding ceremony has not been held.

506
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,940
I have nothing to do with him now.

507
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,140
Moreover,

508
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,780
I'm not hiding from him.

509
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,460
Your Highness.

510
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,260
We are all on his territory.

511
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,580
Do you still want to escape marriage?

512
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,260
And Youyong has come 20 or 30 times.

513
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,340
You didn't see him.

514
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,380
What if we make Prince Qin angry

515
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,300
and he'll...

516
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,100
What do we do then?

517
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,540
I won't talk to you.

518
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,380
Anyway,

519
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,140
you must wait until
the most important time to open it.

520
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,380
Do you think

521
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,180
this is an important moment?

522
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,380
It's either an important moment

523
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,780
or a desperate time.

524
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,940
Jinyan, go.

525
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,980
Find the dowry Guangde gave me.

526
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,030
Your Highness.

527
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,460
What time is this?

528
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,020
Why are you still thinking about that?

529
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,700
If Prince Qin is really unreliable,

530
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
and we have to escape,

531
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,820
we should bring some real treasure.

532
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,580
Let's see what Guangde gave me.

533
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,860
Go.

534
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,460
(Youlan Pavilion)
I'll clean this up first.

535
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,540
Your Highness.

536
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,540
(Princess Changsheng)

537
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,140
Now that you've opened the box,

538
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,900
I guess you had a fight with your husband.

539
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,740
Don't get angry.

540
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,500
These are all the tips I wrote

541
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,020
for couples to reconcile.

542
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,300
As long as you follow the instructions,

543
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,900
you and your husband will definitely

544
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,060
become inseparable

545
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,940
like glue.

546
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,580
(Guangde.)

547
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,460
(Who wants to be inseparable with him?)

548
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,300
Your Highness.

549
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,340
What's wrong?

550
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,980
(Forget it, I'll just take a look.)

551
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,860
Your Highness.

552
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,700
Your Highness.

553
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,300
Mr. Xiao sent someone to report

554
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,580
the batch of saplings we brought from Fuyu

555
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,140
- won't survive.
- What?

556
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,380
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

557
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,500
I'm afraid Muyan tree
can't adapt to the soil here.

558
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,060
- You guys prepare early.
- Yes.

559
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,220
Changsheng, get on the horse.

560
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,820
I know you're going to the Muyan Forest.

561
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,100
If you don't want to delay,

562
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,940
get on the horse now.

563
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,660
I concealed my identity before

564
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,180
because I had a heavy responsibility.

565
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,140
If my identity is exposed,

566
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,340
I might be assassinated or attacked on the way.

567
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,900
So I used the name Yi'an.

568
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,820
After that,

569
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,940
I didn't find the right time to tell you.

570
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,660
I didn't want to hide it from you.

571
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,180
I promise you that

572
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,580
I won't lie to you again

573
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,780
from now on.

574
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,940
Only you know

575
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,220
whether you mean it

576
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,460
or not.

577
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,980
How can I tell?

578
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,900
Besides,

579
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,420
don't follow me in a while.

580
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,380
Your Highness.

581
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,780
They look fine.

582
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,100
Where is Xiao Zilv?

583
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,860
Your Highness.

584
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,820
The Imperial Academy of Medicine has something.

585
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,940
Mr. Xiao was just called away.

586
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,940
I know he's unreliable.

587
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,700
Didn't I tell you not to follow me?

588
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,700
I'm just watering it.

589
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,660
No need.

590
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,660
Your Highness, what are you doing?

591
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,740
OK.

592
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,220
You want to water it?

593
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,260
Then water all the trees.

594
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,700
Doctor Yuan.

595
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,860
The acupuncture technique you just used...

596
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,940
It treats illnesses

597
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,420
according to human's

598
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,460
meridians and acupoints.

599
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,740
The most important thing is

600
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,020
to find the accurate acupuncture points.

601
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,980
- This can't be learned...
- Doctor Yuan, please stay.

602
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,700
- Ms. Fang.
- I finally caught up with you.

603
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,900
Consort De wants to invite you
to take a look at the description.

604
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,740
OK.

605
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,260
Zilv.

606
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,700
Doctor Yuan.

607
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,220
This doctor

608
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,260
looks unfamiliar.

609
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,260
I forgot to introduce.

610
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,740
Zilv.

611
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,740
You go back to the clinic first.

612
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,940
I have a copy of "Miraculous Pivot"
on my cabinet.

613
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,580
- Read it carefully.
- Okay.

614
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,820
I'll be back soon.

615
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,180
- This way, please.
- Ms. Fang, please.

616
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,940
It was my fault for hiding my identity before.

617
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,500
But can you please let me make up for it

618
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,020
for the sake that I helped water the trees?

619
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,900
Or tell me if you have any requests.

620
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,660
I will definitely grand them.

621
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,740
Even though the grass withers,

622
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,340
the fallen flowers will meet again elsewhere.

623
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,460
After parting ways with old friends...

624
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,540
Shut up, why are you
saying this all of a sudden?

625
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,380
Why can't I say it?

626
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,780
This is the poem I wrote for you.

627
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,180
You obviously wanted
to embarrass me on purpose.

628
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,380
Keep me in the dark

629
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,300
and fool me around.

630
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,660
The first two lines of this poem

631
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,980
is my identity.

632
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,940
It's my hint to you.

633
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,420
What?

634
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,900
Even though the grass withers,

635
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,820
I only wish for you to know me.

636
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,100
This means Yi'an is Prince Qin.

637
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,780
Who would have thought of this?

638
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,620
You are not allowed to follow me anymore.

639
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,460
Now everyone knows

640
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,780
the Third Prince is called Lv Jing.

641
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,940
But only those closest to me know

642
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,460
Yi'an is my courtesy name.

643
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,580
And didn't you

644
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,740
look for me before?

645
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,220
What?

646
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,340
I wanted to say goodbye to you.

647
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,980
It meant nothing else.

648
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,220
I have witnesses.

649
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,260
Come out, everyone.

650
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,180
What?

651
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,140
It's you again.

652
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,700
Greetings, Princess Consort.

653
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,220
I'm not your Princess Consort.

654
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,700
Greetings, future Princess Consort.

655
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,180
Changsheng.

656
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,340
They can all testify for me.

657
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,420
It doesn't count.

658
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,540
They are all your people.

659
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,980
Of course, they listen to what you say.

660
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,020
Let them disappear.

661
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,980
Did you hear

662
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,940
Princess Consort's words?

663
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,460
Disappear.

664
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,100
Yes.

665
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,540
Isn't this good?

666
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,100
Just treat me as Yi'an.

667
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,380
You don't have to face an unfamiliar husband.

668
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,060
I'll take my leave too.

669
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,340
Why did the wind suddenly rise?

670
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,860
It will get cold soon.

671
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,740
Princess, sit here for a while.

672
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,820
I'll be back soon.

673
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,220
My book.

674
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,380
What's going on?

675
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,940
What are you doing?

676
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,460
