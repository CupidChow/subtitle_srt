=Episode 21=

3
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,850
Quick.

4
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,170
No one can be left alive!

5
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,010
Kill them!

6
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,820
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

7
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,450
Save them.

8
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,340
(Imperial Study)

9
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
Liu Changsheng.

10
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,220
Although you are the Princess of Fuyu,

11
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,980
after marrying into Great Tang,

12
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,430
you must abide by our rules.

13
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,430
I ordered you to stay at home,

14
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,890
how dare you go out without permission?

15
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,750
I know I was wrong,

16
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
but I really had no choice.

17
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,030
No choice?

18
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,470
Did someone force you to leave the house?

19
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,520
Last night,

20
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,590
Chu Ge came to visit me

21
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,610
and told me that His Highness
was sent to the fiefdom.

22
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,400
I was afraid something would happen to him.

23
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,700
- So...
- Something did happen.

24
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,070
I was quite surprised

25
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,870
that my third son

26
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,870
ran away halfway.

27
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,470
Your Majesty, please investigate it.

28
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,450
His Highness was just sent to the fiefdom.

29
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,980
He didn't commit a heinous crime.

30
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,190
Why would he run away?

31
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,520
Jing may be dissatisfied with the removal
of his military power,

32
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,290
and the deprivation of his title.

33
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,130
Your Majesty.

34
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,100
His Highness is dedicated to the people.

35
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,540
He isn't a greedy person.

36
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,450
If he is really such a person,

37
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,980
he wouldn't harvest food for the people

38
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,590
at the risk of defying your order.

39
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,570
Brother.

40
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,100
I have something to say.

41
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,330
Wan.

42
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,190
You are...

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Brother.

44
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,680
I received a letter from Changsheng

45
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,980
and hurriedly led the soldiers there.

46
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,100
I found Prince Qin was besieged by assassins.

47
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,050
There must be something fishy behind this.

48
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,360
Please investigate it thoroughly.

49
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,350
Where is Jing? Where is he?

50
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,630
Is Jing injured?

51
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,650
Tell me.

52
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,900
Where is Jing?

53
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,550
I was a step late.

54
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,020
When I arrived,

55
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,260
Jing had fallen off the cliff.

56
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,960
Changsheng.

57
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,890
Changsheng.

58
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,480
Your Highness.

59
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,400
Your Highness.

60
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,880
- Jing.
- Your Highness.

61
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,330
Your Highness.

62
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,500
Your Highness.

63
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
Your Highness.

64
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,650
Your Highness.

65
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,840
Your Highness.

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,850
Your Highness.

67
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,440
- Jing.
- Your Highness.

68
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,500
Jing.

69
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,010
Your Highness.

70
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,020
Jing.

71
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,460
Your Highness.

72
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,310
- Your Highness.
- Jing.

73
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,190
Jing.

74
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,370
What is that?

75
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,280
It's...

76
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,640
It's...

77
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,990
It's a locust.

78
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,720
Go over there and take a look.

79
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
- Okay.
- Yes.

80
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,600
Your Highness.

81
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,690
Go over there and take a look.

82
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,380
- Not here.
- Jing.

83
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,090
Keep looking.

84
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,930
Your Highness.

85
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,460
- Your Highness.
- Have you checked there?

86
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,600
No.

87
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,430
Go to the front.

88
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,900
There are locusts.

89
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,700
The locusts are coming.

90
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,460
Run, run!

91
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,900
- The locusts are coming.
- Run.

92
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,070
The locusts are coming.

93
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,640
Your Highness.

94
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,700
At your request,

95
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,460
we've sent more people
to search for His Highness.

96
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,400
Besides,

97
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,340
His Majesty just sent someone to ask

98
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,400
did His Highness

99
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,720
leave some

100
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,310
strategies of tackling the locust plague.

101
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,870
Strategies of tackling the locust plague?

102
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,260
What are you writing?

103
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,860
Some thoughts on controling locust swarms.

104
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,830
(Trapping and Burning Locusts)

105
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,160
I referred to the methods of controlling

106
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,930
locust plague recorded in historical books

107
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,850
and made some notes.

108
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,750
We should take preventive measures.

109
00:06:59,050 --> 00:06:59,890
Harvest the grain.

110
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,200
Harvest the grain.

111
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,790
In my opinion,

112
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,940
Jing needs to suffer some grievances

113
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,760
and be confined to the Reflection Room

114
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,830
to resolve people's resentment.

115
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,520
No.

116
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,340
Then I will report to His Majesty.

117
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,570
Wait.

118
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,190
Go to His Highness's study and wait for me.

119
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,690
Yes.

120
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,420
(Light in the Courtyard)

121
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,260
(Notes on Preventing Locusts)

122
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,660
(Encirclement)

123
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,260
(You've worked so hard)

124
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,700
(and racked your brains)

125
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,260
(for Great Tang's sake)

126
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,070
(to find a solution.)

127
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,230
(But His Majesty)

128
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,400
(and the people)

129
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,820
(did this to you in return.)

130
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,930
(Notes on Preventing Locusts)

131
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,190
(Is it really worth it?)

132
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,460
(Resolving the turmoil.)

133
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,140
(But it's the people that are in turmoil.)

134
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,870
(The more you prevent it,
it unleashes more turmoil.)

135
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,500
Why not let them all accompany you?

136
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,260
What is Her Highness thinking?

137
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,070
This bunch of fools
caused His Highness to end up like this.

138
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,840
Now she's helping them to control locusts.

139
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,860
Now Prince Lu

140
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,940
is also in charge of the disaster control.

141
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,490
If you ask me,

142
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,640
it is better to change

143
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,390
the disaster management policies.

144
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,910
Wouldn't that be harmful?

145
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,820
Who harmed whom first?

146
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,090
Never mind.

147
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
Forget about it.

148
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,010
Take it.

149
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,200
Remember to tell him

150
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,290
that the methods recorded

151
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,390
were all carefully considered.

152
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,030
Don't change them at will.

153
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,160
Yes.

154
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,220
Youmou, wait a moment.

155
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,620
The 40% of the food previously prepared

156
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,170
should still be in the mansion, right?

157
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,010
Yes.

158
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,090
But

159
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,770
it might be transferred soon.

160
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,610
Don't give it to them.

161
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,430
I know how to use

162
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,490
the 40% of food.

163
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,810
Your Highness, it...

164
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,680
No need to say more.

165
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,520
I know what I'm doing.

166
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,910
Help me do something.

167
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,390
Before His Highness returns home,

168
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,360
the entire mansion

169
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,520
should listen to my instructions.

170
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,730
If someone disobeys,

171
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,220
heavy penalties may be imposed.

172
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,770
Yes.

173
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,530
Princess Royal.

174
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,510
Have you checked carefully?

175
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,820
Although the hall has taken precautions,

176
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,760
we still need to be careful that

177
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,410
locust invasions will damage the books.

178
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,700
Check it again.

179
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,850
Yes.

180
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,320
Princess Royal.

181
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,770
You have been working all night recently.

182
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,910
I guess you haven't had dinner.

183
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,430
I prepared some refreshing side dishes.

184
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Lingzhi.

185
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,550
I don't know if Jing's alive or dead.

186
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,220
How can I have the appetite?

187
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,890
At a time like this,

188
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,480
you have to brace yourself up.

189
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,100
His Highness is a lucky man.

190
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,620
How's Changsheng?

191
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,460
I just went to Prince Qin's Mansion.

192
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,210
The servant said that Changsheng went out

193
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,960
with Jinyan, Shenxing, Youyong and Youmou.

194
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,940
But I don't know where she went.

195
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,620
I guess she went to look for His Highness.

196
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,910
This locust swarms
have only been here for one day.

197
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,480
But the hidden dangers brought by it

198
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,270
will take over a year to cure.

199
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,910
In my opinion,

200
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,940
these aren't the scariest.

201
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,740
What do you mean?

202
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,740
The natural disaster

203
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,030
is followed by the man-made disaster.

204
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,580
This place must be paid attention to.

205
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,430
And also the grain.

206
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,700
Keep an eye on it.

207
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,890
(Grain)

208
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,430
Changsheng, how are you?

209
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:23,770
Take it away.

210
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,010
Ke.

211
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,130
It's so late.

212
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,860
What are you doing here

213
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,720
instead of studying your disaster relief notes?

214
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,790
Food and fodder should go

215
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,150
ahead of troops and horses.

216
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,130
I hope you could help

217
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,740
with raising food.

218
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,980
You're right.

219
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,840
Since now you're in charge

220
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,070
of the disaster relief work,

221
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,620
you should figure out a way

222
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,430
to raise food.

223
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,270
Maybe Jing left in a hurry

224
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,130
and you are depressed,

225
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,970
so you get confused.

226
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,170
That day, Jing proposed

227
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,580
to donate 40% of the food.

228
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,310
Did he propose that?

229
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,910
I didn't know.

230
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,030
I am just a woman.

231
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,200
I only know to protect
the family property for my husband.

232
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,430
Since he promised that,

233
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,370
you can go find him.

234
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,210
Okay.

235
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,100
Your Highness is eloquent.

236
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,240
I don't have time

237
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,650
to waste with you here.

238
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,190
It's up to my father to decide.

239
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,890
After the plague is lifted,

240
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,730
perhaps

241
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,070
the locusts will be attached to this place.

242
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,910
Your Highness, don't be hurt by them.

243
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,980
Ke, stay.

244
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,170
What a big locust!

245
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,530
Fortunately, I found it.

246
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,440
Liu Changsheng.

247
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
You're right.

248
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,340
The plauge is lifted.

249
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,910
Beware of the locusts left.

250
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,220
They will cause harm.

251
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,010
I got anxious

252
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,980
and acted impulsively.

253
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,250
Please don't blame me.

254
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,070
Your Highness is widowed at a young age.

255
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,820
I tell you, let's wait and see.

256
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,090
He's not dead, he'll come back.

257
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,430
Liu Changsheng, you crazy woman!

258
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,580
I won't let it go.

259
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,550
You all should go and get busy.

260
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,550
Where are you?

261
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,340
You will definitely come back.

262
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,620
Come back quickly.

263
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,910
I know you'll come back.

264
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,620
Your Highness, your face...

265
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,430
That crazy woman Liu Changsheng

266
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,190
dared to hit me.

267
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,550
Sooner or later,

268
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,100
I'll make her pay.

269
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,320
Your Highness, calm down.

270
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,700
But Father still cares about Lv Jing

271
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,210
and shows understanding

272
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,410
for Liu Changsheng.

273
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,820
This crazy woman won't give out the food.

274
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,670
Father doesn't want to force her

275
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,600
out of guilt for Lv Jing.

276
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,100
Father favors Jing,

277
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,220
so he won't make things hard
for Liu Changsheng.

278
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,980
But what if Jing is already dead?

279
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,940
If we can't find Jing's body,

280
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,790
Father will not believe it.

281
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,430
It's just a body.

282
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,190
The water is turbulent

283
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,510
under the cliff.

284
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,270
If he died in the water,

285
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,580
the body would be ruined in a day.

286
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,570
This Liu Changsheng

287
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,690
refused to donate food

288
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,310
to save the people from trouble

289
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,970
and caused Great Tang

290
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,550
to lose the most valued prince.

291
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,920
Will Father

292
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,670
forgive

293
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,550
such kind of person?

294
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,860
Liu Changsheng.

295
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,190
I don't believe you'll survive this.

296
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,860
(Imperial Study)

297
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,400
Father.

298
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,800
You...

299
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,220
Changsheng was just anxious

300
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,390
and couldn't control her emotions.

301
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,100
It's her again.

302
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,700
Father, don't blame her.

303
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,030
But however sad she is,

304
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,650
she can't delay the disaster relief work

305
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,070
and risk people's livelihoods.

306
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,670
I tried my best to convince her,

307
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,890
but she still refused

308
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,390
to donate the 40% of food they promised.

309
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,030
Now the people are starving.

310
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,740
Refused to donate food?

311
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,190
She is

312
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,940
blaming me.

313
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,530
Father is in high position,

314
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,460
and naturally beas in mind
the overall interests.

315
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,820
Changsheng is just a woman.

316
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,940
It is difficult for her to understand.

317
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,980
I feel guilty for Jing.

318
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,340
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

319
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,310
Troublemarker!

320
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,610
Go back.

321
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,910
Go back now, jinx!

322
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,070
Go back.

323
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,270
Go back to Fuyu.

324
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,820
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

325
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,580
The food outside the city
must be properly placed.

326
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,320
Those will save lives.

327
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,340
- Understand?
- Yes.

328
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,720
And this drawing.

329
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,620
Take another look.

330
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,050
Your Highness, the meal is ready.

331
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,430
Let us serve you to eat.

332
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,560
Now locust swarms are spreading,

333
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,080
let's not waste food.

334
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,510
Sit down and let's eat together.

335
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,944
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

336
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,450
Let's eat.

337
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,370
Your Highness, the palace sent someone

338
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,310
to ask you to go to the palace.

339
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,180
Seems that I can't have this meal.

340
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,600
Your Highness.

341
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,510
There are still many people gathered
at the front door.

342
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,930
Let's go through the back door.

343
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,030
Why go through the back door?

344
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,210
Your Highness.

345
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,680
Now the people of the city

346
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,520
have been instigated

347
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:28,690
and lost control.

348
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,930
Can you bear with it?

349
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,850
His Highness and I did nothing wrong.

350
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,100
Why should we flinch?

351
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,650
Your Highness.

352
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,490
Let's go.

353
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,460
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

354
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,160
Go back.

355
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,050
Go back to Fuyu.

356
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,100
Go back.

357
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,450
Go back.

358
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,040
- How dare you!
- Your Highness.

359
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,790
He's just an innocent child.

360
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,030
Let him be.

361
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,490
Jinx.

362
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,060
Go back to Fuyu.

363
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,580
(The world now)

364
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,180
(is not what you want.)

365
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,270
(Come back quickly.)

366
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,270
(Let's make it)

367
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,100
(a better place together.)

368
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,650
The Princess of Fuyu, Liu Changsheng,

369
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,900
requests an audience.

370
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,140
Your Majesty.

371
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,340
Rise.

372
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,310
Your head...

373
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,340
Thank you for your concern.

374
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,560
I'm fine.

375
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,820
Just bumped my head.

376
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,860
Ke told me

377
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,420
that your mansion

378
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,510
has been busy.

379
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,990
You didn't have time

380
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,340
to donate food.

381
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,120
Your Majesty.

382
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,510
I have my own difficulties.

383
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,030
We can't use

384
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,340
the 40% of food.

385
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,380
How dare you!

386
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,800
I dare not.

387
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,650
But I really can't use it.

388
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,490
Your Majesty.

389
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,880
How bold!

390
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,420
You've become more and more unruly.

391
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,510
Flog him twenty times.

392
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,270
Your Majesty, bad news.

393
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,320
What's up?

394
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,520
Take your time.

395
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,490
Your Highness.

396
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,820
We've found His Highness's body.

397
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,520
Impossible.

398
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,880
Impossible.

399
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,690
Impossible.

400
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,580
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

401
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,510
Your Highness,
the imperial decree has arrived.

402
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,030
How can Great Tang's imperial decree
be issued so casually?

403
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,580
His Majesty knows you are in a bad mood,

404
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,420
so you don't need to kneel.

405
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,270
He restored Prince Qin's title

406
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,310
and will hold the funeral

407
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,440
following the Crown Prince's rank.

408
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,310
Funeral?

409
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,950
Why hold the funeral?

410
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,370
That's not His Highness's body.

411
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,570
Your Highness, sorry about that.

412
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,900
- His Highness...
- Get out!

413
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,610
Your Highness.

414
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,450
Your Highness.

415
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,890
Be careful on the ladder.

416
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,730
Okay.

417
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:14,970
Stop.

418
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,100
What are you doing?

419
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,960
Your Highness, this is Mr. Youmou's order.

420
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,510
- We were decorating...
- His Highness is not dead.

421
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,030
That's not him.

422
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,960
Your Highness.

423
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,380
This is His Majesty's order.

424
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,420
Don't make it difficult for them.

425
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,340
No one's order will work.

426
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,820
His Highness will come back.

427
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,140
Your Highness.

428
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,070
Pass my order.

429
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,790
Anyone who does

430
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,140
these unlucky things again

431
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,660
will be flogged to death.

432
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,500
(Prince Lu's Mansion)

433
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,360
Come on, Ge.

434
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,080
Let me toast you.

435
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,820
Congratulations, your wishes have come true.

436
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,550
Liu Changsheng

437
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,900
refused to hold the funeral.

438
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,180
Now Father

439
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,730
is furious.

440
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,030
I did not expect

441
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,950
she's an infatuated person.

442
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,990
This crazy woman refused to donate food

443
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,140
and even hit me.

444
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,320
I said

445
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,230
I'd let her pay the price.

446
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,580
Your Highness.

447
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,720
How are you going to deal with her?

448
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,650
Since this couple

449
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,710
is so affectionate,

450
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,330
I'll fulfill her wish.

451
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,890
I won't let Jing feel lonely

452
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,990
on the road to the underworld.

453
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,620
I killed Jing.

454
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,850
- Jing.
- Your Majesty.

455
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,230
Prince Lu is here to greet you.

456
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,600
Father.

457
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,860
I'm here to greet you.

458
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,040
All the people in the world

459
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,100
are still relying on you.

460
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,310
If you keep being like this,

461
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,240
Jing will not

462
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,310
rest in peace.

463
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,040
We should hold his funeral as soon as possible.

464
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,520
- If we delay it any further,
- Jing.

465
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,100
I'm afraid

466
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,660
he won't feel at peace.

467
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,600
Okay.

468
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,480
You arrange it.

469
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,310
Her Highness and Jing are very much in love.

470
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,520
I'm afraid

471
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,180
Jing would want to see Changsheng the most.

472
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,040
Go.

473
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,420
Go ahead.

474
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,340
Jing.

475
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,790
They all say His Highness is gone.

476
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,620
But I believe

477
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,420
he's fine.

478
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,660
He will come back.

479
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,820
You also believe he will come back, right?

480
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,660
We need to give him some time.

481
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,790
We have to believe in ourselves.

482
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,600
Right?

483
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,260
(Library)

484
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,310
How's Changsheng?

485
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,900
Yesterday I went to her place

486
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,820
and wanted to comfort her.

487
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,370
But Jinyan asked me to leave.

488
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,710
They've been through so much.

489
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,180
They were about to live happily together.

490
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,180
Why did this happen?

491
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,270
Now the wedding is coming soon.

492
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,790
It's such a pity.

493
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,140
What should we do?

494
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,550
By the way, according to
the rules of Great Tang,

495
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,550
how would an unmarried woman

496
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,990
like her live?

497
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,820
The worst case scenario
is being sent back to Fuyu.

498
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,070
Princess Royal.

499
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,850
Princess Royal, bad news.

500
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,650
- Take your time.
- I can't.

501
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,520
Prince Lu requested

502
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,860
to make Her Highness sacrifice herself.

503
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,860
His Majesty has agreed.

504
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,370
At this moment, Prince Lu should have gone
to Prince Qin's Mansion

505
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,320
with the imperial decree.

506
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,340
- What?
- What?

507
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,560
Go get the carriage ready.

508
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,890
I'm going to Prince Qin's Mansion.

509
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,330
No, I'm going to see His Majesty.

510
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,820
You go to Prince Qin's Mansion.

511
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,130
I'll buy some time. You hurry up.

512
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,970
Okay.

513
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,320
Your Highness.

514
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,860
Why haven't you

515
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,470
decorated the mourning hall?

516
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,990
Don't you want Jing to rest in peace?

517
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,310
Prince Lu.

518
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,900
You forgot how I hit you?

519
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,580
Do you want to get beaten again?

520
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,950
This time I brought the imperial decree.

521
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,730
Presumably

522
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,180
you won't accept it either.

523
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,170
Liu Changsheng.

524
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,040
You've been in Great Tang for less than a year

525
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,480
and already disobeyed the order three times.

526
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,270
That's a first in history.

527
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,600
Whatever.

528
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,790
I will take your life

529
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,310
in a lofty way.

530
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,560
What did you say?

531
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,140
Come on. Pick one.

532
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,280
Her Highness married into Great Tang

533
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,170
and has a respected status.

534
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,010
She represents Fuyu.

535
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,610
How can she make the sacrifice easily?

536
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,950
If you won't pick one,

537
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,710
then I'll do it for you.

538
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,560
That's it.

539
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,840
Stop.

540
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:19,930
Don't move.

541
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,650
Let go.

542
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,480
Princess Consort, you go first.

543
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,790
Leave it to us.

544
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,470
I'm not going anywhere.

545
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,900
I'll wait for him here.

546
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,240
Changsheng, go!

547
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,510
Don't hesitate, go now!

548
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,100
Liu Changsheng.

549
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,950
You better give in.

550
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,720
This mansion has been

551
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,580
surrounded by me.

552
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,660
Could it be

553
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,580
that you want them to die with you?

554
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,580
(Imperial Study)
Brother.

555
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,480
Changsheng is the Princess of Fuyu.

556
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,610
How can we make her die

557
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,550
as we wish?

558
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,570
(Upholding Morality)
Besides, there is no such precedent

559
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,570
in Great Tang.

560
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,330
She refused to donate food for disaster relief

561
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,750
and let Jing die without peace.

562
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,040
Do you know what people

563
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,420
say about her?

564
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,410
After Changsheng came to Great Tang,

565
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,930
she helped us plant Muyan trees

566
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,030
to develop the salt industry

567
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,720
and compiled many books in Xiuwen Hall.

568
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,370
She has made so many contributions.

569
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,620
How could she be a human sacrifice?

570
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,030
I've made up my mind.

571
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,960
Since childhood,

572
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,750
I never asked you for anything.

573
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,930
This time,

574
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,380
I beg you to take back your order.

575
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,410
You were all fooled

576
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,650
by her sweet talk.

577
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,810
- Brother.
- Drag Princess Royal out.

578
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,200
Yes. Princess Royal.

579
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,960
- Brother.
- Princess Royal.

580
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,900
- Brother.
- Let's go.

581
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,450
- If Jing was still alive,
- Let's go, Princess Royal.

582
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,520
- he wouldn't want to see this.
- Let's go.

583
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,660
Brother.

584
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,070
It seems that you

585
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,900
are determined to make everyone

586
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,900
in the mansion die with you.

587
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,620
Don't you dare.

588
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,620
Protecting Her Highness.

589
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,950
Live or die with Prince Qin's Mansion.

590
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,090
In this case,

591
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,470
kill them all.

592
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,770
Yes.

593
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,410
Stop.

594
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,100
I told you to stop.

595
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,930
Don't move.

596
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,280
Behave yourself.

597
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,310
Do you think I'm afraid of death?

598
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,570
I'm just afraid that
I won't be able to wait for Yi'an.

599
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,470
Rest assured, His Highness

600
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,130
won't come back.

601
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,030
He will.

602
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,620
But...

603
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,030
Listen carefully.

604
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,620
Today I, Liu Changsheng, voluntarily go to die.

605
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,230
You cannot follow me.

606
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,720
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

607
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,760
Your Highness.

608
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,660
Changsheng.

609
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,440
- Youyong, Youmou.
- Yes.

610
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,510
Take good care of Jinyan and Shenxing.

611
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,470
Take them down.

612
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,070
- Yes.
- Your Highness.

613
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,570
Your Highness.

614
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,030
Your Highness.

615
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,100
Your Highness.

616
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,710
Your Highness.

617
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,710
Your Highness.

618
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,820
Liu Changsheng.

619
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,660
Time for you to die.

620
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,170
Your Highness.

621
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,240
Your Highness.

622
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,370
Changsheng.

623
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,550
- No, Your Highness!
- No, Your Highness!

624
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,580
Your Highness.

625
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,600
- Changsheng.
- Your Highness.

626
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,710
Your Highness.

627
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,000
- Your Highness.
- Let me go.

628
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,840
Your Highness.

629
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,810
Don't move.

630
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:43,650
I said...

631
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,440
- Your Highness.
- Changsheng.

632
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,960
I would make you pay.

633
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,180
No, Changsheng.

634
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,620
Let me go!

635
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,230
Changsheng!

636
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,560
Changsheng!

637
