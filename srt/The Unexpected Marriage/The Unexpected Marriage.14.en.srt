00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,660
=Episode 14=

3
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,170
Youmou.

4
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,070
His Highness is too cautious.

5
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,940
Yu has been clearly annihilated.

6
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,290
Even if there are some remnants left,

7
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,450
it's nothing to be afraid of.

8
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,780
Why do we need to patrol?

9
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,780
Look at your pouting mouth.

10
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,540
It can even lift a bottle.

11
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,490
Today I have an appointment with Jinyan

12
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,330
to take her to see people making clay figures.

13
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,770
Who made an appointment with you?

14
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,360
Isn't that your own wishful thinking?

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,330
Did she agree?

16
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,590
She didn't refuse.

17
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,450
Careful.

18
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,500
Who sent you here?

19
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,420
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

20
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,730
No survivors.

21
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,430
There's poison behind their teeth.

22
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,080
Those captured people

23
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
all committed suicide.

24
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,870
Judging from the pattern on the cuffs,

25
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,870
they seem to be descendants of Yu.

26
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
Indeed.

27
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,330
Has there been any movement

28
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,540
at the Second Prince

29
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,540
and the Fifth Prince's mansion?

30
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,240
The Second Prince

31
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,310
added some guards in his mansion.

32
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,310
There's been no change.

33
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,730
The Fifth Prince's mansion

34
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,070
is the same like every other day.

35
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,400
But I recently heard

36
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,540
that several martial arts masters
sneaked into the city.

37
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,080
The detective has not yet found out

38
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,980
who's behind them.

39
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,310
Could it be that they're targeting Prince Qin?

40
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,400
His Highness is about
to marry Princess Changsheng.

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,030
The Crown Prince still hasn't been decided.

42
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,760
Maybe they want to go all out.

43
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,610
Like a last-ditch attempt.

44
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,500
Who are they?

45
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,500
The Second Prince and the Fifth Prince
want to compete for the throne.

46
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,670
But if they have
a private relationship with Yu,

47
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,380
that's a capital crime.

48
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,490
Your Highness.

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,600
Youmou.

50
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,630
Investigate the background of these bandits

51
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,090
and the martial artists
who sneaked into the city a few days ago.

52
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,400
If there is any news,

53
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,490
report to me immediately.

54
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,570
Yes.

55
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
Youyong.

56
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,660
Increase the guards at Huadeng Pavilion.

57
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,900
Tell Changsheng not to leave the house
for the next few days.

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,870
Make sure to keep her safe.

59
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,820
There can't be any mistakes.

60
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,400
Yes.

61
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,770
Your Highness.

62
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,320
His Highness has ordered,
no one is allowed to leave the house

63
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,220
without a necessary reason.

64
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,460
Everyone including me?

65
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,610
Though you haven't gotten married yet,

66
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,580
it does include you.

67
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,870
What happened?

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,360
We are only executing the order.

69
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,230
We don't know anything else.

70
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,680
Do you have

71
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,560
some exceptions?

72
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,820
That requires His Highness's token.

73
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,500
What if I must leave the house
without the token?

74
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,930
We're ordered to guard this place.

75
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,590
- Please don't make things difficult for us.
- Okay, okay.

76
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,500
I'll go back to my room, okay?

77
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,770
Would you like to eat some fruit?

78
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,820
No appetite.

79
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,240
How about we

80
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
play the shuttlecock?

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,020
My feet are sore.

82
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,810
Then

83
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,880
we can practice writing.

84
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,110
I'm sleepy.

85
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,200
Your Highness, don't be so listless.

86
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,110
You can get up and talk to us.

87
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,040
Your Highness, where are you going?

88
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm going to find Lv Jing.

89
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,790
I want to go out.

90
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,340
Your Highness.

91
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,580
Prince Qin

92
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,730
is your future husband.

93
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,050
Whatever happens,

94
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,500
you must control your temper.

95
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,730
Your Highness.

96
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,730
Be careful with your words.

97
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,750
Be careful with your actions.

98
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,940
It's been so many days.

99
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,970
Why are you following me so strictly?

100
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,580
It's like I'm running away from marriage.

101
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,260
I don't believe it.

102
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,880
The more you don't let me leave here,

103
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,070
the more I want to leave here.

104
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,670
Chase her. Your Highness.

105
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,340
(Pen and Ink)

106
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,630
It's so frustrating
not being able to leave the house.

107
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,490
Don't be frustrated, Your Highness.

108
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,760
Come down soon.

109
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,870
Don't fall.

110
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,970
I came up with great difficulty.

111
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,360
I won't go down simply because you ask me to.

112
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,530
It's not that easy.

113
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,490
Your Highness.

114
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,560
As long as His Highness wants,

115
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,800
even a fly can't fly out of here.

116
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,880
- Yes.
- You are the fly.

117
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,900
What kind of metaphor is that?

118
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,440
Spring is in full swing.

119
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,580
You can't lock me up.

120
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,410
Have you heard the poem?

121
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,190
As spring cannot be kept in a house yard,

122
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,410
a red apricot bloom...

123
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,310
Creeps over the wall.

124
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,090
Do you want to climb over the wall?

125
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,310
I don't.

126
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,520
We were wrong.

127
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,120
But please come down now.

128
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,140
If you get hurt,

129
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,630
His Highness will blame us.

130
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,720
I don't.

131
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,580
I want to bask in the sun here.

132
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,640
Careful.

133
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,810
Bask in the sun?

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,310
Next time you have this plan,

135
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,870
ask me to join you.

136
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,640
Never mind.

137
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,630
It seems that basking in the sun

138
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,110
is pretty dangerous.

139
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,460
I'm going back.

140
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,200
Your Highness.

141
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,280
I'm afraid

142
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,510
Her Highness

143
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,980
will still think about going out.

144
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,310
Should I send more people

145
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
to guard her?

146
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,370
For this kind of thing,

147
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,980
the more you don't let her do it,

148
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,940
the more she wants to do it.

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,030
- Then...
- It's better to divert the flood

150
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,700
rather than blocking it.

151
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,510
His Highness is knowledgeable.

152
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,560
Youmou.

153
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,280
Flood?

154
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,560
What does it mean?

155
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,940
Where is the flood?

156
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,070
Where is the flood?

157
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,820
I asked you to read more books.

158
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,190
"Strategies to Tame the Flood".

159
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,100
(Huadeng Pavilion)

160
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,320
Your Highness.

161
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,730
Your Highness.

162
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,740
Have you got the token?

163
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,930
Why is your face

164
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,980
so red?

165
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,890
Is it red?

166
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,520
Maybe

167
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,340
it's because I just ran back.

168
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,030
Exercise makes people hot.

169
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,600
Never mind. Never mind.

170
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,510
Look what this is.

171
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,740
His Highness didn't find it out?

172
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,100
Of course.

173
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,720
- So what if he's an old fox?
- A mouse.

174
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,440
While the priest climbs a post,
the devil climbs ten.

175
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,220
I stole the token after all.

176
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,840
It didn't take much effort to get it.

177
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,740
Your Highness, you got a fake token.

178
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,170
What fake token?

179
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,010
This...

180
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,780
(Pure Like Orchids)

181
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,190
Lv Jing.

182
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,430
You old fox.

183
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,650
The cylinder is too slippery.

184
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,550
Little mouse,

185
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,940
let's wait and see.

186
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,220
But why doesn't he let me leave the house?

187
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,720
Is it possible

188
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,770
that there are some

189
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,800
monsters

190
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,940
or ghosts outside?

191
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,580
What happened

192
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,270
to make him so cautious?

193
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,390
His Highness has always been thoughtful.

194
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,010
I guess he's doing this

195
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,860
for your safety.

196
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,220
If you really want to know,

197
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,820
just ask him directly.

198
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,160
Never mind.

199
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,580
I have a way without asking him.

200
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,370
Your Highness, go change your clothes.

201
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,850
Go.

202
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,940
Have another drink.

203
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,910
You can't refuse.

204
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,200
Your Highness, during our shift,

205
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,560
we can't drink alcohol.

206
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,430
What are you afraid of?

207
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,250
If His Highness blames you,

208
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,100
let him come to me.

209
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,560
His Highness

210
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,700
definitely won't blame you.

211
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,970
But

212
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,720
he will punish us.

213
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,560
Then,

214
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,250
if you can answer my question,

215
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,980
you can avoid drinking this wine.

216
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,720
What do you

217
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,860
want to know?

218
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,340
Recently, is there

219
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,700
something big going on out there?

220
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,250
Drink.

221
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,250
Drink.

222
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,250
Our mansion is strengthening guard

223
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,310
because of this matter?

224
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,340
They're coming for me?

225
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,390
Your Highness.

226
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,910
You have to ask His Highness yourself.

227
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,090
We are just following orders

228
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,190
to protect you.

229
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,880
His Highness

230
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,820
didn't let us reveal anything else.

231
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,030
Not reveal.

232
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,460
I want you to explain the details.

233
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,390
If you don't tell me,

234
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,430
you need to drink more.

235
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,610
Come on.

236
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,040
Come on.

237
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,360
If you still don't say,

238
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,960
I'll go tell His Highness

239
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,440
that you drank alcohol while on duty.

240
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,620
You will be punished too.

241
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,130
Your Highness.

242
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,770
You forced us to drink.

243
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,770
Yes.

244
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,070
I forced you to drink?

245
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,070
Who saw it?

246
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,740
I didn't.

247
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,130
Who can prove it?

248
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,310
No one can prove it.

249
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,440
You...

250
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,680
So Youyong and Youmou

251
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,080
drank alcohol while on duty,

252
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
and I caught them.

253
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,130
They even falsely accused me.

254
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,620
Shenxing, note it down.

255
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,760
Let's go find His Highness.

256
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,600
Okay.

257
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,520
Well...

258
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,310
Don't talk nonsense.

259
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,270
His Highness is afraid that
Her Highness will worry,

260
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,620
so he did not allow us to talk.

261
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,960
I didn't say anything.

262
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,150
Isn't it the assassination incident
some days ago?

263
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,070
Assassination?

264
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,980
Your Highness, what about them?

265
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,040
They will sober up.

266
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,250
What to do now?

267
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,200
Take a cold shower

268
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,270
to get rid of the smell of alcohol.

269
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,460
We still have to check for the assassin later.

270
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,680
Let's go.

271
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,680
Go.

272
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,820
(Equalling Men of Virtue)

273
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,540
In recent days,

274
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,990
the secret guards have checked the situation
in various places in the city.

275
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,230
The people involved in the assassination
have also been eliminated.

276
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,860
There is no accident in the city at present.

277
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,010
What about Her Highness?

278
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,230
Her Highness

279
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,740
have been quiet these days.

280
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,930
After asking us last time,

281
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,390
she doesn't want to leave the house now.

282
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,160
It's late.

283
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,640
Let's go see her tomorrow.

284
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:44,890
Okay.

285
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,980
Jinyan, I caught two more.

286
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,640
Look.

287
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,050
(Youlan Pavilion)
How long do we have to wait

288
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,580
to catch a hundred of them?

289
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,510
Since Her Highness was imprisoned here,

290
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,940
our days are getting harder and harder.

291
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,700
We caught cicadas the day before yesterday,

292
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,440
counted the stars last night,

293
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,430
and today we're building an Ant House.

294
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,050
Her Highness's imagination

295
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,910
is getting richer.

296
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,720
I'm already very satisfied

297
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,150
with quietly catching a few ants.

298
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,860
The day is long.

299
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,700
We need to have something to do, right?

300
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,150
Her Highness said

301
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,940
we have to stay in the mansion

302
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,700
and learn to entertain ourselves.

303
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,610
Jinyan.

304
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,220
Did you catch the ants?

305
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,280
Here they are.

306
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,150
You guys, be good.

307
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,430
I'll also be good.

308
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,370
If I can't help,

309
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,270
I won't make more trouble.

310
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,970
Your Highness.

311
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,910
Why are you talking to the ants?

312
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,890
Are you confused now?

313
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,740
She's communicating with the ants.

314
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,200
Everything has a soul.

315
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,980
It's always good to interact with them.

316
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,330
By the way, His Highness got a canary

317
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,310
to amuse you.

318
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,600
That canary is so pretty.

319
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,550
Canary?

320
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,480
There is a duck in this mansion

321
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,430
and also a canary.

322
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,550
It's almost become a poultry house.

323
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,370
What?

324
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,620
You don't like a poultry house?

325
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,700
I didn't let you leave the house before

326
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,940
because there were some bandits outside.

327
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,860
I was worried they'd harm you.

328
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,510
Now the bandits have been wiped out.

329
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,560
It's safe outside.

330
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,270
I'll go out with you.

331
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,220
Really?

332
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,410
In recent days,

333
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,980
Great Tang is holding the market of the month.

334
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,570
The main street is full of small vendors

335
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,510
shouting and selling things.

336
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,940
If you go,

337
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,820
you can eat all the delicious food
in Great Tang.

338
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,280
Do you want to go for a walk?

339
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,980
Since you are sincere,

340
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,670
I can't refuse you.

341
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,040
Let's go.

342
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:58,890
Look at this.

343
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,790
Look at that.

344
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,250
And this.

345
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,860
It feels good to be outside.

346
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,150
What did you promise me just now?

347
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,200
First, follow Prince Qin closely.

348
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,410
Can't act alone.

349
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,050
Second, keep a low profile.

350
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,100
Can't reveal my identity.

351
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,150
Third, be careful.

352
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,580
Can't be reckless or impulsive.

353
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,770
Good.

354
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,550
What is the most important one?

355
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,980
Follow you closely.

356
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,800
Jinyan, Shenxing.

357
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,830
You guys should walk around too.

358
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,670
- Yes, Young Lady.
- Let's go.

359
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,720
Miss, look at the jewelry.

360
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,100
I have the most fashionable jewelry now.

361
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,650
Miss, you have good taste.

362
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,290
Stop, do you want to say

363
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,980
this earring is the treasure of your store,

364
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,130
the materials used are of the highest quality,

365
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,520
and the style is also the most fashionable?

366
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,050
With my beautiful face

367
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,130
and elegant figure,

368
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,430
it'll look stunning?

369
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,340
Could it be that you're a businesswoman?

370
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,860
Can you make it cheaper?

371
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,560
I give you the lowest price.

372
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,400
I'll take it.

373
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,160
Does it look good?

374
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,090
Yes.

375
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,970
Wrap it up.

376
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:58,970
Okay.

377
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,390
And this one, and this.

378
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,330
- Okay.
- Wrap them all up.

379
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,370
Someone will come to pick them up.

380
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,210
OK, sir.

381
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,710
Take care.

382
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,760
Miss.

383
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,990
Check out our new fabrics.

384
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,410
All over here.

385
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,410
It feels smooth

386
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,250
and the colors are bright.

387
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,380
This green one is so pretty.

388
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,790
- It's all new.
- Ma'am.

389
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,010
Coming.

390
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,230
You two take your time.

391
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,440
Look at this silk.

392
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,900
It's much thinner than Fuyu's.

393
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,040
Touch it.

394
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,080
Let me touch it.

395
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,470
This one is better.

396
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,140
Alright.

397
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,900
I want it.

398
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,990
I'll make you a hat later.

399
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,760
Miss, you have good taste.

400
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,820
Is it beautiful?

401
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,480
Which one do you like?

402
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,520
This one.

403
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,850
- OK.
- Wrap it up for me.

404
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,690
Okay.

405
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,520
(Where's Changsheng?)

406
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,080
Young Lady, how come you run so fast?

407
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,850
We almost couldn't catch up with you.

408
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,660
I'm too happy today.

409
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,410
- What do you think?
- Nice.

410
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,250
You're here.

411
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,210
Today we bought jewelry, fabric,

412
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,310
and so many other things.

413
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,880
Isn't

414
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,180
this mask cute?

415
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,140
Smile.

416
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,180
Look at your expression.

417
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,470
It's just like this mask.

418
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,140
What did you promise me?

419
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,280
Didn't we agree to...

420
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,240
Follow you closely

421
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,310
and don't leave you.

422
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,180
You only know how to talk.

423
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,650
I am overwhelmed by the power

424
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,750
of Great Tang.

425
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,620
Look at that silk.

426
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,370
It feels thin and soft,

427
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,090
and the texture is thick and shiny.

428
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,000
The embroidery on it

429
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,890
is so exquisite.

430
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,170
And the jewelry here.

431
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,200
The style is trendy,

432
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,420
and the materials are also different.

433
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,680
This sweetmeat

434
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,070
tastes delicious too.

435
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,950
Although Fuyu is also rich in products,

436
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,200
after all, it's mainly in the salt business

437
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,570
and lacks life sentiment.

438
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,410
If

439
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,200
we can teach these handicraft skills to Fuyu,

440
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,900
I think it will be more prosperous.

441
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,770
What's wrong?

442
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,620
I'm going to marry into the Great Tang soon.

443
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,230
But I am also a princess of Fuyu.

444
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,950
I always think about

445
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,100
what I can do for our people.

446
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,920
I will try to find a way

447
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,810
to establish trade relations
between Fuyu and Great Tang.

448
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,820
You can see these things in Fuyu in the future.

449
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,560
Thank you.

450
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,470
They're selling sugarcoated haws.

451
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,030
Let's go buy some.

452
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,120
Okay.

453
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,380
Take your things and wait in the carriage.

454
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,450
- We'll meet up in a bit.
- Yes.

455
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,280
Okay.

456
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,080
Let's go.

457
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,960
Please take it.

458
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,800
Thanks.

459
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,900
Come again.

460
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,030
Sugarcoated haws.

461
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,140
Delicious sugarcoated haws.

462
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:23,930
Not yet satisfied?

463
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,790
I am satisfied.

464
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,380
Just feeling a little reluctant.

465
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,620
Wait until life becomes peaceful,

466
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,820
I'll come with you often.

467
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,250
Follow me.

468
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,840
Buy some.

469
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,990
So beautiful.

470
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,420
Previously in Fuyu,

471
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,090
we often heard

472
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,370
how prosperous Great Tang is.

473
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,230
After today's visit,

474
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,280
it surely lives up to its name.

475
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:07,950
I'm thinking

476
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,900
for the people to live and work in peace,

477
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,580
the country needs to be stable

478
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,180
and the world peaceful.

479
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,950
We were born in the royal family.

480
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,420
So we should think what the people think,

481
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,230
and worry what the people worry.

482
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,270
If the people in Great Tang and Fuyu

483
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,650
can avoid the suffering from war in the future,

484
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,790
the prosperous times now

485
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,730
can be passed down for thousands of years.

486
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,860
Why did you suddenly think of this?

487
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,950
Fuyu's market is also very lively.

488
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,370
Nowadays,

489
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,620
on the streets of Great Tang,

490
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,410
watching the busy traffic,

491
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,570
the hustle and bustle of crowds,

492
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,420
I just feel

493
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,650
indescribably

494
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,900
moved.

495
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,450
Just like

496
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,820
people in the world

497
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,380
should live happily and peacefully like this.

498
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,990
Of course, all this

499
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,280
still depends on Great Tang

500
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,070
protecting the people on this land.

501
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,380
Being in the right position,

502
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,230
we must seek happiness for the people.

503
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,270
This has always been my motto.

504
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,310
The people of Great Tang are my responsibility.

505
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,750
Now Fuyu is too.

506
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,130
I will spare no effort

507
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,580
to provide a better life for all.

508
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,620
You did a great job.

509
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,340
Taste this as a reward.

510
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,950
It's really sweet.

511
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,860
It fell.

512
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,380
I'll buy a new one.

513
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:50,970
Young Lady.

514
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,100
Where are you going?

515
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,330
Wait for me.

516
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,790
I'm accompanying her to buy sugarcoated haws.

517
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,180
Your Highness, do you need me to go with you?

518
00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,730
No need.

519
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,620
Get out of the way!

520
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,860
The horse was frightened.

521
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,120
Step aside!

522
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,600
Are you okay?

523
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,250
Careful.

524
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,650
How can they do this in the street?

525
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,490
That's right.

526
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,520
- Are you OK?
- Young Lady.

527
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,360
- I'm fine.
- Your Highness.

528
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,510
Are you OK?

529
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,140
You're bleeding.

530
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,320
It's fine.

531
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,140
Let's go back home.

532
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,940
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

533
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,140
Have the assassins in the market been found?

534
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,660
After the carriage was hit,

535
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,680
the bodyguards came over

536
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,240
worrying about your and Her Highness's safety.

537
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,470
Then these assassins
blended into the crowd and escaped.

538
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
But...

539
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,450
But what?

540
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,810
But we examined the body of the dead assassin.

541
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,170
The pattern on his cuffs

542
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,750
is the same as those assassins' from last time.

543
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,650
And on his back,

544
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,030
we found a special totem.

545
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:01,990
It's a scar.

546
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,120
This scar

547
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,100
was caused by a knife cut later.

548
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,310
After careful examination, we found

549
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,930
the scar is to cover up the slave imprint

550
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,340
peculiar to the royal family.

551
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,680
Same as you guessed before,

552
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,090
it should be done by someone from the palace.

553
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,610
Although the back has been scratched,

554
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,950
we can vaguely recognize

555
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,210
this pattern

556
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,660
is the totem of the Second Prince.

557
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,040
Lv Hou.

558
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,580
Keep investigating.

559
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,420
You mean...

560
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,510
Don't be misled by this obvious evidence.

561
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,660
Don't miss any clues.

562
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,790
Send some more people

563
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,760
to make sure Her Highness's safety.

564
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,600
Yes.

565
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,200
Your Highness, let's apply the medicine.

566
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,040
You guys can leave.

567
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,180
It's a minor injury, not serious.

568
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,860
You took me out of the mansion.

569
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,070
I guess you had confirmed it was safe.

570
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,270
But we encountered an assassination again.

571
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,810
I'm afraid the last assassination

572
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,030
was to test your strength.

573
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,810
Today is the key.

574
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,180
While the streets are crowded,

575
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,900
they disguised as civilians

576
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,510
and assassinated you.

577
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,340
I didn't think carefully.

578
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,200
I just came to Great Tang

579
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,340
and don't know your situation.

580
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,820
I even clamored to go out,

581
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,580
caused you trouble,

582
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,660
and hurt you.

583
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,560
Sorry.

584
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,900
Why bother saying this?

585
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,860
Training a desperado

586
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,550
takes three to five years.

587
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,180
These people were well prepared.

588
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,660
It's only a matter of time
before they take action.

589
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,750
You don't have to take it to heart.

590
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,140
But you still got hurt.

591
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,880
Don't worry.

592
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,140
I will adapt to the situation here
as soon as possible.

593
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,450
So

594
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,180
no matter what happens to you,

595
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,860
you can tell me.

596
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,510
You don't need to be

597
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,990
extremely cautious for me.

598
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,030
I don't want it

599
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,340
that you'll always stand in front of me.

600
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,340
You are good enough.

601
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,550
Not enough.

602
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,710
You want me to trust you.

603
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,790
I hope you can trust me too.

604
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,140
We will be each other's

605
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,420
most powerful ally.

606
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,820
Have you heard that Prince Qin got injured?

607
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,130
What?

608
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,410
The invincible Prince Qin

609
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,760
was injured in Luojing?

610
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,890
That's right.

611
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,030
This is a hot topic among the public recently.

612
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,280
I heard that Prince Qin was injured

613
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,170
because of the future Princess Consort Qin.

614
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,090
They're at odds?

615
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:32,930
No.

616
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,800
It is said that the Princess of Fuyu

617
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,850
is a witch.

618
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,000
All the men who admire her
will have a bad ending.

619
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,410
That's why Prince Qin was injured.

620
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,240
This matter has long been known
to everyone in Fuyu.

621
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,650
Only Prince Qin is still kept in the dark.

622
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,610
This sounds a bit unbelievable.

623
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,860
Right.

624
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,810
Let's continue from last time.

625
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,370
Last time we said

626
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,070
the lone star

627
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,340
happened to fall

628
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,710
into a family in Fuyu.

629
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,370
This family

630
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,340
is not an ordinary family.

631
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,550
It's a prince of Fuyu.

632
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,510
And this child

633
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,470
became Fuyu's princess.

634
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,340
Because the lone star

635
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,470
lives in the princess's body,

636
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,770
so

637
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,040
since the birth of this child,

638
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,760
there has been no peace in the whole mansion.

639
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,420
Who are you talking about?

640
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,310
- I'm going to destroy your tavern.
- You...

641
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,100
(Huadeng Pavilion)

642
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,170
Your Highness.

643
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,270
What happened?

644
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,090
Who is so bold

645
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,100
as to bully my maids?

646
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,490
Wait and see.

647
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,130
No one bullied us.

648
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,280
Someone bullied you.

649
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,520
We didn't fight.

650
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,820
We went to smash up the tavern.

651
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,930
So you guys bullied others.

652
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,000
I just thought

653
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,030
my maids wouldn't get bullied.

654
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,570
Your Highness.

655
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,930
Is this the point?

656
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,470
The point is that someone bullied you.

657
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,280
Tell me.

658
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,790
What on earth happened?

659
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,900
They spread rumors

660
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,180
that you are the reincarnation of a lone star.

661
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,890
You'll affect the fortune of Great Tang.

662
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,140
(The rumor has spread to Great Tang.)

663
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,750
(It seems someone did it on purpose.)

664
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,860
I see.

665
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,830
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

666
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,280
The horse got crazy?

667
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,120
Father.

668
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,490
Actually,

669
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,070
everyone knows it now.

670
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,100
Although I don't quite believe it,

671
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,440
the recent events

672
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,480
are worrying indeed.

673
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,610
Lv Jing's carriage

674
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,330
was rolling along the road.

675
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,470
How could the mad horse

676
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,100
bump into it?

677
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,900
Fortunately, nothing happened.

678
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,180
But the strangest thing is

679
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,370
why did the horse suddenly go crazy?

680
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,270
Right.

681
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:59,170
Why did the horse suddenly go crazy?

682
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,570
Yes, Father.

683
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,240
This is the crux of the matter.

684
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,410
The merchants have said

685
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,510
this horse is usually very docile.

686
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
It never lost its temper.

687
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,690
But how come it suddenly went crazy

688
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,030
after seeing Lv Jing's carriage?

689
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,510
This situation

690
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,550
only has one explanation.

691
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,180
That is...

692
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,860
What is that?

693
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,860
The rumor is true.

694
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,210
The Princess of Fuyu

695
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,580
is really the reincarnation of the lone star.

696
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,490
Son.

697
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,950
You need to be responsible

698
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,990
with what you say.

699
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,100
I said the wrong thing again.

700
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,210
Father.

701
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,410
I spoke without thing

702
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,420
because I cared too much.

703
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,680
What if it's true?

704
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,520
Father.

705
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,760
Great Tang's fortune

706
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,270
allows no slip-ups.

707
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,040
Fine.

708
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,650
Someone,

709
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,180
summon

710
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,710
Princess Changsheng.

711
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,140
His Majesty wants to see me.

712
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,510
Why does he suddenly want to see you?

713
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,790
I'm afraid the rumors about me recently

714
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,000
were spread by someone on purpose.

715
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,090
What to do then?

716
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,680
If it is true as you said,

717
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,610
you can't go to the palace.

718
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,930
If I don't go, it means
I have a guilty conscience.

719
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,380
Once you go, you might not come back.

720
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,750
This happened because of me.

721
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,080
His Highness is busy.

722
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,070
Don't tell him yet.

723
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,510
Your Highness.

724
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,170
Don't worry.

725
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,510
I'll try to solve it.

726
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,520
I heard

727
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,090
Fuyu

728
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,580
is good at growing flowers and plants.

729
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,280
Changsheng.

730
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,790
Look at how my flowers are growing.

731
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,550
It's not appropriate to plant

732
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,600
lilac and daffodil together.

733
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Why is that?

734
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,820
Different flowers have different habits.

735
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,040
Lilac likes plenty of sunshine

736
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,090
and has strong shade-resistance.

737
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,610
Daffodil

738
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,960
prefers warm and humid climates.

739
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,520
And it needs sufficient rainfall.

740
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,410
Two seemingly unrelated plants

741
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,720
will hurt each other when planted together.

742
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,340
Everything in the world is interdependent.

743
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,790
This is natural law.

744
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,660
If the two plants are grown separately,

745
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,140
I guess it will be better.

746
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,580
Even nature has laws.

747
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,100
What about human beings?

748
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,370
Your Majesty.

749
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,400
I have something to confess.

750
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,270
Go ahead.

751
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,900
When I was in Fuyu,

752
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,270
it was once rumored that I was a lone star.

753
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,030
Therefore, in Fuyu,

754
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,370
no men

755
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,370
wanted to marry me.

756
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,270
So you mean

757
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,030
the peace-making marriage

758
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,040
is not what you want?

759
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,030
Quite the contrary.

760
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,230
The marriage was initiated by me.

761
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,000
Although I don't care about the rumor,

762
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,520
since I'm married to Great Tang,

763
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,410
naturally, I don't want these unfounded rumors

764
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,660
to affect Prince Jing.

765
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,230
Get up.

766
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,180
Today we're appreciating the flowers.

767
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,030
Why did you talk about this?

768
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,810
Your Majesty.

769
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,470
The envoy from An
presented a letter of credence.

770
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,550
Please read it, Your Majesty.

771
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:11,760
This...

772
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,340
An is becoming bolder.

773
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,370
They wrote the letter

774
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,510
in their own native language.

775
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:19,930
Who can understand

776
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,820
this letter?

777
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,010
Wan.

778
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,820
Take a look for me.

779
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,820
I could read An's language.

780
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,340
It's just this letter...

781
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,850
I heard that An recently
made changes to their language.

782
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,000
I can't fully

783
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,660
understand this letter.

784
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,790
Then leave it to the Ministry of Rites.

785
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,080
Your Majesty.

786
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,470
Could I

787
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,990
have a look?

788
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,210
You?

789
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,850
Even my aunt can't read it.

790
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,240
Can you understand it?

791
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,230
You'd better not make a fool of yourself.

792
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,610
You have to

793
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,230
let me read it first

794
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,750
to know whether I'll make a fool of myself.

795
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,180
Please, Your Majesty.

796
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,420
Then take a look.

797
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,400
Your Majesty.

798
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,890
In this letter,

799
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,300
the intention is to pay respects to you.

800
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,770
It's mentioned that
at the border between the two countries,

801
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,520
there have been bandits
causing chaos occasionally.

802
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,930
But An has sent troops to quell it.

803
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,070
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

804
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,000
At the end of the letter,

805
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,300
they used very respectful words.

806
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,830
They mentioned Your Majesty

807
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,640
is quite busy,

808
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,140
and asked you to take care of your health.

809
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,250
You...

810
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,870
How can you

811
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,140
understand this letter?

812
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,660
Yeah, I'm curious too.

813
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,370
You can even

814
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,040
recognize

815
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,370
such complicated

816
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,220
honorifics.

817
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,360
Your Majesty.

818
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,410
I've always liked

819
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,910
to study the language of different countries.

820
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,640
Among them, the written and spoken language

821
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,370
of An are not the same,

822
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,580
so there are frequent changes.

823
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,040
Out of curiosity,

824
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,780
I paid special attention to An's language.

825
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,140
I showed myself up
in front of Princess Royal and Your Majesty.

826
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,830
You're too modest.

827
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,960
Wan.

828
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,140
In this regard,

829
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,040
you've met your match.

830
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,220
You're right, Brother.

831
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,520
Being proficient in languages,

832
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,160
the Princess of Fuyu

833
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,780
does have some skills.

834
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,830
I'm flattered.

835
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,950
It's been a tiring trip.

836
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,350
Especially Princess Changsheng.

837
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,550
With all the explanations,

838
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,120
you must be thirsty.

839
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,960
Hou.

840
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,910
Why don't you pour a glass of water for her?

841
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,100
Yes, Father.

842
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,580
Father, please.

843
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,030
Thank you.

844
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,690
Changsheng.

845
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,160
Just now,

846
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,580
you weren't even afraid of me.

847
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,580
Why do you look scared

848
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,300
of our Second Prince?

849
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,650
Your Majesty.

850
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,350
I'd better

851
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,510
not tell you the reason.

852
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,430
Since you said that,

853
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,430
I must know the reason.

854
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,180
I don't mean this.

855
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,100
I'm just afraid that saying this

856
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,220
will drive a wedge between you two.

857
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,470
Then I'll become a sinner.

858
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,530
You won't.

859
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,870
I won't punish you.
