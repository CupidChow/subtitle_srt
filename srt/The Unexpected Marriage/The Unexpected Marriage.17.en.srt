=Episode 17=

3
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,210
(Imperial Study)

4
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,290
The Buddhist scriptures
sent by Dazhi Zen Temple

5
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,820
have been all sorted out
and compiled by Xiuwen Hall.

6
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,730
We've made a copy

7
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,100
and sent it to the Library.

8
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,770
This matter

9
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,980
will bring boundless beneficence.

10
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,840
If you've finished compiling them,

11
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,380
give them back to the temple.

12
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,840
Although Dazhi Zen Temple

13
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,280
is a small temple

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,500
in the suburbs,

15
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,010
their Buddhist attainments

16
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,380
are great.

17
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,190
And

18
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,880
I heard it's effective

19
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,260
to seek a marriage there.

20
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,560
You can go and pay respects.

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,030
After all, marriage

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,780
is a matter of fate.

23
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,380
Yes.

24
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,590
Yi'an.

25
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,910
Don't take advantage of me.

26
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,870
Your Highness, wake up.

27
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,880
Your Highness, wake up.

28
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,820
Time to wake up.

29
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,570
Your Highness.

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
Today you have to go with Princess Royal
to deliver Buddhist scriptures.

31
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,540
It's going to be late.

32
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,290
Buddhist scriptures?

33
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,130
Yes.

34
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,910
We still have to hurry to Dazhi Zen Temple.

35
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,470
It's in the suburbs.

36
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,960
I don't know if we can make it back today.

37
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,290
That's great.

38
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,700
I don't need to see him for now.

39
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,500
Who?

40
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,870
Nothing.

41
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,980
Change my clothes quickly.

42
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,890
Changsheng.

43
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,590
Where are you going?

44
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,840
Here.

45
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,310
I almost walked by.

46
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,500
Princess Royal.

47
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,050
What a coincidence.

48
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,050
- You're here too.
- Yes.

49
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,090
Having Princess Royal is enough

50
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,310
to deliver the Buddhist scriptures.

51
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,110
You are busy with official duties.

52
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,970
You don't need to go.

53
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,940
How do you know
I'm going to deliver the Buddhist scriptures?

54
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,050
Otherwise?

55
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,790
The marriage tree
at Dazhi Zen Temple is efficacious.

56
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,790
I made a wish there before.

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,190
It worked yesterday.

58
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,936
I have to go there to show my gratitude.

59
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,140
It's really so efficacious?

60
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,400
Sure.

61
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,050
The time has come.

62
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,900
Let's go.

63
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,140
I'll share a carriage with Princess Royal.

64
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,990
What are you doing?

65
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,970
Princess Royal has been
in poor health recently.

66
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,140
Mr. Xiao has medical skills.

67
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,970
It's a long way round.

68
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,430
I hope Mr. Xiao will take good care of her.

69
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,490
Your Highness.

70
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,960
Let's go.

71
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,990
How long have you been coughing?

72
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,900
It's okay, I'm used to it.

73
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,190
Let me check your pulse.

74
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,490
No need.

75
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,490
Heavy dew and cold wind

76
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,670
are most likely to cause cough.

77
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,850
I'll write prescriptions for expelling cold

78
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,690
and give them to Lingzhi.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,790
Please remember to take it.

80
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,500
Great Tang has doctors.

81
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,430
I won't bother you, Mr. Xiao.

82
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,850
You seem to be avoiding me.

83
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,900
How come?

84
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,460
Prince Qin

85
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,690
accompanies us to Dazhi Zen Temple

86
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,610
despite the hardship of the journey.

87
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,700
You're my role model.

88
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,230
Then why do you sit so far away from me?

89
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,650
You have long arms and legs.

90
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,170
I'm making room

91
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,230
for you.

92
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,700
You're considerate of me today.

93
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,330
Not at all.

94
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,500
I've always been like this.

95
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,080
Changsheng.

96
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,020
Why is your face so red?

97
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,750
Really.

98
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,200
When I think about seeing

99
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,340
the legendary Dazhi Zen Temple,

100
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,550
I get excited.

101
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,850
Princess Royal

102
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,990
is delivering

103
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,230
the Buddhist scriptures in person.

104
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,750
I appreciate it.

105
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,750
Relying on Buddha's grace,

106
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,970
our temple

107
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,870
has been renovated lately.

108
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,910
If you have free time,

109
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,430
you can go and have a look.

110
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,290
Then

111
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,670
I'll have to trouble you.

112
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,640
Please.

113
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,860
In the backyard of our temple,

114
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,840
there is a marriage tree

115
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,070
which is quite efficacious.

116
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,340
Since you are here,

117
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,430
it's better to worship it.

118
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,760
Marriage

119
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,940
has its own cause and effect.

120
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,940
I am still thinking about the unfinished game.

121
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,800
I wonder if anyone has solved it.

122
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,290
I'm still preparing for the prize.

123
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,460
Princess Royal,

124
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,270
no one has yet solved the chess game.

125
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,530
It's been left there for a hundred years

126
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,960
and hasn't met the right person.

127
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,460
After all, it is a century-old game.

128
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,440
Did you hear that?

129
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,580
There is a century-old chess game
in this temple.

130
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,200
What is this reaction?

131
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,910
It's a century-old unresolved game.

132
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,050
I'll take you to solve the puzzle.

133
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,100
Go by yourself.

134
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,620
I'm sleepy.

135
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,270
I didn't sleep well last night.

136
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,100
I need to find a place to rest for a while.

137
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,680
Master.

138
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,080
Where is the guest room?

139
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,150
I want to take a break.

140
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
Let's go.

141
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,610
Master.

142
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,340
Please tell me where the puzzle is.

143
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,620
Please follow me, sir.

144
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,140
(Namo Amitabha)

145
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,510
A kite.

146
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,340
(Weituo Hall)

147
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,430
Changsheng, you took the rest?

148
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,010
This kite is so beautiful.

149
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,130
Where did you get it from?

150
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,340
When I was young,
I often stayed here with my aunt.

151
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,190
This is a good location.

152
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,910
The wind is good this season too.

153
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,820
It's perfect for kite flying.

154
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,130
Try it.

155
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,770
Hold it like this.

156
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,770
Yes.

157
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,070
Hold the kite string.

158
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,640
Like this.

159
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,590

Right.

163
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,310

Princess Royal.

173
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,910
Greetings.

174
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,840
Are you going to solve this puzzle?

175
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,680
I think so.

176
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,010
After placing the black piece here,

177
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,700
it seems that the chess game has been solved,

178
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,390
but it'll result in a lot of crises.

179
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,400
Look.

180
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,790
The white piece is determined
to avoid entanglement.

181
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,620
But you're pressing on.

182
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,560
In the end,

183
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,580
you'll trap yourself in the game.

184
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,910
You've memorized this chess game.

185
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,610
I'm impressed.

186
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,910
You and I are both people with obsessions.

187
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,790
I've also made

188
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,820
this move before.

189
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,030
What if I

190
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,190
want to follow up the victory?

191
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,080
You've never won.

192
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,740
How can you follow up the victory?

193
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,370
If you continue to be persistent,

194
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,980
you will lose everything.

195
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,730
Sir.

196
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,150
Playing chess

197
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,460
cultivates the mind.

198
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,980
You should be careful.

199
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,940
Then I won't make this move.

200
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,670
No regrets allowed.

201
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,190
Why don't you think about your next move?

202
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,510
Playing chess

203
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,620
cultivates the mind.

204
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,550
No regrets

205
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,890
allowed.

206
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,670
The kite got stuck.

207
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,320
I'll help you take it off.

208
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,160
Wait a moment.

209
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,860
There are so many red strings on this tree.

210
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,820
What if you get stuck too?

211
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,890
Then...

212
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,700
Let's hang this kite up as well.

213
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,740
So they can be in pairs

214
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,170
and won't feel lonely.

215
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,010
OK.

216
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,190
Come on, try again.

217
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,180
(Forever together)

218
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,500
(Forever together)

219
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,310
Are you okay, Changsheng?

220
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,400
I'm fine.

221
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,390
We are stuck.

222
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,480
The marriage tree tied us up.

223
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
We can't keep being tied up like this.

224
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,360
Okay, then untie it.

225
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,815
But this is the string of the marriage tree.

226
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,190
Do you really want to untie it?

227
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,460
We...

228
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,670
Stand up and untie it.

229
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,670
Untie it now.

230
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,370
Your Highness.

231
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,690
Your Highness, His Majesty asked for you

232
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,740
to the palace immediately.

233
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,050
- Changsheng.
- It's okay.

234
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,100
Go do your job.

235
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,770
- What about this?
- I will rip it apart

236
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,790
and hang it back.

237
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,900
All right.

238
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,550
Remember to hang it back.

239
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,130
Miss.

240
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,050
How did this red string
get wrapped around your wrist?

241
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,670
I just accidentally pulled it off.

242
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,550
Miss, don't you know?

243
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,710
What's wrong?

244
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,410
This marriage tree in our temple

245
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,250
works well.

246
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,280
Every year there are many people

247
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,370
coming to worship it.

248
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,990
If you take away this red string,

249
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,550
it can ensure a happy and smooth marriage.

250
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,860
- Really?
- Of course it's true.

251
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,240
The abbot said

252
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,750
monks never tell lies.

253
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,360
Okay.

254
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,340
I believe in you.

255
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,180
(Forever together)

256
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,080
Princess Royal.

257
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,860
Just now the little monk told me...

258
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,270
Sorry to interrupt.

259
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,360
You guys continue.

260
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,450
Continue.

261
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,790
Do you want to continue?

262
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,930
Didn't you say

263
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,180
playing chess requires meditation?

264
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,620
I only see the chess game now.

265
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,230
Where's Her Highness?

266
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,410
I don't know.

267
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,470
Let me look for her.

268
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,240
(Peace)

269
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,080
Your Highness.

270
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,071
Why are you here?

271
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,650
Won't you accompany His Highness to the palace?

272
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,890
His Majesty only summoned
the princes this time.

273
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,570
Guards cannot accompany them.

274
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,085
But

275
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,442
before His Highness returns to the palace,

276
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:37,520
he specially told us

277
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,310
to escort you home safely.

278
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,380
Such a small thing...

279
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,890
His Highness said

280
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,550
you're our most important thing.

281
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,510
Your Highness, please.

282
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,970
Let's go.

283
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,340
(Huadeng Pavilion)

284
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,120
Your Highness.

285
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,550
What are you doing?

286
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Making a knot.

287
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,890
Me and His Highness

288
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,000
got stuck by this red string

289
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,470
in Dazhi Zen Temple.

290
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,270
He likes it very much.

291
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,650
I see.

292
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,370
Is this called

293
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,130
"Like the double screen,

294
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,510
there are thousands of knots?"

295
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,620
Like the double screen,

296
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,180
there are thousands of knots.

297
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,860
So he misses me too.

298
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,100
He will definitely be touched
when he receives it.

299
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,660
I didn't prepare a box.

300
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,750
Isn't it

301
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,380
not formal?

302
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,040
Isn't it bad

303
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,420
to touch his stuff casually?

304
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,420
It should be fine.

305
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,100
(The Plan to Attack Fuyu)

306
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,580
(The Plan to Attack Fuyu)

307
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,500
(Twenty-four Cavalry Formations)

308
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,260
(Imperial Study)

309
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
Jing.

310
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,420
Are you really going to give up

311
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,030
attacking Fuyu?

312
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,310
Xiaoke.

313
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,860
If she knew I approached her before

314
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,810
(The Plan to Attack Fuyu)

315
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,070
to attack Fuyu,

316
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,180
she must be very sad.

317
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,040
Before,

318
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,030
I wanted to expand our territory

319
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,510
until I met her.

320
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,040
Now I

321
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,510
want to give her a peaceful life.

322
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,340
(The Plan to Attack Fuyu)

323
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,450
Jing, I think you

324
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,650
and the Princess of Fuyu

325
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,760
developed feelings

326
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,440
in Xiuwen Hall.

327
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,310
Because of a woman...

328
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,370
Father, during my trip in Fuyu,

329
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,440
I learned

330
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,410
though it's a small country,

331
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,720
there are talents

332
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,900
and soldiers everywhere.

333
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,270
After the Battle with Yu,

334
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,140
Great Tang is in its recuperation.

335
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,930
If we start a war now,

336
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,100
we are not sure of winning

337
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,750
and people will say that we are treacherous,

338
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,270
starting a war

339
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,610
- right after the peace-making marriage.
- Jing.

340
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,890
Don't forget

341
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,000
the purpose of your trip to Fuyu.

342
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,340
Isn't the purpose to make peace with Fuyu
through marriage?

343
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,650
Alright.

344
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,950
It's getting late.

345
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,470
Leave now.

346
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,550
Stop there, Ke.

347
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,730
Ke.

348
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,250
Hou.

349
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,410
Are you okay?

350
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,250
I'm fine.

351
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,950
No, it's not fine.

352
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,230
I have something to ask you.

353
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,690
Tell me.

354
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,140
Are your eyes for venting anger?

355
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,970
I just tipped you

356
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,550
many winks.

357
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,650
I... I didn't see it.

358
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,330
No, you...

359
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,820
Why didn't you say a word today?

360
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,710
Haven't you said everything
that needs to be said?

361
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,470
I have nothing to say.

362
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,280
Ke.

363
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,410
I'd like to say

364
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,550
you're just a little

365
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,070
stupid.

366
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,270
If you really don't know what to say,

367
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,280
you can tell Father

368
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,120
that

369
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,040
Hou is right.

370
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,720
You should help me.

371
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,560
Right?

372
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,100
You're right.

373
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,170
What's the point of saying it now?

374
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,370
You can't be so stupid in the future.

375
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,280
Be smart

376
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,230
and flexible.

377
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,360
You're right.

378
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,270
I can't even talk to you.

379
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,420
Think about Lv Jing.

380
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,340
Father is already very fond of him.

381
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,960
Now he has Liu Changsheng.

382
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,200
If Liu Changsheng

383
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,280
is just smart, that would be fine.

384
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,480
But Fuyu

385
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,690
is rich.

386
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,360
Lv Jing now has both money and power.

387
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,380
If we don't work harder,

388
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,790
will we have a good result?

389
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,550
You're right.

390
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,650
Ke.

391
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,100
Be smart.

392
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,310
Let's go home.

393
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,440
Don't be like this anymore.

394
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,660
Promise me, okay?

395
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,900
These rhododendrons are precious.

396
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,950
You must be extra careful.

397
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,547
You have been watering it day and night.

398
00:24:56,553 --> 00:24:57,960
In two months, these rhododendrons

399
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,100
will bloom for sure.

400
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,990
His Highness values them very much.

401
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,880
Your Highness.

402
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,580
His Highness is back.

403
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,880
Really?

404
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,810
You can leave now.

405
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,650
Yes.

406
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,660
Your Highness, have you had dinner?

407
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,210
I have no appetite.

408
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,230
But you have to eat.

409
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,650
Keep fit,

410
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,900
and then can you plan for the future.

411
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,790
My father is really partial.

412
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,990
I was giving some advice today.

413
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,710
Plus Hou's suggestion,

414
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,990
he already has a plan to attack Fuyu.

415
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,820
But a few words from Jing

416
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,010
made him drop the idea.

417
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,750
Father has always doted on Jing.

418
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,030
This is not doting.

419
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,250
He's spoiling him.

420
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,330
Other emperors value counterbalance

421
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,420
among the princes.

422
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,900
Lv Jing already has power.

423
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,230
Logically speaking,

424
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,340
I should be the one marrying Liu Changsheng.

425
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,440
But Father gave all the best

426
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,280
to him.

427
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,790
But I feel

428
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,520
at the moment,

429
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,760
don't focus

430
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,510
on irreversible things.

431
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,750
We should care about what we want.

432
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,510
That's what helps move forward.

433
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,230
You mean...

434
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,100
Why not wait a while?

435
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,070
Wait for the wind

436
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,510
and then we can borrow its strength

437
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,340
to soar up to the azure sky at last.

438
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,070
Your Highness, look.

439
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,420
The rhododendrons are growing well.

440
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,030
I guess in a few months, they'll bloom.

441
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,650
Common rhododendrons

442
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,330
bloom from April to June.

443
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,510
But they bloom in July.

444
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,510
Naturally it is different from others.

445
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,673
So it is more precious.

446
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,126
I have no mood to enjoy the flowers.

447
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,950
If he could understand my intention,

448
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,660
why repay a favor with a favor?

449
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,470
Your Highness, you're back.

450
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,470
This food box...

451
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,950
You just sent someone
to prepare it for Her Highness.

452
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,410
I just sent it over.

453
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,380
I mean, does she like it?

454
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,600
Her Highness

455
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,010
didn't touch it.

456
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,510
It shouldn't be.

457
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,100
It's all her favorite.

458
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,230
No need. I can go by myself.

459
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,490
Yes.

460
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,410
Changsheng.

461
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,650
Are you asleep?

462
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,210
Changsheng.

463
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,690
Your Highness, forgive me.

464
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,240
I no longer dare to steal food.

465
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,080
Get up.

466
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,450
Where's Her Highness?

467
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,600
Her Highness...

468
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,000
Her Highness said she was tired

469
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,100
and wanted to rest early.

470
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,420
She let me go back to my room first.

471
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,380
Rest early?

472
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,040
Your Highness.

473
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,330
I will go and find Her Highness.

474
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,170
No need.

475
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,710
Go get Youyong and Youmou here.

476
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,080
Okay.

477
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,780
(Cypress and Plum Blossoms)

478
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,000
Since I entered the palace,

479
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,030
have you ever seen Her Highness?

480
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,130
Me and Youmou

481
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,130
sent Her Highness home

482
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,100
following your instructions.

483
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,820
Then...

484
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,610
Her Highness is waiting in the study

485
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,310
- to have midnight snacks with you.
- Your Highness.

486
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,990
But she left madly for no reason.

487
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,520
Study?

488
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,280
No.

489
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,860
(The Plan to Attack Fuyu)

490
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,650
Your Highness.

491
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,950
Now what should we do?

492
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,310
The city gates are locked.

493
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,890
Her Highness must still be in the city.

494
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,900
I'll send someone to look for her.

495
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,520
No.

496
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,030
Don't disturb the people in the city.

497
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,410
Princess Consort Qin ran away from home.

498
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,250
It's a family affair.

499
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,605
We should solve it privately

500
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,488
in order not to let people
with ulterior motives speculate too much

501
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,690
and alarm His Majesty.

502
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,530
But Your Highness,

503
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,850
after the city gates are open tomorrow morning,

504
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,904
and Princess Consort Qin returns
to Fuyu with the attack plan,

505
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,410
once the news spreads,

506
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,580
it'll cause big trouble.

507
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,620
If you know it.

508
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,180
She naturally knows it too.

509
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,420
What you mean is...

510
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,030
Before she found out the whole story,

511
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,064
she won't leave the imperial city rashly.

512
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,560
Then

513
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,710
where else will Her Highness go?

514
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,560
Xiuwen Hall.

515
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,220
(Xiuwen Hall)

516
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,090
Your Highness, don't panic.

517
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:48,950
It's just a wild cat.

518
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,070
No one has lived here for a long time.

519
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,170
I just had someone clean it up.

520
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,660
You can stay here for one night.

521
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,030
Thank you, Aunt...

522
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,310
Princess Royal.

523
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,600
Princess Royal.

524
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,170
I have a question

525
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,140
to ask you.

526
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,100
I can't answer your question.

527
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,100
Neither Jing can answer it.

528
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,030
Only you have the answer.

529
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,570
I will have the answer?

530
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,680
A lot of things

531
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,140
can't be looked at with your eyes.

532
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,420
Take a rest early.

533
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,470
I have the answer?

534
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,520
Your Highness.

535
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,550
Is Great Tang really going to attack Fuyu?

536
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,140
I don't know either.

537
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,040
I see Prince Qin

538
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,380
treats you sincerely.

539
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,760
Besides, you two have been through

540
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,310
a lot together.

541
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,330
If he really wanted to attack Fuyu,

542
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,380
there were many opportunities.

543
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,860
He didn't have to wait until now.

544
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,170
You can't judge a book by its cover.

545
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,030
It is difficult to know one's heart.

546
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,810
Your Highness, this is a big deal.

547
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,520
We have to act with caution.

548
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,820
Because we need to be cautious,

549
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,930
I didn't send the message

550
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,070
back to Fuyu immediately.

551
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:33,230
Just in case it's a misunderstanding.

552
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,820
If Fuyu sends troops,

553
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,270
then Great Tang
will definitely send troops too.

554
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,650
By the time,

555
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,420
things will be irreversible.

556
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,610
Your Highness.

557
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,580
What do you want to do?

558
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:43,770
I think

559
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,200
I'll trust him again.

560
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,140
Should we discuss this with Mr. Xiao?

561
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,680
After all, he is the only person

562
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,070
we can trust in Great Tang.

563
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,500
(Officials of Fuyu's Six Ministries)

564
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,740
(Twenty-four Cavalry Formations)

565
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,100
I'm going to marry into Great Tang soon.

566
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,070
But I am also the princess of Fuyu.

567
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,700
I always think about

568
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,870
what I can do for the people.

569
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,091
Don't worry, I'll try

570
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:31,000
to establish trade relations
between Great Tang and Fuyu.

571
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You will be able to see

572
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,100
all these things in Fuyu.

573
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,350
Being in the high position,

574
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,300
we must seek happiness for the people.

575
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,100
This has always been my principle.

576
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,100
The people of Great Tang are my responsibility.

577
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,700
Now Fuyu is too.

578
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,250
I will spare no effort

579
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,510
to make the life better for everyone.

580
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,210
Yi'an.

581
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,860
(Xiuwen Hall)

582
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,830
Prince Qin.

583
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,510
Why is it closed for no reason?

584
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,440
Mr. Xiao.

585
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,880
Your Highness.

586
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,840
You came so early.

587
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,810
- Yes.
- Xiuwen Hall is closed today.

588
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,040
(Closed)
- Closed? - Yes.

589
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,700
Xiuwen Hall has a distinguished guest today,

590
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,550
and can't receive visitors.

591
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,440
Mr. Xiao, Jing,

592
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,550
please go back first.

593
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,880
Aunt.

594
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,250
The ministers will soon enter the palace.

595
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,740
I guess you don't want everyone to know

596
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,910
Princess Changsheng ran away from home.

597
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,950
Changsheng ran away from home?

598
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,030
I need to see Changsheng

599
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,333
to clarify the misunderstanding.

600
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,950
There is no rush.

601
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,870
You can't solve any problems by seeing her now.

602
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,410
If you really want to repair your relationship,

603
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,560
what's important now

604
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,830
is to give her confidence.

605
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,960
I see.

606
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,510
Thank you for your advice.

607
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,090
Please take care

608
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,470
of Changsheng for me.

609
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,910
I will naturally do my duty as a host.

610
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,850
But think about

611
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,100
what to do next carefully.

612
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,830
You have to understand
that she is not a criminal.

613
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,430
I can't keep her.

614
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,780
The only thing that can keep her

615
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,300
is your sincerity.

616
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,740
My sincerity towards her

617
00:36:12,757 --> 00:36:14,010
can be testified by the sun and the moon.

618
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,430
There are times when the sun and the moon
are obscured by clouds.

619
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,910
She may not know

620
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,580
your sincerity.

621
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,810
Trapped in love,

622
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,870
even you

623
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,180
have become a fool.

624
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,070
If you really figured out what to do,

625
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,620
do it now.

626
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:32,650
Goodbye.

627
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,550
Did you bully Changsheng?

628
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,510
Princess Royal, what happened?

629
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,690
Princess Royal.

630
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,390
Slow down, I can't keep up with you.

631
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,440
If you can't keep up, stop.

632
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,470
You fail to get what you want

633
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,510
because of our inconsistent steps.

634
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,550
Just like the chess game in the temple,

635
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,130
one wrong move

636
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,830
leads to another.

637
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,210
That's true.

638
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,780
Then I'll ask Changsheng directly.

639
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,250
By the way,

640
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,960
I'm going to the market to buy breakfast.

641
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,908
Do you want to eat something?

642
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,780
How about fried buns?

643
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,390
Changsheng said it was delicious.

644
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,220
Changsheng has her favorite food,

645
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,350
and I have mine.

646
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,890
I remember you seemed to like

647
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,470
osmanthus cakes.

648
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,470
I also like you.

649
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,880
Never mind.

650
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,470
I just heard you...

651
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,840
Yes.

652
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,730
You heard it right.

653
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,430
I have feelings for you.

654
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,080
I know you like Changsheng.

655
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,440
I thought about giving up.

656
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,480
But I can't help it.

657
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,390
I just can't.

658
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,690
You and I are in the game together.

659
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,350
I don't know what to do.

660
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,610
I...

661
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,130
I...

662
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,050
Sorry.

663
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,400
Your Highness.

664
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,700
His Highness is back?

665
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,290
I don't know what Princess Royal is thinking.

666
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,600
She just gave His Highness a letter,

667
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,070
saying she wouldn't let him in.

668
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,640
She won't even let him see you.

669
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,740
Then how can we solve the problem?

670
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,740
Which side is Princess Royal on?

671
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,550
Does she hope to clear up the misunderstanding

672
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,950
or not?

673
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,100
Princess Royal said

674
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,870
I have the answer to the question.

675
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,220
If I don't have the answer myself,

676
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,830
even if we meet,

677
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,960
it's also useless.

678
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,170
Mr. Xiao.

679
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,480
Princess Royal.

680
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,640
Have you ever imagined

681
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,390
such a scene with Changsheng?

682
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,770
Xiao Zilv.

683
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,620
What are you doing?

684
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,260
What happened between you and Lv Jing?

685
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,260
I was just about to talk to you.

686
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,870
Xiao Zilv.

687
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,910
Well, I got something to do. I gotta go.
