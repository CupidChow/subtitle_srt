00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,660
=Episode 5=

3
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,870
Here, Young Master.

4
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,070
Young Master.

5
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,070
Do you want more?

6
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,510
Bring them all.

7
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,470
It's all here.

8
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,740
(Luck and Blessing)

9
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,000
Young Master is smart.

10
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,390
You let us lure Zhao Huaibi

11
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,120
to Muyan Forest.

12
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,350
This chance encounter

13
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,470
will definitely change Her Highness's mind

14
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,540
and make her fall for Zhao Huaibi.

15
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,460
Zhao Huaibi has made outstanding
military achievements.

16
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,070
I believe we can get more information

17
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,070
about Fuyu from him.

18
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,240
It's better to use hot water.

19
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,630
Princess Guangde.

20
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,870
How did she leave?

21
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,550
Why is she acting weird lately?

22
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,870
According to her previous temper,

23
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,630
she should've come to provoke you now.

24
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,440
Maybe it's because you helped her
at the Lantern Festival

25
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,520
so she changed her attitude.

26
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,070
Maybe.

27
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,870
Your Highness, we found out.

28
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,320
The reason why Princess Guangde

29
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,160
changed her temperament drastically

30
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,590
is because of a man.

31
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,630
So where is my destined man?

32
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,950
Yours hasn't appeared yet.

33
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,030
But hers has shown up.

34
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,470
Who said mine hasn't appeared?

35
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
In the deep pit accident that night,

36
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,920
my destined man

37
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,110
already appeared.

38
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,950
Who is it?

39
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
Zhao Huaibi.

40
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,000
General Zhao.

41
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,920
Well...

42
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,720
She just has someone she likes.

43
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,200
Which man does she fancy?

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,600
I don't know.

45
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,670
I only know that they met
at the Lantern Festival.

46
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,590
That man rescued her.

47
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,080
Princess Guangde

48
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,160
couldn't forget him since then.

49
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,880
Your Highness.

50
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,720
What a small world.

51
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,600
I did not expect

52
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,110
our fate

53
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,350
is tied to one person.

54
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,190
Who?

55
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,120
Zhao Huaibi,

56
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,270
General Zhao.

57
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,320
You mean the General Zhao

58
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,030
who hasn't yet returned to the capital?

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,470
Your Highness.

60
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,470
Be careful.

61
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,080
Don't tell Princess Guangde.

62
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,750
You need to take action first.

63
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,590
Take action first.

64
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,200
Your Highness.

65
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,530
Princess Guangde requests to meet you.

66
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,360
Princess.

67
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,310
Speak of the devil.

68
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,160
Changsheng.

69
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,320
What brought

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,880
you here today?

71
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,480
These are the storybooks I carefully prepared.

72
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,720
Many good love stories are recorded.

73
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,520
Read them and accumulate some experience.

74
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,110
Come, sit down first.

75
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,320
Are they really useful?

76
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,880
Of course.

77
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,080
Moreover,

78
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,470
if one of us gets married first,

79
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,590
she'll get rid of the peace-making marriage.

80
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,430
Although we are opponents,

81
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,990
we still need to be fair.

82
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,280
I don't want to cheat.

83
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,080
Thanks.

84
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,640
Alright,

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,400
I'm not used to this yet.

86
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,910
I'm telling you,

87
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,590
I think this matter

88
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,080
is not as difficult

89
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,110
as we think.

90
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,560
It's either

91
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,960
quarrelsome lovers

92
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,880
or

93
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,760
childhood sweethearts.

94
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,390
First, the two people were at odds.

95
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,880
Then their fates entangle.

96
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,680
If there's no fate,

97
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,280
we can create opportunities ourselves.

98
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,640
Just pester him.

99
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,110
- If pestering doesn't work...
- Guangde.

100
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,790
We are rivals.

101
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,280
I know.

102
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,790
But it has to be fair.

103
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,200
Don't worry.

104
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,400
Even if we like the same person,

105
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
I won't mind.

106
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,310
Really?

107
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,470
I really don't mind.

108
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,640
Wait.

109
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,320
What do you mean by "really"?

110
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,960
Guangde.

111
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,790
Since you're here to deliver the notes

112
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,840
and share everything you know,

113
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,870
then I will also be honest.

114
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,880
Actually

115
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,160
that day at the Lantern Festival,

116
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,110
the person you met is...

117
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,990
Who is it?

118
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,030
Tell me quickly.

119
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,520
It's Zhao Huaibi.

120
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,720
General Zhao.

121
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,270
Really?

122
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,920
No.

123
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,470
Wait a minute.

124
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,030
You mean...

125
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,910
He also saved me after that.

126
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,430
You're saying

127
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,350
he saved you...

128
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,390
Hurry up.

129
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,470
Take all of these away.

130
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,430
Don't leave any.

131
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,230
Didn't you say you wanted it to be fair?

132
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,750
Who wants to be fair to you?

133
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,040
I didn't say that.

134
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,960
Give me this one back, too.

135
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
Go.

136
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,840
In terms of talent and appearance,

137
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,280
you're the best in Shangkang.

138
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,000
But my Guangde

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,200
is also beautiful

140
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,520
and intelligent.

141
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,390
You two

142
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,030
are a match made in heaven.

143
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,000
How about I issue a decree

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,320
and make you two

145
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,670
a couple?

146
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,750
Your Majesty,

147
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,910
thank you for your kindness.

148
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,520
It's just

149
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,720
I have a disability.

150
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm not good enough

151
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,160
for Princess Guangde.

152
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,640
So I dare not agree.

153
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,760
You dare not agree

154
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,760
or you don't want to?

155
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,120
You've used this reason many times.

156
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,710
I also have my pride.

157
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,590
All right?

158
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,200
I noticed that your leg

159
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,160
is no different from ordinary people's.

160
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,830
Are you using the crutch

161
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,800
just to refuse the marriage?

162
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,640
I dare not.

163
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,760
My official rank

164
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,960
is low.

165
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,030
In terms of ability, I have
no military achievements.

166
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,950
It's just unjustifiable.

167
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,950
If I do marry Princess Guangde,

168
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm afraid it will make the royal family
a laughing stock.

169
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,120
If this is true,

170
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,670
please execute me, Your Majesty.

171
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,790
You'd rather die than marry Guangde?

172
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,470
Wouldn't that make me a tyrant?

173
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,830
Being a matchmaker

174
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,870
is harder than being the Emperor.

175
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,400
I need to persuade everyone earnestly

176
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,880
for their marriage.

177
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,120
Never mind.

178
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,430
I won't interfere.

179
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,430
Thank you, Your Majesty.

180
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:15,430
(Imperial Study)

181
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,120
Xiao Zilv.

182
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,120
You would rather die than marry me.

183
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,710
Princess, please calm down.

184
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,560
I...

185
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,400
Well done.

186
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,190
Actually, I already have someone I like.

187
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,080
You must stand your ground.

188
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,480
Next time, don't just talk.

189
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,360
Princess, what are you doing?

190
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Don't be afraid.

191
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm afraid that next time
my father will force you.

192
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,590
You can't just talk.

193
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,790
You need to take action.

194
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,670
This dagger

195
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,120
is extremely sharp,

196
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,360
which can cut clean through iron.

197
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,560
If it really doesn't work,

198
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,910
just cut it off.

199
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,550
I'm the only son in the family.

200
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,960
What are you thinking?

201
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,990
Lecher.

202
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,120
I mean cut your leg.

203
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,230
If it still doesn't work,

204
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,600
cut off both legs.

205
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,710
I don't believe Father is still so persistent.

206
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,280
Princess, you deserve

207
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,590
a hero in the world.

208
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,790
Actually,

209
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,590
the man I like

210
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,880
is indeed a hero.

211
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,680
It's just

212
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,550
Changsheng also likes him.

213
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
What do you think I should do?

214
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,630
Princess, if you don't mind,

215
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,960
I am willing to lend you

216
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,950
a helping hand.

217
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
You want to help me

218
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,430
or help yourself?

219
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,080
You are always against Changsheng.

220
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,190
Do you want to marry her?

221
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,270
Jin.

222
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,150
Are you embroidering?

223
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,710
This pattern is obviously not for me.

224
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,310
Humph.

225
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,830
You look very happy today.

226
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,280
Today is really refreshing.

227
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,080
You argued with Changsheng again?

228
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,070
No.

229
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,990
This time I am

230
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,430
sitting back and reaping the benefits.

231
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,680
If Changsheng is the snipe,

232
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,880
who is that clam?

233
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,430
Guangde.

234
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,070
You're helping Guangde against Changsheng?

235
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,070
Don't tell her.

236
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,280
Zilv.

237
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,830
How can you bear
to watch Changsheng marry far away?

238
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,360
Rest assured.

239
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,710
I know you are close to Changsheng.

240
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,830
If she is really forced to marry far away,

241
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,590
I'll just open my arms

242
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,030
and marry her.

243
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,720
See you.

244
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,190
My brother just got close to her

245
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,310
and then broke a leg.

246
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,240
If he marries Changsheng...

247
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,840
No.

248
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,760
No way.

249
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,270
Changsheng.

250
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,670
Jin.

251
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,680
How did you come?

252
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,830
I sneaked out.

253
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,070
Got to go back soon.

254
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,830
What's so important?

255
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,040
I heard from my brother

256
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,310
that you like Zhao Huaibi?

257
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,950
General Zhao is going to go fishing tomorrow.

258
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,520
You should prepare early.

259
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,310
Don't let Zhao Huaibi marry Guangde.

260
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,910
Jin, you are still the best to me.

261
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,160
If I really can't get married,

262
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,670
I'll marry your brother.

263
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,990
Anyway,

264
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,160
he has already broken a leg.

265
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,360
There shouldn't be any more problems.

266
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,830
Marry my brother?

267
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,710
No way.

268
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,000
No.

269
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,840
Well...

270
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,590
My brother

271
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,920
is actually an

272
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,950
embroidered pillow,

273
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,440
pleasant to the eye but of no use.

274
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,680
Usually, he looks

275
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,160
elegant on the outside,

276
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,510
but he's terrible

277
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,360
behind people's backs.

278
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,400
You don't know, Changsheng.

279
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,240
How could I not know?

280
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,830
Don't worry.

281
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,830
I won't choose

282
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,190
Xiao Zilv to be my husband.

283
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,440
Even if I have to marry into Great Tang,

284
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,600
I won't consider him.

285
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,000
But

286
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
I don't want you to go to Great Tang.

287
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,400
Thank you, Jin.

288
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,790
Then I'll leave first.

289
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,310
Wait a minute, Jin.

290
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,070
We've got a batch of fruits you like.

291
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,280
Take some away.

292
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,470
No, I'll come to your house to eat next time.

293
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,310
Bye.

294
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,190
Why are you sighing?

295
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,760
You know her intention,

296
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
and still gave her good fruit to eat.

297
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,190
It is evident that Your Highness

298
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,550
is generous.

299
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,880
What do you want to say?

300
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,360
With your intelligence,

301
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,910
you're sad

302
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,190
not because Xiao Jin
betrayed her brother, right?

303
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,480
Jin cares about her brother the most.

304
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,790
That's why she doesn't want me
to marry into the Xiao family.

305
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,950
So what do you think?

306
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,520
I think...

307
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,880
That's not your concern.

308
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,120
Xiao Zilv

309
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,800
is a good choice.

310
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,120
You must be kidding.

311
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,950
He and I have been arguing
since we were little.

312
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,760
I know him well.

313
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,640
We are not suitable for each other.

314
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,480
Then who are you suitable for?

315
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,480
Anyway, it's not Prince Qin.

316
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,590
But then again,

317
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,030
we've been through so much.

318
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,760
Do you want me to marry into Great Tang?

319
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,430
This is not for me to decide.

320
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,040
It's up to you to decide

321
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,280
whether you want to help me.

322
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,040
Guangde already has a helper.

323
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,030
Do you want

324
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,350
to stand with me?

325
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,520
You're kidding.

326
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,400
I'm anxious to choose you as the candidate.

327
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,600
But

328
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,360
what's in it for me

329
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,670
to help you?

330
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,310
If you help me,

331
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,360
you will be my good friend.

332
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,880
Just one word from you

333
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,950
can make me

334
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,910
go through fire

335
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,480
and water for you.

336
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,550
What if I don't help?

337
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,830
Then I am your death warrant.

338
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,430
You offended me many times in Fuyu.

339
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,600
When I get to Great Tang,

340
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,350
one word from me

341
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,110
can make you go through

342
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,760
fire and water.

343
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,010
I know you are not convenient
expressing your opinion.

344
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,550
We will use this as a signal.

345
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,520
Scrape the nose

346
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,550
means you tacitly approve.

347
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,390
How about it?

348
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I have something else to do.

349
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,880
I'll leave first.

350
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,710
Unify the family, govern the country,

351
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,790
and pacify the world.

352
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,960
My greatest wish

353
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,400
is to marry a good wife

354
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,680
and then contribute my part

355
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,120
to assist the Emperor.

356
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,400
Stop it.

357
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,080
The point of your words is

358
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,070
marry a beautiful wife.

359
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,910
Nonsense.

360
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,070
Yuzhi.

361
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,360
Do you have any wishes?

362
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,160
The wilderness is desolate with withered grass.

363
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,910
The Yellow River rolls its waves forward.

364
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,310
Well...

365
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,950
Why hasn't the fish taken the bait?

366
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,800
Speaking of fishing,

367
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,190
a few years ago, my father

368
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,400
went fishing in the Huai River

369
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,790
and caught a carp weighing 18 catties.

370
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It was this long.

371
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,160
Do you think it's awesome?

372
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,630
Now

373
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,670
no one can catch such a rare fish.

374
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,200
Some people even caught turtles in the river.

375
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,630
It's like a river going against the current,

376
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,830
seawater flows backward.

377
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,870
The world is in chaos.

378
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,870
Don't listen to his bragging.

379
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,720
Turtles.

380
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,160
Why didn't you say people caught a fairy?

381
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,760
We really caught it.

382
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,280
And there are two of them.

383
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,830
Wait, isn't this

384
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,240
Princess Changsheng?

385
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,550
How come we catch Princess Changsheng?

386
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,400
The two boats

387
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,760
are coming towards us.

388
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,870
No more fishing.

389
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,910
- No more fishing.
- That's it.

390
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,200
Yuzhi, you continue fishing.

391
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,160
We'll go play cards.

392
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,280
We're going to play cards.

393
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,680
You keep fishing.

394
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,710
Keep going.

395
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,950
You really designed

396
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,470
a good entrance for Her Highness.

397
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,950
Princess Guangde's entrance is also amazing.

398
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,230
I guess the master behind this
must be no simple person.

399
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,270
You are here to see the princesses,

400
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,110
right?

401
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,750
So what are we here for?

402
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,670
We're here to do business.

403
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,800
What business?

404
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,120
Shut up.

405
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,560
- Here we are.
- We've arrived.

406
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,990
- Zhao.
- General.

407
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,920
Greetings, Princess Guangde,

408
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,760
Your Highness.

409
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,600
Zhao, don't move.

410
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,710
We'll go find you.

411
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,670
(The brave is the conqueror.)

412
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,190
(Look how I take the initiative.)

413
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,550
Princess Guangde.

414
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,400
Princess Changsheng.

415
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,470
General, it's been...

416
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,670
We meet again.

417
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,880
What a coincidence!

418
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,720
Interception.

419
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,400
Give me money.

420
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,830
Come on, come on.

421
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,920
Zhao, it's cold on the boat.

422
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,710
Let's go talk in the cabin.

423
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,080
(It doesn't matter.)

424
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,320
(Cater to his taste.)

425
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,450
In fact, I think

426
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,720
the most important thing about fishing

427
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,520
is the bait.

428
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,680
Usually we use

429
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,950
the kind of bait...

430
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,560
Speaking of fishing,

431
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,710
Your Highness, do you like fishing?

432
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,800
- Not...
- I like it very much.

433
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,470
- I think fishing...
- Not really.

434
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,240
I

435
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,640
love fishing.

436
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,120
It is a determination
from the bottom of my heart.

437
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,910
Just like once

438
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,990
I'm determined to do something,

439
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,990
I will make every effort.

440
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,080
I heard last time

441
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,550
when you were rejected by Yang Wulang,

442
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,950
you said you were going to die.

443
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,270
What's wrong?

444
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,360
You're giving up halfway?

445
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,990
You might as well try harder

446
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,190
and fight to the end,

447
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,030
right?

448
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,640
I have heard that General

449
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,710
is good at fishing.

450
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,880
How about showing us today?

451
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,320
- Well...
- Zhao.

452
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,710
Just show us.

453
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,920
After all, not everyone

454
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,840
likes fishing

455
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,880
like I do.

456
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,360
There's nothing bad

457
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,320
about showing it to someone.

458
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,110
Okay.

459
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,840
Then let's play together.

460
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,680
OK.

461
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,990
Since Changsheng

462
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,120
loves fishing so much

463
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,840
from the bottom of her heart,

464
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,880
then let's play together.

465
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,990
Changsheng

466
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,950
can't deceive the general, can she?

467
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,080
It's my pleasure.

468
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,070
So

469
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,200
what's the first thing you want me to do?

470
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,040
Teach me to fish.

471
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,400
General Zhao

472
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,640
is very good at fishing.

473
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,550
I want to show him

474
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,560
I am also good at fishing.

475
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,910
With a common interest,

476
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,360
then...

477
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,120
OK, you have already approved.

478
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,710
Teach me how to fish.

479
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,710
(Luckily I was prepared.)

480
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,560
What were you looking at, General?

481
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,640
The landscape

482
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,160
and the lights in the windows.

483
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,880
You have

484
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,230
a bigger world in heart.

485
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,080
Then tell me,

486
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,360
what kind of world is this?

487
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,400
It's the withered grass in the wilderness,

488
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,430
the roaring waves of the Yellow River,

489
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,990
and the cold snow and frost in the north.

490
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,710
Your heart

491
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,560
is filled with the unfinished cause of Fuyu.

492
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,030
Conquering several small countries
in the southeast

493
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,310
can't give full play

494
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,270
to your talent.

495
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,710
Even Prime Minister Huan didn't accomplish it.

496
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,400
How can I dare to achieve it?

497
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,120
Prime Minister Huan

498
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,270
can't compare with you.

499
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,600
He was just using the Northern Expedition

500
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,800
for fame.

501
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,080
He is different from you.

502
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,750
He doesn't have the ambition

503
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,840
to regain lost territory like you do.

504
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,990
Zhao, come and help me.

505
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,080
I'm about to catch it.

506
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,600
One, two, three.

507
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,360
How did it run away?

508
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,200
It doesn't matter.

509
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,510
Fishing

510
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,710
is about having patience.

511
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,910
You can't be anxious.

512
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,710
You can't even cast the line out.

513
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,120
It's hard for you

514
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,510
to learn how to fish.

515
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,190
I can't give up, right?

516
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,740
That's Zhao Huaibi.

517
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,530
Rather than doing twice the work
with half the effort,

518
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,260
it is better

519
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,730
to wait at your ease for an exhausted enemy.

520
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,400
What does it mean?

521
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
This is a good idea.

522
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,270
Princess.

523
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,160
Don't be impatient.

524
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,510
It's normal that you can't
catch any fish at first.

525
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,990
It's too hard to fish.

526
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,430
Your Highness, fish.

527
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,270
This is a fish in the sea.

528
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,400
We are at the lake.

529
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,430
So what should I do?

530
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,670
Forget it.

531
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,840
Hook it up quickly.

532
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,960
Okay.

533
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,840
Are you done?

534
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,880
It's hooked.

535
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,080
It hurts.

536
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,400
I've only heard

537
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,300
there was a fish at North Sea.

538
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,640
Its name was "Kun".

539
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,790
It can also change into a bird.

540
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,710
But

541
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,680
what you caught

542
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,270
is not Kun.

543
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,910
You know no-

544
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,270
Nothing.

545
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,920
This is called Mermaid,

546
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,120
also known as dugong

547
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,080
and manatee.

548
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,710
It's half human and half fish,

549
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,230
living underwater all year round.

550
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,230
He just looks like a human.

551
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,710
He's quite gentle actually.

552
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,990
Go home.

553
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,560
Go home?

554
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,030
Yes.

555
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,400
To your crystal palace.

556
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,560
Or where else can you go?

557
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,400
Go quickly.

558
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,880
Go.

559
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,750
It took me a long time to think of this trick.

560
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,270
Princess Guangde.

561
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,160
Princess Changsheng.

562
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,510
I'm going to dig in.

563
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,960
Zhao, try this.

564
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,750
I asked a famous chef from Jiangnan

565
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,600
to make this specially,
squirrel-shaped mandarin fish.

566
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,030
Try this steamed sea bass.

567
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,120
It's fresh.

568
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,360
It won't taste good if it gets cold.

569
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
If it's cold, try this grilled fish.

570
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,880
- Spicy and delicious.
- If it's spicy,

571
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,120
try this fish soup.

572
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,080
It's warm and nourishing.

573
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,920
Zhao, eat a fish tail.

574
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,230
I wish you success

575
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,270
and victory.

576
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,030
General, try this fish loin.

577
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,960
I wish you a happy

578
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,950
and invincible life.

579
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
Eat this.

580
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
- Eat this.
- Eat this.

581
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,160
Princess.

582
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,400
Your Highness.

583
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,880
I suddenly remembered

584
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,320
I have some important matters to attend to.

585
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,270
You can enjoy the dishes.

586
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,670
I will take my leave now.

587
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,950
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

588
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
General.

589
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,360
Eat a little bit.

590
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,880
Don't let Princess Guangde down.

591
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,270
Yes.

592
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,510
If you won't eat any,

593
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,230
Changsheng will be embarrassed.

594
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,070
I'll eat.

595
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,480
Tasty.

596
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,310
Eat this.

597
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,270
Eat this.

598
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,560
Try this.

599
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,400
Try this again.

600
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,910
Another bite of this.

601
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,270
This is delicious.

602
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,400
Have some fish soup.

603
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,000
Well,

604
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,590
I

605
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,710
am full.

606
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,360
I'll leave first.

607
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,710
- Zhao.
- General.

608
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,200
Eat some more.

609
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,360
General.

610
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,880
- Eat more.
- Zhao.

611
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,600
- Why don't you eat more?
- General.

612
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,920
Wait a moment.

613
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,560
Sorry.

614
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,950
Excuse me.

615
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,640
Zhao.

616
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,860
(Imperial Study)

617
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,720
Sir,

618
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,190
His Majesty has not yet decided
on the candidate.

619
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,680
It seems that the peace-making marriage

620
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,560
is not that simple.

621
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,430
Yes, sir.

622
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,910
Great Tang has urged us to go back and report.

623
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,640
Keeping delaying this

624
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,750
is not a solution.

625
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,200
I have other plans

626
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,270
for the report.

627
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,750
You don't worry, sir?

628
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,800
I'm afraid someone else is worried.

629
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,030
Do you mean

630
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,510
Princess Changsheng?

631
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,360
I heard

632
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,920
Princess Changsheng has been

633
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,070
close to General Zhao Huaibi

634
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,910
these days.

635
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,840
As the saying goes,

636
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,920
one leaf obstructs sight.

637
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,910
They can't necessarily see clearly
when they're close.

638
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
General Zhao is honest and upright.

639
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,310
Princess Changsheng

640
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,800
is straightforward.

641
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,190
They are more like confidants,

642
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,640
but not a couple.

643
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,430
It seems that I was overthinking.

644
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,270
Overthinking?

645
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,320
I'm afraid someone thinks more than you do.

646
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,640
Mr. Envoy.

647
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,240
Sir.

648
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,800
Mr. Xiao.

649
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,120
Are you coming to meet His Majesty

650
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,360
and discuss the peace-making marriage?

651
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,680
Exactly.

652
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,400
So, is there any result?

653
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,160
There are many beauties in Fuyu,

654
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,200
each has her own merits.

655
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,710
It's really hard to decide.

656
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,550
That's for sure.

657
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,470
Although the purpose of the marriage
is to make peace,

658
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,960
Prince Qin

659
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,190
is choosing a person he'll spend his life with.

660
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,670
It's natural to be cautious.

661
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,120
Mr. Xiao, you're right.

662
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,710
But recently I heard

663
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,920
Prince Qin

664
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,070
does favor

665
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,230
a princess.

666
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,360
I wonder who is this lucky princess.

667
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,230
This princess

668
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,320
is quite famous.

669
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,800
I believe you are also very familiar with her.

670
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,360
Are you referring to

671
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,950
Princess Changsheng?

672
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,800
Exactly.

673
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,320
Mr. Envoy,

674
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,470
you don't know.

675
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,750
Princess Changsheng

676
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,230
has an unfavorable rumor.

677
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,640
Marrying her

678
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,270
will be bad for Prince Qin.

679
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,110
What a coincidence.

680
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,270
Prince Qin is unmatched in wisdom and courage

681
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,910
and never believes these nonsense.

682
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,710
It seems

683
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,080
a good match.

684
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,470
That being the case,

685
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,670
forget what I said.

686
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,710
Mr. Xiao, you were thinking for Prince Qin.

687
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,910
I am grateful.

688
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,470
But recently I heard

689
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,920
General Zhao and Princess Changsheng

690
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,840
have been very close.

691
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,080
I don't know

692
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,910
whether they'll end up in a relationship.

693
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,510
This is Princess Changsheng's private matter.

694
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,880
I'm not familiar with General Zhao.

695
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,320
I really don't know.

696
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,920
I don't know about your relationship

697
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,950
with General Zhao.

698
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,430
But you're on good terms

699
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,840
with Princess Guangde.

700
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,440
Come in.

701
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,670
Your Highness

702
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,950
is in a good mood.

703
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,840
I'm bored.

704
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,950
So I'm doing some needlework.

705
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,990
How did it go today?

706
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,560
We are evenly matched.

707
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,430
So it's still hard to choose.

708
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,960
I mean

709
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,950
in General Zhao's heart,

710
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,920
I only have a small space

711
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,270
but she occupies

712
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,670
a lot of weight.

713
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,430
Your Highness, don't be discouraged.

714
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,030
This is just temporary,

715
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,160
not eternal.

716
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,880
Your embroidery

717
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,510
represents something.

718
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,640
You're surely my adviser.

719
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,610
Tomorrow General Zhao

720
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,990
is going to the military camp for training.

721
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,040
I plan to go and show my care for him.

722
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,710
(Military camp.)

723
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,360
I went to the palace today,

724
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,990
so you didn't win Princess Guangde.

725
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,430
I will go with you tomorrow.

726
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,750
Then please accompany me

727
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,230
as my servant

728
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,840
to avoid trouble.

729
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,470
Of course.

730
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,430
Tomorrow, Her Highness and I
will go to the military camp.

731
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,070
If too many people go, it'll attract attention.

732
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,800
You guys stay at home.

733
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,650
Sir, do you want to

734
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,830
check out their defense deployment?

735
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,190
After you go,

736
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,520
their deployment will naturally change.

737
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,840
The deployment will change,

738
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,190
but their formations, military strength

739
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,880
and usual martial arts techniques

740
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,560
won't change.

741
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,950
Your Highness.

742
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,310
What brought Your Highness

743
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,230
here today?

744
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,310
I'm here to see General Zhao Huaibi.

745
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,710
Please wait here.

746
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,470
I will report this to General Zhao.

747
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,510
This is...

748
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,400
My servant.

749
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,960
Hold on.

750
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,550
What a small world.

751
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,030
What a narrow road for enemies.

752
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,750
Who is your enemy?

753
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,230
I'm here for Zhao.

754
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,920
I'm afraid if you marry General Zhao,

755
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,120
you'll be enemies.

756
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,960
You...

757
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,510
- Zhao.
- General Zhao.

758
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,230
Princess, Your Highness.

759
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,960
What are you two

760
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,890
doing here?

761
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,790
I have something to tell you.

762
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,120
I have something to tell you too.

763
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,840
- I'll go first.
- I'll go first.

764
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,510
Zhao.

765
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,070
I personally...

766
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,950
Liar.

767
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,710
Personally let the embroiderers in the palace

768
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,840
make this for you,

769
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,470
an invincible safety bracelet.

770
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,360
As long as you wear it on the battlefield,

771
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,430
you will be invincible.

772
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,030
Thank you, Princess.

773
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,400
You didn't even make the gift yourself.

774
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,840
So sincere.

775
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,120
General won the battles

776
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,190
based on his real ability.

777
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,070
A mere safety bracelet

778
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,990
can't keep him safe.

779
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:57,950
General.

780
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,070
This is a purse

781
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,120
I embroidered by myself.

782
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,320
Although the embroidery is rough,

783
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,230
every stitch

784
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,750
contains my care for you.

785
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,640
I hope you can stay safe

786
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,670
on the battlefield.

787
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,550
Don't forget

788
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,920
someone is waiting for you at home,

789
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,160
wishing you to come back soon.

790
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,040
Thanks, Your Highness.

791
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,670
You're so humble.

792
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,360
These two big fat geese

793
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,840
are really beautiful.

794
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,990
Speaking of which,

795
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,960
I have to mention

796
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,670
the delicacies

797
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,360
Princess Guangde made

798
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,840
are really hard to swallow.

799
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,840
You flatter me.

800
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,200
The delicious food you made

801
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,750
have a memorable

802
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,880
and lingering

803
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,400
taste.

804
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,030
General.

805
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,230
The new horse is going mad again.

806
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,200
I have important things
to attend to in the army.

807
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,320
I'll take my leave first.

808
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,830
Let's go.

809
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,190
General, be careful.

810
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,830
- Zhao.
- General Zhao.

811
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,440
- Zhao, are you okay?
- Zhao, are you okay?

812
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,160
I'm fine.

813
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,350
Sorry for that.

814
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,400
Strong bones and muscles,

815
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
pointed ears,

816
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,560
and brisk hooves.

817
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,800
Could this be the famous Dayuan horse?

818
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,670
Good eye, Your Highness.

819
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,160
This is a Dayuan horse.

820
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,760
But this horse

821
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,960
has a strong temper,

822
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,740
we still can't tame it

823
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,290
even though it's been in the army
for half a month.

824
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,240
Could you let me try it?

825
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,550
Maybe I can help.

826
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,480
Your Highness, don't.

827
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,870
This horse is fierce and hard to tame.

828
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,280
If you get injured,

829
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,590
I can't bear the consequences.

830
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,440
Don't worry.

831
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,470
Your Highness.

832
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,430
Your Highness.

833
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,990
Come over.

834
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,280
Good boy.

835
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,190
(Fool.)

836
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,990
(You know everything,)

837
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,560
(so you don't need a companion.)

838
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,720
Zhao.

839
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,400
I usually stay in the imperial palace

840
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,870
and never tried horse riding.

841
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,150
Finally today you have some free time.

842
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,360
Would you teach me

843
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,870
how to ride a horse?

844
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,520
Okay.

845
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,870
That one then.

846
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,200
Please.

847
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,560
(Training arena.)

848
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,160
(Long spear formation.)

849
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,360
Who are you?

850
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,920
Dare to barge into the training arena?

851
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,030
I am Yi'an,

852
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,990
a servant from Prince Changle's Mansion.

853
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,070
I'm here to escort Her Highness
to meet General Zhao.

854
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,360
Mistakenly,

855
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,200
I lost the way.

856
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,190
Please lead the way for me.

857
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,080
Prince Changle's Mansion?

858
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,510
Princess Changsheng is here?

859
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,670
Not only Princess Changsheng,

860
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,160
Princess Guangde is here too.

861
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,150
I heard that they're

862
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,430
choosing a husband in the army.

863
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,270
A husband?

864
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,920
Judging by your appearance,

865
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,160
you must be a rare talent.

866
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,830
Why not go and try it?

867
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,720
If you lead the way for me,

868
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,990
I will also

869
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,190
return the favor.

870
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,400
You flatter me.

871
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,520
Actually, I am just a soldier.

872
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,000
This way, please.

873
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,110
Are they practicing

874
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,950
the spear formation?

875
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,510
You don't know this, do you?

876
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,590
We're practicing

877
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,560
a unique formation created by General Zhao.

878
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,320
People can take care of each other

879
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,550
and also attack together.

880
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,230
There are many subtle changes in the formation.

881
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,670
Impressive.

882
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,430
Princess.

883
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,800
If you step on

884
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,240
this pedal firmly,

885
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,830
the other foot kicks off the ground,

886
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,480
then you can jump on the horse's back.

887
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,310
Okay.

888
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,390
One foot step on it.

889
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,950
Zhao.

890
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,240
You are so far away from me.

891
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,430
What if I accidentally fall down?

892
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,000
I will get injured.

893
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,830
Then I'll hold the horse.

894
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:42,870
Princess.

895
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,040
Are you hurt?

896
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,070
I apologize.

897
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,600
I accidentally made you fall.

898
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,710
Let's continue practicing.

899
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,120
Get on the horse and give me a hand.

900
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,520
I...

901
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,600
All right.

902
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,640
Pull me up.

903
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,440
Well...

904
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,870
Princess.

905
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,270
Give me the reins.

906
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,560
Here.

907
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,640
Princess.

908
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,640
I...

909
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,240
I'm just protecting you.

910
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,600
I don't have any frivolous intention.

911
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
Have you eaten enough?

912
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,720
Let's go.

913
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,110
Princess, rest assured.

914
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,390
I will protect you well.

915
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,240
Zhao.

916
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,680
Let's go out for a walk.

917
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,520
Okay.

918
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,160
General.

919
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,510
In addition to

920
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,320
fishing and horse riding,

921
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,710
do you have any other hobbies?

922
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,120
Usually

923
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,680
I just practice martial arts and read books.

924
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,760
Reading?

925
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,840
Reading is good.

926
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,280
I also like reading books.

927
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,350
I'm currently learning how to write a book.

928
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,960
What books do you usually read?

929
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,990
I prefer to read

930
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,040
Sun Tzu's The Art of War.

931
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,350
Do you know that?

932
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,070
I've heard of Sun Tzu.

933
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,480
But Art of War?

934
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,790
It's enough that I understand you.

935
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,160
Princess.

936
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,560
I'm a rough man,

937
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,190
and don't know much

938
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,320
about love.

939
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,190
It's okay.

940
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,030
And it's not that you know nothing about it.

941
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,640
You just don't want to understand it now.

942
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,390
But that's okay.

943
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,120
I can wait for you.

944
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,840
As long as you want,

945
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,040
I can wait forever

946
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,800
until one day

947
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,510
you and I can be together

948
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,440
and enjoy a carefree life.

949
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,280
What do you say?

950
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,000
A carefree life.

951
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,920
Your Highness, you're discouraged?

952
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,200
Yi'an.

953
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,600
Are you married?

954
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,920
I'm alone.

955
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,750
Do you have someone you like?

956
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,520
Someone I like?

957
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:10,910
It's not in a hurry.

958
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,830
Didn't you say that

959
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,080
love is fated?

960
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,360
Guangde said

961
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,670
it's easiest to write

962
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,230
storybooks about love.

963
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,230
Innocence and intimacy

964
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,560
of childhood sweethearts,

965
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,440
finding each other congenial

966
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,520
and making solemn vows.

967
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,350
Your Highness.

968
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,360
If Princess Guangde said that,

969
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,560
maybe it makes some sense.

970
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,950
Look.

971
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,240
General Zhao

972
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,830
has been tamed by Guangde.

973
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,080
It seems so.

974
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,190
So you will choose to give up?

975
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,080
I won't.

976
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,430
Yi'an.

977
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,080
You will help me, right?

978
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,270
What are you doing?

979
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,040
I accepted it.

980
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,870
It's snowing.

981
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,440
(The world is troubled by love.)

982
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,030
(But it's the same)

983
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,080
(whether you get it or not.)

984
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,040
(Gains and losses)

985
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,390
(are all experiences in life.)
