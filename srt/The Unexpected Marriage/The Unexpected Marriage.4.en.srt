=Episode 4=

3
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,510
Help!

4
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,970
Let me go.

5
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,970
Let me go.

6
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,990
Where did this kid come from?

7
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,340
Dare to disturb me at my pleasure.

8
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,370
I am the commander of guards in Shangkang City.

9
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,180
You bunch of scoundrels

10
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,060
were bullying an innocent girl.

11
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,930
Today I will teach you a lesson.

12
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,230
Go, go, go.

13
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,420
Hurry up and go.

14
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,020
(Zhao Huaibi, General of Fuyu)

15
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,250
Miss, are you okay?

16
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,060
Let me help you up.

17
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,800
You scoundrel.

18
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,150
You look decent

19
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,250
but did such a barefaced thing.

20
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,060
- Miss...
- Don't try to get close to me.

21
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,530
Explain to the local government.

22
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,110
Changsheng, this man...

23
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,960
I know it's him.

24
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,060
Don't worry, he can't run away.

25
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,860
This man saved me.

26
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,830
Sorry, sorry.

27
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,670
Look at me.

28
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,950
Are you OK?

29
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,390
You just...

30
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,710
It's okay.

31
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,740
I've practiced martial arts.

32
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,430
He didn't take advantage of me.

33
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,390
You were really...

34
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,970
Really brave, right?

35
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,710
It doesn't matter.

36
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,140
Just stop arguing with me in the future.

37
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,340
You just went too far.

38
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,040
It's all your fault.

39
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,080
I didn't even ask his name

40
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,140
and where he lives.

41
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,180
How can I thank him?

42
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,140
You are so ungrateful.

43
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,200
Why don't you stay in the palace?

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,770
You ran away without a servant around.

45
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,490
Come back home with me first.

46
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,020
I'll ask someone to take you back later.

47
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,860
Today ended dismally.

48
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,040
I don't know what Wulang would think of me.

49
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,230
Your Highness.

50
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,060
There is no need to be discouraged.

51
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,490
Didn't you say

52
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,270
that love

53
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,180
is fated?

54
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,300
Love

55
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,010
is fated.

56
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,190
Let's go.

57
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,390
Young Master, what did you get

58
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,300
from Yang Wulang?

59
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,660
Something went wrong.

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,370
You never make mistakes.

61
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,660
I guess Yang Wulang

62
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,420
must have some abilities.

63
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,380
(Virtue and Morality)

64
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,780
My destined man.

65
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,250
He saw my puzzle.

66
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,860
Are you talking about Yang Wulang?

67
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,920
No.

68
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,980
It's Mr. Envoy.

69
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,620
My puzzle is that.

70
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,150
A veiled dream and a tree in blossom.

71
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,890
They come and go mostly in the white clouds.

72
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,190
The answer is

73
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,330
where to meet the destined person.

74
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,930
No wonder he told me

75
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,590
love is fated.

76
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,760
The puzzle is so obscure.

77
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,620
But Mr. Envoy still figured it out?

78
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,790
He's well-read

79
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,930
and scrupulous.

80
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,430
So

81
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,060
I have to avoid him even more.

82
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,580
(Self-discipline and Social Commitment)

83
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,220
(Looking for Heron)
Wulang.

84
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,100
I thought that after the Lantern Festival,

85
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,620
you won't come to me again.

86
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,030
How could it be?

87
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,880
Me and you

88
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,130
are good friends who share weal and woe.

89
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,180
Why don't I see Mr. Envoy?

90
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,200
He...

91
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,330
Maybe he's busy.

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,800
Well,

93
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,220
what happened at the Lantern Festival
was a misunderstanding.

94
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,100
Don't take it to heart.

95
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,060
I certainly won't take it to heart.

96
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,320
I wonder

97
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,780
what Mr. Envoy is busy with recently.

98
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,830
I wanted to invite him to have tea.

99
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,300
You came to have tea with him?

100
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
Yes.

101
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,460
Since he is busy,

102
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,020
I will take my leave.

103
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,620
I'll come another day.

104
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,820
Congratulations, Your Highness.

105
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,400
Yang Wulang is very attentive.

106
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,060
I guess he's interested in you.

107
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,500
I think you should congratulate the envoy.

108
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,180
Your Highness, Xiaoke is here.

109
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,420
Why are you here?

110
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,260
Your Highness.

111
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,020
Why did you steal my Xiaoke again?

112
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,860
You're the one who likes

113
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,140
to steal things.

114
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,940
Your Highness, how is it going

115
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,380
with Yang Wulang?

116
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,580
Why do you sigh?

117
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,700
I saw you were having a good chat.

118
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,140
I think

119
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,690
he's interested in someone else.

120
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,540
You are the someone else.

121
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,420
Your Highness,

122
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,340
you must be joking.

123
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,460
He and I are just friends.

124
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,540
You worry too much.

125
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,380
Worry too much?

126
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,740
I don't think so.

127
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,980
He visited frequently.

128
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,180
Seeing you're not here,

129
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,820
he won't stay for even a moment.

130
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,500
I guess Yang Wulang is cautious.

131
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,620
He's worried that
if he spends time with you alone

132
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,860
without my witness,

133
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,180
it'll affect your reputation.

134
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,300
Never mind.

135
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,140
Only white clouds still float in vain.

136
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,220
Since he has no intention,

137
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,300
I'll forget about him.

138
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,220
Your Highness, cheers.

139
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,740
If you don't believe me, just look at my leg.

140
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,780
That's her, right.

141
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,660
(Grandson of the Minister of Rites)

142
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,140
Your Highness.

143
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,020
Only Mr. Xiao is left

144
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,060
on Miss Jin's roster.

145
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,500
What should we do?

146
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,420
Is General Zhao Huaibi back?

147
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,100
He's guarding the border.

148
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,020
I'm afraid he won't be back for a while.

149
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,420
Why don't you ask His Royal Highness?

150
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,220
Never mind.

151
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,820
It's quite difficult to change the fate

152
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,740
by myself.

153
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,140
I can only let him give up.

154
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,020
Mr. Envoy?

155
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,780
Your Highness, you took me to...

156
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,820
To visit the grave.

157
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,740
To honor the dead.

158
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,020
Who is this deceased person?

159
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,140
I came in a hurry today,

160
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,260
- and couldn't bring...
- What nonsense are you talking about?

161
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,420
Let me introduce you.

162
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,260
There buries

163
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,140
the people who proposed to me.

164
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,260
Make a fake grave?

165
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,700
Won't it bring bad luck?

166
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,020
Your Highness, watch your actions.

167
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,020
It's a fake grave.

168
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,940
It won't bring any bad luck.

169
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,140
The envoy

170
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,860
is always trying to praise me

171
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,900
just to make me go
for the peace-making marriage.

172
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,100
I have to come up with a better plan

173
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,980
to totally scare him off.

174
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,580
I should let him know

175
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,250
that marrying me

176
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,700
is just bad luck.

177
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,660
Anyone gets close to me will get hurt.

178
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,940
Will he still

179
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,340
let me marry into Great Tang?

180
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,980
Where?

181
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,380
During the day,

182
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,220
they're resting now.

183
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,820
Come tonight and try your luck.

184
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,980
Maybe they can come out

185
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,020
and chat with you

186
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,860
while drinking.

187
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,660
Actually,

188
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,380
the rumor about me

189
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,820
is not all fake

190
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,820
and groundless.

191
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,540
Ever since little,

192
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,300
all the men who've been involved with me

193
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,140
would come to a very bad end.

194
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,500
Well said.

195
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,540
The words you used are accurate.

196
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,380
Unfortunately,

197
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,540
we don't believe it.

198
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,220
When Erlang left,

199
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,300
he was only fourteen years old.

200
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,780
I remember we often played
under the Muyan tree.

201
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,140
- Slow down.
- One day, he proposed to me.

202
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,300
Changsheng.

203
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,420
I like you.

204
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,300
Then what happened?

205
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,340
Then he fell asleep.

206
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,860
Forever.

207
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,740
Poor Erlang.

208
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,460
His mother and my mother are close friends.

209
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,740
They arranged our marriage when we were kids.

210
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,500
But he died

211
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,740
at such a young age.

212
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,620
What did he do wrong?

213
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,180
Why did God do this to him?

214
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,300
You mean

215
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,540
he did nothing wrong,

216
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,860
it's his mother's fault.

217
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,700
Now that you mention it,

218
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,220
I suddenly realized

219
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,420
I really never thought about it before.

220
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,580
This may really be

221
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,580
about the engagement.

222
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,660
It's been hard for you.

223
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,420
With your sympathy and understanding,

224
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,980
I feel much better.

225
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,580
Maybe this is fate.

226
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,580
I will bring your sympathy and understanding

227
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,180
to keep living alone

228
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,340
and courageously.

229
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,020
Prince Qin doesn't believe this.

230
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,980
It's just a kind reminder.

231
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,580
With so many cases,

232
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,400
(Tomb of beloved son Yang Mingyu)
you can't be unrepentant.

233
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,960
(Tomb of beloved son Lu Jinbao)
Take another look.

234
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,890
Where is it?

235
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,330
I remember

236
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,820
it's here.

237
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,740
This is it.

238
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,540
At first, he coveted my beauty,

239
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,260
and didn't believe the rumor.

240
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,740
Now the grass around his grace

241
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
has grown so high.

242
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,180
(63 years old)

243
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,500
You surely take what comes.

244
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,020
Even a 63-year-old man.

245
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,820
(Tomb of loving father Qin Haihui)

246
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,060
It's not that.

247
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,460
He wanted to set me up with his son.

248
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,940
Then he died for his son.

249
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,060
After that,

250
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,500
his son immediately called off the marriage.

251
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,500
Now...

252
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,300
Now he is an official in the court.

253
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,460
His career is taking off

254
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,460
and everything became smooth.

255
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,980
Right, right, that's it.

256
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,740
Why are you smiling?

257
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,140
It's like playing the lute to a cow.

258
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,860
Mr. Envoy

259
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,060
still didn't believe it?

260
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,580
He helped me

261
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,740
with my dates.

262
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,780
I thought he was easy to persuade.

263
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,580
Today I wanted to offer him a way out

264
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,820
and let him

265
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,660
cut me some slack,

266
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,460
but he didn't fall for the trick.

267
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,660
It seems this has become difficult.

268
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,660
Now the peace-making marriage is imminent.

269
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,220
Mr. Envoy refused to give in.

270
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,460
Mr. Xiao spread rumors
and cut off your chance of going on dates.

271
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,340
Can we just sit here and wait?

272
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,940
Yeah.

273
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,740
I forgot about that stupid Xiao Zilv.

274
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,020
If he hadn't been interfering,

275
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,420
I'd have been married a long time ago.

276
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,100
It seems that
to escape the peace-making marriage,

277
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
I need to eliminate the internal trouble first.

278
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,140
Some days ago,

279
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,180
didn't a servant come to report

280
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,700
that a hunter dug pits without permission

281
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,980
in Muyan Forest

282
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,820
to catch wild animals?

283
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,540
Find a safe and deep pit

284
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,020
and then lure him over.

285
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,860
I want to give Xiao Zilv

286
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,580
a lesson.

287
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,220
Sir.

288
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,300
I just got the news

289
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,900
that General Zhao returned
to report on his work.

290
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,340
His Majesty asked him to be in charge
of the security around Muyan Forest.

291
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,620
Does Her Highness know about this?

292
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,260
The decree was issued today.

293
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,810
She probably doesn't know yet.

294
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,660
Young Master,
Her Highness just prepared a carriage

295
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,220
and is ready to leave the mansion
late at night.

296
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,740
I heard that she's going to the Muyan Forest.

297
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,980
You guys pretend to be thugs

298
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,300
and put me and Her Highness in danger

299
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,500
to make Zhao Huaibi come to save us.

300
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,660
This opportunity

301
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,100
can help me visit him later.

302
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,940
Okay.

303
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,980
Okay.

304
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,580
Let's go.

305
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,900
Another job to do.

306
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,020
Your Highness, after careful thought,

307
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,340
I still think it's inappropriate for you
to go to Muyan Forest alone.

308
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,500
Please be careful.

309
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,180
Don't worry.

310
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,100
I know what I'm doing.

311
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,540
You guys follow the plan.

312
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,380
But...

313
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,740
By the way,

314
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,820
don't let my dad know

315
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,060
about this thing.

316
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,340
Understand?

317
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,780
Your Highness.

318
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,420
But tomorrow is your birthday.

319
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,220
His Royal Highness has given instructions.

320
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,220
Don't worry.

321
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,900
I'll be back in less than two hours.

322
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,740
All right.

323
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,900
Your Highness.

324
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,740
Mr. Envoy.

325
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,340
We've known each other for a long time.

326
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,460
Why be so distant?

327
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,820
Just call me Yi'an.

328
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,300
Oh, well.

329
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,340
Where are you going

330
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,540
late at night?

331
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,780
I can't sleep.

332
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,900
Just going out for a walk.

333
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,860
How about we

334
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,340
take a walk together?

335
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,860
I'm afraid it's not convenient.

336
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,660
Don't be afraid of what others say.

337
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,780
I'm not afraid of what others say,

338
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,860
but what others think.

339
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,020
I'm afraid that in the future,

340
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,060
there will be disturbance.

341
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,220
Even if there is disturbance,

342
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,620
I will face it with you.

343
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,580
Let's go.

344
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,780
Don't be a moth to the flame.

345
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,340
Your Highness is as gentle as water.

346
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,940
I just want to be a boy jumping into the water.

347
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,180
Let's go.

348
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,100
(Xiao's Mansion)

349
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,820
Miss Jinyan.

350
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,060
Our young master is not here today.

351
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,660
Not here?

352
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,860
Today His Majesty summoned him.

353
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,900
Young Master went to the palace

354
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,740
two hours ago.

355
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,060
This is bad.

356
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,260
Why haven't they come yet?

357
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,100
You're waiting for someone?

358
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,660
Thank you.

359
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,900
In fact, today

360
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,820
I just wanted to...

361
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,220
Wait for ghosts?

362
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,700
- Wait for ghosts?
- During the day,

363
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,300
you showed me the graves.

364
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,380
You are a smart person.

365
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,220
I won't hide it from you.

366
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,220
I'm waiting for Xiao Zilv.

367
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,980
This guy keeps going against me.

368
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,140
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

369
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,420
Changsheng.

370
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,620
Don't move.

371
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,620
Okay, stop acting.

372
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,660
Where did this young lady come from?

373
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,020
So pretty.

374
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,620
Why not go up the mountain with me

375
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,980
and be my wife?

376
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,820
You lechers.

377
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,660
Don't act wild.

378
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,020
Go get them.

379
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,140
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

380
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,020
Her Highness

381
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,340
is so awesome!

382
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,180
Impressive.

383
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,300
Yes.

384
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,860
Don't be afraid.

385
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,780
Get them.

386
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,740
Check if Young Master is injured.

387
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,860
Hold onto it.

388
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,780
- Is it dangerous?
- You hold on.

389
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,620
I can't make it.

390
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,820
Don't get distracted.

391
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,980
- Move up a little.
- Hold on a little longer.

392
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,620
I can't come up.

393
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,100
What kind of words are these?

394
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,540
- Hold on a little longer.
- So embarrassed.

395
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,820
- Let's not look.
- Almost done.

396
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,820
What are you doing? You scared me.

397
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,420
Should we go to lure Zhao Huaibi out?

398
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
You should inform me.

399
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,660
Let's go quickly.

400
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,820
Let's go, go.

401
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,660
Go, go, go.

402
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,860
Hold onto it.

403
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,860
Hold on a little longer.

404
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,940
I...

405
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,740
Are you OK?

406
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,220
Did you get hurt?

407
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,300
It's okay, just a minor injury.

408
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,940
It's my fault.

409
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,210
I've caused you trouble.

410
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,120
I insisted on going with you.

411
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,580
What's it got to do with you?

412
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,540
This is the safe pit

413
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,500
that they found?

414
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,300
There is no one around here.

415
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,900
Right,

416
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,580
didn't you practice martial arts?

417
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,540
Just like you took me flying

418
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,740
last time at the Lantern Festival.

419
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,260
It shouldn't be difficult.

420
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,260
I'm afraid I sprained my ankle.

421
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,660
We're doomed.

422
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,940
I really can't do bad things.

423
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,100
Harming others will eventually harm yourself.

424
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,660
It's so cold now.

425
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,700
And your leg is injured.

426
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,260
You should wear it yourself.

427
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,420
It's fine.

428
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,260
I'm not cold.

429
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,220
(I wonder)

430
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,660
(if they can lure Zhao Huaibi over.)

431
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,260
Young Master.

432
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,740
Please remember to bring your flares

433
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,140
in case plans change.

434
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,260
(Now Changsheng is...)

435
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,300
(But if I ask Youmou to save us,)

436
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,820
(I will lose this opportunity
to get close to Zhao Huaibi.)

437
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,140
If this continues,

438
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,060
we'll freeze to death.

439
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,060
My birthday

440
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,900
will be my death anniversary.

441
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,500
Today is your birthday?

442
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,740
It's tomorrow.

443
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,820
Why I didn't see anyone prepare for it?

444
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,500
Your parents usually love you very much.

445
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,200
They should've prepared it ahead of time.

446
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,020
Dad and Mom treat me very well.

447
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,660
It's just that the year I became an adult,

448
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,900
Dad and His Majesty

449
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,500
prepared for me

450
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,980
the grandest fireworks display

451
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,540
in Shangkang.

452
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,550
I still remember it.

453
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,540
Fireworks that night

454
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,340
looked like a silver waterfall.

455
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,460
Since you like fireworks so much,

456
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,300
I think you will watch it
on your every birthday.

457
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,820
Why that year is the most unforgettable?

458
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,620
Because at the fireworks display that year,

459
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,780
the most serious stampede

460
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,340
happened in Shangkang.

461
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,220
From then on,

462
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,540
I haven't let my dad set off fireworks.

463
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,140
I must get out.

464
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,500
I can't die.

465
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,820
Don't sleep, Changsheng.

466
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,420
Hold on a little longer.

467
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
It's been a long time.

468
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,580
Will someone come to save us?

469
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,100
Don't worry, someone will come to save us.

470
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,780
I said

471
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,980
anyone who gets close to me

472
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,500
will not end well.

473
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,180
You forgot

474
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,100
what Sheng Tiangang said
at the Lantern Festival?

475
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,820
How can I believe

476
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,140
his words?

477
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,300
Do you believe me?

478
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,460
Someone will come to rescue us.

479
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,060
Yi'an.

480
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,620
I can not make it.

481
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,860
Sorry

482
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,980
for causing you trouble.

483
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,660
Changsheng.

484
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,660
Hold on a little longer.

485
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
So many logs.

486
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,340
We can't kill Zhao Huaibi.

487
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,380
Why don't you wait for him to pass by
and then hit him?

488
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,060
We use logs

489
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,180
to attract Zhao Huaibi's attention

490
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,380
and lead him to the Muyan Forest.

491
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,900
Why should we kill him?

492
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,020
He's coming.

493
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,500
After waiting for four hours, he finally came.

494
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,700
I don't know how Young Master's doing.

495
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,020
Let's push?

496
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,860
Wait.

497
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,900
Squat down.

498
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,220
Three, two, one, push.

499
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,380
Go, go, go, go.

500
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,540
Go to the mountain and have a look.

501
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,900
(Why haven't they come yet?)

502
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,380
(If we keep waiting here,)

503
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,500
(I'm afraid that Changsheng won't make it.)

504
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,780
(I should save Changsheng first.)

505
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,460
General, it's a flare.

506
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,740
- Go check it out.
- Yes.

507
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,740
Come back.

508
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,260
The Muyan Forest is ahead.

509
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,740
It is the lifeline of Fuyu.

510
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,020
You have to be very alert.

511
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,140
- Go now.
- Yes, General.

512
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,260
Everyone, check carefully.

513
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,100
Yes.

514
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,660
General Zhao, there is a collapsed hole here.

515
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,100
Get a rope and let me down.

516
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,700
- (Zhao Huaibi arrived first.)
- Yes.

517
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,340
Changsheng.

518
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,060
Changsheng, wake up.

519
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,060
Someone came to rescue us.

520
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,020
General Zhao, the rope has been tied.

521
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,860
You can go down now.

522
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,660
I'm going down. Changyan.

523
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,220
- Tighten the rope.
- Yes.

524
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,500
(Isn't this the person
who saved Guangde last time?)

525
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,540
(It's her.)

526
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,500
Don't try to get close to me.

527
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,900
Explain to the government.

528
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,100
It was him who saved me.

529
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,220
Are you all right?

530
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,900
Send her up first.

531
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,060
I can go up by pulling the rope.

532
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,460
Sorry for offending you.

533
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,060
Changyan, pull the rope.

534
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,860
Thank you.

535
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,900
Warm yourself up with some strong liquor.

536
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,060
(Were they the ones who set off the flares?)

537
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,340
Thank you

538
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,940
for saving our lives.

539
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,180
Changsheng?

540
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,100
You are Princess Changle,

541
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,860
Liu Changsheng?

542
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,580
It's me.

543
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,020
You are...

544
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,380
Your Highness, this is General Zhao,

545
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,220
Zhao Huaibi.

546
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,860
General Zhao.

547
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,740
(It turns out that he is Zhao Huaibi.)

548
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,460
General Zhao's seventh son, Zhao Huaibi.

549
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,020
Although his mother is a concubine,

550
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,580
he's gifted

551
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,500
and has both civil and military skills.

552
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,260
He's appreciated by His Majesty.

553
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,540
It seems we really are destined.

554
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,540
I deeply appreciate

555
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,620
this big favor.

556
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,940
But I don't know

557
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,460
how to repay your kindness.

558
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,300
No need.

559
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,260
Just don't do what you did last time.

560
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,940
Last time

561
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,700
it was a misunderstanding.

562
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,060
General, where is your residence?

563
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,940
Next time, I will definitely go to thank you.

564
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,700
No need to bother.

565
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,420
By the way, do you need me to send someone

566
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,860
to escort you two back home?

567
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,300
No need to trouble, General Zhao.

568
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,980
I will send Her Highness back.

569
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,500
Thank you for the rescue.

570
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,140
I will come to thank you in the future.

571
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,140
(This Princess Changsheng
behaves inappropriately,)

572
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,740
(being with a man in the wilderness)

573
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,100
(late at night.)

574
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,060
(I should stay away from her.)

575
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,940
(This general)

576
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,820
(saved people in distress)

577
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,060
(many times.)

578
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,620
(He should be a benevolent gentleman.)

579
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,660
(He is also very handsome.)

580
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,220
(Everything about him is the best.)

581
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,500
(He is really the best choice for marriage.)

582
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,340
Your Highness, let's go.

583
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,860
This Muyan Forest is so big.

584
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,060
I didn't find them.

585
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,300
Where did they go so late at night?

586
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,300
Your Highness, next time
you go out at midnight,

587
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,260
please tell me in advance

588
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,780
so I won't spoil your pleasure.

589
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,340
What are you talking about?

590
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,060
Your Highness is still as powerful as before.

591
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,620
Even the envoy injured his leg too.

592
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,900
You...

593
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,100
Xiao Zilv.

594
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,860
I don't have the energy
to argue with you today.

595
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,820
Mr. Envoy.

596
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,340
I wonder if Prince Qin

597
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,860
has had a candidate in mind.

598
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,380
Prince Qin has always been mysterious.

599
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,060
I actually don't know.

600
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,620
In this case, I will take my leave first.

601
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,620
Your Highness.

602
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,780
Your Highness, look!

603
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,260
Fireworks.

604
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,340
Who's setting off

605
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,940
fireworks at this hour?

606
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,380
(Since you like fireworks so much,)

607
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,390
(I think you will watch it
on your every birthday.)

608
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,660
So beautiful.

609
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,140
Here, Young Master.

610
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,220
Thanks.
