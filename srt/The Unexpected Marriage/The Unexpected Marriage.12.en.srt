00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,660
=Episode 12=

3
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,620
Let go.

4
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,380
Stand up and take a look.

5
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,520
You scared me.

6
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,780
It's so shallow.

7
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,340
What were you doing?

8
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,980
Our body is given by our parents.

9
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,100
How can you destroy it at will?

10
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,100
If you don't want to live anymore,
don't drag others to die with you.

11
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,340
When did I drag you?

12
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,140
Do you know that if you commit suicide,
you will go to hell

13
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,140
and suffer endlessly?

14
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,460
If the water was a little deeper,

15
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,460
we'd have met in the underworld.

16
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,020
I...

17
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,460
- This...
- In the blink of an eye,

18
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,780
what happened?

19
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,020
Go back and think about it carefully.

20
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,220
Don't try to kill yourself again.

21
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,340
Changsheng.

22
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,860
Do you like these flowers?

23
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,660
Orchids are found everywhere in Fuyu.

24
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,420
But in Great Tang,

25
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,300
they become the precious Fuirena.

26
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,900
I can't afford it.

27
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,300
Changsheng.

28
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,020
I asked the cook to make you
squirrel-shaped mandarin fish.

29
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,500
I'll send it to you in the evening.

30
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Let's dine together.

31
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

32
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,500
I'm not hungry yet,
so I'll go back to the room.

33
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,460
Book...

34
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,140
Your Highness, is there anything else?

35
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,820
The welcome dinner will be held tomorrow.

36
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,740
In previous years,
people would ask the organizer

37
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,580
to perform before the Emperor.

38
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,100
You're new here.

39
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,500
There must be someone with bad intentions.

40
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,380
If you don't want to,

41
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,820
just refuse without hesitation.

42
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,540
I'll handle the rest.

43
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,140
Perform before the Emperor?

44
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,340
This kind of thing doesn't bother me.

45
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,860
It seems that you're well prepared.

46
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,180
I won't tell you.

47
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,500
Besides,

48
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,900
I'm going to start practicing now.

49
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,140
Please go back.

50
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,460
All right.

51
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,540
(Fine Spirits of the Universe)

52
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,620
He called the small pond a lake.

53
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,300
Please forgive me, Princess Royal.

54
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,820
It's fine.

55
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,660
Leave me first.

56
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,020
Yes.

57
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,700
Put it there.

58
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,900
Princess Royal.

59
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,780
Drink the ginger soup while it's hot.

60
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,140
Did you suddenly think of something?

61
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,580
Go check

62
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,900
who was the man in the palace today.

63
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,340
Yes.

64
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,700
After checking,

65
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,900
will he be severely punished?

66
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,380
Just check it first.

67
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,460
(Huadeng Pavilion)

68
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,620
Jinyan, come here.

69
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,660
Let me tell you.

70
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,780
Help me prepare.

71
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,020
Understand?

72
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,260
Your Highness.

73
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,540
What do you want these for?

74
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,940
His Highness had told me
before coming to Great Tang

75
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,140
that we should proceed with caution.

76
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,260
I have my own reason

77
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,180
for doing this.

78
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,180
You, Youyong and Youmou,

79
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
go help me get prepared.

80
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,020
- Yes.
- Yes.

81
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,860
Okay, go quickly.

82
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,820
Remember to tell Youyong and Youmou

83
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,940
to be smart.

84
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
Don't be noticed.

85
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,700
(Longevity Hall)

86
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,580
(Peace in All the World)

87
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,220
Changsheng.

88
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,980
The one above is Consort De.

89
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,380
She's the head of the harem now

90
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,220
and also the biological mother
of Prince Lv Hou.

91
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,660
That person is Prince Lv Hou,

92
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,020
also known as Prince Song.

93
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,620
Liu Yiyi, Princess Consort Song,

94
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,180
is the eldest daughter of Minister Liu
of the Ministry of Revenue

95
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,900
and also the granddaughter
of the Marquis of the West.

96
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,620
Her strength can't be underestimated.

97
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,420
That's my fifth brother Lv Ke.

98
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,340
How to say that?

99
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,620
He's also a huge deal.

100
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,180
You will know later.

101
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,260
His wife is called Chu Ge,

102
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,140
daughter of the concubine of Minister Chu
of the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

103
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,540
Changsheng.

104
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,340
Yi'an.

105
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,860
It's him.

106
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,940
Changsheng, stop looking.
The banquet will begin.

107
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,580
Your country has so many rules.

108
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,780
The Emperor is here.

109
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,380
Father.

110
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,420
Sit down.

111
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,860
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thanks, Father.

112
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,700
Start the banquet.

113
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,620
This barbarian princess

114
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,740
can't even sit properly.

115
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,540
Look, Prince Qin even serves her food.

116
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,260
Although Her Highness is not well-mannered,

117
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,020
she's really beautiful.

118
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,860
Among all the people present,

119
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,020
no other lady can outshine her.

120
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,620
That's because Princess Royal didn't come.

121
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,380
This barbarian

122
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,700
is no match for

123
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,100
Princess Royal's elegance.

124
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,940
In terms of nobility,

125
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,980
she can't compare to Princess Royal.

126
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,860
In terns of talent and knowledge,

127
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,100
she's not as good as Miss Rujing.

128
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,500
Only her face is worth mentioning.

129
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,700
I don't know when Miss Rujing will come back.

130
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
After all, she grew up with Prince Qin.

131
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,860
- They're childhood sweethearts.
- Xiao Zilv.

132
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,580
We really should take
Princess Changsheng down a peg.

133
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,580
Father, I toast you.

134
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,780
I have heard that women in Fuyu

135
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,340
are not inferior to Great Tang's.

136
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,580
The men are martial

137
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,660
and the women are good at dancing.

138
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,900
Your Highness is a girl in a million.

139
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,500
You must be excellent too.

140
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,020
Why don't you

141
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,300
dance for us

142
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,780
and let Father

143
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,980
appreciate your charm?

144
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,100
Very well.

145
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,620
Would you show me

146
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,580
the graceful dance of Fuyu?

147
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,060
Father.

148
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,180
Today is Changsheng's welcome banquet.

149
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,140
Changsheng is the Princess of Fuyu

150
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,420
and my unmarried wife.

151
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,100
This seems

152
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,500
not appropriate.

153
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,180
My Great Tang

154
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,340
is worshipped by all countries.

155
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,500
What?

156
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,300
You don't want to?

157
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,140
Do you feel contempt

158
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,580
for Great Tang?

159
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,780
Princess Changsheng traveled
a long way to Great Tang

160
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,300
just to make an alliance through marriage.

161
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,340
Some narrow-minded people

162
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,540
deliberately make things difficult for her,

163
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,660
and even elevated this unspeakable rivalry

164
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,980
to such a major deal.

165
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,540
You must be scheming

166
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,900
to drive a wedge

167
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,220
between Great Tang and Fuyu.

168
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,140
Well...

169
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,460
Your Majesty.

170
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,100
Our peace-making marriage

171
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,700
received congratulations
from all over the world.

172
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,940
Since the marriage has been decided,

173
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,220
there is no distinction between host and guest,

174
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
only the etiquette between
monarch and subject.

175
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,820
I'm willing

176
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
to present a dance for you

177
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,300
as an entertainment.

178
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,860
Good, good.

179
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,020
Aren't those war drums?

180
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,340
Who knows what she's thinking?

181
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,540
Trivial skills.

182
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,540
Good.

183
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,620
Careful.

184
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,220
The six peony paintings at the back

185
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,180
are dedicated to Your Majesty.

186
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,500
May Great Tang

187
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,020
prosper forever

188
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,620
and maintain good relations

189
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,900
with Fuyu.

190
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,340
May Your Majesty

191
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,420
live a long life.

192
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,420
Good, good.

193
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,500
Reward Princess Changsheng

194
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,940
with a pair of golden hairpins,

195
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,220
100 ounces of gold,

196
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,100
100 pieces of colorful

197
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,140
gold silk cotton cloth.

198
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,660
Take a seat.

199
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,140
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thanks, Father.

200
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,260
Come on.

201
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,180
Let's toast to Changsheng.

202
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,340
Your Majesty.

203
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,100
I have seen many beauties over the years.

204
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,260
But Princess Changsheng

205
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,020
is good-looking in an unconventional way.

206
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,340
Prince Qin is also brave and battlewise.

207
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,860
Now it seems

208
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,500
they're a match

209
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,500
made in heaven.

210
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,780
Yes.

211
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,180
Princess Changsheng is both outstanding

212
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,300
and pretty.

213
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,980
She also has an intelligent heart.

214
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,860
We really feel ashamed of ourselves.

215
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,460
Fuyu has a lot of good singers and dancers.

216
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,300
It's normal that

217
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,580
their princess can dance.

218
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,220
I know that I'm not well-informed.

219
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,100
The drum

220
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,260
is always used on the battlefield.

221
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,620
I've never seen

222
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,140
a drum dance before.

223
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,420
Father.

224
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,540
I think

225
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,140
there is something wrong with the drum dance.

226
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,860
What's wrong?

227
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,780
Princess Changsheng,

228
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,820
were those

229
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,340
war drums that you used?

230
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,140
All the generals know

231
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,860
the sound of the drums means to charge.

232
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,980
Now the world is peaceful.

233
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,860
I wonder if she's referring to something.

234
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,940
Father, calm down.

235
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,180
Princess Changsheng

236
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,300
didn't do it on purpose.

237
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,540
She is a woman

238
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,980
and never been on the battlefield.

239
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,460
How could she know

240
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,780
every time the drum is beaten,

241
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,180
people would die?

242
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,580
She won't even know

243
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,740
that the very first drumming cheers them up,

244
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,940
the second weakens them,

245
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,180
while the third absolutely devitalizes them.

246
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,300
Well said,

247
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,820
steering clear of the crucial point.

248
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,980
Just now Princess Changsheng
danced with the six drums,

249
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,380
which means peace

250
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,500
will last forever in Great Tang.

251
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,380
Changsheng.

252
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,980
What do you say?

253
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,780
It is said that Great Tang is prosperous

254
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,740
and tolerant to diversity.

255
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,020
I'm sure you understand

256
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,700
the purpose of my dance

257
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
is to remember the past

258
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,220
and bless the future.

259
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,420
What does this mean?

260
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,500
It's been many years

261
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,260
that the two armies fight against each other

262
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,540
and the people suffer from war.

263
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,660
Your Majesty is wise

264
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,580
and advocates for peace.

265
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,140
This follows the laws of nature

266
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,780
and complies with public opinion.

267
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,460
I appreciate Your Majesty's broad-mindedness,

268
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,060
so I presented this dance

269
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,460
to commemorate

270
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,180
the soldiers who died in war

271
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,980
and the displaced people.

272
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,380
It is also a blessing

273
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,820
of peace and prosperity

274
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,180
under Your Majesty's rule.

275
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,180
May the country prosper

276
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,300
and enjoys peace

277
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,340
and quiet.

278
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,380
May the people of our two countries

279
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,460
be friendly with each other

280
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,580
and live in harmony.

281
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,180
I

282
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,020
wish to guard Great Tang

283
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,060
and make sure

284
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,300
we live in peace and prosperity

285
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,340
like Changsheng

286
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,860
and you wish for.

287
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,460
Well said.

288
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,340
- I like Changsheng's drum dance...
- Princess.

289
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,500
- The man at the harem yesterday
- ...very much.

290
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,500
- is the envoy that Fuyu sent,
- You deserve rewards.

291
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,860
Mr. Xiao Zilv.

292
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,260
In Fuyu,

293
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,180
he's known as the walking medical book.

294
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,740
This time he came here specifically to learn

295
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,220
Great Tang's medical skills.

296
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,100
He is the envoy of Fuyu.

297
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,020
Princess Royal.

298
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,980
Aren't we going to the banquet?

299
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,340
I have seen everything I should see.

300
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,700
It's just some false pretenses.

301
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,460
Nothing interesting.

302
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,020
Let's go back.

303
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,100
The weather has turned cold again.

304
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,140
This time,

305
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,700
you have to take good care.

306
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,540
Don't jump into the lake

307
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,700
like you did last time.

308
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,020
It's a small pond.

309
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,020
Yes, yes.

310
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,820
You can't just jump into the small pond.

311
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,980
You still cough a lot.

312
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,380
It's the beginning of spring.

313
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,100
We should go to the Imperial Academy
of Medicine for prescriptions.

314
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,540
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

315
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,980
Your Highness.

316
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,100
I have

317
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,740
sent someone to inspect it carefully.

318
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,460
It's just that

319
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,740
the banquet was crowded with people,

320
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,300
and we couldn't find conclusive evidence.

321
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,140
Forget it.

322
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,980
From the direction the marble came,

323
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,380
we can also tell who it is.

324
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,420
Why do we need evidence

325
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,340
to punish them?

326
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,930
Yes.

327
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,820
Pass my order.

328
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,180
Send more people

329
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,180
to make sure Her Highness's safety.

330
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,020
Okay.

331
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,940
Your Highness.

332
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,380
This is the military report from the barracks.

333
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,540
(Waiting for you to lead the soldiers
to the battlefield and destroy Fuyu)

334
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,780
The soldiers are in high spirits,

335
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,380
waiting to go out to battle with you.

336
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,940
The time is not yet ripe.

337
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,940
It can wait.

338
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,860
The soldiers have almost recovered.

339
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,060
Just wait for you to give the order.

340
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,340
The situation is unstable now.

341
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,940
Tall trees catch much wind.

342
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,900
If we rashly send troops to attack Fuyu,

343
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,860
with external problems,

344
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,220
there'll be more trouble.

345
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,780
Your Highness, Mr. Xiao has arrived.

346
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,180
I know.

347
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,420
Why did you come?

348
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,180
Don't stand. Please sit down.

349
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,700
Should I address you

350
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,980
as Prince Qin?

351
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,620
You've come a long way

352
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,700
to Great Tang.

353
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,140
You must think us very disorganized.

354
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,020
Youyong, get some tea.

355
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,300
No need.

356
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,900
What do you want

357
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,740
to see me about?

358
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,700
I have to ask you, Your Highness.

359
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,500
Why did you hide your identity from Changsheng?

360
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,380
What is your intention?

361
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,500
Mr. Xiao.

362
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,060
In what position

363
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,940
are you questioning me?

364
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,020
I am the envoy of Fuyu,

365
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,580
and Changsheng's friend.

366
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,700
It's only natural for me to care about her.

367
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,020
Me and Changsheng

368
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,500
have not gotten married yet,

369
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
but Changsheng

370
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,980
will be my

371
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,300
legitimate wife.

372
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,460
She's Princess Consort Qin

373
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,180
of Great Tang.

374
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,580
Mr. Xiao.

375
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,140
Why do you think

376
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,700
I will harm my wife?

377
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,060
Then why didn't you tell Changsheng

378
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,980
your real identity?

379
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,340
We'll spend the rest of our lives together.

380
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,660
Since Changsheng no longer minds this,

381
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,580
there is no need for you to worry.

382
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,860
Mr. Xiao.

383
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,420
I would like to mention one more thing.

384
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,100
If you miss someone, you miss them forever.

385
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,300
Even if you follow her to Great Tang,

386
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,940
it doesn't help.

387
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,740
Better to let go.

388
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,140
(Prince Qin's Mansion)

389
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,580
Your Highness, sorry for the wait.

390
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,420
Your Highness.

391
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,500
Didn't I tell you?

392
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,740
You can be yourself in here.

393
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,300
Don't be bound by these etiquettes.

394
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,220
Your Highness.

395
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,380
Did you find

396
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,860
who threw the marble?

397
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,100
I have already found some clues.

398
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,660
You don't have to

399
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,740
worry about this.

400
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,500
I will definitely help you get justice.

401
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,020
Thanks.

402
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,540
Then

403
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,740
I'll leave first.

404
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,700
Changsheng.

405
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,140
Let's dine together

406
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,420
tonight.

407
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,420
Maybe tonight...

408
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,260
I'll be waiting for you.

409
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,420
These are Fuyu's dishes.

410
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,900
Previously in Prince Changle's Mansion,

411
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,380
I learned to cook a few dishes.

412
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,860
You should try it

413
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,660
and see if it suits your taste.

414
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,620
You made them?

415
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,900
(They don't taste bad.)

416
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,660
The taste is not bad, right?

417
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,180
You are sincere.

418
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,260
Try this dish, "Regret".

419
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,020
That's not the name of this dish.

420
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,420
It is not called this in Fuyu,

421
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,340
but the name changed

422
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,780
in Great Tang.

423
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,340
That way,

424
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,020
call it "Forgiveness".

425
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,340
Even so,

426
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,180
we still have to make some rules.

427
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,700
What rules?

428
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,540
Tell me.

429
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,620
Don't deceive me.

430
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,740
Don't distrust me.

431
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,060
Don't make things difficult for me.

432
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,540
Understand?

433
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,580
Understood.

434
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,260
Whatever you say.

435
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,180
But

436
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,220
I also have a small request.

437
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,060
Sure.

438
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,220
It depends on my mood whether I agree.

439
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
Like you said,

440
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,220
you and I are a couple,

441
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,420
so we should be the strongest ally.

442
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,260
Since I chose you,

443
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,980
I've shown my back to you.

444
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,700
I'm not afraid of you
making things difficult for me,

445
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
or deceive me,

446
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,020
I'm only afraid that you don't trust me.

447
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,780
I hope

448
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,260
you can treat me as

449
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,460
someone you can rely on.

450
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,420
Okay.

451
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,420
I promise you.

452
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,500
Again.

Prince Qin.

456
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,340
Did you get burnt while cooking?

457
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,180
Never mind.

458
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,020
You deserve it.

459
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,980
You lied to me after all.

460
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,220
I'll let you freeze here for one night

461
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,500
as a punishment.

462
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,300
No way.

463
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,940
She just left like that.

464
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,820
Although I promised to ally with you,

465
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,980
I still haven't forgiven you.

466
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,780
I help apply medicine to you

467
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,900
because

468
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,940
you cooked for me.

469
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,060
But don't think

470
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,260
I can forgive you so easily.

471
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,420

00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,060
(Cypress and Plum Blossoms)

571
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,260
Your Highness.

572
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,900
I heard from Youyong

573
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,620
that you slept
in Prince Qin's bedroom last night.

574
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,620
I didn't.

575
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,980
I just stayed there a little longer.

576
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,780
It was an accident.

577
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,860
Accident?

578
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,420
You haven't gotten married yet.

579
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,180
Why is Prince Qin disregarding the rules?

580
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,380
No, no.

581
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,940
There's no accident.

582
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,500
So that's not an accident.

583
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,620
No.

584
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,380
Don't ask anymore.

585
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,340
Nothing happened between us.

586
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,900
Prepare the pen and ink.

587
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,140
What do you want them for?

588
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,060
Copy the Meditation Mantra.

589
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,340
(Huadeng Pavilion)
Jinyan.

590
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,420
Give me the copybook we brought from Fuyu.

591
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,260
Okay.

592
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,780
You've been copying scriptures for two days.

593
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,180
Still haven't calmed down yet?

594
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,020
(Travel Far Away)

595
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,500
Even though the grass withers,

596
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,260
the fallen flowers will meet again elsewhere.

597
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,540
After parting ways with old friends,

598
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,340
I only wish for you to know me.

599
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,260
I only wish for you to know me.

600
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,260
Even though the grass withers,

601
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,860
I only wish for you to know me.

602
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,420
This means Yi'an is Prince Qin.

603
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,500
Liar.

604
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,940
Jinyan.

605
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,420
Have you heard

606
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,020
the phrase "seeing things
reminds people of someone"?

607
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
I have heard,

608
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,500
but I haven't seen it.

609
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,900
But

610
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,460
now I see it.

611
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,420
What nonsense are you talking about?

612
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,060
I just wrote something, what's wrong?

613
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,020
Yes, yes.

614
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,180
You're just

615
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,820
writing Prince Qin's poem

616
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,460
and thinking about Prince Qin.

617
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,660
If you ask me,

618
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,180
just go see him if you want to.

619
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,820
It's not like you are

620
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,780
thousands of miles away.

621
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,020
He's just next door.

622
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,900
Who wants to see him?

623
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,060
The last person I want to see

624
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,900
is him.

625
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,220
Yes, yes.

626
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,300
Look at Her Highness.

627
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,340
She's getting anxious.

628
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,140
Your Highness.

629
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,540
Are you looking for someone?

630
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,100
No.

631
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,500
Are you looking for Prince Qin?

632
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,300
I'm not.

633
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,980
I heard Youyong say

634
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,860
His Highness is very busy recently.

635
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,740
When he returns home,
he's always in the study to discuss work.

636
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,820
I've been copying scriptures lately,
and my limbs are sore.

637
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,980
I'll go there for a walk.

638
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,980
Your Highness, don't go far.

639
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,140
It's a gloomy day.

640
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,340
I'm afraid it's going to rain.

641
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,980
Princess Consort.

642
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,220
I'm not that yet.

643
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,700
Whatever.

644
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,420
Your Highness, what are you looking at?

645
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,300
You're alone?

646
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,300
Where's Youmou?

647
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,060
He went to the training camp
to watch the new recruits.

648
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,740
You want to see him?

649
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,820
I can give him the message.

650
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,020
It's okay.

651
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,780
I'm just asking.

652
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,860
This tree is growing well.

653
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,380
Well,

654
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,260
where is Prince Qin?

655
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,820
I want to ask him

656
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,220
what kind of tree is this.

657
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,540
It looks pretty good.

658
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,380
His Highness went to the palace
and hasn't returned yet.

659
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,500
I'll ask him for you when he comes back.

660
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,020
No need.

661
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,340
I'll ask him

662
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,500
next time I see him.

663
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,420
Your Highness, don't open the window.

664
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,380
It's raining so hard tonight.

665
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,020
This is the first time I've seen rain

666
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,140
since I came to Luojing.

667
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,700
Oh no.

668
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,580
- What's wrong?
- Muyan trees.

669
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,220
I never thought it would rain.

670
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,580
We didn't use protection.

671
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,420
Now the Muyan trees

672
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,740
will die from flooding.

673
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,900
I should have thought of it earlier.

674
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,220
(Huadeng Pavilion)
Your Highness.

675
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,060
Your Highness.

676
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,860
Your Highness, wait.

677
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,980
You haven't taken an umbrella.

678
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,580
Your Highness, where are you going?

679
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,180
- Muyan Forest.
- Now?

680
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,660
Lend me the horse.

681
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,860
Your Highness, don't go!

682
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,060
The rain is too heavy.

683
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,300
I'll go there for you.

684
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,460
- You don't know how to tend the trees.
- Your Highness.

685
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,740
- Take an umbrella.
- Your Highness.

686
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,860
Your Highness.

687
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,940
What can we do?

688
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,100
I'm going after Her Highness.

689
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,580
Hurry to the palace to report to His Highness.

690
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,420
Okay.

691
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,420
