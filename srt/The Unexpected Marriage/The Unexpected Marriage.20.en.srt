3
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,700
It's rare that you still have
such a good appetite.

4
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,350
Actually I don't.

5
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,190
But we should cherish food.

6
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,940
Maybe we'll have nothing to eat anymore.

7
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,470
Cherish the present moment.

8
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,940
You should eat some too.

9
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,300
(Pure Like Orchids)

10
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,700
That's right.

11
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,810
We can't make ourselves feel bad

12
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,940
for tomorrow's troubles.

13
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,360
After dinner,

14
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,980
I'll help you find a solution.

15
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,730
If things go well

16
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,640
tomorrow,

17
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,480
then everything is fine.

18
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,240
If it doesn't go well...

19
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,100
There are no ifs.

20
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Your Highness.

21
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,770
If you have goodwill,

22
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,750
whatever you do, it will go smoothly.

23
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,210
Because you know

24
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,120
what you're doing

25
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,700
isn't for your own interest.

26
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,260
We are not gambling with God.

27
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,980
We're following the will of heaven.

28
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,630
No matter what the result is,

29
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,150
I will always be with you.

30
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,070
So...

31
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,500
So...

32
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,430
She hasn't left.

33
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,540
Letting a man stay overnight
before getting married.

34
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,430
It's really outrageous.

35
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,290
So it's getting late.

36
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,380
Your Highness, go to bed early.

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,400
Wish you a great success tomorrow.

38
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,500
I'll wait for your triumphant return at home.

39
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,910
I'm leaving.

40
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,150
Changsheng...

41
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,380
There is a tough battle to fight tomorrow.

42
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,940
Let him preserve his strength.

43
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:20,260
(Essentials for Businessmen)
What?

44
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,360
People are dissatisfied

45
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,820
with the early grain harvest

46
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,700
and injured Jing?

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,670
This is disobedience.

48
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,850
Father, pleaes calm Down.

49
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,360
Farmers can't take the long view

50
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,200
like Jing does.

51
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,870
But if we rashly harvest food,

52
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,310
it'll provoke public opposition.

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,990
And if the locust plague doesn't occur
like Jing predicted,

54
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,790
resentment will build

55
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:39,201
and the consequences will be dire.

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,640
Your Majesty.

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,120
We just received a message.

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,290
Prince Qin brought his soldiers

59
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,290
to harvest grain by force.

60
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,880
Now they are confronting
the farmers in the fields.

61
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,720
This...

62
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,430
In my opinion,

63
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,380
we should summon Jing back

64
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,580
and think of a long-term plan.

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,245
Father, please think about it.

66
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,970
If this gets out,

67
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,020
our royal family will lose face.

68
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,070
The locust plague will soon occur.

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,870
If we continue the stalemate,

70
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,930
when the locusts arrive,

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,110
it'll be too late for everything.

72
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,790
You'll harvest nothing at all.

73
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:20,125
Today I hope everyone
will join me in harvesting food.

74
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,450
I promise

75
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,020
all the grain harvested today

76
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,700
will be returned to you.

77
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:27,330
The national treasury will also
give you corresponding compensation.

78
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,800
What locust plague?

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,890
The weather is fine.

80
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,190
There's no sign of locust plague.

81
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,340
That's right.

82
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,600
I must harvest

83
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,790
the grain today.

84
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:41,750
Now the locust plague
has been rampant in Dongpei.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,310
It'll soon affect Great Tang.

86
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,450
I'm doing this

87
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,800
for your good.

88
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,440
Then make some gesture.

89
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,800
It's not that we won't harvest food.

90
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,900
But you have to satisfy us.

91
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,400
We need some actual compensation.

92
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,240
Jing.

93
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,680
Aunt.

94
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,790
Do what you should do.

95
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,310
I'm here

96
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,800
to give you a helping hand.

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,190
You're not here to negotiate.

98
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,200
You are here to forcibly collect food.

99
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,170
Brothers, protect our food.

100
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,680
For our wives, children and parents,

101
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,610
let's fight to the end!

102
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,610
I don't believe they'll
make a big deal out of it.

103
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,953
Fight to the end!

104
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,379
The grain is growing so well this year.

105
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:15,570
We will lose a lot of money.

106
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,240
His Majesty will not leave us alone.

107
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,110
We refuse to harvest grain!

108
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,230
- We can't.
- We can't do it.

109
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,130
Your Highness.

110
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
General Zhao wrote to you

111
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,800
that he's raised food

112
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,970
and is personally escorting food to Great Tang.

113
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,020
He'll arrive within three days.

114
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,659
(To Princess Changsheng)
Great.

115
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,730
Your Highness, bad news.

116
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,260
The negotiation broke down.

117
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,230
His Highness prepares
to forcibly collect grain.

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,230
Finally, we have reached this point.

119
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,410
Jinyan, go and gather
the servants in the mansion

120
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,455
to follow me to the fields

121
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,663
and help His Highness harvest grain.

122
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,440
Yes.

123
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,200
I hope the news of food arriving

124
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,630
can resolve the conflict.

125
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,960
Your Highness.

126
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,490
Where are you going in such a hurry?

127
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,530
His Highness is in trouble.

128
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,070
- I have to go there.
- Your Highness.

129
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,020
His Highness is wise and resourceful.

130
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,850
He will solve the trouble himself.

131
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,430
We women will only cause trouble.

132
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,760
I think you should stay

133
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,360
and study women's virtues with me.

134
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,120
OK, I'll study with you later.

135
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,190
Your Highness, I won't let you go.

136
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,250
How dare you!

137
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,730
This is not a place

138
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,260
for you to mess around.

139
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,370
Someone.

140
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,490
I am Mr. Huaishan's granddaughter,

141
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,550
General Ru Lin's daughter,

142
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,020
and your guest.

143
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,610
Who dares to be rude to me!

144
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,630
I am the Princess of Fuyu,

145
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,790
and His Highness's wife,

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,310
also the mistress of Prince Qin's Mansion.

147
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,135
Are you turning a deaf ear to my orders?

148
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,260
Why are you still standing there?

149
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:37,140
Do you want to be punished?

150
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,700
Let's go, Miss.

151
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,380
- Miss, please leave.
- Let me go.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,840
Let me go.

153
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,400
We refuse to harvest food.

154
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,070
Here's the imperial decree.

155
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,690
Prince Qin, receive the order.

156
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,410
Prince Qin Lv Jing

157
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,730
is dedicated to the people,

158
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,930
contributes to the country,

159
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:56,990
and cares for the folks.

160
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,440
Grain collection

161
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,670
is out of goodwill.

162
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,190
But this matter is serious

163
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,970
and needs to be considered in the long term.

164
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,230
Prince Qin is summoned to the palace

165
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,430
without delay.

166
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:08,700
- Prince Qin, receive the order.
- (Isn't Father making me...)

167
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,690
Jing.

168
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,630
Disobeying the order is a serious crime.

169
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,090
Protect yourself first

170
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,940
and look for the future.

171
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,750
Your Highness, accept the order.

172
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,160
Your Highness.

173
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,820
It's such a mess here.What are you doing here?

174
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,640
Folks.

175
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,820
This is a letter from Fuyu.

176
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
There is the stamp

177
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,670
of General Zhao Huaibi.

178
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,820
He is coming here with food.

179
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,370
Now the locust plague has not occurred,

180
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,070
so we can still take precautions.

181
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,470
When the plague occurs,

182
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,620
the food we can compensate for you
will not be enough to share.

183
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,430
For your family,

184
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,890
give up your greed

185
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,150
and come harvest food with us.

186
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,820
Who is Zhao Huaibi?

187
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,010
Never heard of him.

188
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,220
You are the Princess of Fuyu.

189
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,440
Who knows you're here to help

190
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,890
or to cheat us?

191
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,970
She wants to cheat us.

192
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,820
We must not let them collect the grain.

193
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,080
Right.

194
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,190
Yes, we can't.

195
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,260
We won't harvest food.

196
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,740
I was worried that you would be
hindered on your way back.

197
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,162
So I borrowed

198
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:20,160
the Royal Guards from Father

199
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,740
to escort you back.

200
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,550
Do what you want to do.

201
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,130
I'll accompany you.

202
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,920
Harvest grain.

203
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,190
- Harvest grain.
- Yes.

204
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,590
You're forcing us.

205
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,464
Princess Royal.

206
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:02,130
Disobeying the order
and arousing public anger...

207
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:03,270
Soldiers, obey my order.

208
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,130
Stay here

209
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,320
and protect the people.

210
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,050
Anyone who leads troops into the fields

211
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,130
and causes a fight

212
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,100
shall be killed.

213
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,430
Aunt, what are you doing?

214
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,840
Are you disobeying the order like Jing?

215
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,220
The decree was given to Prince Qin.

216
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,960
How am I disobeying the order?

217
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,150
Isn't it right

218
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,410
to protect the people?

219
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,860
Then I'll wait here.

220
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,250
Then

221
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,100
I'll meet His Majesty with you all.

222
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,340
Father will decide

223
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,440
who's right and who's wrong.

224
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,280
It's raining here.

225
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,270
You're frail and weak.

226
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,440
Why not find a place to hide from the rain?

227
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,740
Thank you for the concern.

228
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,510
You can't harvest it.

229
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,480
Don't cut it.

230
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,980
- Don't take our food.
- Go back.

231
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,700
It's an urgent situation.

232
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,580
He will definitely collect the food by force.

233
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,770
Then,

234
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,340
he will violate His Majesty's will

235
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,550
and at the same time

236
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,670
lose the support of the people.

237
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,430
You just need to...

238
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,130
Ge.

239
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,790
What a good plan
to kill two birds with one stone.

240
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,340
Miss, you can't go out.

241
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,550
You two just let me out.

242
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,790
We are following orders.

243
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,430
Jing.

244
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,150
Grandpa.

245
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,670
- They...
- Grandpa.

246
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,460
You are...

247
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,930
It's time for us to go.

248
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,820
Grandpa.

249
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,860
Are you angry?

250
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,410
Prince Qin didn't want to confine us.

251
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,070
It's Liu Changsheng
who is causing trouble for us.

252
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,680
No.

253
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,290
We caused a lot of trouble for them.

254
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,980
It's time to leave.

255
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,150
Grandpa.

256
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,820
What are you talking about?

257
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,550
Grandpa.

258
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,270
Do you remember

259
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,370
why did I name you Ru Jing?

260
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,650
As transparent as glass,

261
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,670
both inside and out.

262
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,251
Flowers in a mirror, moon in the water.

263
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,620
They're all illusions.

264
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,100
Yes.

265
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,120
You are too obsessed.

266
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,580
It's easy to be blinded.

267
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,050
But you are born intelligent

268
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,310
and prone to trouble.

269
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,890
Go, go, go.

270
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,800
Leave with me.

271
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,640
I...

272
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:29,970
I'm not leaving.

273
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,440
That's fine.

274
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,940
If you insist on staying,

275
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,480
I won't force you.

276
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,700
But remember

277
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,250
to stay true to your heart.

278
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,890
Don't use your own cleverness

279
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,130
to do something evil.

280
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,430
Otherwise it will backfire on you.

281
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,130
Grandpa.

282
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,650
Jing has been busy.

283
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,320
I won't say goodbye to him.

284
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,410
I left him a letter

285
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,550
in the study.

286
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,190
If you have something,

287
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,430
you know how to find me.

288
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Grandpa.

289
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,400
Miss.

290
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,940
Miss Ru Jing.

291
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,290
Don't run away. We'll fail our job.

292
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,390
We'll fail our job.

293
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,560
Miss.

294
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,766
Where's His Highness?

295
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,936
Because of disobeying the decree,

296
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,426
he was taken to the Imperial Study.

297
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,010
What?

298
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,330
Disobedience?

299
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,170
Yes.

300
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,220
I'm going to save His Highness.

301
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,220
(Imperial Study)

302
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,090
I

303
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,150
disobeyed the order.

304
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,820
Please punish me.

305
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,150
I, Liu Changsheng,

306
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:47,820
am willing to take the punishment
with my husband.

307
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,010
Brother.

308
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,960
Jing was reckless to disobey the order,

309
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,530
but considering the emergency,

310
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,860
I hope you will treat it leniently.

311
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,430
What are you doing?

312
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,370
I haven't said a word yet.

313
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,740
But you guys didn't even let me talk.

314
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,530
As a prince,

315
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,740
you disobeyed the order.

316
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,680
As my sister,

317
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,560
you led troops to resist the Royal Guards.

318
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,200
Do you all want to rebel?

319
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,040
Father.

320
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,700
His Highness was forced to do so.

321
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,250
Facing the imperial decree,

322
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,580
he could have just let it slide.

323
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,080
But for the sake of the people,

324
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,340
he did not stand idly by.

325
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,340
Please forgive him

326
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:24,770
for the sake of his sincerity.

327
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,790
Your Highness, I disagree.

328
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,460
Father's intention is not to withdraw troops

329
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,530
but to summon Jing back

330
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,430
to think of a long-term plan.

331
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,670
This time, Jing forcibly collected the grain.

332
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,390
Now there is public resentment.

333
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,700
What do we do now?

334
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,920
Mr. Xiao.

335
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,050
Why are you laughing?

336
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,940
I felt that Prince Lu's words
were inappropriate.

337
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,700
He kept saying a long-term plan,

338
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,030
but it takes time to come up with such a plan.

339
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,048
Right now, the locust plague is overwhelming.

340
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,198
In addition to harvesting food,

341
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,430
I want to know if you have any better ideas.

342
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,040
Mr. Xiao.

343
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,790
Have you seen the plague?

344
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,320
No.

345
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,600
Will it occur tomorrow?

346
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,940
According to Mr. Huaishan,

347
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,330
it will...

348
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,250
If it doesn't occur tomorrow,

349
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,100
what should we do?

350
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,684
But we know for sure that locust plague will...

351
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:04,460
How can you be so sure?

352
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,387
If the locust plague doesn't occur,

353
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:08,213
and the people lose confidence
in the royal family,

354
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:09,270
leading to some chaotic scenes,

355
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,122
what should we do?

356
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,510
If protests erupt first,

357
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,050
and then the natural disaster falls,

358
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,910
what will you do?

359
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,280
Ke.

360
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,650
Your questions

361
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,840
are all groundless speculation.

362
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,700
Jing also did something reckless

363
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,250
because of groundless speculation

364
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,460
and caused such consequences.

365
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,640
Ke.

366
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:25,850
Now

367
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,620
do you have any idea?

368
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,290
In my opinion,

369
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,170
disaster prevention

370
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,190
must not be taken lightly.

371
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,960
But we also need to

372
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,860
pacify the people.

373
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:36,980
Maybe

374
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,220
Jing needs to suffer some grievances.

375
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:40,960
We should

376
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,208
confine Jing to the Reflection Room

377
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,314
to resolve people's resentment.

378
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,320
Tomorrow, we will give back all the food

379
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,430
we have collected in batches.

380
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,220
You go handle this.

381
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,250
Yes.

382
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,751
I'm willing to go

383
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:00,190
to the Reflection Room with His Highness.

384
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,860
Father, I did this all alone.

385
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,290
Please let Changsheng go.

386
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,860
Changsheng is the Princess of Fuyu.

387
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,120
Brother, please think twice.

388
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,820
Changsheng will be temporarily
under house arrest

389
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,270
and can't go out without order.

390
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,200
Thank you, Father.

391
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,190
Leave me.

392
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:27,940
Don't worry, Jing.

393
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,440
I will definitely

394
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,890
help you take care

395
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,510
of your family.

396
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,980
No need for the trouble.

397
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,790
Proceed with caution

398
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,070
and be cautious.

399
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,370
Changsheng.

400
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,030
Think positively.

401
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,980
There will be a way.

402
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,740
Thank you, Aunt.

403
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,190
Where's His Highness?

404
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,790
Princess Royal.

405
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,930
You should go back and rest earlier.

406
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,770
Okay.

407
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,170
Wait.

408
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,250
Stop there.

409
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,270
He is in the Reflection Room.

410
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,860
Reflection Room?

411
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,170
It's all because of you.

412
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,990
You should find a way to get him out.

413
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,120
You...

414
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,580
What is the Reflection Room?

415
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,790
Is it a prison cell?

416
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,170
When civilians make mistakes,

417
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,270
they go to the jail.

418
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,310
When people in the royal family make mistakes,

419
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,030
they go to the Reflection Room.

420
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,580
It sounds

421
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:53,970
like

422
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:55,200
a more comfortable place, right?

423
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,370
The Reflection Room is different
from the cells outside.

424
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,820
The punishment will only get worse.

425
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,930
The Reflection Room, as the name suggests,

426
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,580
is a place for reflection.

427
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,620
Although there is no corporal punishment,

428
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,900
compared to physical suffering,

429
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,230
mental torture

430
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,180
is even more terrifying.

431
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:12,610
The temperature there is extremely low,

432
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,620
like an icehouse,

433
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,928
with wind coming from all directions.

434
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,550
The reflective person wears a singlet,

435
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,850
and only sleeps four hours a day,

436
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,950
sustaining life with just soup.

437
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,950
There is no sound,

438
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,420
and no speaking allowed.

439
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,310
Outsiders are not allowed to visit.

440
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,340
It's pitch dark,

441
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,380
you can't see anything.

442
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,620
The one who receives the punishment

443
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,040
will have all five senses

444
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,100
destroyed.

445
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,330
His Majesty

446
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,510
is really ruthless this time.

447
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Brother

448
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,990
was forced to do so.

449
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Now we have to figure out a way

450
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,860
to rescue His Highness.

451
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,620
As long as the locust plague occurs tomorrow,

452
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,890
Jing's words will be confirmed.

453
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,900
Then he can get away with it.

454
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,000
This is the only time I hope

455
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,380
the disaster to happen soon.

456
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,210
Princess Royal.

457
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,200
We've arrived at the inn.

458
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,100
So fast.

459
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,100
Then I will go back first.

460
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,930
By the way,

461
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,440
you looked so gorgeous

462
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,580
when you led soldiers

463
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,360
to rescue His Highness.

464
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,020
(Huadeng Pavilion)

465
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,310
Come on, Ge.

466
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,770
Let me toast you.

467
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,930
Thanks to your good idea,

468
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,790
this plan went so smoothly.

469
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,610
It's because of Your Highness's

470
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,550
wise decision.

471
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,310
But Your Highness,

472
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,890
now that Jing

473
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,030
is in the Reflection Room,

474
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,620
next...

475
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,710
Of course, strike while the iron is hot

476
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,100
to avoid future troubles.

477
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,270
Although Father punished Jing,

478
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,140
it was all out of his helplessness.

479
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,693
Tomorrow when the locust plague strikes,

480
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,790
Jing will naturally have room for maneuver.

481
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,010
So

482
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,410
we should take a drastic measure

483
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,580
as soon as possible.

484
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,230
Don't worry.

485
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,180
I have it all planned.

486
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,100
This time you've made a great contribution.

487
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,750
Is there any reward you want?

488
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,660
I dare not take credit.

489
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,510
There's only one thing.

490
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,240
The rhododendrons

491
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,100
are going to bloom.

492
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,170
Are you willing

493
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,900
to see the blooms with me?

494
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,140
When the rhododendrons bloom,

495
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,370
I will go with you

496
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,420
to view them.

497
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,800
Cheers.

498
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,580
(Prince Song's Mansion)

499
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,030
Honey.

500
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,480
What did you go?

501
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,620
You look flustered.

502
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,550
You are going to be the Empress.

503
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,650
What nonsense are you talking about?

504
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,520
You are a prince.

505
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,990
How could I be the Empress?

506
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,230
Honey, how can you be so stupid?

507
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,340
Well,

508
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,380
if I were the Emperor,

509
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,070
you're naturally the Empress.

510
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,750
Your father has died?

511
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,330
No.

512
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,170
What are you daydreaming about?

513
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,040
Besides, if your father is really gone,

514
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,720
Lv Jing would be the one...

515
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,550
He's in the Reflection Room.

516
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,440
Lv Jing disobeyed the order
and collected grain yesterday.

517
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,330
He got punished.

518
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,130
There are several farmers

519
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,510
who made a remonstrance today.

520
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,251
They also incited the crowd by saying that
there was not enough food this year.

521
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:49,550
He must pay for this.

522
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,800
Some people even

523
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,410
hit their heads against the stone gate,

524
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,250
bang,

525
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,750
their brains spilling out all over the floor.

526
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,340
Lv Jing

527
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,180
is doomed this time.

528
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,420
Really?

529
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,680
I'm leaving for the Imperial Study now

530
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,140
to find Ke and Father.

531
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,810
I'm going to add fuel to the flames.

532
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,480
- Don't go.
- Why?

533
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,890
Your fifth brother

534
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,170
just pretends to listen to you.

535
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,480
But every time something goes wrong,

536
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
he stays away

537
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,680
from the trouble.

538
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,890
You just

539
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,280
never learn the lesson

540
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,710
no matter how many times you fell.

541
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,420
Lv Hou.

542
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,660
(Youlan Pavilion)

543
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,690
Your Highness.

544
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,310
It;s a mess outside.

545
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,030
What should we do?

546
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,320
Your Highness, General Zhao has sent the food

547
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,380
to a hidden place ten miles outside the city.

548
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,699
According to your instructions,

549
00:22:56,737 --> 00:22:58,380
Youyong has already brought people
to take over.

550
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,790
General Zhao wanted to come visit you.

551
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,850
But after listening to what you said

552
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,170
that it's a troubled time right now

553
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,251
and he's inconvenient to meet you,

554
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,340
so he went back.

555
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,520
Got it.

556
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,170
Your Highness, please get ready.

557
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,480
I have contacted my grandpa.

558
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,790
You will go to the palace with me
and my grandpa to see His Mahesty.

559
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,550
Account book.

560
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,930
Liu Changsheng.

561
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,368
His Highness is not dead yet.

562
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,056
Are you so anxious
to divide the family property?

563
00:23:26,064 --> 00:23:27,660
Miss Ru Jing, please watch what you say.

564
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,750
I'm confined here,

565
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,470
and can't leave the house without order.

566
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,580
We cannot disobey the order a second time.

567
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,040
Miss Ru Jing, please help

568
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,240
my husband leave the Reflection Room.

569
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,480
I will surely return your favor.

570
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,950
Now you know you can't disobey the order.

571
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,620
Why didn't you persuade His Highness yesterday?

572
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,420
Liu Changsheng, you shouldn't
have come to Great Tang.

573
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,030
Your Highness, don't listen to her nonsense.

574
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,860
(Should I come here)

575
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,100
(or not?)

576
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:10,180
(Memorial from Assistant Minister
of Punishments)

577
00:24:10,194 --> 00:24:12,380
Prince Qin just collected some grain.

578
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,310
He didn't commit any serious crime.

579
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,990
These ministers spoke with conviction

580
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,380
and wanted me to...

581
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,620
Yes, Jing has already been sent
to the Reflection Room.

582
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,380
Do they really want him dead?

583
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,860
Those people are really...

584
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,410
They even...

585
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,380
What?

586
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,890
Those people

587
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,520
threatened us with their lives.

588
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,790
Some even hit their heads

589
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,510
against the ground,

590
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,000
and their brains were flowing out.

591
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,130
It was white,

592
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,620
just like the tofu pudding you're eating.

593
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,650
Wel...

594
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,490
Father.

595
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,930
Now only by sacrificing Jing

596
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,620
can we preserve the dignity
of our royal family.

597
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,170
Get out.

598
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,720
Get out of here!

599
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,140
I'm leaving.

600
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,730
You stay.

601
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,040
I'm back.

602
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,240
I didn't mean you.

603
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,550
I'm leaving.

604
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,840
Ke.

605
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,100
What's your view

606
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:18,990
on this matter?

607
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,510
I think what Hou said is a bit radical.

608
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,280
After all, we're brothers.

609
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,510
Even if Jing did something wrong,

610
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,800
he doesn't deserve death.

611
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,090
It's just that the situation
is too tense right now.

612
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,270
Jing first disobeyed your order

613
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:31,140
and then forcibly collected the grain.

614
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,200
We must give the farmers an explanation.

615
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,720
This, this...

616
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,100
How to explain?

617
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,286
In my opinion,

618
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:40,340
we should temporarily take back
Jing's military power

619
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,520
and his title

620
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,100
to quell the impeachment of the ministers.

621
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,470
The Reflection Room is a tough place.

622
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,470
Why not ask Jing to leave the capital

623
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,380
and stay in the fiefdom for a while?

624
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,660
It can be an explanation to the farmers.

625
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,263
Wait for the public grievances to dissipate,

626
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,637
then we can get Jing back

627
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,715
to continue serving the country.

628
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,340
I know you don't want to let Jing go.

629
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,620
But it's a stopgap measure for now.

630
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,550
Keeping him by your side at this moment

631
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,380
will only bring more danger to him.

632
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,500
Just do

633
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,840
as you wish.

634
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,320
Yes.

635
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,240
Your Highness, it's late now.

636
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,280
Be careful not to catch a cold.

637
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,120
I'm fine.

638
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,520
You should explain this to Youyong and Youmou.

639
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,570
Now Prince Qin's mansion

640
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,550
is not like what it used to be.

641
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,570
(Youlan Pavilion)

642
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,100
The Royal Guards were ordered to guard here.

643
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,210
Ask them

644
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,050
to avoid conflicts

645
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,080
and don't offend people

646
00:26:57,424 --> 00:26:58,510
lest people will speak ill of us.

647
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,010
Yes.

648
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,650
Your Highness.

649
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,240
You have been busy recently,

650
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,230
and your body is weak.

651
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,180
You'd better go back and rest soon.

652
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,140
I can't sleep.

653
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,180
Instead of wasting time in bed,

654
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,820
it's better to think about

655
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,660
some solutions.

656
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,820
His Highness has great prestige in the court

657
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,420
and many supporters.

658
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,570
We might as well

659
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,710
contact them

660
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,100
and see if they will speak up for His Highness.

661
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,950
I thought about this last night.

662
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,970
But it won't work.

663
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,045
His Majesty asked His Highness

664
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,040
to go to the Reflection Room.

665
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,650
If at this moment,

666
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,140
his supporters stand out,

667
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,950
they'll be going against His Majesty.

668
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,270
First, defying the order

669
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,790
and then drawing over the ministers.

670
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,850
A slight mistake

671
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,860
and a wrong attitude

672
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:44,660
will create chances for people

673
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,270
to slander him.

674
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,520
By that time,

675
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,270
His Highness will be doomed.

676
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,620
Your Highness is thoughtful.

677
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,080
Your Highness.

678
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,620
Go back and rest soon.

679
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,470
If you catch a cold and get sick,

680
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,180
you'll have another bowl of ginger soup.

681
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,410
Your Highness.

682
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,180
Your Highness, bad news.

683
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,330
His Majesty issued an order

684
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,650
to remove His Highness's title

685
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,270
and send him to the fiefdom.

686
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,620
What?

687
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,230
Father has ordered

688
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,620
to take back Jing's military power

689
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,130
and deprive him of the tile,

690
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,030
send him to the fiefdom.

691
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,330
Impossible.

692
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,170
It's true.

693
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,900
Because this idea was mine.

694
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,280
You...

695
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,820
So why are you telling me this?

696
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,800
You're showing off

697
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,090
that you're powerful now?

698
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,990
Miss Ru Jing.

699
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,710
You don't know the situation at that time.

700
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,240
The ministers and the commoners

701
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,330
were all writing to impeach him.

702
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,380
Father had no choice,

703
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,230
and Hou wanted to sacrifice Jing.

704
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,550
I was forced

705
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,140
to make this decision.

706
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,580
I was being rude.

707
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:45,620
Your Highness, please forgive me.

708
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,370
You and I are both hoping that Jing

709
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,230
will get through this.

710
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,990
How can I blame you?

711
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,750
Just a pity

712
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,660
that when Jing was in power,

713
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,680
some ministers

714
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,520
were close to him.

715
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,310
Now they give him the cold shoulders.

716
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,520
There's no one

717
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,710
to speak for him.

718
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,270
I have sent a letter to my grandpa.

719
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,580
We can go to the palace
to see His Majesty tomorrow.

720
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,510
If Mr. Huaishan can come to help,

721
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,270
we'll surely turn the tide.

722
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,010
But

723
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,660
Jing is leaving now.

724
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,660
If there is a minister who can defend him

725
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,800
and keep him here

726
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,800
to buy time

727
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,810
until Mr. Huaishan comes,

728
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,380
we'll have a greater chance of success.

729
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,340
I'll get it done.

730
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:33,730
Your Highness.

731
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,040
Farewell.

732
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,800
Your Highness.

733
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,340
Miss Ru Jing

734
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,750
is deeply in love

735
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,070
with Jing.

736
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,310
Mr. Huaishan alone

737
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,230
can persuade Father.

738
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,900
But if Prince Qin's confidants speak for him,

739
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,790
it will only alienate him from Father

740
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,660
and make Father more suspicious.

741
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,040
Stop.

742
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,520
Your Highness.

743
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,660
It's time to set off.

744
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,040
Okay.

745
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,280
Wait a moment.

746
00:30:42,848 --> 00:30:43,820
Fortunately, I made it in time.

747
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,120
Ru Jing.

748
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,410
How did you come?

749
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,650
Your Highness, don't worry.

750
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,080
I have contacted some ministers

751
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,310
to go speak for you.

752
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,080
When Grandpa arrives...

753
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,710
The ministers will speak for me?

754
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,490
Yes.

755
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,250
What's wrong?

756
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,170
Your Majesty,

757
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,330
please recall the order

758
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,140
and take Prince Qin back to the palace.

759
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,170
Your Majesty,

760
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,760
please recall the order

761
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,620
and take Prince Qin back to the palace.

762
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,170
Your Majesty,

763
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,650
please recall the order

764
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,340
and take Prince Qin back to the palace.

765
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,610
Are you trying to rebel?

766
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,480
Get up.

767
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,750
Get up quickly.

768
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,570
Ministers,

769
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,950
get up first and explain yourselves.

770
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
His Majesty will listen to you.

771
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,550
Your Majesty, please think twice.

772
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,650
Great Tang

773
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,130
can't live without Prince Qin.

774
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,710
The soldiers cannot fight without the general.

775
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:34,770
Yes.

776
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,140
I disagree.

777
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,280
His Majesty is in charge

778
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,330
and there's also Prince Song here.

779
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,760
Ke is right.

780
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,820
You mean

781
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,280
Is it that Father and I

782
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,200
are no better than Prince Qin?

783
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,040
Besides,

784
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,750
Father has stripped Jing of his title.

785
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,890
If you mention Prince Qin again,

786
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,510
that is disobedience.

787
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,570
Your Majesty,

788
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,040
please recall the order

789
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,550
and forgive His Highness.

790
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,620
Outrageous.

791
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,550
You all are going to rebel.

792
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,950
Mr. Huaishan is here.

793
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,410
Greetings,

794
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,790
Your Majesty.

795
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,130
Mr. Huaishan

796
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,610
came back again.

797
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,610
What is it for?

798
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,900
Your Majesty...

799
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,410
Today,

800
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,440
there are so many people in the Imperial Study.

801
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,990
I'm afraid there's no place for me.

802
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:44,650
Your Highness.

803
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,580
Princess Consort Lu came to pay respects.

804
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:47,770
Do you want to see her?

805
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,990
Prince Qin's Mansion

806
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,420
is guarded by the Royal Guards.

807
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,140
She can still come and go freely.

808
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,660
Could we decide

809
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,990
whether we want to see her?

810
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,580
Invite her to the lobby.

811
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,130
Changsheng, you're sick.

812
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,470
How could I ask you to receive me?

813
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,100
Usually,

814
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,550
you rarely come here.

815
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,080
How come you have time to come today?

816
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,860
Don't you know?

817
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,210
Jing's title

818
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,310
has been stripped away.

819
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,950
There is no more Prine Qin in the world.

820
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,230
Of course, Prince Qin's Mansion
has ceased to exist.

821
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,750
There is no Prince Qin in the world,

822
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,470
but I remember it in my heart.

823
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,070
Be careful with this statement.

824
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,130
After all, it was Father who issued the order

825
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,620
to deprive of the title of Prince Qin.

826
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,990
You are blatantly defying him.

827
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,140
- You...
- But it doesn't matter.

828
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,440
You're not the only one

829
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,620
who's defying the order.

830
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,420
There are also Jing's confidants.

831
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,040
If it weren't for them

832
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,760
going to the Imperial Study together

833
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,340
and ask for His Majesty's forgiveness,

834
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,270
I guess with Mr. Huaishan's authority,

835
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Father

836
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,820
would also forgive Jing.

837
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,090
What?

838
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,480
You heard it right.

839
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,650
This is all thanks to

840
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,070
Miss Ru Jing's help.

841
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,000
If it weren't for her,

842
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,140
the ministers wouldn't have done this.

843
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:05,900
What a pity.

844
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,340
I assume

845
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,660
Jing

846
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,700
should be on the way now.

847
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,660
Don't get angry.

848
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,660
You must take good care of your health.

849
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,580
What if there's worse news?

850
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,030
What will you do then?

851
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,510
Worse news?

852
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,570
Yes.

853
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,660
It'll be a long trip.

854
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,480
I don't know whether the Royal Guards

855
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,950
can escort Jing well.

856
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,410
What if someone who wants to harm him

857
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,870
get mixed in?

858
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,180
Even Youyong and Youmou

859
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,440
may not be able

860
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,870
to keep Jing safe.

861
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,870
Since you're seriously ill,

862
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,830
I will take my leave.

863
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,990
No need to see me off.

864
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,200
I'm going to notify them.

865
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,350
His Highness is in danger.

866
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,400
Your Highness.

867
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,430
You are now confined to here.

868
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,780
You can't leave the house.

869
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,080
It is a capital crime.

870
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,660
Rather than surviving here,

871
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,390
I'd rather die with him.

872
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,280
Your Highness.

873
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,000
Protect His Highness. There are bandits.

874
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,840
Protect His Highness.

875
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,740
Protect His Highness.

876
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:16,570
Are you here

877
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,260
for me?

878
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,360
Lv Jing.

879
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,770
You didn't follow the imperial decree.

880
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,610
You will die today.

881
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,880
Go.

882
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,690
Your Highness.

883
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,930
Changsheng,

884
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,030
where are you going?

885
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,210
Chu Ge.

886
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,470
You lured me out?

887
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,700
I just wanted to visit you.

888
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,440
I didn't expect that on the way back home,

889
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,560
I ran into you.

890
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,520
But speaking of which,

891
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Jinyan and Shenxing

892
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,140
never leave you.

893
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,840
What about the other maid?

894
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,360
Right.

895
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,390
Where's Shenxing?

896
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,660
Princess Royal.

897
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,310
(Fine Spirits of the Universe)
Help.

898
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,260
Princess Royal.

899
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,620
Help!

900
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,830
Princess Royal.

901
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,090
Princess Royal.

902
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,370
You are Her Highness's maid, Miss Shenxing?

903
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,104
Yes, go tell Princess Royal

904
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,459
that someone wants to kill His Highness.

905
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,690
Quick.

906
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,180
(Imperial Study)

907
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,050
Father.

908
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,130
Father.

909
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,870
Sorry for disturbing you.

910
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,560
There is really something important to report.

911
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,510
What happened again?

912
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,560
The Royal Guards reported

913
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,080
that on his way to the fiefdom,

914
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,740
Jing ran away because
he was dissatisfied with you.

915
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,550
Dissatisfied with me?

916
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,390
Ran away?

917
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,650
Yes.

918
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,430
Princess Changsheng came out from the dog hole

919
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,480
and escaped the house

920
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,620
with a large sum of money.

921
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,140
Pass my order.

922
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,480
Capture

923
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,350
Lv Jing

924
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,080
and Liu Changsheng.

925
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,990
Bring them in alive

926
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,090
or dead...

927
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,260
Catch them alive.

928
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,170
Yes.

929
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,100
Protect His Highness.

930
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,870
Kill them all and leave no one alive.

931
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,250
Your Highness, leave here.

932
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,250
Focus on the big picture.

933
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,890
Your Highness, go!

934
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,100
Leave here, Your Highness!

935
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,730
Chase them.

936
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,290
He can't get far.

937
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,130
Go.
