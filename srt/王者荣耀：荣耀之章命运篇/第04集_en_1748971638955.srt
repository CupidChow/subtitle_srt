Now, where can we find them?

21
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Never.

I will kill you all!

47
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
I will kill you all!

48
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
You!

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Kill him!

57
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Luna!

58
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Luna!

59
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Hurry!

60
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Leave Luna.

61
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
I am leaving him alone.

62
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Let's go down.

63
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
I need my life.

64
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Come with me!

65
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Forlorn.

66
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Let's release Luna.

67
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Go right ahead.

68
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
His will.

69
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Kaiyin, you are the leader of the Sea Capital.

70
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,240
I allow you to stay for the last time.

71
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Don't hit my path.

72
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
I can't get through this!

73
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
I'm going to kill you!

74
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
No one can judge my brother!

75
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
No!

76
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,240
I can't let anyone judge my brother!

77
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
I'm stopping you!

78
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
I can't stop you!

79
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
You two are going to kill me!

80
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
I'm going to kill you!

81
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Kaiyin, we're here!

82
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,240
No matter what you've done, we all believe in you!

83
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Go! Leave this place to us!

84
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Kaiyin!

85
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Kaiyin!

86
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Kaiyin!

87
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
You're going to kill me!

88
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
You're going to kill me!

89
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
Give me back!

90
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Kaiyin!

91
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,240
I just took back what belongs to me.

92
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,240
You should have done everything you could to make it a shame!

93
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Shame?

94
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Back then, I was the strongest warrior of the family.

95
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,240
But I lost everything because of this.

96
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,240
To survive, I killed the merchant

97
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,240
and made my sister pay for the punishment of Zhou Ying.

98
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,240
He was suffering and never reminded me of me.

99
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,240
I was the worst person.

100
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,240
I got the chance to pay back my life.

101
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,240
But I still have to bear the torture

102
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,240
to make the merchant live.

103
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,240
If I keep doing this, I'll be dead.

104
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,240
But I didn't expect you to be so famous.

105
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
I don't deserve you.

106
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
You're the one who won the war.

107
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Not me.

108
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,240
You're the one who can get the new life.

109
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,240
Not me!

110
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
I finally understand.

111
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Because of you,

112
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,240
our lives will never change!

113
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,240
I'll live to the most important!

114
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Master.

115
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Luna.

116
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,240
We used to trust you so much.

117
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Go!

118
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,240
I won't let anyone hurt her!

119
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Then you'll be dead.

120
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
Luna.

121
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,240
I'll give you all these.

122
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
Go to hell!

123
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Luna.

124
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,240
You're so lucky to have me.

125
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Why don't I help you?

126
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Luna.

127
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
Luna.

128
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,240
I promise you!

129
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Don't cry.

130
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Luna is with brother.

131
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
What's the big deal?

132
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Luna, come and protect brother.

133
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Give me your power!

134
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,240
I'll see what you want!

135
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
I'm so happy.

136
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,240
But you don't want to give up

137
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,240
all the memories of love.

138
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Give them to me.

139
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,240
You'll forget what you've done.

140
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,240
And your sister.

141
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
I can't go!

142
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,240
I can only let Luna live!

143
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
You can wake me up.

144
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm the most special criminal.

145
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Then you'll be dead.

146
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,240
You'll give me all the memories.

147
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,240
And I'll be your driver forever.

148
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Together, another way of what we've begun.

149
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Brother, we're all that we've begun.

150
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,240
I'll kill you!

151
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
No!

152
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
No!

153
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
No!

154
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
No!

155
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
I won't do it!

156
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
No!

157
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
Follow me!

158
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
I'll jump out!

159
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,240
No one will ever know you're here!

160
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
Deklan!

161
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
What the hell?

162
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
What?

163
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
What's that shit?

164
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,240
What the hell?

165
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
You're still not dead?

166
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Luna!

167
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
What's going on?

168
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,240
If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead.

169
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,240
We're all dead.

170
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Are we?

171
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Our family?

172
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Xiuying!

173
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
I've told you before.

174
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,240
I have nothing to do with your family.

175
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,240
But I really didn't expect that.

176
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,240
You're not the one who's finally been punished.

177
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,240
You're your sister.

178
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
What happened?

179
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Luna was too impulsive.

180
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,240
She didn't know what happened just now.

181
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Brother!

182
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Xiuying!

183
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
She was...

184
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,240
She was the one who killed you.

185
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,240
How pitiful.

186
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,240
You scared us...

187
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Stupid, right?

188
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,480
Your drawing

189
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,440
is saved?

190
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Xinesha, this is

191
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
our destiny.

192
00:24:50,240 --> 00:25:18,720
I miss my sister.

193
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
She likes me!

194
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,720
She doesn't know how to talk. How do you know she likes you?

195
