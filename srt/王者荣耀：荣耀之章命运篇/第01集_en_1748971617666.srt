00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,780

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,840

4
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,560
But It has temporarily been delayed

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,160
Wave

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
...

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's Li Tang's room!

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
She's finally out of her family!

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What's going on?

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's going on?

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Get out!

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's going on?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Brother!

14
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Brother!

15
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Could it be...

16
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
...

17
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's me, Luna.

18
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's me!

19
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is Zhou Ying...

20
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
...abandoned?

21
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Catch her!

22
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hurry!

23
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Catch her!

24
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes.

25
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is...

26
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
...our fate.

27
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Brother!

28
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't let her go!

29
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Brother!

30
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
...

31
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
...

32
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
...

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
...

34
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
...

35
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
...

36
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
...

37
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
...

38
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
...

39
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
...

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
...

41
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
...

42
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
...

43
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
...

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
...

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
...

46
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Catch her!

47
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What's going on?

48
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's...

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
...

50
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
...

51
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
...

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
...

53
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
...

54
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
...

55
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
...

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
...

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Get out!

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
...

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Where is he?

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He is there!

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He is there!

62
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Come on!

63
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let go!

64
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Go after him!

65
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,880
He finally got ur inward.

66
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,860
Hurry up!

67
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,000
This is a��ar patcher handgun!

68
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:52,480
Oh, sling is sent.

69
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,120
It's been for a long time.

70
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,520
So it better start.

71
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,480
It's time he's dead on the way.

72
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,680
What anzed?

73
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,480
S heritage is here.

74
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,360
Here's therating over,

75
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,360
Shiqiao, we just got him.

76
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,240
We didn't expect he would come back so soon.

77
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,480
It doesn't matter.

78
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,440
At least our plan was successful.

79
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,560
Kaiyan's seal is really explosive.

80
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,600
He is now a public public body.

81
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,120
His sister can't help him.

82
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,160
The position of the leader should be ours.

83
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,840
Who is the leader of the south?

84
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Put the gun down.

85
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,360
Be careful.

86
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,040
What are you afraid of?

87
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Look at what sister just said.

88
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,120
They are just a group of people.

89
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,320
You got hurt by Kaiyan.

90
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,680
I'm fine.

91
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,600
But...

92
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,120
How about him?

93
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,760
To kill a common player,

94
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,480
and to separate,

95
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,440
the seal of bands of foreigners

96
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,200
will explode onto every troublemaker.

97
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,360
At the end,

98
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,840
we will get the trigger to make a popcorn stand up.

99
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,000
The Li'l tello

100
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I can't escape.

101
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Accept it.

102
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What do you think?

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No.

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Brother promised me.

105
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He will fight for this fate.

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
When the dead man died,

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Ji Zheng Que and his son,

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Kai Yan,

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and Qiao Yan,

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
still protected them.

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't worry.

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I won't be a burden to them.

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Brother,

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
don't cry.

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm not crying.

116
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He can't escape.

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Where are the others?

118
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Qiao Yan is gone.

119
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Kai Yan has many enemies there.

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You are...

121
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Kill him.

122
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Kai Yan?

123
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He killed all of us.

124
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Brother.

125
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Follow me.

126
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We'll get out of here.

127
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Brother.

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Brother.

129
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It hurts.

130
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It hurts.

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't get out of here.

132
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I...

133
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I...

134
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to protect Lunar.

135
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I want to protect Lunar.

136
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think I've got a strong feeling.

137
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I dare not.

138
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You are the one who's been looking for me.

139
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Who are you?

140
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Where are you?

141
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I've been watching for thousands of years.

142
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You've been watching for thousands of years.

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You are the one who's been looking for me.

144
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Give me your power.

145
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll give you my power.

146
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're the one who's been watching for thousands of years.

147
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Brother.

148
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What's that?

149
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's Kai's armor.

150
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What's going on?

151
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Why is he suddenly so strong?

152
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What's going on?

153
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The Dark Lord of Moon Sect will be exposed to the strongest man in the world.

154
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Is he the one?

155
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Run!

156
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Brother.

157
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What's going on?

158
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Are you feeling anything?

159
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Brother!

160
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No!

161
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No!

162
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Brother.

163
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The Dark Lord of Moon Sect will be exposed to the strongest man in the world.

164
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is my most important thing.

165
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I will never come back to save you again.

166
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Brother!

167
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Run.

168
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I still like you, you bastard.

169
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I will follow you until you learn the day of salvation.

170
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Run.

171
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know what your power is.

172
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But he's very strong.

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If you can't suppress him,

174
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
let him become stronger,

175
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
he might really become the one who's going to be exposed to the Dark Lord.

176
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Teacher.

177
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What's going on with the Dark Lord you've been talking about?

178
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No one knows what exactly happened.

179
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They only know that he came from the Divine.

180
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
A thousand years ago,

181
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
when the late Shennan of the Shennan of the 11th Clan was still in the Divine Garden,

182
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the Dark Lord was cast into the blood.

183
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The Taiyang Clan was burned to the ground.

184
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The Gaota Clan was exiled to the capital.

185
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The Taiyang Clan will never stop.

186
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The Shennan Clan will be with the guilty.

187
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What about us?

188
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The Taiyang Clan will be killed.

189
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The Sun and the Moon will be separated.

190
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Brother.

191
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
No way.

192
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I will control my power.

193
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We will never be separated.

194
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No way.

195
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Hurry up.

196
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You want to use this method to prove that you can control your power?

197
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Do you need my power more?

198
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't need it.

199
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Brother.

200
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The Dark Lord is dead.

201
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We have to fight together.

202
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We have to fight together.

203
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We have to fight together.

204
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We have to fight together.

205
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We have to fight together.

206
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Brother.

207
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Brother.

208
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Brother.

209
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's been three years.

210
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You haven't been gone.

211
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't worry.

212
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm fine.

213
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Now you can finally be the captain.

214
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm still the captain.

215
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Why not?

216
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
No one can ever cure you.

217
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's your fault.

218
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The heroes of the past have been doing this for us.

219
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But they don't know what you have been killed.

220
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Especially your sister.

221
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Shut up.

222
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If it's the trial of Kaiyin,

223
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
why hasn't the Moon Family been here?

224
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Kaiyin doesn't know the truth.

225
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You can't help her.

226
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You are so close to the next爆-dry group.

227
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But this time...

228
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's right.

229
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll avoid the Kaiyin.

230
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The Moon Family's mistakes

231
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
should be our fault.

232
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't be so troublesome.

233
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The Moon Family doesn't need to be blamed.

234
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Kaiyin is her sister.

235
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If we change her,

236
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
we can re-establish her.

237
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It doesn't matter who you are.

238
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Give Kaiyin the important thing.

239
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm the one who controls

240
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the Moon Family.

241
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
No one can interfere.

242
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Luna?

243
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes.

244
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
She is the new captain of the Moon Family.

245
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The Moon Family is always self-sufficient.

246
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But it's a very important time now.

247
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Kaiyin must get the trial as soon as possible.

248
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The Moon Family has a rule.

249
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The major war workers under the Moon Family

250
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
will be killed.

251
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The war workers can't be involved in a fight with the Moon Family.

252
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If they can save the Moon Family,

253
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
they can destroy the Moon Family.

254
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's so boring.

255
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Every person in the Shiyi Clan in the East

256
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
who has been exposed to the Moon Family

257
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
will be killed because of the power loss and the Moon's evil power.

258
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
For thousands of years,

259
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
the Moon Family has been in danger.

260
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Kaiyin is not the evil mother.

261
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
If it's not the evil mother,

262
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
we, the Shen Han Clan, will be doomed.

263
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why do we always have such a tragedy?

264
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And then we have to do the trial again and again.

265
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We never thought about it.

266
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We should get rid of her from the Moon Family.

267
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Exactly.

268
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The Moon Family is under the Moon Family.

269
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
As long as our bloodline is still in the blood,

270
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
it will never be able to save the Moon Family.

271
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
If the Moon Family really stands by us,

272
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
only by killing Kaiyin

273
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
can it avoid the Moon Family's own evil power.

274
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
This is also the fate of the Shen Han Clan.

275
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's not the evil mother.

276
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The Shen Family has no power.

277
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's the evil mother.

278
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I, the Mei Luo Si of the Shen Han Clan,

279
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
officially declare that

280
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,700
the

281
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,000
Kaiyin's curse will be revealed.

282
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We must get rid of her.

283
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Although the bloodline is not able to save the Moon Family,

284
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I can take care of it myself.

285
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Xiao Ke'ai, I really feel the same.

286
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
As long as Kaiyin is not covered,

287
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
it will still be the master of the Moon Family.

288
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You all said Kaiyin is the evil mother.

289
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
But they have always wanted to kill us.

290
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And you all are involved in it.

291
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Who is the evil mother here?

292
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The evil mother.

293
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The evil mother.

294
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The evil mother.

295
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The evil mother.

296
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The bloodline is revealed.

297
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
All the heads of the people here are now in the battle.

298
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Kaiyin killed the people.

299
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
She is seriously threatening the safety of the sea.

300
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
She is going to kill all the enemies.

301
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Isn't Kaiyin protecting the sea?

302
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Is that possible?

303
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The fate of the Guizu Clan.

304
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I heard that she killed many of the people.

305
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Only her sister can survive.

306
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Kaiyin is taking us to the sea.

307
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
She is going to kill us.

308
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What are you talking about?

309
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Kaiyin, don't be so mean to her.

310
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Your battle with her is still a joke.

311
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's so funny.

312
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Kaiyin.

313
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Shen Yu?

314
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We dare not go there.

315
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You go find someone else.

316
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You are looking for the boat that can sail the sea, Kaiyin.

317
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Where do you want to get the magic leaves?

318
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Forget it.

319
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Because of you, the mortal world will die.

320
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
This is the only way.

321
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Only I can help you.

322
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Remember, our friendship is always in the same place.

323
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
This boat is not good.

324
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,000
You are the most向 me.

325
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You have the power of the Thunder.

326
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,040
The one who died.

327
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,600
That安要索他件, rights,

328
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,880
死的嘛,

329
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,540
一手啦,

330
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
huh

331
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,520
suits you.

332
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,060
Are you kidding me?

333
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,700
V variant

334
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,940
LoALLY

335
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,140
nte.,

336
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:17,260
ME,

337
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,520
I'm sure it's safe not to think about it.

338
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,100
I didn't mean to.

339
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,060
It does 93% of things so contribute to being a master gaming.

340
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,160
What?

341
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,480
Start!

342
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,720
Come after me!

343
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,260
You are the one.

344
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,260
Don't worry, you are not your enemy.

345
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,260
You can't escape, Kain.

346
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,260
All the judges,

347
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
please follow me.

348
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,260
Teacher.

349
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,260
Luna, are you really going there?

350
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,260
That is the god's territory.

351
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,260
I won't let you down.

352
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,260
He will definitely go there.

353
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,260
No matter what, I will find him.

354
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,260
Have you ever thought that

355
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,260
Kain might not be your brother anymore?

356
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
Even so,

357
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,260
I can also change him back.

358
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,260
Let's get up.

359
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,260
Teacher.

360
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,260
Your injury is not good.

361
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,260
And Kain

362
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,260
is also my student.

363
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,260
I won't let you face the danger alone.

364
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,260
I won't let you face the danger alone.
