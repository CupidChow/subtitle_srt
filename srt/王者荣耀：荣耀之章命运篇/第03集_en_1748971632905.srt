1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
Quickly save the Uhh...

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,040
You can save 37K for Ð» short time.

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,660
Slice.

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,420
Okay.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,420
Here's what happens only after you destroyed perbecausekeys.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,720
To What

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,780
is

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,900
what

9
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:58,380
is

10
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,780
I won't disappear.

11
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,700
I will always be there for you.

12
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,020
But...

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,620
But I'm still very afraid.

14
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,660
If you're afraid,

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,620
just let us handle the situation.

16
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,660
No matter what happens,

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,700
I will protect you.

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,820
When I'm afraid,

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,940
I will protect you.

20
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,380
I will protect you.

21
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,380
I will protect you.

22
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,380
I will protect you.

23
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
Brother.

24
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,380
Hold on.

25
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,900
Wait for me.

26
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,380
I might die before I die.

27
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,380
Do you know what my life condition is?

28
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,380
The dragon is more brave than the arrow.

29
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,380
I will remove the curse and end the sea capital.

30
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,380
This stone is the god we want to challenge.

31
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,380
Do you know that?

32
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,380
I know.

33
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,380
I know.

34
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,380
I know.

35
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,380
I know.

36
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,380
I know.

37
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,380
I know.

38
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,380
I know.

39
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,380
I know.

40
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,380
I know.

41
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,380
I know.

42
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,380
He is the source of the curse.

43
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,380
Yes.

44
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,380
The god's curse

45
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,380
is still in the prison.

46
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,380
The god's curse

47
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,380
Why doesn't he move?

48
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,380
Wait.

49
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,380
Wait.

50
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
Wait.

51
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,380
What is going on?

52
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,380
He is taking our power.

53
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,380
He might be stronger.

54
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,380
This is not a way.

55
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,380
Disperse his attention.

56
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,380
Let's go.

57
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,380
Run.

58
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,380
You have a chance.

59
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,380
You have a chance.

60
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,380
The human of the village.

61
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,380
I have given you my power.

62
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,380
Now

63
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,380
it's time to return.

64
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,380
When he takes our power,

65
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,380
the curse will stop.

66
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,380
If so,

67
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,380
I will return it to you.

68
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
Let go of me.

69
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,380
You are good at all the magic.

70
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,380
You are useless.

71
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
Who will take revenge?

72
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,380
I will take revenge.

73
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,380
No.

74
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,380
No.

75
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,380
No.

76
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,380
You are so good.

77
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,380
You can take the power.

78
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,380
Because of his body.

79
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,380
Now

80
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,380
there is only one soul left.

81
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
I have been sleeping for too long.

82
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,380
I missed so many interesting things.

83
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,380
Our god's curse has let you down.

84
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,380
You have given us the curse.

85
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,380
I will take revenge.

86
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,380
I will take revenge.

87
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,380
Why?

88
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,380
You.

89
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,380
You are a liar.

90
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,380
You are so greedy.

91
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,380
You betrayed my words.

92
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,380
You used my face.

93
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,380
You used me to beg for mercy.

94
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,380
You only took away my power.

95
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,380
And you also punished me

96
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,380
with your sins.

97
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,380
The curse is your punishment.

98
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,380
Punishment?

99
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,380
So this is the truth.

100
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,380
Your sins

101
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,380
are the most precious.

102
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,380
I will take revenge.

103
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,380
I will take the punishment.

104
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,380
You have no idea.

105
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,380
The god's will

106
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
cannot be eliminated.

107
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,380
From the moment you were god

108
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,380
you were beaten by the most powerful.

109
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,380
You can never be eliminated.

110
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,380
You are so greedy.

111
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,380
No matter what you do

112
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,380
you will never change.

113
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,380
You are punished by the god.

114
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,380
Even so

115
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,380
I will let this fate

116
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,380
be my witness.

117
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,380
You.

118
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,380
Why are you here?

119
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,380
You.

120
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,380
Lu Na.

121
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,380
You.

122
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,380
You are not here for yourself.

123
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,380
Am I right?

124
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,380
How do you know?

125
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,380
He found out

126
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,380
that you are not the one who is punished.

127
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,380
You are not.

128
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,380
You are your sister.

129
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,380
You are the one who is punished.

130
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,380
The god and the beast

131
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,380
are all for your sister.

132
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,380
This is your biggest secret.

133
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,380
This is a secret.

134
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,380
It must be a forever secret.

135
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,380
Your sins

136
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,380
are all for your greed and selfishness.

137
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,380
Although I still hate them

138
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,380
but you and those people are different.

139
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,380
I will give you

140
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,380
the god's will.

141
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,380
I will give you

142
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,380
the god's protection.

143
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,380
With your spirit

144
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,380
you can release these spirits

145
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,380
and make them free from the power of the god.

146
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,380
But

147
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,380
your mission of the Shiyi family

148
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,380
is never to be destroyed.

149
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,380
The god and the beast

150
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,380
will never give up

151
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,380
their power to the people.

152
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,380
I don't understand

153
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,380
why you have to do this.

154
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,380
When you have something to protect

155
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,380
I understand.

156
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,380
I understand.

157
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,380
You are so funny.

158
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,380
Master.

159
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,380
Give me the money.

160
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,380
I need it.

161
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,380
No.

162
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,380
I took my sister

163
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,380
and took her away.

164
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,380
I need to take her away.

165
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,380
No.

166
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,380
I will take her away.

167
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,380
No.

168
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,380
No.

169
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,380
I will take her away.

170
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,380
No.

171
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,380
No.

172
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,380
I took my sister

173
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
and took the money from the judge

174
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,380
but I couldn't take the real case.

175
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
You also broke the law.

176
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,380
You didn't break the law.

177
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,380
You did it.

178
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
You were punished

179
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,380
by the ancestors.

180
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,380
Why did you break the law?

181
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,380
I didn't know what happened.

182
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,380
What happened?

183
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380
Qingxu was the only one with me.

184
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,380
But he didn't even ask me

185
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
and he wanted to kill me.

186
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,380
I have to find a way to protect him.

187
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,380
No.

188
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,380
No.

189
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,380
You are so coward.

190
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,380
I have been fighting against the mortal

191
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,380
for decades.

192
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,380
I should be punished.

193
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,380
No.

194
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,380
Kaeyin.

195
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,380
You are so weird.

196
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,380
Just blame us.

197
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,380
No.

198
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,380
You are so strong.

199
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,380
You are so annoying.

200
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
I will let you go.

201
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,380
You can't run away.

202
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,380
Kaeyin has become a devil.

203
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,380
Kill him.

204
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,380
You are so annoying.

205
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,380
You are so annoying.

206
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,380
Kill him.

207
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,380
Kill him.

208
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,380
Kill him.

209
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,380
Kill him.

210
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,380
Kill him.

211
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,380
Kill him.

212
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,380
Kill him.

213
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,380
Kill him.

214
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,380
Kill him.

215
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,380
Kill him.

216
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,380
Kill him.

217
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,380
Kill him.

218
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,380
You are so annoying.

219
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,380
Kill him.

220
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,380
Kaeyin.

221
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,380
Kaeyin.

222
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,380
Kaeyin.

223
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,380
You are so annoying.

224
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,380
I don't need you.

225
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,380
Kaeyin.

226
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,380
You are still my brother.

227
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,380
Right?

228
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,380
Let go.

229
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,380
Have you forgotten?

230
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,380
You promised you will control yourself.

231
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,380
We will never be separated.

232
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,380
We will never be separated.

233
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,380
Kaeyin.

234
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,380
It's been three years.

235
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,380
You don't have any faith.

236
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,380
Kaeyin.

237
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,380
Kaeyin.

238
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,380
Don't listen to me.

239
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,380
I am not here.

240
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,380
When your brother is still scared,

241
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,380
you can protect him.

242
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,380
We will never be separated.

243
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,380
I am no longer your brother.

244
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,380
Kaeyin.

245
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,380
I didn't expect this would happen.

246
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,380
Help me watch Luna.

247
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,380
You want to go back?

248
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,380
You are alone.

249
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,380
But you are still fighting against the whole sea.

250
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,380
I don't understand.

251
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,380
You were ambushed by the criminal.

252
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,380
You almost died here.

253
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,380
But why?

254
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,380
There was a woman who was against your sister.

255
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,380
I will take this fate alone.

256
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,380
Since that,

257
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,380
why didn't you promise me?

258
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,380
Some things

259
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,380
can't be traded.

260
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,380
Some things can't be traded.

261
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,380
You are really interesting.

262
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Some things are greedy.

263
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,380
Some lies are betraying the spirit.

264
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,380
Some things are not worth the effort

265
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,380
to survive.

266
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,380
Some things are killing

267
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,380
the spirit of God.

268
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,380
But you are different.

269
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,380
I feel the same way

270
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,380
as my former owner.

271
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,380
I feel the same way.

272
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,380
I am a warrior.

273
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,380
But I feel the same way

274
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,380
as the noble God.

275
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,380
I finally

276
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,380
got a small family.

277
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,380
I don't understand

278
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,380
why he did this.

279
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,380
I want to know

280
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,380
what the feelings

281
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,380
are.

282
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,380
But he

283
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,380
can't answer me.

284
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,380
You

285
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,380
don't care about me.

286
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,380
You don't want to give me the key.

287
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,380
You want me to know this.

288
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
This answer

289
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,380
is not important.

290
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,380
It's not important.

291
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,380
I want to call you.

292
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,380
I can't hear my voice.

293
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,380
I dream of a dark shadow.

294
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,380
I can't get out of it.

295
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,380
I am not a dark shadow.

296
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,380
I am in the light.

297
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,380
I can't see my heart.

298
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,380
I ask myself

299
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,380
how to change the rules.

300
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:50,380
I am a dark shadow.

301
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,380
I can't get out of it.

302
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,380
I can only get back to the clear.

303
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,380
I am a strong voice.

304
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,380
I am a voice of the same.

305
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,380
I am a brave, kind,

306
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,380
and brave smile.

307
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,380
I am a memory.

308
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,380
I am a memory.

309
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
I am a memory.

310
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,380
I am a memory.

311
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,380
I am a memory.

312
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,380
Who can define?

313
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,380
I don't know how to explain.

314
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,380
I am a sweet, sweet,

315
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,380
and innocent smile.

316
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:37,380
I am a memory.

317
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,380
I am a memory.

318
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
I am a memory.

319
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,380
I am a memory.

320
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,380
I am a memory.

321
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,380
I am a memory.

322
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,380
I am a memory.

323
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,380
I can't get out of it.

324
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,380
I am a memory.

325
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,380
I am a light.

326
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,380
I am afraid that the sky

327
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,840
will find it

328
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,380
or carries fate.

329
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,840
I take rest for this day.

330
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,380
I am a immortal.

331
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,380
I am all set.

332
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,080
Fight with us.

333
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,380
Fight with us.

334
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,440
you
