00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,208
=Blemish Flaw=

2
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,832
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,079
What's the rush? So annoying.

4
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,719
Your driving style resembles mine.

5
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,200
The way you curse.

6
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,599
So you also keep

7
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,680
a sharp lookout

8
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,200
while cursing everything?

9
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,439
Cursing those cutting in

10
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,079
and wouldn't let us cut in.

11
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,599
Cursing the drivers when biking

12
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,159
and cursing the bikers when driving.

13
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,280
Yeah.

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,000
Now that I can't drive anymore,

15
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,239
I realize how rude

16
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:57,920
I used to be.

17
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,400
Why do I feel

18
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,120
that you're trash-talking me?

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,120
Did you curse this much

20
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,400
on the rides with your ex?

21
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,359
No.

22
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,319
Got this right after

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,479
my ex and I split.

24
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,639
A who-knows-what-hand car.

25
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,120
Put up with it, rich lady.

26
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,840
I like your

27
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,879
high chassis car.

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,000
Nice visibility.

29
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,080
And I haven't

30
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,759
sat in the passenger seat for ages.

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,080
So your husband

32
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,879
drives a luxury car with spacious

33
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,879
back seats,

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,080
unlike my car

35
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,120
with its cramped back.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,719
Where do you live?

37
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,800
Which direction?

38
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,360
Take me back to the cafe.

39
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:31,960
Still worried

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,280
when I'm dressed like this?

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,800
When he finishes work early,

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,759
he picks me up.

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,560
What does he do?

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,719
He's an artist.

45
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,080
Impressive.

46
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,439
What kind of art?

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,759
Can you drive or not?

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,879
That car cut in.

49
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,080
What's the hurry? Off to reincarnate?

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,240
You're actually

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,360
adding me on WeChat?

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,199
Scan the code.

53
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,439
I'll see if I accept

54
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,439
your friend request.

55
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,599
You seem in a good mood today.

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,080
See you around.

57
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,120
Zeng Jie.

58
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,680
I suddenly remembered someone.

59
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,280
Who?

60
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Liu Wei.

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,840
What do you want?

62
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,800
It just crossed my mind.

63
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,879
You want to dig up

64
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,159
the messes again?

65
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,000
I didn't mean to bring it up

66
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,919
or pick a fight.

67
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,960
I just...

68
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,000
What do you want,

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,639
Bai Xiaoling?

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,639
It amuses you

71
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,439
to bring it up?

72
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,400
No.

73
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,879
Sometimes, I even wonder

74
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
if it was karma

75
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,879
that made me unable to walk.

76
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,272
I shouldn't have mentioned her.

77
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,479
I know we agreed

78
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,319
to let the past stay buried

79
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,520
and no one

80
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,879
shall mention it again.

81
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,759
Let's go home.

82
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,319
You'll have to

83
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,719
go back to work again.

84
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,520
Forget it.

85
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,639
We're almost home.

86
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll go alone.

87
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,959
I could use some fresh air.

88
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,360
Please grab my wheelchair.

89
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,120
Bai Xiaoling.

90
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,360
I don't know

91
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,160
what got into you.

92
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,720
But last year, we agreed

93
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,480
not to mention this ever again.

94
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,279
Let me remind you.

95
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:08,959
We agreed that

96
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,160
whoever wanted

97
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,040
a divorce

98
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,680
could bring it up.

99
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,399
Tell me.

100
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,639
You want a divorce again?

101
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,519
No.

102
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,439
You haven't even returned

103
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,279
my parents' money.

104
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,040
How can I divorce you?

105
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,600
I shouldn't have

106
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,639
brought it up.

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,920
From now on,

108
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,480
I won't mention it again.

109
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,079
(Yeah.)

110
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,439
(She's pretty,)

111
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,000
(classy,)

112
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,439
(and loaded.)

113
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,920
(Many people think)

114
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,959
(I married the perfect woman.)

115
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,000
(But they don't know)

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,920
that she often

117
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,879
says hurtful things

118
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,000
in the coldest tone.

119
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,439
And she always had that look of contempt

120
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,199
for it.

121
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,519
I'm an artist, a professor.

122
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,839
She's just a new rich's daughter.

123
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,439
Yet she carries

124
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,439
this sense of

125
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,920
superiority and coldness.

126
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,120
Maybe it's because

127
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,480
she grew up in privilege

128
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,600
with too many suitors.

129
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,079
She thinks all men

130
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,560
should revolve around her?

131
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,000
She wants

132
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,319
evidence of your infidelity

133
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,040
to claim your assets.

134
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,040
Didn't you say

135
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,319
her family's rich?

136
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,319
Who doesn't want more money?

137
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,959
We have substantial joint assets.

138
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,600
She probably wants me

139
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,279
to leave empty-handed.

140
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,639
Fortunately,

141
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,439
I'm the one she hired

142
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,759
to help her.

143
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,560
Why did you tell me

144
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,000
that you're sent by Bai Xiaoling

145
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,240
to trap me in adultery?

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
She told me to smash

147
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
your artwork.

148
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,600
She said

149
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,000
you would only be glad

150
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,319
and not mad.

151
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,959
She really knows you well.

152
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,240
You did it.

153
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,959
But when I saw you,

154
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,279
I fell for you.

155
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,879
I wasn't interested in ceramics

156
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,560
or blemish flaws.

157
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,120
But you showed me

158
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,319
that even mud can be extraordinary.

159
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,199
That with heartfelt.

160
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,240
I didn't even like

161
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,560
my first love this much.

162
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,279
The men I met before

163
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,399
were all worthless.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,839
Overambitious college boys,

165
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,639
aimless and broke drifters,

166
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,759
tasteless rich kids who only show off.

167
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,000
And someone who resents

168
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,439
being ordinary

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,879
yet remains average like my ex.

170
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,199
No one is your match.

171
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,480
Though I know

172
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,079
we don't have

173
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,040
a future together,

174
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,560
I still can't help

175
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,399
liking you.

176
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,879
How do you know

177
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,759
we don't have a future?

178
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,600
Master Zeng,

179
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,559
could you tolerate someone

180
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,240
full of blemish flaws like me?

181
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,799
I'd even seduce

182
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,960
a married man for money.

183
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,039
But you're genuine.

184
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,440
I can't lie to myself.

185
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,440
I've fallen for you.

186
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,000
So,

187
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,360
I have more crucial evidence.

188
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,960
Half a million for this.

189
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,080
How much did my wife pay you?

190
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,200
300,000.

191
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,039
200,000 balance.

192
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,080
It never occurred to you

193
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,000
to make a copy for her too?

194
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,399
I like you,

195
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,799
not her.

196
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,240
200,000 yuan.

197
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,320
What if you change your mind?

198
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,200
I'm this crazy about you,

199
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,759
but you still don't trust me?

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Fine then.

201
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,399
I secretly recorded a video

202
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,879
when your wife

203
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,799
came to me.

204
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,039
She was captured

205
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,799
telling me to seduce you

206
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,879
and secure evidence.

207
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,240
You recorded that?

208
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,679
Yeah.

209
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,519
I was afraid

210
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,639
she wouldn't pay up.

211
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
That video will be useful to you.

212
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,679
With that,

213
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,679
would you still fear her?

214
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,559
Do you think I'd fear her?

215
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,679
I've wanted to end this marriage

216
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,480
for a while.

217
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,519
And

218
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,480
I like you too.

219
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,440
Too bad.

220
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,919
I can't accept blemish flaws either.

221
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,639
Cheating is a red line.

222
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,799
Remember?

223
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,919
When we first started dating,

224
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,840
I broke up with my ex first.

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,279
I only accept cash.

226
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,960
Your wife also paid me in cash.

227
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,039
800,000 in cash.

228
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,840
You should have it ready soon, right?

229
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,399
My brother-in-law.

230
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,320
You're back.

231
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,039
What a coincidence.

232
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,480
I was just leaving.

233
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,120
You're here again.

234
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,879
I had business in the city

235
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,039
and came to check on my brother-in-law.

236
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,360
I've told you not to

237
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,159
call me that.

238
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,000
I never married your sister.

239
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,159
So what if you didn't marry her?

240
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,440
You'll always

241
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,960
be my brother-in-law.

242
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,039
Besides,

243
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,039
there's no one else in the car.

244
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,279
Your wife isn't here.

245
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,360
What's her name again?

246
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,320
Bai Xiaoling, right?

247
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,519
If you came back with a woman,

248
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,639
even if she wasn't your wife,

249
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,320
I'd pretend not to know you.

250
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,879
When have I ever caused you trouble?

251
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,480
But my sister

252
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,000
isn't so lucky.

253
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,080
The fortune teller said she's

254
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,120
destined to be poor.

255
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,159
She wasn't lucky enough

256
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,960
to marry you.

257
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,159
What can we do?

258
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,639
But I'm lucky enough

259
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,919
to have you as my brother-in-law.

260
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,840
Wait here.

261
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,360
That's all?

262
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,679
I don't have cash.

263
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
I'll give you my bank account.

264
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,320
I told you.

265
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
No bank transfers.

266
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,080
Are you scared?

267
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,519
Are you scared that people will

268
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
find out about me

269
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,399
or the fact that

270
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,960
I have a sister?

271
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,120
How much more?

272
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,639
Don't make it sound like
I'm extorting you.

273
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,720
I need to renovate the hometown house

274
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,919
and my sister's place needs repair.

275
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,279
Not much.

276
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,200
100,000.

277
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,279
Come next week.

278
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,519
But inform me

279
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,440
before you come.

280
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,799
Alright.

281
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,200
Then I'll make another trip.

282
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,879
Lin Shan.

283
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,559
I've been giving you

284
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,519
what you ask for.

285
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,080
But remember.

286
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,159
Keep your mouth shut.

287
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,200
My lips are sealed.

288
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,039
If I spill the beans,

289
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,399
and make your rich wife

290
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,879
divorce you...

291
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,759
Wait,

292
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,759
your wife

293
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,879
broke her legs.

294
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,519
She can't leave you anyway.

295
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
Brother-in-law,

296
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,440
you've got it made now.

297
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,840
Listen, Lin Shan.

298
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,559
If you want money,

299
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,320
keep your mouth shut.

300
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,960
Zeng Jie.

301
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,080
You're my brother-in-law,

302
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,639
not my older brother.

303
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,159
Don't yell at me.

304
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,000
Aren't you some kind of artist?

305
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,080
Be civilized and polite.

306
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,679
You hear me?

307
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,679
I'm off.

308
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:38,960
By the way.

309
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,759
When are you changing your car?

310
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,320
Let me know when you do.

311
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,039
Let me drive it.

312
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,879
Dispose of all these.

313
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,879
And those trashy works

314
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,480
with blemish flaws.

315
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,559
Don't keep a single one!

316
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,039
Bring me those.

317
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,840
What a pity.

318
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,320
You still lack attention to detail.

319
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,320
If you controlled

320
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,480
the temperature better,

321
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,799
would these issues occur?

322
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:32,759
Professor Zeng.

323
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,200
Are we smashing all these?

324
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,000
How many times have I told you?

325
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,639
Without perfectionist standards,

326
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,159
how can you create masterpieces?

327
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,320
Professor, he...

328
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,159
It's you again?

329
00:16:08,544 --> 00:16:09,312
Want an interview?

330
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,320
Isn't it a waste

331
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,039
to smash

332
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,840
all these pieces?

333
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,120
I get rid of artworks

334
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,159
with blemish flaws.

335
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,679
You know

336
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,399
blemish flaws.

337
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:16,960
Yeah.

338
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,440
Wei explained it to me.

339
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,120
Who is this Wei to you?

340
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,320
My ex.

341
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,200
When did you break up?

342
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,039
Last year.

343
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,320
You've been looking for her?

344
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,840
No, just these past few days.

345
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,080
When was

346
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,960
the last time

347
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:29,919
you saw Liu Wei?

348
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,039
I don't know her.

349
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
We've never met.

350
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:38,919
Why don't you check

351
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,720
your contacts?

352
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,480
My friend.

353
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,919
I don't get what you're doing.

354
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,679
But I won't intervene.

355
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,639
Likewise,

356
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,240
I don't want you

357
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,399
to keep harassing me

358
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,799
for no reason.

359
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,919
I don't care what grudges

360
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,799
you have with her

361
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,159
that you're looking for her

362
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,279
after a year.

363
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,000
This is your private matter.

364
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,120
I won't interfere.

365
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Just don't come

366
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,639
ever again.

367
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,200
Professor Zeng,

368
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,079
did you study acting?

369
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,279
You act like

370
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,519
you really don't know her.

371
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,400
I don't know her.

372
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,880
Nor do I know you.

373
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,720
Leave my studio now.

374
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,400
Framing me?

375
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:22,112
Call the police.

376
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:22,960
Call the police?

377
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,000
Call the police?

378
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,839
He damaged your work.

379
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,640
These were flawed pieces

380
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,119
to be discarded.

381
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,039
This is my student's

382
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,160
completed work

383
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,319
despite the blemish flaws.

384
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,480
We can discard it.

385
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,599
But you have no right

386
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,279
to do so.

387
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,880
You barged into my studio

388
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,160
and destroyed our works.

389
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,440
So I'm calling the police.

390
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,960
You turn out to be so shameless.

391
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,079
Save your words

392
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,359
for the police.

393
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,359
How much is this worth?

394
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,480
Don't scam me.

395
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,480
Why did you smash

396
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,519
his porcelain?

397
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,079
I just

398
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,039
pulled him a bit.

399
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,279
And he threw the porcelain

400
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,359
onto the ground.

401
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,440
And when I arrived,

402
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,039
they were smashing those.

403
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,680
Those were flawed pieces

404
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,839
to be disposed of.

405
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,599
He set you up?

406
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,720
He has something to do

407
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,839
with Wei's disappearance.

408
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,720
He's been hostile

409
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,279
toward me the whole time.

410
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
If he wasn't guilty,

411
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
why would he do this?

412
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,200
Speculations

413
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:22,920
don't work.

414
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,359
Speculations put us

415
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,160
on the right track.

416
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,119
In that case,

417
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,599
I'll uncover the truth.

418
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,519
Have you eaten yet?

419
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,640
I came straight

420
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,200
from work. What do you think?

421
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,599
Have you analyzed

422
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,039
the online information

423
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,599
about Zeng Jie?

424
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,680
What information?

425
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,599
Zeng Jie fought his way up

426
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,359
on his own.

427
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,400
His family was poor.

428
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,759
He took part-time jobs

429
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,960
and scholarships

430
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,799
in college.

431
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,079
But he suddenly

432
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,759
got rich during

433
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,759
his graduate years.

434
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,640
He even drove to school.

435
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,240
Upon graduation,

436
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,720
he stayed as a lecturer.

437
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,920
He kept winning awards

438
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
in the following years.

439
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,599
Then he got married

440
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,440
to a business family heiress,

441
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,240
who is wealthy.

442
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,240
So he met his wife

443
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,480
during graduate years.

444
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,160
He latched onto a rich lady.

445
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,119
This makes perfect sense now.

446
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,000
Zeng Jie used his wife's money

447
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:18,960
to change his life.

448
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,200
That's why he couldn't

449
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,880
let anyone discover his affair.

450
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,240
That's right.

451
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,880
I bet his wife has no idea

452
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,000
about his infidelity.

453
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,640
Why are you so sure?

454
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,880
I'm almost certain.

455
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,000
Just need to dig deeper.

456
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,240
Want to

457
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,359
talk to his wife?

458
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,279
That's clearly

459
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,279
a viable path.

460
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,039
Don't worry.

461
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,559
I won't act recklessly.

462
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,799
Everything will stay
within legal boundaries.

463
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,960
Finally getting on track.

464
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,720
You also suspect

465
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,599
Zeng Jie, right?

466
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,160
What else

467
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,880
did you find?

468
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,119
The rest seems

469
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,000
pretty useless.

470
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,559
Same info online.

471
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,359
No, no.

472
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,240
Basic info is crucial.

473
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,680
The details you shared

474
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,680
with me today

475
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,640
are vital.

476
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,880
I always assumed

477
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,559
Zeng Jie's success

478
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,920
came easily.

479
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,160
But he turned out to be

480
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,079
a common guy who'd endured hardships.

481
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,279
That's important.

482
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,519
How?

483
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,599
How is it important?

484
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:13,920
Imagine a market

485
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
with security guards.

486
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,359
The captain retires,

487
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,200
and promotes

488
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,319
a subordinate.

489
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,079
To prove

490
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,400
himself worthy as a leader,

491
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,240
he'll be stricter

492
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,680
with former colleagues

493
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,839
more than necessary.

494
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,200
He won't hesitate to scold

495
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,079
and punish them.

496
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,279
Even a minor mistake

497
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,319
calls for punishment.

498
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,400
And he won't hesitate to fire anyone.

499
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,559
People's mindsets change
with their status.

500
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,519
To climb the social ladder,

501
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,319
one must pay their dues.

502
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,319
Yeah.

503
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,680
If Zeng Jie came from a poor family

504
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,440
and worked his way up,

505
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,480
he would do anything it takes

506
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,400
to maintain his status

507
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,279
and lifestyle.

508
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,200
I really hope you're wrong.

509
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,279
So little faith in me?

510
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
It's not about faith.

511
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,880
If you're wrong,

512
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,359
Wei will be safe.

513
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,799
It is the best.

514
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,520
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to her.

515
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,480
Ma'am.

516
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,559
Two packs of these.

517
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,359
And a lollipop.

518
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,410
Alright.

519
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,119
Ma'am.

520
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,680
Where can I find

521
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,200
a painter in this village?

522
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,319
Painter of what?

523
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,519
Just regular paintings.

524
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,960
Everywhere.

525
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,920
E-Everywhere?

526
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,720
Only we run this store.

527
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,319
All the other are painters.

528
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,279
All the others?

529
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,720
Do they actually make money?

530
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:44,960
Young man.

531
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,920
We have to make ends meet somehow.

532
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,599
Sir.

533
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,279
Can I ask about someone?

534
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,640
Who?

535
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,000
Have you ever

536
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,119
hired a man

537
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,920
called Zeng Jie?

538
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,200
Zeng Jie?

539
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,200
Do we have a Zeng Jie here?

540
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:10,680
No.

541
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,119
Nobody by that name.

542
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,475
What painting do you want?

543
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,480
He paints...

544
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,839
We paint Van Gogh replicas here.

545
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,240
What style are you aiming for?

546
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,240
This is how it works?

547
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,119
We have to paint different stuff.

548
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,880
Each village

549
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,000
has a specialty.

550
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,440
See across the road?

551
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:27,640
Gauguin replicas.

552
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,720
Monet replicas further east.

553
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,480
Pissarro replicas behind that.

554
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,079
All impressionist stuff.

555
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,960
We used to do Picasso cubism

556
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,960
and Dadaism.

557
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,839
But business dried up.

558
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,799
Now we're

559
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,039
sticking to impressionism.

560
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,839
We haven't heard of Zeng Jie.

561
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,200
Thanks.

562
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,599
I'll ask around.

563
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,759
Take care.

564
00:22:51,924 --> 00:22:55,040
(Bulk purchase discounts available)

565
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:06,799
Sir.

566
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:07,880
Sir.

567
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:08,896
Want a painting?

568
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:09,559
No.

569
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm looking for someone.

570
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:11,920
Have you ever

571
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,039
hired a guy

572
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,119
called Zeng Jie?

573
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,359
Zeng, you said?

574
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,680
I think

575
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,680
someone was by that surname.

576
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:20,880
Handsome Zeng.

577
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,720
Handsome Zeng?

578
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,039
I forgot his real name.

579
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,680
Last name Zeng, handsome guy.

580
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,319
Everyone called him Handsome Zeng.

581
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,000
Now I remember.

582
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,640
That was seven or eight years back.

583
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,559
No way.

584
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,039
It was a decade ago.

585
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,200
Back then, your kid

586
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
wasn't even born.

587
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,640
That guy was something.

588
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,720
He could paint two canvases at once.

589
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,880
Simultaneously?

590
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,880
He had fast hands.

591
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,480
But he was fierce

592
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,240
and earned way more than others.

593
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,000
His family was poor.

594
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,440
So he had to work hard.

595
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:03,880
So hardworking?

596
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,640
I need money.

597
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,759
My dad's in the hospital.

598
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,720
We can't borrow
a single penny from anyone.

599
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,880
Where am I supposed

600
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
to get 400,000 yuan?

601
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,119
And I got accepted

602
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,559
into graduate school.

603
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,240
Even if I get scholarships,

604
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,599
there are daily expenses.

605
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,359
How much do you sell this for?

606
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,240
Water Lilies sells for 500 yuan.

607
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,359
Wholesale's 350 yuan.

608
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Sunrise is trending.

609
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,119
Each sells for 50 yuan more.

610
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,079
The gallery bought these.

611
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,519
Each sells for 2000 to 3000.

612
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:33,559
I get 150

613
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,480
per painting.

614
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,759
These artworks

615
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,240
aren't that expensive.

616
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,039
You call this artwork?

617
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,960
This is just replication.

618
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,200
Zero creativity.

619
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,680
At best, it's a craft.

620
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,359
No.

621
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,039
Not even a craft.

622
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,279
It's garbage.

623
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:55,839
Trash.

624
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,519
So he made money

625
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,599
and left?

626
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,319
What money?

627
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,519
He's no Monet.

628
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,279
He paints one per day.

629
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,759
That's just over 100 yuan.

630
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,279
To save up 400,000 yuan,

631
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,799
he'd need 3000 paintings

632
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,039
without eating or drinking.

633
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,119
He went to school.

634
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,079
He could've kept painting,

635
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,759
but he never showed up.

636
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,039
Perfect timing.

637
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,240
I just sorted out

638
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
old photos on my phone.

639
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,160
He's here.

640
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,039
You have his photo?

641
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,960
Look, this is our group photo.

642
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,680
This one.

643
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,680
That's him.

644
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,920
Yeah, that's him.

645
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,319
Who's the woman next to him?

646
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,359
I think it's Lin Fang.

647
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,039
She was Gauguin's sales rep.

648
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,160
Lin Fang?

649
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,200
Was she somehow involved

650
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,519
with this guy?

651
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,440
What do you mean by involved?

652
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,640
But I do know a woman

653
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,839
who often came to see him.

654
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:58,880
A rich woman, right?

655
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,079
A rich woman?

656
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,759
Yeah.

657
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,559
You've seen her?

658
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,200
That sports car?

659
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah.

660
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,400
Handsome guys have it good.

661
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,720
I wish some rich lady would

662
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,519
come find me.

663
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,000
Look at your face.

664
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,359
Unless those rich ladies

665
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,200
are blind.

666
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,400
Sir.

667
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,079
Can you send me

668
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,799
that photo

669
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,480
on your phone?

670
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,039
Okay.

671
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,559
Also,

672
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,920
do you have

673
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,039
Lin Fang's contact info?

674
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,680
What?

675
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,119
I'm obviously working right now.

676
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:30,920
Really?

677
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,160
You actually tracked down

678
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,359
where he worked?

679
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,880
Lin Fang?

680
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:40,864
(Big Hui)

681
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,160
What was that photo

682
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,880
you sent me?

683
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,680
Lin Fang was close to Zeng Jie.

684
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,279
It took a lot of digging.

685
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,079
But for some reason,

686
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,319
I can't reach her.

687
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,759
She might be the key.

688
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,960
I bet there was something between them.

689
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What do you mean?

690
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,559
It's just a group photo.

691
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,200
Dude.

692
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,200
Be more observant.

693
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,160
Look closely. Zoom in.

694
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:07,680
Wasn't Lin Fang

695
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,839
looking at Zeng Jie?

696
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:09,599
Yeah.

697
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,160
The photo is a bit blurry,

698
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,599
but look closely and tell me,

699
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,119
doesn't it look like

700
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,119
she was in love?

701
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,839
And she had paint

702
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,279
all over her wrists.

703
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,200
She's a salesperson,

704
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,079
not a painter.

705
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,639
How'd she get paint on her?

706
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,839
Even if she grabbed something,

707
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,400
the paint wouldn't be there.

708
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,839
Now look at Zeng Jie.

709
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Hands covered in paint.

710
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,079
Clearly, he had been

711
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,400
grabbing Lin Fang's hands.

712
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,119
Indeed.

713
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,559
Who is this Lin Fang?

714
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,839
Based on my deductions,

715
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,640
and you know my reasoning skills

716
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
are solid,

717
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,000
Lin Fang was

718
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,519
Zeng Jie's secret girlfriend

719
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,079
from his early years.

720
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,119
Zeng Jie

721
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,759
did come from a poor family

722
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:49,599
and had no money.

723
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,839
But people at the Artist Village told me

724
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,839
that a rich woman

725
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,480
had been visiting Zeng Jie.

726
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,440
Whether that was his wife,

727
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,119
I'll have to

728
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,920
find out somehow.

729
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,640
You'll see his wife again?

730
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,200
Watch your mouth.

731
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,519
It's for investigation.

732
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,559
You find it

733
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,799
honorable to lie to her?

734
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,279
How is this lying?

735
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,599
If Zeng Jie is a wolf

736
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,480
in sheep's clothing

737
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,319
as we suspect,

738
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,440
then we're saving his wife

739
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,359
from disaster.

740
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,200
She doesn't look

741
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,960
like a bad person.

742
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,799
Alright, let me sort things out.

743
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:24,736
(Meeting Zeng Jie, September 30, 2019)

744
00:28:27,891 --> 00:28:29,056
(Friend request accepted)

745
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,759
Took you a whole day to cheer up?

746
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:34,304
(Fire outbreak)

747
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,440
I'm just okay. What are you doing?

748
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,079
Thinking through some things.

749
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,240
(Fire outbreak)
I didn't have time

750
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:44,400
(November 24, 2018)
to meet you at the cafe.

751
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,599
You should be busy.

752
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,720
I added you as an update reminder.

753
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,319
Update reminder?

754
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:00,319
Yeah.

755
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,160
I've watched all your videos.

756
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,960
Nothing left.

757
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
(Married: 2016)
Upload more.

758
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,400
Thanks.

759
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,480
Did you like, save,

760
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,440
or follow me?

761
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,079
No.

762
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,005
(Dating)
When will you upload a new one?

763
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,079
I've been busy.

764
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,480
Plus, no inspiration.

765
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
You know how it is.

766
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,079
Without inspiration,

767
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,240
it's impossible.

768
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,880
(Zeng Jie's wife)
What if you lose followers?

769
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,160
It terrifies me.

770
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,079
But I lose more followers

771
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,920
if I make videos without inspiration.

772
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,279
(Wealthy)

773
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:34,720
Alright.

774
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,559
Fine.

775
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,359
I'll delete you.

776
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,039
Come on. You just added me.

777
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,240
Why delete me?

778
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,759
Big Hui.

779
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,119
I'm a disabled married woman.

780
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,000
Are you that desperate?

781
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,119
Am I not

782
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,039
a caregiver to you?

783
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,440
Here's a tip for you.

784
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,119
After the accident,

785
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,839
my husband manages all our finances.

786
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,640
If you want a sugar mama,

787
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,839
I can't help you.

788
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:05,960
Don't make me

789
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,720
sound so nasty.

790
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,039
There should be

791
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,559
basic trust.

792
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,799
I won't delete you today.

793
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,559
Maybe when I'm in a better mood.

794
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm going to bed.

795
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:18,799
Goodbye.

796
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,160
Zeng Jie.

797
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,319
Bai Xiaoling.

798
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Why did you fall for Zeng Jie?

799
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:43,880
You probably don't know

800
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,119
about Wei.

801
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,200
So,

802
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,640
do you know

803
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,839
Zeng Jie's secret?

804
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,160
So?

805
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,039
Bai Xiaoling is a businesswoman

806
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,680
and a second-generation rich kid.

807
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,359
Her company

808
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,960
was funded by her parents.

809
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,559
Her parents are retired.

810
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,160
Her dad's been in the hospital

811
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,039
because of a stroke

812
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,079
or something.

813
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,000
It's been

814
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:37,799
over a year.

815
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,240
Her husband's a professor

816
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,680
and a famous

817
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:42,599
ceramics master.

818
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,039
What about her?

819
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,799
She graduated from a mediocre college,

820
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,440
studying management.

821
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:48,839
She didn't seem

822
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,759
so hardworking.

823
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,000
She was traveling

824
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,160
and organizing

825
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,240
club activities.

826
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,599
She was a good dancer.

827
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,359
Too bad

828
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,119
she can't stand now.

829
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Where'd you get this?

830
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,480
You asked me to investigate.

831
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,200
So I scraped data

832
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,039
from all her contacts

833
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:07,119
and associates' social media

834
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,640
I could get my hands on.

835
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,400
But her husband

836
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
barely uses

837
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,000
social media.

838
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,119
He's either super disciplined

839
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,599
or extremely cautious.

840
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,359
What did you find?

841
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,000
Bai Xiaoling

842
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
had many suitors in school.

843
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,599
But she only had one boyfriend.

844
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,720
An older alumnus.

845
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,799
After graduation, he went abroad.

846
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,799
She stayed single for years.

847
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,559
Then she got married

848
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,119
three years ago.

849
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,839
How's marriage like?

850
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,240
No idea.

851
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,279
I've never been married.

852
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,280
I'm asking about Bai Xiaoling.

853
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,759
She only posted

854
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
superficial stuff

855
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
after she got married.

856
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,400
I can't tell much.

857
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,119
But others' comments

858
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,279
show that

859
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,519
people quite envy her.

860
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,200
She has an admirer

861
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,160
named Zhang Ye.

862
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,759
He kept liking

863
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,039
her posts

864
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,960
and kissing up to her.

865
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,519
But last December,

866
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,880
he disappeared.

867
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,279
I think he got blocked.

868
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,799
I don't think

869
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,000
he would give up so easily.

870
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,599
Nothing else?

871
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,200
This is all

872
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,319
I could dig up.

873
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,960
Dude,

874
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,440
I'm not a cop.

875
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,319
This is

876
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,519
good enough.

877
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,319
Fine.

878
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,279
I didn't expect you

879
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,279
to surprise me anyway.

880
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,559
I spent two hours searching.

881
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,119
You wouldn't

882
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,119
get this much info in days.

883
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:36,799
What's your game?

884
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,079
Trying to hit on a married rich lady?

885
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,440
Idiot.

886
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,720
It's an investigation.

887
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,720
Send me

888
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,920
everything you found.

889
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,839
An extra document for you.

890
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,559
What is it?

891
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
(To Big Hui)
How to Charm Rich Ladies.

892
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:58,880
Get lost.

893
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,400
Sent it.

894
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,559
(Free for a meal?)

895
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,199
(You'll go to the cafe tomorrow?)

896
00:34:26,836 --> 00:34:30,320
(Married 2016, Dating)

897
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,960
Forget everything starting today.

898
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:13,480
How can I forget?

899
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,039
Then never bring it up.

900
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,360
Pretend this person

901
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,000
never existed.

902
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,119
From now on,

903
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,440
neither of us should bring it up

904
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,639
unless we want a divorce.

905
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,000
Alright.

906
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,000
This dirty secret

907
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
stays buried forever.

908
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:23,104
If you came back with a woman,
even if she wasn't your wife...

909
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:24,895
My brother-in-law.

910
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:27,551
That was wrong.

911
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:29,461
How much?

912
00:36:30,892 --> 00:36:31,936
Well, I wasn't finished.

913
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:33,184
What? There's more?

914
00:36:33,184 --> 00:36:34,112
- Yes.
- Yeah.

915
00:36:34,112 --> 00:36:35,488
- Stop.
- Alright. Stop.

916
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,627
My dad's in the hospital.

917
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:39,712
We can't get a single penny...

918
00:36:39,712 --> 00:36:40,960
Get... No, it's wrong.

919
00:36:42,816 --> 00:36:44,800
Imagine a market with security guards.

920
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,208
The captain retires

921
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,640
and promotes a... A...

922
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,312
Sorry, one more.

923
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:50,528
Alright. Stop. Again.

924
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,864
To prove himself worthy as a leader,

925
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,328
he'll be stricter with former colleagues

926
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:56,416
more than necessary.

927
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:57,696
He won't hesitate to scold

928
00:36:57,696 --> 00:36:58,761
without mercy...

929
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:05,312
- Scold and punish them. And what?
- Okay.

930
00:37:05,312 --> 00:37:07,872
Help me phrase the next line.

931
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:09,536
Sichuanese.

932
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:10,784
The whole village.

933
00:37:11,988 --> 00:37:12,960
The whole village...

934
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,458
Don't you farm the land?

935
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:16,032
Don't you farm the land?

936
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:17,065
Forget it.

937
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,240
The whole village...

938
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,512
Don't you farm the land?

939
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,392
Bai Xiaoling's a rich heiress.

940
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:24,704
And a...

941
00:37:24,704 --> 00:37:25,888
A businesswoman.

942
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,784
Businesswoman.

943
00:37:27,604 --> 00:37:29,536
I want to ask your monthly rate.

944
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,616
I'm sorry.

945
00:37:31,936 --> 00:37:33,452
I'm her permanent hire.

946
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:36,000
Add more hand gestures when speaking.

947
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,600
He's no...

948
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,443
He's no Monet.

949
00:37:39,443 --> 00:37:40,608
- Be natural.
- Yes.

950
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:42,499
You can move a bit.

951
00:37:42,584 --> 00:37:44,384
Don't rush.

952
00:37:44,384 --> 00:37:45,407
He's no Monet.

953
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:46,243
Too dull.

954
00:37:46,254 --> 00:37:47,513
4,000 yuan.

955
00:37:47,513 --> 00:37:47,968
Hands...

956
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:52,224
- Make it funny.
- Back when you were

957
00:37:52,224 --> 00:37:53,440
- working on it...
- Don't be so direct.

958
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,080
No need...

959
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,936
Two canvases...

960
00:37:55,936 --> 00:37:58,272
♪Questioning where my soul♪

961
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,672
♪Don't you feel♪

962
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:03,648

963
00:38:03,968 --> 00:38:05,504
Oh. Sorry.

964
00:38:05,504 --> 00:38:06,051
Stop.

965
00:38:08,148 --> 00:38:09,984
- Okay. Right?
- A bit further back.

966
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:11,791
Bye-bye.

967
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:18,292
