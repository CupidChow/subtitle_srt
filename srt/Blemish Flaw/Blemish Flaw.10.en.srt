3
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,480
I'm sure I can find...

4
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,079
Wei.

5
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,599
Wei?

6
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,480
Big Hui.

7
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,879
Wei.

8
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,799
It's really you.

9
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,760
Stay away from me.

10
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,439
We broke up.

11
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,560
Show some respect.

12
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,280
This is great.

13
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,360
You're okay.

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,560
You're alive.

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,159
Are you crazy?

16
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,199
Should I be dead?

17
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,039
No.

18
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,560
I've been

19
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,960
looking for you these days,

20
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,000
but I haven't found a trace of you.

21
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,159
I was worried.

22
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,280
Liu Wei?

23
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,800
She is Liu Wei?

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,759
And who are you?

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,759
I'm Li De,

26
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:33,919
a police officer.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,759
Big Hui has been

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,080
asking me to help

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,719
find you.

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,639
He was

31
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,479
worried about you.

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,199
Yang Zhenghui,

33
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,280
why are you so petty?

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,120
I'm sorry I dumped you.

35
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,680
But you wanted me dead?

36
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,520
No.

37
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,400
You got me wrong.

38
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,319
It suddenly occurred to me

39
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,639
that you vanished from

40
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,360
all social media

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,560
and video accounts.

42
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,680
I got nervous.

43
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,800
I-I was just worried

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,520
about you.

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,599
That's true.

46
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,919
He's been worried sick about you.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,759
You guys talk.

48
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,840
Well, thanks.

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,439
I changed my accounts.

50
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,319
No more videos or livestreams.

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,159
I abandoned my previous accounts

52
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,120
to cut ties with

53
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,120
people like you.

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,800
I have my own life now.

55
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,800
I'm doing fine.

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,680
Stop bothering me.

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,199
Okay?

58
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,919
Isn't it for the best?

59
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,120
Everything is wrong.

60
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,719
What do you mean?

61
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,039
Liu Wei is doing well.

62
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,280
Your greatest fear

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,960
was confirming

64
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,919
she was murdered, wasn't it?

65
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,560
Wei is doing fine.

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,159
Of course, I'm happy for her.

67
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,520
But after all my efforts,

68
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,159
everything turned out wrong.

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,919
I'm like a joke.

70
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,960
Do you think you're wrong?

71
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,280
Do you honestly believe

72
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,520
Zeng Jie isn't a villain?

73
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:19,839
Your phone.

74
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,680
Tracy.

75
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,319
I've been thinking and couldn't

76
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,959
come to another conclusion.

77
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,959
If our deduction

78
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,920
was right

79
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,240
and Zeng Jie

80
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,480
killed Lin Fang and Wei,

81
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,120
then Bai Xiaoling

82
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,120
is doomed, too.

83
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,040
Bai Xiaoling

84
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,879
is worthless

85
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,079
to Zeng Jie now.

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,079
She's a liability.

87
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,040
Why not

88
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,879
get rid of her?

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
On the other hand,

90
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,120
if I ended up disabled

91
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,319
like Bai Xiaoling,

92
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,120
with a husband

93
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,279
partying all day

94
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,720
and wasting my money

95
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,879
on other women,

96
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,680
I wouldn't want anything

97
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,439
other than killing him.

98
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,759
I understand.

99
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,519
The thing women can never forgive

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,920
is betrayal.

101
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,560
Yeah. And being let down.

102
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,240
Come on.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,040
What's with the sour face?

104
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,879
You found Liu Wei. Aren't you happy?

105
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,600
Yeah, I am.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,160
I'm just surprised.

107
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,800
What did I say?

108
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,079
You had no proof.

109
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:41,839
See?

110
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,040
A slap in the face.

111
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,519
Wei is alive

112
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,759
and she seems

113
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,040
to be doing better.

114
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,720
How do you know?

115
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,879
She wasn't

116
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,319
wearing any designer brands.

117
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,920
But the fabric quality was decent.

118
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
She wore a watch

119
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,839
at a moderate price.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,680
Most importantly,

121
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,680
she wasn't screaming for attention.

122
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,040
Nothing was

123
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,240
worth showing off

124
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:05,879
on her Moments.

125
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,160
Her makeup was more subtle.

126
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,759
Compared

127
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,759
to her glamorous

128
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,560
past self,

129
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
she's changed.

130
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,079
But how did you conclude

131
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,319
that she's doing better

132
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,000
just like that?

133
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,720
She was dressed up

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,879
not for photos,

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,839
videos,

136
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,000
or others' approval.

137
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,560
It's like she was genuinely

138
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,800
styling herself

139
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,519
in a comfortable way.

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,279
She was crossing the street,

141
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,639
having bubble tea.

142
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,519
She looked relaxed.

143
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,959
So,

144
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,720
I'm genuinely happy

145
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
that she's doing better.

146
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,560
The reason

147
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
why she broke up with me

148
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
doesn't matter anymore.

149
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,560
But I'll keep

150
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,199
investigating Zeng Jie.

151
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:47,959
Big Hui.

152
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,680
Whatever happened between

153
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,720
Liu Wei and Zeng Jie

154
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
was in the past.

155
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,240
It's not about Liu Wei.

156
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,600
It's about Lin Fang.

157
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,360
I'll keep

158
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,319
digging into it.

159
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,560
But our top priority is

160
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,399
Bai Xiaoling.

161
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,600
I didn't know her before

162
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,959
and only approached her

163
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
for investigation.

164
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,680
Now,

165
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
we're like friends.

166
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,439
Besides,

167
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,720
I make videos

168
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
about case analysis.

169
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,480
It's against

170
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,600
my work ethics

171
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,399
to let go of suspicious details.

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,759
I must respect

173
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,120
the logic behind truth.

174
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,720
You believe Zhang Xiaohong's claim

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,384
that Bai Xiaoling is in danger?

176
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,319
Think about it.

177
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,439
Bai Xiaoling

178
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,439
may be disabled,

179
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,240
but she's getting by.

180
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,959
Zeng Jie hasn't done

181
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,959
any harm to her.

182
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,959
Last year's fire at Zeng Jie's studio

183
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,120
wasn't an accident.

184
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,120
He wanted to burn

185
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,920
Bai Xiaoling alive.

186
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,759
Enough.

187
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,360
Enough.

188
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,399
Trust me.

189
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
I did trust you before.

190
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,399
Yeah.

191
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,680
I was wrong once,

192
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,439
but my logic

193
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,000
is sound.

194
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,399
Yeah.

195
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,399
Your reasoning is flawless.

196
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,439
But my stance remains.

197
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,399
We need evidence.

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,439
Li De.

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,240
Three questions for you.

200
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:55,959
First,

201
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,279
have you suspected

202
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,399
even for a second

203
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,279
that Zeng Jie

204
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
is a criminal?

205
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,319
Yeah.

206
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,120
But that's not enough.

207
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,560
Okay.

208
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,160
Second,

209
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,240
have you suspected

210
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,079
even for a second

211
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,959
that Lin Fang

212
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,959
didn't drop dead

213
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,240
by chance?

214
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,240
Nod if you have.

215
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,279
Third,

216
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,759
if I find

217
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,040
valuable leads

218
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:21,959
or evidence,

219
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,439
wouldn't you be excited?

220
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,600
That's it.

221
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,120
We'll keep investigating.

222
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,879
What do you mean by "we"?

223
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,480
You think I have nothing

224
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,360
better to do?

225
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
We're buddies now.

226
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,440
Why split hairs?

227
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,200
You're obsessed.

228
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,080
So obsessed.

229
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,600
Who is it?

230
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:54,879
Food delivery.

231
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,480
I didn't order anything.
Wrong address...

232
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,159
I just couldn't figure out

233
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,440
how you got involved

234
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,480
with Bai Xiaoling.

235
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,360
Now, I get it.

236
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,879
You're investigating

237
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Zeng Jie.

238
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,840
W-Who are you?

239
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,000
(Law Firm)
Zhang Ye?

240
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,000
It sounds familiar.

241
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,840
She has an admirer
named Zhang Ye, who keeps

242
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,919
liking her posts

243
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,840
and kissing up to her.

244
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,320
I don't think

245
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,440
he would give up so easily.

246
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:29,960
A lawyer.

247
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,279
Wait.

248
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,600
Why would a lawyer come to me?

249
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,799
A-Am I being sued?

250
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,080
Come on, chill.

251
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,840
I was just kidding.

252
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,279
Let's be friends.

253
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,399
I-It's not funny.

254
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,120
Who's your friend?

255
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:42,840
You.

256
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,799
Big Hui.

257
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,279
Impressive.

258
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,200
As expected of a lawyer.

259
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,080
What do you want?

260
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,879
Have you eaten?

261
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,799
Grab a bite with me.

262
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:57,919
I've eaten.

263
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,279
Then have a drink with me.

264
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,000
Those people on your list,

265
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,159
some I know,

266
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,879
some I don't.

267
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,039
If I'm not mistaken,

268
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,919
you're going after

269
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,679
Zeng Jie.

270
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,679
To some extent,

271
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,039
we're allies.

272
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,039
You're quite something,

273
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,039
digging so deep into this

274
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,559
as a video content creator.

275
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm also surprised

276
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,240
that Zeng Jie had

277
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,840
done so many things.

278
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,720
Does Bai Xiaoling know
that Zeng Jie is investigating me?

279
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,039
Yeah, I told her.

280
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,080
What's next?

281
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Will you go on?

282
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,399
I want to.

283
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,279
Listen.

284
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,200
You shouldn't

285
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,080
fight alone anymore.

286
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I'll join you.

287
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,720
You're investigating

288
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,519
two people, right?

289
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,440
Chen Yuhe,

290
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,000
right?

291
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,440
Yeah.

292
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,559
Chen Yuhe has been

293
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,919
dating Zeng Jie for a while.

294
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,159
She's different.

295
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,399
Zeng Jie won't abandon her

296
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,320
because she's from

297
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,120
a wealthy family.

298
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,264
Her dad is Vice President
of Caorong University.

299
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,399
Got it.

300
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,080
He deceives the poor ones
and dumps them.

301
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,639
Then he sweet-talks the rich ones.

302
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,279
This guy

303
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,399
is complete trash.

304
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,200
You said he was seeing

305
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,200
another rich lady before he got married?

306
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,080
What happened?

307
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,039
A rich lady

308
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,200
with a sports car

309
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,039
was visiting him.

310
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,480
That's all I know.

311
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,840
This is like looking for

312
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,320
a needle in a haystack.

313
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,559
Zeng Jie went to Japan
during grad school.

314
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,879
With his financial situation back then,

315
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,000
he couldn't have

316
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,440
paid for the trip himself.

317
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,679
That's easy.

318
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:42,919
Find out

319
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,759
who took him

320
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,600
there.

321
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,519
I've tried

322
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,879
every possible way

323
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,279
but found nothing.

324
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,960
Official investigations

325
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,720
require professionals like us.

326
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,360
Leave it

327
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,399
to me.

328
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,159
Mr. Ye,

329
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,679
why are you

330
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,519
so invested?

331
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,639
W-Why are you so invested?

332
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,399
I make

333
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,639
case analysis videos.

334
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,639
It's my passion.

335
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,720
Besides,

336
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:06,879
technically speaking,

337
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,320
I'm unemployed.

338
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,960
I have nothing else to do.

339
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,679
But you

340
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,360
can't be that idle.

341
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
I...

342
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,639
Come on.

343
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,960
Here's to you.

344
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,600
Back then, I focused

345
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,159
entirely on my career.

346
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,679
Otherwise, how could

347
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,159
Bai Xiaoling fall for that bad guy

348
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,399
Zeng Jie?

349
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,559
Now she means

350
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,679
nothing to me.

351
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,279
She's just some girl

352
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,799
I happened to like.

353
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,480
Once

354
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,320
she divorces Zeng Jie,

355
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,679
I'll make him leave empty-handed.

356
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,039
Then I'll cut ties

357
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,240
with Bai Xiaoling.

358
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,799
No more drinks.

359
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,720
I can't...

360
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,080
You're so lousy.

361
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,159
Let me get out... I can't...

362
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,519
Come on, buddy.

363
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,639
Listen.

364
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,720
I'm telling you.

365
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,559
You must

366
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,759
look into that bad guy.

367
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,600
Dig deep.

368
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,240
Once you find something,

369
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,240
I'll

370
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,120
bring him to justice.

371
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,240
Bring him to justice.

372
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,519
At the very least,

373
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,120
I'll make him leave with nothing.

374
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,960
Yeah...

375
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,200
Yeah.

376
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,320
He wants to
take advantage of Bai Xiaoling?

377
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,120
Doesn't he know

378
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,039
who I am?

379
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,120
Who are you?

380
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,200
Excellent question.

381
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,559
To explain who I am,

382
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,080
we must start with humanity's

383
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,399
relation to the cosmos.

384
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,000
Have a seat.

385
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,440
Want a drink?

386
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,320
I ordered.

387
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,960
Desserts?

388
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,632
No, thanks.

389
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,080
Well...

390
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,000
Correct me if I'm wrong.

391
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,879
Zhang Ye

392
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,399
has approached you.

393
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,120
Yeah.

394
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,600
He dragged me out drinking

395
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,639
until midnight.

396
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,440
I'm still dazed.

397
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:21,840
So let's just

398
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,200
cut to the chase.

399
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,559
I don't have

400
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,440
any secrets anymore.

401
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,399
I think Mr. Ye

402
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,639
genuinely likes you.

403
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:30,879
All these years,

404
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,320
he's always cared about you.

405
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,600
"Mr. Ye"?

406
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Drinking

407
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,600
made you buddies.

408
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,840
Not exactly.

409
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,039
But we did get wasted.

410
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,600
I think I puked all over his car.

411
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,200
Enough about him.

412
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,279
Got something to say?

413
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,120
Go ahead.

414
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,480
Shall we talk somewhere else?

415
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,080
Sure.

416
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,279
You live here?

417
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,159
Yeah.

418
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,360
It's nothing like

419
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,320
your neighborhood.

420
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,000
I think it's nice.

421
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,679
I like the vibe here.

422
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,679
Why did you bring me here?

423
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,679
There's honestly

424
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,679
nothing

425
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,480
to explain.

426
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,240
I've been

427
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,600
investigating your husband.

428
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,399
That's why

429
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,639
I approached you.

430
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,759
Your husband

431
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,799
has done many unspeakable things.

432
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,399
Mr. Ye knows

433
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,320
and offers to handle your case

434
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,480
and protect

435
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
your assets.

436
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,360
One more thing.

437
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,639
It may sound ridiculous.

438
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,879
I've been looking for Wei,
suspecting she was dead.

439
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:38,960
But I saw her

440
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,039
on the street yesterday.

441
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:49,879
She

442
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,679
told you everything?

443
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,159
I was surprised to see her.

444
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,559
I blurted out,

445
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,519
"You're alive."

446
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,559
She cursed at me

447
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,279
and left.

448
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,759
Didn't you talk about

449
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,200
why you broke up

450
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,279
back then?

451
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,519
No.

452
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,600
She yelled at me and left,

453
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,264
without leaving contact information.

454
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,159
But

455
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,039
she's alive.

456
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,240
I think she's doing well.

457
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,320
So I can put my mind at ease.

458
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,480
Here.

459
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,519
Won't you check it?

460
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:45,840
Why?

461
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,559
Want to see how you looked?

462
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,639
I edited it.

463
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,159
I blurred out

464
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,279
my face.

465
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,480
Did you make backups?

466
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,240
Would you believe me if I said no?

467
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,559
This stuff

468
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,759
doesn't benefit me.

469
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,200
We're even now. You can go.

470
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,160
I'll discard the SIM card.

471
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,720
I assume

472
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,759
you won't contact me again.

473
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,680
Happy divorcing.

474
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,200
Why did you come?

475
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,640
Zeng Jie.

476
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,200
There's something

477
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,839
you should see.

478
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,519
I'll cut to the chase.

479
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:42,880
It's about you

480
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,680
and Liu Wei.

481
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,440
Bai Xiaoling.

482
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,559
I've got something

483
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,519
you should see, too.

484
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:57,960
It's about you

485
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,240
and Liu Wei.

486
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,880
I secretly recorded a video

487
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,240
when your wife

488
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,960
came to me.

489
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,640
300,000 yuan extra

490
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,720
and it's yours.

491
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,720
Happy divorcing.

492
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,559
Shameless!

493
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,119
You sold me out!

494
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,119
Hypocrite!

495
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,519
You only wanted evidence

496
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,440
to get a bigger share

497
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
of the assets.

498
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,200
Liar.

499
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,640
Not a shred of integrity.

500
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,599
A woman

501
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,319
who scams her own husband

502
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
is speaking of integrity?

503
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,079
Go ahead and kill me.

504
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,359
Or I'll tell everyone

505
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,759
you paid me

506
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,200
to seduce your husband.

507
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,000
Go ahead.

508
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,839
I'll release the video

509
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,279
of you and Zeng Jie.

510
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,200
Go ahead.

511
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,519
It doesn't even

512
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,960
show my face.

513
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,200
I don't want trouble.

514
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,079
I just want some money

515
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,279
and start a new life.

516
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,000
Why won't you let me go?

517
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,960
Don't provoke me.

518
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:24,680
And I won't

519
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,119
expose your dirty secrets.

520
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,359
Someone of your status

521
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,440
wouldn't want to lose face, right?

522
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,160
I'll say it again.

523
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,720
I don't want trouble.

524
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,880
If you want to fight,

525
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,880
you might not win.

526
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,240
Why did you set me up?

527
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,839
I didn't plan

528
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
to set you up.

529
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,680
I just wanted to do the job

530
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,839
and leave with the money.

531
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,839
But your husband

532
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,839
opened up to me about his life.

533
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,119
And I realized we were the same.

534
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,759
No money, no status,

535
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,279
struggling desperately

536
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,559
to live a better life.

537
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,359
The life he's built

538
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,720
wasn't achieved easily.

539
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,519
We're just the same.

540
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,920
So you sold me out

541
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,000
and took his money.

542
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,480
You just wanted more dirty money.

543
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,200
Why shouldn't I get paid

544
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,480
for doing the job?

545
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,640
I did everything

546
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,119
you asked me to do.

547
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,319
Why won't you let me go?

548
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,559
What do you want?

549
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,640
You think you're justified?

550
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,920
How are you justified then?

551
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,519
You hired me

552
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,319
to seduce your husband for money.

553
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,519
We're both bad.

554
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,920
So don't judge me.

555
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,519
Stop bothering me.

556
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,640
Or I'll drag you down with me.

557
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,319
Let's see who breaks first,

558
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,680
you or me.

559
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,400
I know very well

560
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,720
why you're getting divorced.

561
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,680
Would that make you look good?

562
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,279
Just let me go

563
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,279
and I'll vanish.

564
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,000
I was leaving anyway.

565
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,079
You'll

566
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,440
never see me again.

567
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,519
And I want nothing to do

568
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,599
with my current life.

569
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,920
Alright.

570
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,279
Good.

571
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,839
The thing is, it's not about

572
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,200
Liu Wei,

573
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,000
but her.

574
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,400
Lin Fang.

575
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,480
I don't know her.

576
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,960
Nor do I care to hear

577
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,039
her story.

578
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,079
You have to hear it.

579
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,440
She was Zeng Jie's girlfriend

580
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,799
before he met you.

581
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,680
In fact,

582
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,319
they held a wedding in the village.

583
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,000
When they were dating,

584
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,079
Zeng Jie worked at

585
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,359
a village art studio.

586
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
I know that he copied

587
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,759
Monet paintings

588
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,960
at the art studio.

589
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,079
Meanwhile, he was also

590
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,960
seeing another

591
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,799
rich lady.

592
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,240
(Rich Lady)
I'm investigating her.

593
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:48,519
She probably

594
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,240
took Zeng Jie

595
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,519
to Japan for fun.

596
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,960
Because he went there
during grad school,

597
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:53,880
even though

598
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,440
he didn't have any money.

599
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,880
I'm going with friends
for the hot springs in Japan.

600
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,759
Come along.

601
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,519
Japan?

602
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,359
Do you have a visa?

603
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,200
No.

604
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:12,359
Due to

605
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,640
some unfathomable reasons,

606
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,240
Zeng Jie didn't marry

607
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,519
this rich lady.

608
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,480
After that,

609
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,680
he met you.

610
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,559
The timeline I reconstructed

611
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,279
shows that

612
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,039
(Time for dating and marriage)
he was still with Lin Fang.

613
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,279
When you two

614
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,799
first started dating,

615
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
Lin Fang died

616
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,960
from a sudden heart attack.

617
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,000
Her brother

618
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,119
Lin Shan held the funeral.

619
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,400
But oddly,

620
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,319
no one

621
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,720
ever saw her remains.

622
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,119
Lin Shan took her ashes

623
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,839
back for burial.

624
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,279
That's why

625
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,480
I can't determine

626
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,200
how Lin Fang died.

627
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,799
She died four years ago.

628
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,240
Lin Shan hasn't

629
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,200
had any steady job

630
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,039
ever since.

631
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,799
But he kept getting money somehow.

632
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,240
Zhang Xiaohong's hospital bills

633
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,640
have already cost him

634
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,720
hundreds of thousands.

635
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,440
Who is Zhang Xiaohong?

636
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,279
(Money, treatment)
Zhang Xiaohong.

637
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,119
Tracy.

638
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,599
She's a bit like you.

639
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,480
She also suffered an accident

640
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,319
that left her unable to walk.

641
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,720
But unlike you,

642
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,640
she's broke

643
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,240
and confined to her hospital bed.

644
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,039
Regarding Lin Shan, Lin Fang,

645
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:16,839
and Zeng Jie,

646
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,039
she has some

647
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,480
personal insights and theories.

648
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,119
Does Zhang Ye know about

649
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,519
what you just told me?

650
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,359
Yeah.

651
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,039
He's probably

652
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:38,880
investigating

653
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,039
that mysterious rich lady

654
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,359
and Chen Yuhe.

655
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,920
He's always wanted me

656
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,119
to get divorced with minimal

657
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:44,960
financial loss.

658
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,079
I think he truly

659
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,000
cares for you.

660
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,000
I know.

661
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,279
I'm his unresolved

662
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,200
attachment.

663
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,079
But it's unnecessary.

664
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,039
I am no longer

665
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,119
who I used to be.

666
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,799
But I have another thought.

667
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,279
Think about it.

668
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,240
Was the fire at Zeng Jie's studio

669
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,480
truly an accident?

670
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,960
He thought you went

671
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,799
to the third floor to rest.

672
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,160
The fire broke out

673
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,400
after you left.

674
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,799
It is

675
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,079
quite hard to believe

676
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,279
that Zeng Jie

677
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,359
just happened to have

678
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,119
the mask and blanket ready.

679
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,359
You survived the fire.

680
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,240
A month later,

681
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,440
you had a car accident.

682
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,640
The brake failed...

683
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,319
It can't be a coincidence.

684
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,880
You drove a good car.

685
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,440
I consulted some friends

686
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,279
as car experts.

687
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,839
Someone must have tampered

688
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,960
with the brake.

689
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,599
It can't all be coincidental.

690
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:03,599
Bai Xiaoling.

691
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:04,880
You can choose to

692
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,480
dismiss these as mere speculations.

693
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,759
But think about it.

694
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:08,880
Things were awful

695
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
between you two.

696
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,319
Wouldn't it benefit him

697
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:12,759
if you had an accident?

698
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,359
He'd benefit the most.

699
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,400
Zeng Jie is my husband.

700
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:17,799
Yang Zhenghui.

701
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,799
I don't like how you diminish

702
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:20,799
my marriage.

703
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,000
I can tell.

704
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,519
You don't have to like it.

705
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,680
I'm just showing you

706
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,440
the reality.

707
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,279
Reality can be cruel.

708
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,519
You can't keep avoiding it.

709
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,480
Bai Xiaoling.

710
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,559
Zhang Ye wants to

711
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,720
win the case for you.

712
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,599
As for me,

713
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,359
I just want you to stay safe.

714
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,720
You're overthinking.

715
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,079
You're free to make assumptions

716
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,000
and deductions,

717
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,880
following your logic.

718
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,200
But trust me.

719
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,640
This isn't the truth.

720
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,559
Big Hui.

721
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,079
I know my marriage

722
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,039
isn't the most pleasing.

723
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,720
But this is my life.

724
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,960
I want to face it myself.

725
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,640
Zeng Jie is taking me on a trip soon.

726
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,400
He wants to improve

727
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
our relationship.

728
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,624
Where are you going?

729
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,920
Could it be...

730
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,880
Big Hui.

731
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,759
Shouldn't you wish me well?

732
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:12,960
I do.

733
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:13,440
But...

734
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:14,839
When I'm like this,

735
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,160
it can't get much worse.

736
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,519
If we can mend things,

737
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,000
maybe we'll just continue

738
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,440
living an ordinary life.

739
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,319
If it truly can't be fixed,

740
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,240
I want a clean ending.

741
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,440
If I really

742
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,559
divorce Zeng Jie,

743
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,319
I'll ask Zhang Ye for help.

744
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,599
But don't make decisions

745
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,880
on my behalf.

746
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,759
Let me be the judge.

747
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,240
So,

748
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
I'm looking forward

749
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
to this trip.

750
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,920
I used to love traveling.

751
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,799
I also used to

752
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,079
love Zeng Jie.

753
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,440
Leave it open. Someone might come in.

754
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,920
I just love

755
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,480
how you're full of indecent thoughts

756
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,480
and yet you pretend to be decent.

757
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,640
Why did you come?

758
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,519
Three things.

759
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:28,559
First,

760
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,480
I'm meeting friends

761
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,440
this weekend.

762
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,079
So don't make plans with me.

763
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,440
Is that the first thing

764
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,279
or the second?

765
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,200
Second,

766
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,559
I saw

767
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,920
a new restaurant online.

768
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:39,839
It looks good.

769
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,640
I'll treat you to dinner.

770
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,599
If you don't want to
hear the third thing,

771
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,640
I won't say it.

772
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,079
You can't resist

773
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,240
telling me.

774
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
So just say it.

775
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,599
I changed my mind.

776
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,680
I'll tell you

777
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,920
the third thing at dinner.

778
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,200
It seems

779
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,559
you'll have to wait two more hours.

780
00:27:59,119 --> 00:27:59,839
It must be tough.

781
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:07,640
I'll tell you

782
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,440
the third thing.

783
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:09,240
Professor Zeng.

784
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,079
Go ahead.

785
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
I said,

786
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,960
"I'll tell you"

787
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,039
"the third thing."

788
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,000
"Professor Zeng."

789
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:19,759
What?

790
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,039
Professor Zeng.

791
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,200
You fool.

792
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,599
You're no longer

793
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,759
an associate professor.

794
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,480
How do you know?

795
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,920
The promotion came through?

796
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:37,960
I heard my dad

797
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,599
on the phone during dinner

798
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
last night.

799
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,279
Maybe

800
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,599
you heard it wrong.

801
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,039
Yeah, maybe.

802
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,160
Maybe, he meant another Zeng Jie?

803
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,119
No way.

804
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,640
In the entire Caorong,

805
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,000
there's only one Zeng Jie.

806
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,960
Of course, I know that.

807
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,519
I couldn't catch

808
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,240
the other names,

809
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,319
but I heard yours.

810
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,799
So? Professor Zeng.

811
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,000
Aren't you

812
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
really proud,

813
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:09,880
but trying to

814
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,119
look discreet?

815
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,000
Discreet?

816
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,640
Why do I need to

817
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,680
be discreet with you?

818
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,519
Of course, I'm proud.

819
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,319
I was once

820
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,079
Caorong University's

821
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,279
youngest associate professor.

822
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,400
But now,

823
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
I'm Caorong University's

824
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,000
youngest professor.

825
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:35,039
Any plans after dinner?

826
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:36,279
Professor Zeng.

827
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,599
Don't dream about spending a night

828
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,519
with me right after

829
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,640
receiving a promotion.

830
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,400
Tonight,

831
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,319
we only have dinner.

832
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,240
Okay.

833
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,039
You're the boss.

834
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,480
You haven't dined with your wife

835
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,400
for a while, huh?

836
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,240
Yeah.

837
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,519
Dining with her is torture.

838
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,599
Nothing to talk about.

839
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,440
When you were dating,

840
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,799
couldn't you

841
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,960
find topics either?

842
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,599
Back then...

843
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,880
I forgot.

844
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,559
We just chatted about

845
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,359
random things.

846
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,279
I don't remember.

847
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,240
Fine.

848
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,279
Let's go eat.

849
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:30,799
(You have no idea)

850
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,559
(how much I love trains.)

851
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,559
When I was 11,

852
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,640
I saw a train for the first time.

853
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,720
A station was built in our town

854
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,480
with tracks running

855
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,319
past our village.

856
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,680
I'd often

857
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:43,960
wait by the tracks,

858
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,920
sometimes at dawn,

859
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,279
sometimes at dusk.

860
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,680
When trains approached,

861
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,319
I'd chase after them.

862
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,079
Because I knew

863
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,400
they could carry me

864
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,319
away from that village

865
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,599
to those unseen

866
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,720
big cities.

867
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,119
Trains

868
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,359
carried my longing

869
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,200
for the mysterious vast world

870
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,160
out there.

871
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
I first took a train

872
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,000
to take the exams.

873
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,160
I couldn't get

874
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,920
a sleeper berth or a seat.

875
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:18,680
I stood

876
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,039
between carriages

877
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,240
with my backpack.

878
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,920
There was always someone smoking,

879
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,599
making the air

880
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,680
hazy with smoke.

881
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,160
Looking back now,

882
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,160
it feels surreal.

883
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,480
We take arts exams

884
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,039
before the college entrance exams.

885
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,960
That was February.

886
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,200
It was freezing cold.

887
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,440
I stood in the train.

888
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,559
The windows kept fogging up.

889
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,039
I had to keep wiping them

890
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,240
to see outside.

891
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,880
I watched the mountains

892
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,559
and wilderness

893
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,680
transform into farmlands,

894
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,119
villages,

895
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,640
a single tree,

896
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,119
and grassy fields.

897
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,920
Suddenly, a building emerged.

898
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,720
Then there were

899
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,720
buildings after buildings

900
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,960
with lights.

901
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,160
All those roads

902
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,480
were filled

903
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,319
with endless traffic.

904
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,160
Pressing my face against the glass,
I made a promise,

905
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,920
"Caorong,"

906
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:34,759
"I will be there."

907
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,000
"Caorong,"

908
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,079
"I will stay."

909
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,039
You stayed.

910
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,359
Isn't it ridiculous?

911
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,039
A village boy like me

912
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,480
is sitting across

913
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,279
a privileged lady

914
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,279
like you.

915
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,400
Not at all.

916
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,279
I think you're amazing.

917
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,200
You earned everything

918
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,160
through

919
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,480
your own efforts.

920
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,359
You're much better than me.

921
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,200
Back in my village,

922
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,599
we always hold banquets if a kid gets

923
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,839
into college.

924
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:22,920
But when I

925
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,720
received the acceptance letter,

926
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,160
my father was working far away,

927
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,119
and I was painting
to collect tuition fees.

928
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,119
We didn't think about celebrating.

929
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,279
During our call,

930
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,319
my dad told me that

931
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,839
he was celebrating with coworkers,

932
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,799
and buying drinks for everyone.

933
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,319
Hearing that,

934
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,519
I rushed to a store

935
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,880
and bought liquor.

936
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,400
A pocket-sized one.

937
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:47,880
After class,

938
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,559
I downed it alone

939
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,559
in the studio.

940
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,480
That was my first time.

941
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,960
I was drunk in minutes.

942
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,720
The room was filled

943
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,960
with easels everywhere

944
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,920
and canvases filled with crooked lines.

945
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,400
Yet I watched those

946
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,119
clumsy brushstrokes

947
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,199
gradually come alive.

948
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,599
Transforming into clouds.

949
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,199
Clouds colliding with wind.

950
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,440
Wind bringing down rain.

951
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,504
Rain swelling into floods.

952
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,280
Floods breaking the levees.

953
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,360
Levees collapsing on swans.

954
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,480
Swans treading on snow.

955
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,559
Snow defying the frost.

956
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,239
Frost cracking open

957
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,000
the heavens.

958
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,239
Heavens establishing new forms.

959
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,679
Forms coexisting in harmony.

960
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,239
Harmony blending light with dust.

961
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,519
Dust blinding my vision.

962
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,519
Vision blurred by arrogance.

963
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,159
I got drunk

964
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,400
and sobered up.

965
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,559
Then everything changed in my life.

966
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,400
Professor Zeng,

967
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,239
you were born

968
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,400
to be an artist.

969
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,840
How can you stop them

970
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,679
from traveling?

971
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,199
Zeng Jie is up to no good.

972
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:43,960
Enough.

973
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:44,760
Stop theorizing.

974
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,119
Bai Xiaoling won't believe you.

975
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,800
She's too involved

976
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,159
to see clearly.

977
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,000
You theorized

978
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:54,239
that Zeng Jie set the fire

979
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,119
to destroy

980
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,119
traces of Liu Wei.

981
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,000
Now, it seems

982
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:57,920
he was targeting

983
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,800
Bai Xiaoling.

984
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,880
The fire broke out

985
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,800
exactly when Liu Wei

986
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,599
was close to Zeng Jie.

987
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:04,519
Yeah.

988
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:06,719
Right.

989
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:07,960
Ask Wei.

990
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,679
Not bad, Li De.

991
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,360
You're pro.

992
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,159
If Liu Wei

993
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,639
was dating Zeng Jie,

994
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:13,719
she must

995
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,760
know something.

996
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:15,760
That's right.

997
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,960
But

998
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,199
I can't find her.

999
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:21,440
Can you trace her?

1000
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,960
I told you

1001
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:23,880
I can't do that.

1002
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,360
Big Hui.

1003
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,079
You only dated Wei for three months.

1004
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,000
You barely knew her.

1005
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:34,840
Yeah.

1006
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,360
Wei might not be her real name.

1007
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,719
It could be an alias.

1008
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,599
That makes it even harder.

1009
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,599
I also don't know how to find her.

1010
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,000
Think outside the box.

1011
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,199
Aren't you good at this?

1012
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,960
It's Tracy.

1013
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,280
Something came up.

1014
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:53,559
Don't forget this.

1015
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,159
Hello, Tracy.

1016
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,639
Lin Shan asked Zeng Jie

1017
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,519
for a lot of money.

1018
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:58,360
A lot of money?

1019
00:36:59,519 --> 00:36:59,960
Yeah.

1020
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,480
When he brought me

1021
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,599
breakfast earlier,

1022
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,920
he said he would get me

1023
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,119
to a hospital in Shanghai.

1024
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,679
You know how it is.

1025
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,599
My treatment

1026
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,559
costs over a million.

1027
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:11,000
Why does he suddenly decide to ask
for so much money now?

1028
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,159
I'm not sure.

1029
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:13,400
Did you

1030
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,239
uncover something

1031
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,599
that made Zeng Jie nervous?

1032
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,199
Otherwise,

1033
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,000
why would he

1034
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,159
give Lin Shan so much money?

1035
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,800
I haven't found anything.

1036
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,480
Nothing really ties

1037
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,079
Zeng Jie

1038
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,480
to Lin Fang's death.

1039
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,880
This is weird.

1040
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,119
I'm clueless now.

1041
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,920
I just wanted to

1042
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,400
inform you.

1043
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,280
Got it.

1044
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,599
It's fishy.

1045
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,559
Did Lin Shan

1046
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,119
get money from

1047
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:40,760
someone else?

1048
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:41,800
No way.

1049
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,039
Who else would

1050
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:43,639
give him money

1051
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,440
besides Zeng Jie?

1052
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,440
Who are you?

1053
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,320
Take a guess.

1054
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,079
You're...?

1055
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,440
You figured it out?

1056
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,920
So, do you know

1057
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,719
what I want?

1058
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,639
What do you want?

1059
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,159
I don't even know you.

1060
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,960
I know about

1061
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,840
Zhang Xiaohong.

1062
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:12,880
Compared to me,

1063
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,800
she has a better chance

1064
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,639
of recovering.

1065
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,480
Hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing

1066
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,440
can do the surgery.

1067
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,719
But it's costly

1068
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,119
and can't be delayed.

1069
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,559
Half a million. This is half.

1070
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,000
Another half a million after we're done.

1071
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,000
A million.

1072
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,960
What do you want?

1073
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,559
How did Lin Fang die?

1074
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,599
From heart disease.

1075
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,679
Her heart failed.

1076
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,920
Did you see it?

1077
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,519
Tell the truth

1078
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,079
and take the money.

1079
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,480
Otherwise,

1080
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,400
I'm leaving now.

1081
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,960
You saw Lin Fang die

1082
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:02,920
from her illness?

1083
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,800
I handled the funeral.

1084
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,880
Answer my question.

1085
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:19,039
Scared of being charged
with harboring criminals?

1086
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,760
I've consulted a lawyer.

1087
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,079
Relax. Three years maximum.

1088
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,920
Zhang Xiaohong will still be there.

1089
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,480
And after what you've done,

1090
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,320
she'll wait for you.

1091
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,559
You saw it yourself?

1092
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,760
Zeng Jie told me that.

1093
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,320
I didn't get to see my sister.

1094
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,400
Zeng Jie killed her?

1095
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,079
She might have died from her illness,

1096
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,159
but...

1097
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,079
I don't know.

1098
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,239
How much money

1099
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,239
have you extorted from Zeng Jie?

1100
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,880
Probably around

1101
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,559
300,000 yuan.

1102
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,760
He kept giving you money

1103
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,719
out of affection for Lin Fang

1104
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,199
or to silence you?

1105
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:06,960
Ridiculous.

1106
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,880
He's obviously scared of me.

1107
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,559
Alright, I'm done.

1108
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,920
Take the money.

1109
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,159
What kind of soil

1110
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,159
are we even looking for?

1111
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,280
The soil around here

1112
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,119
looks the same to me.

1113
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,400
No rush.

1114
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,159
Search slowly.

1115
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,639
The soup is ready.

1116
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,079
Come on.

1117
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:25,840
We should

1118
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,480
probably head back soon.

1119
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,639
Returning the car after 6 PM

1120
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,400
incurs

1121
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,039
an extra half-day fee.

1122
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,039
No rush.

1123
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,440
Keep looking.

1124
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,440
Shall we try another spot?

1125
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,159
I think the soil here

1126
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,480
is all similar.

1127
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,280
Zeng Jie.

1128
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:06,760
Medicine.

1129
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,440
In my bag.

1130
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,199
Okay, I'll look for it.

1131
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,360
Stay calm.

1132
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,039
Hurry up.

1133
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,480
Easy, I'll find it soon.

1134
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,960
My heart hurts.

1135
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:52,880
Give me the medicine.

1136
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,679
Give me the medicine now.

1137
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,880
I feel awful.

1138
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:06,719
Medicine...

1139
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:12,679
Be good.

1140
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,639
It'll be over soon.

1141
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,719
It'll be over soon.

1142
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,000
I received a gift.

1143
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:25,920
It's special.

1144
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,039
Just

1145
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:29,320

1148
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:43,872
Thank you.

1149
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:47,957
Okay.

1150
00:45:47,957 --> 00:45:48,608
Laid the cables?

1151
00:45:50,144 --> 00:45:51,776
Wei, it's really you.

1152
00:45:51,776 --> 00:45:52,736
Stay away from me.

1153
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:56,036
Come on.

1154
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,136
Wei, this is great.

1155
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:01,184
I thought you were dead.

1156
00:46:01,184 --> 00:46:02,208
Are you crazy?

1157
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:03,840
Sorry, let's retake. I messed up.

1158
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,800
Get off. Hurry.

1159
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:16,320
Again.

1160
00:46:20,064 --> 00:46:21,312
