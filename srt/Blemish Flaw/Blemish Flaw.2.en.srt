I will find you.

9
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,719
Why didn't you reply me

10
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
last night?

11
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,199
I was busy,

12
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,360
monitoring the kiln.

13
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,879
No time to check my phone.

14
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,000
This afternoon,

15
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,560
you took ages to reply me too.

16
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,120
I was in

17
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,199
a fire safety training.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,159
And I even demonstrated

19
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,719
evacuation drills

20
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,599
with firefighters.

21
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,560
You should tell them

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,759
that you set fire every day.

23
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,159
You're professional.

24
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,479
That's different.

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,400
Fire brings destruction,

26
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,000
and I create art.

27
00:02:59,199 --> 00:02:59,960
What about me?

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,719
Fire extinguisher?

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,439
You're the ignition.

30
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,759
Then today,

31
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,400
should I set you on fire?

32
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,240
Not today.

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,879
Today...

34
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,719
Alright, I'm just teasing.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,159
I'm busy today too.

36
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,240
Go work hard, Professor Zeng.

37
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,599
I'm leaving.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,960
Flowers for sale.

39
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,000
Flowers for sale.

40
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,879
I'll buy them all. Keep the change.

41
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,400
Thank you.

42
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,120
Don't worry about anything.

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,520
Operations are running well,

44
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,719
and the fund stays stable.

45
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,919
Leave them be.

46
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,199
Your priority now

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,240
is to recover.

48
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,919
While your mom's away,

49
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,000
let me sneak a cigarette.

50
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,080
Sure.

51
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,360
Listen,

52
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,079
don't wave cigarettes

53
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,560
under my nose to tempt me

54
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,439
and test me.

55
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm disciplined.

56
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,079
I'll die before smoking.

57
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,720
Your dad keeps nagging

58
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,079
that he wants

59
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,240
to see you two

60
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,199
have kids soon.

61
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:37,560
Mom,

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,519
we're both overwhelmed now.

63
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,000
Has he been

64
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,519
staying out often?

65
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,879
Is he having an affair?

66
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,480
He wouldn't dare.

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,800
Back when you married,

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,800
he wouldn't.

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,759
But these few years,

70
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,879
as his career grows,

71
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,920
who knows then?

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,240
When your dad's young,

73
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680
he could stay loyal.

74
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,600
But then

75
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,959
with success

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
and wealth,

77
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,439
he couldn't anymore.

78
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,319
Mom,

79
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
enough with this talk.

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,879
So listen,

81
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,839
if you want stability,

82
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,360
bind him with a child.

83
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,800
Have kids soon.

84
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,199
Your generation's solution

85
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,279
isn't mine.

86
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,279
Besides,

87
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,240
he's done nothing wrong.

88
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,519
(I booked us a room)
(We understand each other.)

89
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,920
(Chats deleted)
(Hope you're fine.)

90
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,839
(Contact removed)
(I won't push about kids.)

91
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,000
(Just keep it in mind.)

92
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,839
Understood.

93
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,439
Too busy to cook,

94
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,480
I ordered takeout.

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
Fine, anything works.

96
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,600
I visited the company today.

97
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,959
You transferred money to the fund again?

98
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,720
Yes.

99
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,000
Cultural industries

100
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,199
have bright prospects.

101
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,639
Our fund...

102
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,680
You invest

103
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,800
most of the capital

104
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,920
into the ceramic factory.

105
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,879
And the rest

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
goes to the fund.

107
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,399
When can we profit
with all this investment?

108
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,839
The ceramic orders

109
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,600
keep coming.

110
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,839
We'll profit soon.

111
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,439
And our fund

112
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,399
has performed well.

113
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,720
You've claimed it all along.

114
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,639
So, where

115
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,399
is the profit?

116
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,279
The capital

117
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:33,920
was earned

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,439
by hard work of my parents.

119
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
You invest it all,

120
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,800
but the profit?

121
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,199
Xiaoling,

122
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,600
the company's future

123
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,639
is promising.

124
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,000
You need to think long-term.

125
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,240
Besides, we're family.

126
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,399
Exactly, we're family.

127
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,439
So, my parents trusted you

128
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,800
and handed the company to us.

129
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,480
But you owe us

130
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,319
an explanation.

131
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,360
What do you mean?

132
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,399
You're fully aware

133
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,519
of my works' current value.

134
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,639
Value?

135
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,800
Professor Zeng.

136
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,079
Master Zeng.

137
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
You won numerous awards.

138
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,480
Works are highly sought after.

139
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
By whom?

140
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,199
Your overpriced pieces are

141
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,360
artificially inflated

142
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,160
by the fund.

143
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,199
Those awards?

144
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,439
If I weren't your wife,

145
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,160
I would never

146
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:27,920
know about

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,560
those obscure ceramic competitions.

148
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,439
You spend much

149
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,480
on every competition.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,759
Creating new pieces, flying abroad,

151
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,399
and paying journalists

152
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,800
for promotion.

153
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,480
- Is this the value?
- You're over the line!

154
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,480
Am I?

155
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,759
When we just married,

156
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,839
you're a college lecturer

157
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,480
with less than 100 thousand yuan.

158
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,079
I chose you for who you are.

159
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,959
So do my parents.

160
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,519
Did we demand

161
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,920
a single penny from you?

162
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:51,959
You want to be

163
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,399
an artist,

164
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,680
we support you.

165
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,600
You want a career,

166
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,199
we support you

167
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,160
all along.

168
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,399
I'm over the line?

169
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,759
Are you even a man?

170
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,680
Say that again!

171
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,800
You want to hit me?

172
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,439
Bai Xiaoling, listen.

173
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,519
Stop judging me

174
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,079
with your nouveau riche mindset.

175
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,120
Today,

176
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,519
aesthetics has value

177
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,800
and art has value.

178
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,560
My career, my achievements,

179
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,480
and my value

180
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,480
aren't something

181
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
you nouveau riche

182
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,480
could understand.

183
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,360
Without my money,

184
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,839
you'd never have value!

185
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,519
Artist?

186
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,759
You're no different

187
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,240
from wife-beating illiterates!

188
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,079
Then divorce!

189
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,960
Fine.

190
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,120
Return my parents' money.

191
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,960
We'll divorce.

192
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,279
What money?

193
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,320
That money

194
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,600
is the company capital.

195
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,120
You're the legal representative

196
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,200
and the shareholder.

197
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,879
Tell me,

198
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,856
what does it have to do with me?

199
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:54,960
Shameless!

200
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,159
Despicable!

201
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,879
Hello, Mr. Sun.

202
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,200
Yes, yes.

203
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,879
About tomorrow's event?

204
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,360
How could I ever forget that?

205
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:24,919
Don't worry.

206
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,559
I'll be there on time.

207
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,919
No problem.

208
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,080
You must dress up

209
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,399
for tomorrow's event.

210
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,639
Don't forget

211
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,919
you're Master Zeng's wife.

212
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,039
Have a meal without me.

213
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,919
I'll go back to the studio.

214
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,600
I'll pick you up tomorrow

215
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,960
at 2 PM.

216
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,360
Do you even know how many people

217
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,639
named Liu Wei in this city?

218
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,080
More than Yang Zhenghui.

219
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,440
But

220
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,080
fewer than Li De, I suppose.

221
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,919
So...

222
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,919
So it's so hard to find her.

223
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,799
I know it.

224
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,320
Actually, I'm kind of relieved.

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,559
It shows

226
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,279
you've accepted

227
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,399
that Wei has vanished.

228
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,440
Not at all.

229
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,080
I don't believe anything without proof.

230
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,320
Do you have evidence?

231
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,080
After all your efforts,

232
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,639
say

233
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,320
what you got.

234
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,480
If I drink and drive,

235
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,360
then get caught

236
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,360
by police,

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,720
can you spare me?

238
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:52,919
No need.

239
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,159
I'll arrest you myself.

240
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,120
Drinking with a police officer,

241
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,840
I thought

242
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,000
I'd get some privilege.

243
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,519
I'll arrest you.

244
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,360
Isn't it a privilege?

245
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,080
This plate was made

246
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,159
in Light Strokes Art Studio's class

247
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,399
Wei attended.

248
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,519
(Light Strokes' classes)

249
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,000
(use this plate,)

250
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,399
(a replica of a master's work.)

251
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,279
Not a deceased master,

252
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,039
but an alive one.

253
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,039
Quite young.

254
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,120
(A classmate of the owner,)

255
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,159
(a professor at
Caorong University, Zeng Jie.)

256
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,440
The staff told me

257
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,440
they don't

258
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,759
mention blemish flaws

259
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,039
to students in all classes.

260
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,000
But Master Zeng Jie

261
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,679
is a perfectionist,

262
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,200
obsessive about blemish flaws.

263
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,919
So far,

264
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,559
the only ones who mentioned

265
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,480
'Perfectionist'

266
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,960
and 'Blemish Flaws'

267
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,000
are Wei

268
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,240
and Zeng Jie.

269
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,320
So you think

270
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,320
Wei is related to Zeng Jie?

271
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,000
Zeng Jie has a studio
at Shuiyuan Art Village.

272
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,159
On the night

273
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,399
of November 24, 2018,

274
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,000
(Art Studio Fire)
(a fire destroyed)

275
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,039
(his studio.)

276
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:52,960
Nothing remained.

277
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,919
When did you break up with Liu Wei?

278
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:55,600
October 20,

279
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,879
one month before the fire.

280
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,679
(November 24)

281
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,399
Wei stopped streaming
and updating videos

282
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,200
(Wei Vivian, 380 days ago)
in that period.

283
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,960
But that doesn't prove anything.

284
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,799
While Wei dated me,

285
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,799
attended the class,

286
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,600
made this plate,

287
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,159
and met Zeng Jie.

288
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:12,960
I am

289
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,320
nobody.

290
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,000
But Zeng Jie

291
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,399
is a brilliant young professor,

292
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,464
a ceramic master.

293
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,879
A fire

294
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,240
broke out in his studio

295
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,399
and Wei vanished.

296
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,360
Do you think there's anything

297
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,399
fishy in here?

298
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,879
Look, right?

299
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,720
It means you have doubts too.

300
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
I know it isn't

301
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,000
with procedures.

302
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't you think

303
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,240
my assumption is right?

304
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,440
You said it's

305
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,519
an assumption.

306
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,000
Assume Liu Wei

307
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,919
is related

308
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,799
to the fire.

309
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,279
But this fire case

310
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,600
made the news.

311
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:51,600
The fire department
must've investigated it.

312
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,919
Let me tell you.

313
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,159
Fire investigations

314
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,120
require the strict search
for human remains.

315
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,039
Anything's wrong,

316
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,159
would've been detected.

317
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,360
How about this?

318
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,360
Let me check

319
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,200
the fire reports

320
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,600
to verify your theory.

321
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:11,960
(November 24, 2018)

322
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,759
Come on, drink up.

323
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,759
Take a group photo.

324
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,679
Smile, everyone!

325
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:16,338
Smile for me.

326
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,679
Take a look.

327
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,159
This photo was taken

328
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,559
at 10:03 PM

329
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,679
on November 24.

330
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,559
All the guests were present.

331
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,360
You often host

332
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:30,960
a party?

333
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,879
Once every month or two.

334
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,440
We're usually busy with work.

335
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,720
After this photo was taken,

336
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,000
(my wife said she's tired)

337
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,519
(and wanted to rest.)

338
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,360
(Then I chatted)

339
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,720
(with others for over an hour.)

340
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,679
(We wrapped up)

341
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,480
(around 11:30 PM.)

342
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,720
(Since my studio
is in Shuiyuan Art Village,)

343
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,120
(taxi usually wait)

344
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,639
(at the village entrance.)

345
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,559
(So,)

346
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,279
(I saw friends off myself.)

347
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,000
(That's it.)

348
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,399
Did you

349
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,799
notice the charcoal brazier?

350
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,480
(No.)

351
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,360
That was my fault.

352
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,960
(After seeing friends off,)

353
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,000
(I went to check the kiln.)

354
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,759
(While checking it,)

355
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:16,759
(I noticed a fire.)

356
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:19,519
So,

357
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:20,919
you saw the fire on

358
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,759
the second floor?

359
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,159
Correct.

360
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,159
(First floor was safe when I was back,)

361
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,399
(so I rushed)

362
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,799
(to the second floor,)

363
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,919
(where I keep my paintings)

364
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,919
(and similar items,)

365
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,200
(all inflammable materials.)

366
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,840
(When I got there,)

367
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,360
(the fire was too big.)

368
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,039
(Then I rushed to the third floor.)

369
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,919
(But the door was locked,)

370
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,399
so I had no choice but to

371
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,039
kick it open violently.

372
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,000
But

373
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,600
my wife wasn't inside.

374
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,559
Then, I escaped.

375
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,159
(Fortunately, I had)

376
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,960
(fireproof equips,)

377
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,559
(so I wrapped myself in a fire blanket)

378
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,799
(and put on a mask)

379
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,000
(before escaping.)

380
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,039
(Otherwise,)

381
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,840
(I might not have escaped as well.)

382
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,600
(Therefore,)

383
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,000
it's because of the charcoal brazier?

384
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,600
Based on our current investigation,

385
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,480
it should be so.

386
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,440
(The brazier was too close)

387
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,000
(to the fabric sofa.)

388
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,440
(Once ignited,)

389
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,639
it'll catch fire quickly.

390
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,639
There were

391
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,279
bottles of wine

392
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,120
(on your end table.)

393
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,639
(And two of them are)

394
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,039
(with high alcohol content.)

395
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,792
(My friend brought
the Spirytus for mixing.)

396
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,840
Very strong stuff.

397
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,159
That makes it an oxidizer.

398
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,120
Luckily,

399
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,799
your studio is far from

400
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,480
other buildings,

401
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,720
so the fire didn't

402
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,559
cause much loss.

403
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:48,960
Right.

404
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,320
This is...

405
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,799
(Silk Banner)
I sincerely thank you.

406
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,639
Actually,

407
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,000
when we got there,

408
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,720
it's...

409
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,080
No, no.

410
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,399
Here.

411
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,039
If you didn't

412
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,600
come to the school to conduct

413
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,639
fire safety training,

414
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,480
I would never prepare something

415
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,679
like fire blanket.

416
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,720
And I didn't know

417
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,440
how to use it.

418
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,960
I learned it

419
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:13,840
in the training.

420
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,879
Glad to know

421
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,840
more about fires

422
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,600
and how to save myself

423
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,639
in the fire.

424
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,679
Professor Zeng,

425
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,360
I heard many of your works

426
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,600
got damaged

427
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,000
in the fire.

428
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,879
What a pity.

429
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,840
Yes.

430
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,639
In the history of art,

431
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
there were many works

432
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,480
failed to maintain,

433
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:36,639
(but they have)

434
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,519
(a name in history.)

435
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,080
(December 25, 2018)
Professor Zeng.

436
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,240
The topic

437
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,519
of our interview

438
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,679
is an art master
who has gone through a fire.

439
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:44,720
We've heard

440
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,240
you'll rebuild the studio.

441
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,039
The same as the one before?

442
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,960
Yes.

443
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,879
This is not creation.

444
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,000
But I'm used

445
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,399
to the way I worked before.

446
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,679
I believe

447
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,480
you can surpass your past self.

448
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
When people can't surpass

449
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,879
their past selves,

450
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,600
it's not because of incapability,

451
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,720
but the past will

452
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,000
hinder the future.

453
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,960
Past glories

454
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,920
will make people lazy

455
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,240
and insensitive.

456
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,319
The first work that won me an award

457
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,079
was created when I was 20.

458
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,079
Looking at it now,

459
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,440
there are many things

460
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,720
to be perfected.

461
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,359
But if I look at it

462
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,160
when I'm 70,

463
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,240
even 80,

464
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,799
perhaps I'll be satisfied,

465
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,880
thinking the young self

466
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,960
sensitive, sharp, and energetic.

467
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,480
Because I would be

468
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,759
too old

469
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,279
to pain then.

470
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,079
So, this fire

471
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,000
helped me make up my mind.

472
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,880
I'm heading back to town too.

473
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,576
I'll give you a ride.

474
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,799
I'll go eat.

475
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,839
And you?

476
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,599
I'll go home

477
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,880
and make something to eat.

478
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:08,960
You cook?

479
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,400
Dining outside

480
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,640
costs too much.

481
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,559
And

482
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:14,839
I have a huge appetite.

483
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,400
Which restaurant is

484
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,119
your favorite?

485
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,599
A lot.

486
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,160
I have a list here,

487
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,519
with restaurants

488
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,039
that I want to try so bad.

489
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:26,839
Then navigate.

490
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,799
Navigate?

491
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,160
Where to?

492
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,200
A restaurant.

493
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,400
Don't cook today.

494
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,519
But these places are way too pricey.

495
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,119
My treat.

496
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:40,519
Please.

497
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,160
(I shared a rental house,)

498
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,440
somewhere in the suburbs.

499
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,640
Can't afford the city center.

500
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,720
My place is old too.

501
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,200
I keep thinking

502
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,559
once my internship ends,

503
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:06,559
I'll try

504
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,519
to move to a better house.

505
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,960
Living with classmates?

506
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,440
Yes, my classmate.

507
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,599
But

508
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,240
she's on business trips.

509
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,160
I just remembered

510
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,519
I haven't paid her back

511
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,599
the rent I asked her

512
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,319
to cover for me.

513
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,064
(Available Credit: 2500. Borrow Money)

514
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,448
(Zeng Jie Transferred 6,000 Yuan)

515
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,319
Professor Zeng.

516
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,720
It charges interest.

517
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,440
I won't.

518
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,319
Just repay me later.

519
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,640
No.

520
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,359
I can't take this.

521
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,000
Fine.

522
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,480
Then blacklist me.

523
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,079
No way.

524
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:56,960
Listen.

525
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,559
Every month,

526
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,039
recommend me a new restaurant,

527
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,319
and I'll treat you.

528
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,440
But no repeats allowed for a year.

529
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,279
Deal.

530
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,519
But I'll definitely

531
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,960
repay you back.

532
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:09,799
Okay.

533
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,480
When you

534
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,160
earn more.

535
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,119
Thank you.

536
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,400
My phone died.

537
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,039
Lend me a charger?

538
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:41,839
We're here.

539
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,279
Your phone...

540
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,200
Thank you.

541
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,880
Professor Zeng.

542
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,880
Don't mind it.

543
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,880
I've been working,

544
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,279
couldn't tidy up properly.

545
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,319
I should

546
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,559
have tidied up before

547
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,680
inviting you over.

548
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,720
You should say,

549
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,759
'I'm very neat,

550
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,400
but my roommate is messy.'

551
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,119
Right, it's her fault.

552
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,319
Want to drink something?

553
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,200
Your interviews

554
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,599
for artists are too niche

555
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,799
for general audiences.

556
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,160
You should focus on finance topics.

557
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,839
I know some

558
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,559
investors and fund managers
in Caorong City.

559
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,720
You can think about it.

560
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,680
Thanks, Professor Zeng.

561
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,279
Professor?

562
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,000
I saw there's a charging cable

563
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,319
in your car.

564
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,519
Why didn't you tell me?

565
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,240
I forgot it.

566
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,039
Maybe

567
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,279
that one was broken.

568
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:20,960
Why

569
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,200
are you here?

570
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:23,880
I don't know.

571
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,960
I want to find my family.

572
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,359
This is a world for living ones.

573
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,039
You shouldn't be here.

574
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,480
Anything you can't let go of?

575
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,519
Who are you?

576
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,119
Why can't others see me,

577
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,000
yet you can?

578
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm

579
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:39,640
a soul reaper.

580
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,400
How's this series

581
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,119
performing lately?

582
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,640
Average.

583
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,319
The content creators nowadays

584
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,279
don't innovate and can't innovate.

585
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,519
Just copy what's trending.

586
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,039
My current project is

587
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,400
starting to get popular.

588
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,279
Go search for it.

589
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,079
There are many soul reapers already.

590
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,000
Understood.

591
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:09,839
Life is tough.

592
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,440
Why call me out?

593
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,160
I recall you studied literature
at Caorong University.

594
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,039
There's a professor

595
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,880
named Zeng Jie.

596
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,599
Know him?

597
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,640
Art college.

598
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,039
He's some kind of ceramic master.

599
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,359
You know him?

600
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,759
Sort of.

601
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,079
He added me on WeChat.

602
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,440
You added him?

603
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,480
But we barely talk.

604
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,559
(Zeng Jie)
Why firecrackers after his name?

605
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,440
It's my note.

606
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:34,640
It means?

607
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,440
What do firecrackers do?

608
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,039
To explode.

609
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,759
Exactly.

610
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,000
Leave the creep alone.

611
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,599
Creative.

612
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,720
What's your note to me?

613
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,400
Fool Big Hui.

614
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,720
What a direct insult!

615
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
You should be grateful

616
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,519
that I didn't add a 'Super'

617
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,279
before that.

618
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,519
It's already respectful.

619
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,039
Why call him a creep?

620
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,160
Think about it.

621
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,799
I attended his class,

622
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,880
he searched for me in the group chat

623
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,960
and added me.

624
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,559
I need to check carefully.

625
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,119
He hit on you?

626
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,039
He was holding

627
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,160
an art exhibition.

628
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,039
Before replying,

629
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,359
my roommate received

630
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,400
the exact same text.

631
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,119
What do you think?

632
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,400
He's a creep for sure.

633
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:12,839
For real.

634
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:13,880
I almost forgot.

635
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,160
I have to delete him.

636
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,400
Let me check

637
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,319
his moments feed.

638
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,799
Too late, already deleted.

639
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,000
Why are you so impulsive?

640
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,920
Not at all!

641
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,519
What?

642
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:23,519
Why keep him?

643
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,319
What do you want?

644
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,160
Nothing. Want to know about him.

645
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,160
He's

646
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,640
a young professor

647
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,720
enjoying flirting,

648
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,000
and a ceramic master

649
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,440
enjoying being interviewed.

650
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,640
That's all.

651
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,519
How do you know he

652
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,599
enjoys being interviewed?

653
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,640
I saw his posts are

654
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,599
all articles and interviews

655
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,119
of himself.

656
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,519
What a narcissist.

657
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,480
Interview?

658
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:54,880
Got an appointment?

659
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:55,880
No.

660
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,359
I want to capture an artist's

661
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,680
authentic state.

662
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,640
He's on a business trip.

663
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,279
Bad timing.

664
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,200
When will he return?

665
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,680
Probably three more days.

666
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
So this is the kiln?

667
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:19,880
Yes.

668
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,960
All our ceramics

669
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,400
are fired here.

670
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,920
Looks pretty high-tech.

671
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,240
Computer-controlled.

672
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,000
State-of-the-art system.

673
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,160
So you just put

674
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,519
the pieces straight in?

675
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,160
Firing is the crucial step.

676
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,720
Temperature control matters.

677
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,559
Professor Zeng is serious about this

678
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,799
and always monitors

679
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,599
the temperature

680
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,960
throughout the night.

681
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,839
All night?

682
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:57,680
That long?

683
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,000
He always says,

684
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,680
'Every piece is hard-earned.'

685
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,079
How many degrees

686
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,079
can this kiln reach?

687
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:06,960
Professor Zeng creates

688
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,880
high-fired ceramics,

689
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:10,079
requiring temperatures
over 1,200 degrees.

690
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,079
1,200 degrees?

691
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,759
Hot enough to turn everything to ashes.

692
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,519
(It uses open flames,)

693
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,920
(but all within the furnace.)

694
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
(The exterior's insulated with
fireproof asbestos,)

695
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,599
with only a few

696
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,519
monitoring peepholes.

697
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,559
The entire setup is safe.

698
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
I heard your place

699
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,440
had a fire before.

700
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,119
That wasn't kiln-related.

701
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,592
The charcoal brazier
on the second floor lit the sofa.

702
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
The kiln wasn't damaged?

703
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,799
This thing

704
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,000
can reach over 1,200 degrees.

705
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,799
Professor is a perfectionist.

706
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,279
He cherishes the kiln,

707
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:46,559
and cannot

708
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,480
tolerate any flaws.

709
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,039
It's said

710
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,240
Professor Zeng
can't stand blemish flaws.

711
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,400
He's always pursued perfection.

712
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,079
He demands perfection

713
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,400
in all his works?

714
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,359
He often says 'approaching perfection.'

715
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,400
Approaching?

716
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,759
Exactly.

717
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,319
(What we can do)

718
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,640
(is approaching perfection.)

719
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,000
Perfection is an aspiration.

720
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,039
(You lack any aspirations.)

721
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:15,799
Buddy,

722
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,920
are there many girls

723
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,359
who admire Professor Zeng?

724
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,480
Of course.

725
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,519
He's young and talented.

726
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,559
Girls?

727
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,839
Which media outlet are you from?

728
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,240
Just casual questions.

729
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:30,759
Don't worry.

730
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,240
Won't write

731
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,599
such a story into the article.

732
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,759
Professor Zeng has a wife,

733
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,160
and they are very devoted.

734
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,079
But do many girls

735
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,519
frequent his studio

736
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:41,319
to do...

737
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,799
art projects?

738
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:56,839
You can't come?

739
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,720
Choose between Mahjong and him.

740
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,519
You can't come?

741
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,799
Just make it here now, fool.

742
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,319
Sir,

743
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,200
do you know Professor Zeng Jie?

744
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,440
The kiln guy.

745
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,680
Sure do.

746
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,640
He's an art master.

747
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,440
Nonsense.

748
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,400
Kiln guy?

749
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,759
He's a ceramic master.

750
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,759
You know nothing.

751
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:24,880
Listen.

752
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,480
Last year his place caught fire,

753
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,920
burned everything to cinders.

754
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,440
Nothing left at all.

755
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,240
How terrifying.

756
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,039
Do you know why it burned?

757
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,319
Playing with fire daily,

758
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,599
it leads to accidents.

759
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,880
Don't listen to him.

760
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,319
He's mentally ill.

761
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,200
The fire department confirmed

762
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,240
the charcoal brazier ignited the sofa.

763
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,480
Your turn now.

764
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,039
Nonsense.

765
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,359
Does he usually

766
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:45,920
stay here?

767
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
He stays here every day,

768
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,359
even overnights.

769
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,680
He has a wife,

770
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,319
yet never goes back.

771
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:52,799
Suspicious, right?

772
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,119
Does he bring women here?

773
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,440
Every day.

774
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:57,799
Frequently.

775
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,240
He's got loads of students.

776
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,279
It's natural

777
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,839
that many are women.

778
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:02,400
Right.

779
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,599
Have you seen

780
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,000
what those women look like?

781
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:05,640
Impressive.

782
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,000
Both young

783
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,160
and pretty.

784
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,079
Nonsense.

785
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,400
I've seen him bring someone here.

786
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,720
Came by car.

787
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,039
Not just once.

788
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,720
Sir, Madams.

789
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:17,559
Have you seen this girl?

790
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,480
Sure do.

791
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,599
They were both here this morning.

792
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,720
Sir, you...

793
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,359
Don't listen to him.

794
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,160
He has a mind issue.

795
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,799
Let me see.

796
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,720
This is his wife?

797
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,880
No.

798
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,200
I recognize her.

799
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,559
This is his housekeeper.

800
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,480
She cleans and cooks.

801
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,559
Nonsense.

802
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,248
One Character.

803
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,640
Three Character.

804
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,920
Sir, Madams.

805
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,759
Time to eat.

806
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,599
- Time to eat.
- Time to eat.

807
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,599
Let's eat.

808
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,400
- Easy.
- Easy.

809
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,599
Easy, easy.

810
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,559
We're leaving.

811
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,200
Thank you so much.

812
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,839
Hadn't you kept them occupied,

813
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,119
they might have run around.

814
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,039
They are...

815
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,559
They're elderly,

816
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,720
not that sharp.

817
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,279
Thank you.

818
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,200
You'd believe some muddled

819
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,200
old folks?

820
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,319
Of course not.

821
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,440
But I think they prove that

822
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,720
Zeng Jie frequently brings

823
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
women to the studio.

824
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,839
If he didn't do that,

825
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,000
these elderly folks

826
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:21,599
would never

827
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,759
have such an impression.

828
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:23,519
Wait.

829
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,759
When investigating a case,

830
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,680
if a child contradicts

831
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,240
an adult,

832
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:28,960
what to do?

833
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,319
If someone with

834
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,279
mental disorder

835
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,279
contradicts

836
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:32,839
a sane person

837
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,680
who do you trust?

838
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,119
Moreover,

839
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,119
when I dug deeper,

840
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,240
his student

841
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,359
got defensive instantly.

842
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,799
This shows Zeng Jie

843
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,920
is not that decent.

844
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,640
Or his student won't be so vigilant.

845
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,799
This is just your speculation.

846
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
It is my speculation.

847
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,559
You can challenge me.

848
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:52,920
Fine.

849
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,359
Even if Zeng Jie is not

850
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:54,839
that decent,

851
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,640
and often brings women to the studio.

852
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,559
How did you connect

853
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,640
Zeng Jie and Liu Wei?

854
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,640
His student mentioned...

855
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,720
(He often says
'approaching perfection.')

856
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:06,720
Wei said it too?

857
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,319
Exactly.

858
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,599
What we can do

859
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,720
is approaching perfection.

860
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,680
After she made

861
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
that ceramic plate.

862
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,039
I told you before about

863
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,759
'Perfectionist' and 'Blemish Flaw'.

864
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,799
Now another one,
'approaching perfection.'

865
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,480
Just a common expression.

866
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,279
Nothing special.

867
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,640
It's a common expression.

868
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,759
But think carefully,

869
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,160
would you say it casually?

870
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,079
This isn't evidence.

871
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,240
I never claimed it is.

872
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,279
Just my speculation.

873
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,079
Good!

874
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,799
- Good!
- Good!

875
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,359
Two more beers.

876
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,160
I don't drive.

877
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:40,799
Let's discuss the fire.

878
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,759
I've asked...

879
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,480
Charcoal brazier?

880
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,440
So careless?

881
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,440
Professor Zeng's been cautious about

882
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,119
fire safety.

883
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,519
That day he hosted a party

884
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,880
with some friends.

885
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
After his friends left,

886
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,119
he went to check the kiln

887
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,400
and stayed monitoring.

888
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,519
He forgot to extinguish

889
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,640
the charcoal brazier.

890
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,079
In short,

891
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,480
Professor was too focused

892
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,799
on his works.

893
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,559
The brazier ignited the sofa.

894
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,279
Makes sense?

895
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:09,720
It isn't a trash can.

896
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:10,400
No one would

897
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,920
put it close

898
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,039
to the sofa.

899
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,400
They were having a party.

900
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,680
Someone must be sitting

901
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,440
on the sofa.

902
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,680
Why was the brazier close

903
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,400
to the sofa?

904
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,720
Someone must've

905
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,720
moved it intentionally.

906
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:20,480
By whom?

907
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,839
Who had the motive?

908
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,960
Only Zeng Jie.

909
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,319
(I heard Professor Zeng
built a new studio)

910
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,680
identical to the old one.

911
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,720
Yes, he said he was used

912
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,960
to the original layout.

913
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,119
So everything here

914
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:33,799
is brand new?

915
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,200
(I examined that layout
and asked his student.)

916
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,759
Even if the house burned down,

917
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,640
it wouldn't

918
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,599
affect the kiln.

919
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Yet he still bought

920
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,839
a new one.

921
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:43,680
I don't think

922
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,559
he did it to pursue perfection,

923
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,720
but to eliminate evidence.

924
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,880
This fire

925
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,359
was to conceal a murder scene.

926
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,570
- Good!
- Good!

927
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,559
So you mean...

928
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,119
(Zeng Jie killed Liu Wei)

929
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,920
(and put her body in the kiln.)

930
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,759
(Then,)

931
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,319
(he started the fire)

932
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,680
(to ruin evidence.)

933
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,599
(The kiln)

934
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,079
can reach over 1,200 degrees.

935
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,240
Such extreme heat

936
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,400
could reduce a body

937
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,319
to utter ashes.

938
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,920
But he took no chances.

939
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:10,839
So he needed a fire

940
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,200
to eliminate every evidence.

941
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,079
The logic holds.

942
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,200
I asked his student.

943
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,799
When the fire

944
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,119
broke out,

945
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,319
Zeng Jie immediately

946
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,480
put on a fireproof mask

947
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,480
and a fire blanket

948
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,079
in escape.

949
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,359
And Zeng Jie brought

950
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,400
these to the studio

951
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,319
just before the fire.

952
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,559
Well-prepared.

953
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,000
Well-planned.

954
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,039
See?

955
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,319
You agree now?

956
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,119
But listen,

957
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,960
maybe all these

958
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,400
are just coincidences.

959
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,079
You believe that?

960
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,119
The brazier was near the sofa,

961
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,000
but not directly adjacent.

962
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,799
They were using the brazier,

963
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,480
so opened windows upstairs.

964
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,799
After everyone left,

965
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,559
a draft blew a blanket

966
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,360
onto the burning coals.

967
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,840
Buying a new kiln

968
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,159
because the old one
got damaged on the outside,

969
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,000
which would compromise
temperature control.

970
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,639
Zeng Jie demands perfection

971
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,559
in his works,

972
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,480
so

973
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,000
he had to buy

974
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:23,960
a new kiln.

975
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:27,480
A month before the fire,

976
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,039
Zeng Jie was arranged to
attend a fire safety training

977
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,360
and demonstrate

978
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:32,840
evacuation drills.

979
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:33,639
After it,

980
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,480
he brought the fireproof equips

981
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,679
to the studio.

982
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,719
If you're right,

983
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,199
the fire department

984
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,079
colludes with him?

985
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:42,760
Are you sure?

986
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,760
Yes.

987
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,639
And do you know

988
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
how much

989
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,320
those burned works are

990
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,400
in his studio?

991
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,320
Millions.

992
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,840
Some are awarded works

993
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,239
and ceramics to be done.

994
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,239
If he did

995
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,039
plan to do this,

996
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,159
why didn't he

997
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:00,800
send them away?

998
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,360
Your deduction

999
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,440
is quite convincing.

1000
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,840
There are detailed reports
on the Internet.

1001
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,920
I read them word for word.

1002
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,559
If anything's off, I'll notice it.

1003
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,519
Li De,

1004
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,559
you missed

1005
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,239
a huge point.

1006
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:15,760
What is it?

1007
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,079
Why did you read the reports

1008
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:17,920
word by word?

1009
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,760
Because you...

1010
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,000
That's because you are like me,

1011
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,639
believing Wei has vanished.

1012
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,760
She vanished too completely.

1013
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,360
It's very likely she's gone.

1014
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,000
The fire at Zeng Jie's studio

1015
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,280
happened in the same period

1016
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,760
to Wei's disappearance.

1017
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,679
You also doubt

1018
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,639
if Wei was killed by Zeng Jie.

1019
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,039
It is my deduction.

1020
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,639
I will keep looking into it.

1021
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,199
You didn't let me drink last time.

1022
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,112
You're drinking now.

1023
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:48,840
I'll go to Zeng Jie

1024
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,199
when he returns.

1025
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,199
Zeng Jie has motives to kill Liu Wei?

1026
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,920
He has a wife.

1027
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,480
Having an affair,

1028
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,519
and he has to kill?

1029
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,079
After all,

1030
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,280
he has a bright future ahead.

1031
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,000
Killing

1032
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,760
by mistake or on impulse...

1033
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,000
Countless possibilities.

1034
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,239
You sure

1035
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,039
Liu Wei is related to Zeng Jie?

1036
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,000
Man!

1037
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,400
Wei broke up with me
after knowing Zeng Jie.

1038
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,159
Why?

1039
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:18,599
I don't have aesthetics

1040
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,280
to let her make ceramic plates?

1041
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,800
In your opinion,

1042
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,480
will she

1043
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,079
force Zeng Jie to divorce?

1044
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,559
No idea.

1045
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,800
You know

1046
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,639
I wasn't in too deep

1047
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,079
with Wei.

1048
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,159
Big Hui.

1049
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,360
You loved her so much.

1050
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,880
Not really.

1051
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,840
I almost forgot her.

1052
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,519
In fact, I already have.

1053
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,480
But I just realized suddenly

1054
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,920
that she's not around me.

1055
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:55,840
If she

1056
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,119
suddenly appears,

1057
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,000
I don't care if she's living well,

1058
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,920
I'll leave

1059
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,199
once I know she's fine.

1060
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,119
Drop me off ahead.

1061
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,440
What?

1062
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,920
It's near my home.

1063
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,519
I had too much.

1064
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,760
Gonna take a walk.

1065
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,159
Your phone died.

1066
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,440
Go get a power bank.

1067
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,440
How? My phone's off.

1068
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,360
I shared

1069
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:28,599
my location with you.

1070
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,079
Your pin was way off.

1071
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,079
I'd never notice you

1072
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,280
if not for my sharp eyes.

1073
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,039
That's because I'm attractive,

1074
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:34,559
okay?

1075
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,280
That's your problem.

1076
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,800
Sure.

1077
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Let's get this wig.

1078
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,119
Wear this,

1079
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
and you'll be noticeable.

1080
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,960
I look amazing.

1081
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,119
I always look good.

1082
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:53,000
Exactly.

1083
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:53,880
You get one too.

1084
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,239
This one.

1085
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,760
Looks great.

1086
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,599
It's scary to think

1087
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,039
if we lose our phones,

1088
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,440
we'd lose all connections,

1089
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,079
like disappearing.

1090
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:11,280
No way.

1091
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,280
I'll always find you.

1092
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:13,920
How?

1093
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,559
What do I do?

1094
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,119
Finding you would be easy.

1095
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,880
You're just a video editor.

1096
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:20,840
Do you think

1097
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,800
you're a detective?

1098
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,800
Anyway,

1099
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,000
I can always find you.

1100
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:26,960
Are you insane?

1101
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:27,840
Pick a green one?

1102
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,079
You told me to.

1103
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,119
Don't wear it.

1104
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,280
Fine.

1105
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,960
When we break up,

1106
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,159
you'll never find me again.

1107
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,280
If we break up,

1108
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,599
I won't look for you.

1109
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,559
But if I do,

1110
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,760
I'll find you anywhere.

1111
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,440
Just try.

1112
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,480
Just try.

1113
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,159
Just try.

1114
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,679
Try.

1115
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,440
Stop it!

1116
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,679
I'm sorry.

1117
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,440
Hello.

1118
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,320
You're back?

1119
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,280
That was quick.

1120
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,599
(Congratulations)

1121
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,320
(for winning this competition.)

1122
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,079
(Please share with us)

1123
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,000
(the concept)

1124
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:09,920
(of this work.)

1125
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,559
(No chaos, no hesitation,)

1126
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,719
(no fear, no attachment.)

1127
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:13,960
Leave it here.

1128
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:14,760
I'll put it away.

1129
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,239
How's it?

1130
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,519
While I was away, anything happened?

1131
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,079
Nothing special.

1132
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,760
A reporter came by

1133
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:22,719
for an interview.

1134
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,400
Which agency?

1135
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,480
Didn't tell me.

1136
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,400
No appointment either.

1137
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,719
He wanted to know

1138
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,519
the daily life of you.

1139
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,199
Reporters nowadays

1140
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,079
are living toughly.

1141
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,960
Think of such approach?

1142
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,360
He left no contact,

1143
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,000
said to return later.

1144
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,559
What's the interview about?

1145
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:40,960
Didn't mention.

1146
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,239
Just chitchat.

1147
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,480
He mentioned last year's fire.

1148
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,719
Fire?

1149
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,280
It's been a year.

1150
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,559
Why would anyone

1151
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,239
bring that up?

1152
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,000
Then he's nosy,

1153
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,079
asked if many women

1154
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,039
come visit you.

1155
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,560
What did you say?

1156
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,119
Nothing.

1157
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,000
Alright.

1158
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,119
(Congratulations)

1159
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,920
(for winning this competition.)

1160
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,639
(Please share with us)

1161
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,480
(the concept)

1162
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:24,280
(of this work.)

1163
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,112
(No chaos, no hesitation,)

1164
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,440
(no fear, no attachment.)

1165
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,559
(What do they represent?)

1166
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,867
Come down together.

1167
00:40:48,672 --> 00:40:49,330
Him?

1168
00:40:51,424 --> 00:40:52,160
Okay, one more.

1169
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,992
One more.

1170
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,640
I'll find out
where this thing came from.

1171
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,920
Alright, cut!

1172
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,928
After that fire, Wei vanished.

1173
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,816
The men nowadays...

1174
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,135
Unbelievable.

1175
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:05,440
Sorry.

1176
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,304
What's wrong?

1177
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,064
No, no. I messed up my lines.

1178
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:10,928
He must've brought women to the studio.

1179
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:13,152
If he hadn't, they wouldn't...

1180
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:14,530
Sorry.

1181
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:17,792
See if you have seen this girl.

1182
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:19,392
Yes.

1183
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:21,792
They were here this morning.

1184
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,351
Sir, you...

1185
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,290
Say that again!

1186
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,160
What, you're scared?

1187
00:41:29,632 --> 00:41:31,296
- Got that?
- The hit.

1188
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:36,827
Are you even a man?

1189
00:41:37,476 --> 00:41:38,441
Say that again!

1190
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:39,620
You want to hit me?

1191
00:41:41,856 --> 00:41:42,880
Whoa, I fell.

1192
00:41:45,664 --> 00:41:48,640
If you hadn't come to us
for fire safety training,

1193
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,748
I would never prepare them.

1194
00:41:52,768 --> 00:41:54,912
You set fire every day.

1195
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,000
You're a pro.

1196
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,796
That's different.

1197
00:41:58,002 --> 00:42:00,132
Fire brings destruction,

1198
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:01,888
I create art.

1199
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,728
I believe I'll create more
and better works in the future.

1200
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,517
Sorry.

1201
00:42:08,672 --> 00:42:10,293
But I...

1202
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:12,164
Sorry.

1203
00:42:16,384 --> 00:42:17,280
Let me tell you.

1204
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,112
You...

1205
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:20,672
Excuse me.

1206
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:21,372
It's fine.

1207
00:42:22,716 --> 00:42:24,160
I can't breathe.

1208
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,088
I can't do it.

1209
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:28,367
You're good to go.

1210
00:42:28,384 --> 00:42:31,978
♪So hypnotize before we pull the fight♪

1211
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,400
Bai Xiaoling, listen.

1212
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,928
Stop judging me
with your nouveau riche mindset.

1213
00:42:37,312 --> 00:42:38,302
Today,

1214
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:39,881
aesthetics has value

1215
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:41,285
and art has value.

1216
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:43,535
My career, my value...

1217
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:45,856
Wait, that's wrong.

1218
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:47,392
My career, my achievements...

1219
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,553
Clear now?

1220
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,945
Maybe

1221
00:42:54,688 --> 00:42:55,647
that one was broken.
