00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
Darker?

4
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,560
You watch this stuff?

5
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,120
You didn't update.

6
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,879
I have to watch this to kill time.

7
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,719
Yang Zhenghui!

8
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,400
Huang?

9
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,599
Why are you here?

10
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,079
Like you've seen a ghost.

11
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,680
I don't want to see you either.

12
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,400
Is this your girlfriend?

13
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,439
Your taste

14
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,439
has changed.

15
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,239
Stop it.

16
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,599
She's just a friend.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,120
Don't worry.

18
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,719
Having a girlfriend

19
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,520
is a good thing.

20
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,919
She's got limited mobility.

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,039
Take good care of her.

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,360
No offense.

23
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,439
You're offending me.

24
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,879
Can you stop it?

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,360
What are you worried about?

26
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,360
Why so worried?

27
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,319
I'm not!

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,080
Don't stay here.

29
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,879
I'm begging you.

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,560
Just leave.

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
Get out of here.

32
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:23,840
Fine.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,719
Just go, thanks.

34
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,319
Don't touch me.

35
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:26,919
Alright.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,840
I'll leave you alone.

37
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,520
Wishing you good health.

38
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,199
You!

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,840
Ex-girlfriend?

40
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,800
The one

41
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,080
you couldn't find last year?

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,520
No.

43
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,919
The one before that.

44
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,000
She doesn't seem

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,280
very friendly toward you.

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,840
The breakup was messy.

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,680
It was years ago.

48
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,840
I hadn't started making

49
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,360
videos.

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,319
Had no money either.

51
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,639
Even for her birthday,

52
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,919
I had to borrow money

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,879
to buy her gifts.

54
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,000
Then some guy

55
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:57,800
pursued her.

56
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,000
He was pretty wealthy.

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,680
I found it out

58
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,840
and we had a huge fight.

59
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,879
She cut ties with him.

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,000
But soon after,

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,879
she dated

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,759
another guy.

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,400
That guy

64
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,400
was married.

65
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,759
She wasn't right for you.

66
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,000
No need to tolerate her.

67
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,439
Not really.

68
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,719
With my conditions then,

69
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,199
no girl was right for me.

70
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,120
But

71
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,400
I later made up my mind

72
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,240
to quit my job

73
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,080
and started making videos.

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,840
Are you successful now?

75
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,439
Not yet.

76
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,639
But my income is

77
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
better than before.

78
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,439
I've already

79
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
shared

80
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,080
my story.

81
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,800
Now

82
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,599
it's your turn.

83
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,759
I didn't ask you to,

84
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,680
but you shared it.

85
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,840
I'm just curious

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,319
how your husband managed to

87
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,240
win over a wealthy girl

88
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,120
like you.

89
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,319
I can tell you,

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
but you can't learn it.

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,319
Maybe I can.

92
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,439
Try me then.

93
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,000
I need to go to the wet market today.

94
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,000
Go with me.

95
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,800
Maybe I'd tell you on the way.

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,719
Let's go.

97
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,520
What?

98
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,759
You forgot the rules.

99
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,639
Luckily, I kept the clothes

100
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,719
in the trunk.

101
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,600
Or, I couldn't

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
go with you.

103
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,519
You didn't wash

104
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,240
them?

105
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,240
I only wore them for one day.
Why would I?

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,199
You men are really something!

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,720
I went on

108
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,120
a road trip with a friend

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,560
and had a flat tire on the way.

110
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,680
We two girls

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,959
couldn't change the tire.

112
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,120
We called for help

113
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,759
but they wouldn't arrive for hours.

114
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,040
We were just waiting.

115
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,720
Then we met my husband

116
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,560
who's taking students for fieldwork.

117
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,319
Great!

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,079
What's wrong?

119
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,680
My car broke down. The tire is flat.

120
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,120
Spare tire?

121
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:02,759
Yes.

122
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,480
In the trunk.

123
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,600
But we don't know how.

124
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,120
No problem.

125
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,920
Here.

126
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,120
Put the sign

127
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:07,839
over there.

128
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,199
Okay.

129
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,079
Get the tools and the spare tire.

130
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,839
Let's change it.

131
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,319
Alright.

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,480
Thank you so much!

133
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,839
No need. We're passing by.

134
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,519
No big deal.

135
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,944
Professor Zeng, done.

136
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,720
Get in then.

137
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,439
Okay.

138
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,279
You're so young to be a professor.

139
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,879
Just an assistant professor.

140
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,120
Are you taking students on a trip?

141
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,040
I'm taking them for fieldwork.

142
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,879
Art Department of Caorong University.

143
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,319
Where are you going?

144
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,000
Maybe join us?

145
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,560
We are just vacationing.

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,839
You drive such a nice car,

147
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,680
probably stay in a boutique hotel.

148
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,199
When we do fieldwork,

149
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,160
usually stay with

150
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,000
locals.

151
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,079
You two city girls

152
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,240
couldn't stand it.

153
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay. Enjoy your trip.

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,839
I'm leaving.

155
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm Zeng Jie.

156
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,000
What car did you drive?

157
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,480
Cayenne.

158
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,600
Remember what car

159
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,680
that rich lady drove?

160
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,600
Yes, yes.

161
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,759
We circled the car

162
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,759
a few times

163
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,839
and saw it clearly. A Porsche.

164
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,160
Do you have a Porsche sports car?

165
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
I've never liked sports cars.

166
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,360
I prefer taller vehicles

167
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,199
with better views.

168
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,639
So you and your husband

169
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,079
just started dating then?

170
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
(Zeng Jie's Moments)
Not bad.

171
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,920
He's your type,
dressing decent but wild inside.

172
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,120
What did you say?

173
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,040
Look,

174
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,480
he's an artist.

175
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,319
His Moments is

176
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,480
filled with ceramics.

177
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,319
I never realized

178
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,959
ceramics could be so beautiful.

179
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,439
What now?

180
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,120
You fancy him.

181
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,319
Now you even like

182
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,839
what he likes?

183
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,199
He's talented.

184
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,560
(Zeng Jie's Profile)
He's won awards.

185
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,439
At his age,

186
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,639
he's already a professor.

187
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,240
Miss Bai,

188
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,519
make your move now,

189
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,279
or

190
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,519
other beauties might

191
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,240
beat you to it.

192
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,199
Heard me?

193
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,319
Stop it. Get in the car.

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,160
Soon after my birthday,

195
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
he saw my post

196
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,879
and sent me a gift.

197
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,360
I received a gift,

198
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,399
very special.

199
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,480
Just an ordinary piece of work.

200
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,360
This is a hairpin, right?

201
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,360
You made this?

202
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,120
Yes.

203
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,240
You have everything.

204
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,959
Designer bags, jewelry.

205
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,959
You've got all that.

206
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,240
So I made

207
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,759
this thing for you.

208
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,399
I really like it.

209
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,879
Since childhood,

210
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,759
no one ever

211
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,959
made anything for me.

212
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
Let alone something this special.

213
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,439
You even engraved a poem?

214
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,920
What does it say?

215
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,480
I yearn to send a letter to my beloved.

216
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,360
But mountains stretch, rivers flow.
I have no idea where my beloved is.

217
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,160
Why can't I

218
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,000
recognize it?

219
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,040
In ancient script.

220
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,439
Just knowing the meaning.

221
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,759
What does that mean?

222
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,959
(I found a poetry.)

223
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,600
Being young and charming
as plum blossoms.

224
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,480
I wear a flower hairpin,
betrothed to you.

225
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,079
This man is really something.

226
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,959
Perhaps.

227
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,519
Anyway, I was quite moved,

228
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,559
thinking he's really thoughtful.

229
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,679
True.

230
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,320
Whatever he does,

231
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,320
he's always this thoughtful.

232
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,759
Let me tell you.

233
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,039
This fish is so fresh.

234
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,919
All picked this morning.

235
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,480
I fear you wouldn't come today.

236
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,279
Thanks.

237
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,080
Take care.

238
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,519
That vendor knows you well.

239
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,360
You love fish?

240
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm so noticeable.

241
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,799
Coming twice,

242
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,960
and they all remember me.

243
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,679
I don't like fish.

244
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,840
But my husband does.

245
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,480
Despite all this,

246
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,519
you still cook at home?

247
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,559
Despite all this,

248
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,080
I can only cook at home.

249
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,120
Besides,

250
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,759
I want to do something.

251
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,919
As usual?

252
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Pork belly, a bit leaner.

253
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,639
Pork liver and lungs,

254
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,120
a bit of each.

255
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,000
You don't seem like eating these.

256
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,519
He likes pork belly.

257
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,399
Liver and lung soup

258
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,200
are good for him.

259
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,120
He often stays up late.

260
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,919
You're such a devoted wife.

261
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
All done.

262
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,720
Next, let's get some greens?

263
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,320
What do you like to eat?

264
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,600
There's

265
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,519
a supermarket

266
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,440
by the market entrance.

267
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,879
They sell excellent steaks

268
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,639
and bread.

269
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,559
(Steak)
It's pricey.

270
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,200
With higher meat grade.

271
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,559
Should I drive you back to café

272
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,559
or home?

273
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,440
Home.

274
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,120
My husband is working late.

275
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
Can't pick me up.

276
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,080
Okay.

277
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,360
Your husband is really lucky.

278
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,759
You treat him so well.

279
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,320
What's special about
shopping and cooking?

280
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,320
Aren't all wives doing so?

281
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:11,360
Besides,

282
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,799
I'm disabled now.

283
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,240
Is it lucky?

284
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,679
You weren't disabled before.

285
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,320
And you'll recover.

286
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,120
Let me take you home.

287
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,600
No need. It's close enough.

288
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll go back myself.

289
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,200
I'm dressed like this.

290
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,480
Don't worry.

291
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,559
I'm not worrying.

292
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,519
I can go back on my own.

293
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,919
You've helped me a lot.

294
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,519
Thank you.

295
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,399
Alright.

296
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,399
Be careful then.

297
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,840
Wash the clothes.

298
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,440
Zeng Jie.

299
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,360
Before I discharge,

300
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,960
I want to have a chat with you.

301
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,879
Alright.

302
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,960
I need to confess something

303
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,519
that

304
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,960
I did consider divorcing you.

305
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,159
And now?

306
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,399
Still want to?

307
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,559
How about you?

308
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,600
Master Zeng,

309
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,879
could you bear having

310
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,399
a disabled wife?

311
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,240
Can you tolerate a blemish flaw like me?

312
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,440
The doctors said

313
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,080
there's a chance you could recover.

314
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,200
What if I can't?

315
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,480
Now,

316
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,360
I couldn't abandon you.

317
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,759
Right.

318
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,039
Of course, you can't abandon

319
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,600
your injured, disabled wife.

320
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,720
If you did,

321
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,679
your reputation would suffer.

322
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,399
Let's discuss this at home.

323
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,879
Afraid of losing face?

324
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,120
I mean,

325
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,360
there's no need to argue here.

326
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,679
I don't mean to argue.

327
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,799
I want to clarify things.

328
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,039
Zeng Jie.

329
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,639
I nearly died this time.

330
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,639
It made me realize many things.

331
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,159
There's

332
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,480
no perfect couple in the world.

333
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,159
Now that I'm in this state,

334
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,279
if we divorce,

335
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,159
my parents will

336
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,240
ask you for money.

337
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,960
Don't tell me

338
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,320
any excuse.

339
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,679
You know well how much money

340
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,840
you took.

341
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,159
I'm calmly discussing

342
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,000
this with you,

343
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,240
and negotiating

344
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,399
terms we can both accept.

345
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,240
Go ahead.

346
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,799
First,

347
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,480
you act as a devoted husband.

348
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,120
In public,

349
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,039
show your

350
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,960
loyalty

351
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,919
and love toward me.

352
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,279
For any events

353
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,919
requiring spouses to attend,

354
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
you must bring me.

355
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,360
Rest assured,

356
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,879
even in a wheelchair,

357
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,120
I won't embarrass you.

358
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,200
Bear with it.

359
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
It'll help

360
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,559
your public image.

361
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:50,720
And second?

362
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:51,840
No divorce

363
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,120
in three years.

364
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,399
After three years,

365
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,399
I might adjust

366
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,320
to wheelchair life

367
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,080
and my outlook could improve.

368
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,039
If you want divorce,

369
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,679
I would agree

370
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,480
and set you free.

371
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,600
In these three years,

372
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,399
act as a devoted husband

373
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,799
in public.

374
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,080
No need to come home,

375
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,279
or spend time with me.

376
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,360
You can

377
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,440
be with any women you like,

378
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,759
and I won't interfere.

379
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,840
And third?

380
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,840
Of course.

381
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,200
You know what it is.

382
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,679
Repaying my parents' money gradually.

383
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,840
I got it.

384
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,159
I'll accept my losses.

385
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,320
Just return

386
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,720
three million annually

387
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,519
for three years.

388
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,840
Nine million totals.

389
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,759
It's less than

390
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,840
half of what you took.

391
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,399
Bai Xiaoling.

392
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,440
I've told you many times

393
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,159
that money is in the fund...

394
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,679
Details aren't my concern.

395
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,600
I've heard it

396
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,440
enough.

397
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,279
I'm sick of it.

398
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,000
I want no excuses,

399
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,720
but money.

400
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,679
Nine million in three years.

401
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,559
Can you manage it?

402
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,679
I think...

403
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,000
Before my accident,

404
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,960
you

405
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,799
sent my car for maintenance.

406
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,120
And the car

407
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
had brake failure right after that.

408
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,559
Bai Xiaoling,

409
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,320
what do you mean?

410
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,200
Do you think I'd harm...

411
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,879
I know you wouldn't harm me.

412
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,360
But if

413
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,559
you don't agree to my terms,

414
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,159
we'll divorce now.

415
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,840
And I'll publicly announce

416
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,159
you took my car for maintenance.

417
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,840
Master Zeng,

418
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,360
you abandoned your wife

419
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,519
after she got disabled.

420
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,080
Moreover, the accident's cause

421
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,480
could raise suspicions.

422
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,879
Your reputation, your image,

423
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,000
and your credibility.

424
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,480
What would happen then?

425
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,120
Bai Xiaoling,

426
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,960
don't push me!

427
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,840
Do I push you?

428
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,200
My dad is a millionaire.

429
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,039
Who are you?

430
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,759
A fake master propped up by money.

431
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,039
Marrying me grants you

432
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:05,960
an immediate success.

433
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,279
Do I push you?

434
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,399
One last question.

435
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,600
Do you agree

436
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,000
to my three terms?

437
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,759
Fine.

438
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,879
Do as you said.

439
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:40,032
(Supermarket)

440
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,000
Can you finish that much?

441
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Much?

442
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,759
When I accompanied Bai Xiaoling

443
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,799
to the wet market,

444
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,159
she spent over a thousand.

445
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,399
Now you've

446
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,440
accompanied her

447
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,559
on shopping trips?

448
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,600
Zeng Jie might

449
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,360
find it out.

450
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,240
I did nothing wrong.

451
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,200
What's there to fear?

452
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,679
Let me ask you.

453
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,600
If you were Bai Xiaoling,

454
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,519
a wealthy woman,

455
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,559
bought fish and meat

456
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,960
your husband loves

457
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,720
in the wet market,

458
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,599
yet he

459
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,200
couldn't come home for dinner,

460
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,640
would you store these items

461
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,799
in the fridge

462
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,119
or feed them to the dog?

463
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,119
In the fridge.

464
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,960
But she fed them to her dog.

465
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,440
The lifestyles of the rich

466
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,640
are just different.

467
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,519
When Zeng Jie's

468
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,480
at the Artist Village,

469
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,920
a rich lady went to him.

470
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,079
I asked about it.

471
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:37,720
Bai Xiaoling?

472
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:38,839
Not her.

473
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,839
Zeng Jie is impressive,

474
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,519
always attracting rich ladies.

475
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,319
Why can't I get through

476
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,200
to Lin Fang?

477
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,000
Two days ago,
I went to the Artist Village

478
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,480
and knew that Lin Fang

479
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
comes from a village.

480
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,839
But different from Zeng Jie's, far apart.

481
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,200
So? Want to visit there?

482
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,720
We've come this far.

483
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,119
Why not give it a try?

484
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,279
You can go,

485
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,960
but remember...

486
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:05,920
I know.

487
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,079
Stay legitimate.

488
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,440
When have I ever

489
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,279
caused trouble?

490
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,559
Yesterday, someone

491
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,680
got detained.

492
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,599
Sometimes,

493
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,160
you should shut up.

494
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,880
(Lin Fang)
Lin Fang.

495
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,279
(Did you die
before Bai Xiaoling appeared)

496
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,200
(or after?)

497
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,960
That sports car rich lady
isn't Bai Xiaoling.

498
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:33,960
(? Lin Fang)
(Then who is she?)

499
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,200
What are you doing?

500
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,519
Solving a case?

501
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,519
Why are you here?

502
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,200
I was filming something nearby.

503
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,839
Just dropped by.

504
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,079
Why did you ask me

505
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,440
to put on a show today?

506
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,079
You're investigating this woman?

507
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,480
What's this projector for?

508
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,640
The room needed some lighting.

509
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,279
Consider it ambient lighting.

510
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,759
You put it upside down.

511
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,000
What?

512
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,440
Maybe it is right,

513
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,039
but our world is upside down.

514
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,880
Your ex-girlfriend?

515
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,240
What are you trying to do?

516
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,319
Wei's disappeared.

517
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,799
Disappeared?

518
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,519
Didn't she dump you last year?

519
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,319
I suspect
she went disappeared last year.

520
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,880
Moreover,

521
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,359
it's very likely she's gone.

522
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
Big Hui, don't scare me.

523
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,960
I know you make

524
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,279
mystery investigation videos.

525
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,599
Seriously?

526
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:46,920
Seriously.

527
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,000
This is a painting?

528
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,160
I thought it was a print.

529
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,480
It's well-painted.

530
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,440
Hello.

531
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
Ask your owner

532
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,680
how much for this painting.

533
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,759
Why buy a replica?

534
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,240
Should be between the 100th and 200th.

535
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,880
What?

536
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
What are you doing?

537
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,119
I have

538
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,559
a deeply hidden past.

539
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,839
Want to hear it?

540
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,279
Is it just hidden

541
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,799
or shameful?

542
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,039
Hidden

543
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,279
and shameful.

544
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,960
Since sophomore year,

545
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,400
I never went home during holidays.

546
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,200
I worked at

547
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,720
a handmade painting village.

548
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,519
It was a magical place.

549
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,359
There were

550
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,279
over a dozen painting workshops.

551
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,200
(Masterpiece, Special Offer, Monet, Oil Paintings, Final Sale)
They made their living via painting.

552
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:01,759
You can find

553
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,039
Van Gogh, Gauguin, Pissarro,

554
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,000
Monet, Renoir

555
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,160
in the village.

556
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,359
Go deeper,

557
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,119
you'd find Degas and Manet.

558
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,559
Even a Dadaism studio.

559
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,119
In this tiny village,

560
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,640
they covered

561
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,240
almost all the Impressionist masters.

562
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,519
Instant noodles please.

563
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,440
The grocery store

564
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,559
accepted purchase on credit.

565
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,240
The owner's ledger

566
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,599
listed debts under masters' names.

567
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,640
Monet owed 350.

568
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,200
Gauguin owed 400.

569
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,319
Thanks.

570
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,039
On credit?

571
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,160
Back then at the Monet studio,

572
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,640
I mostly painted

573
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,559
this, Sunrise.

574
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,880
Other works didn't sell well.

575
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
The studio

576
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,880
would have over 20 people

577
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,160
during peak.

578
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,839
I was the fastest painter.

579
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,079
I could paint two at once.

580
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,079
Each painting

581
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,200
earned me 150 yuan.

582
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,640
During holidays,

583
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,319
I could paint dozens.

584
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,759
I stayed up all nights

585
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,400
to finish two pieces.

586
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,119
My tuition and living expenses

587
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,200
all came from this.

588
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,400
So,

589
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,519
you painted this?

590
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,680
When I worried about

591
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,279
the tuition for postgraduate study,

592
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,319
my dad got hospitalized.

593
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,000
The doctor said

594
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,039
it required 400,000

595
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,200
to save his life.

596
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,079
I couldn't even afford that.

597
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
So I vowed

598
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,359
(Large Volume, Special Offer)
(to complete 2,000 paintings)

599
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,200
(to earn money.)

600
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,119
(Back then, I left a serial number)

601
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,960
(on every painting I drew.)

602
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,039
So, I'm certain this piece is

603
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,559
between the 100th and 200th.

604
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,519
How can you tell?

605
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,240
When doing such work,

606
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,640
one'd start

607
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,160
meticulously.

608
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,839
But when painting
the 100th to 200th piece,

609
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,200
exhaustion sets in.

610
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,440
The work

611
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
becomes rushed.

612
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,119
After the 200th pieces,

613
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
the technique matures

614
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,319
and the lines flow more smoothly.

615
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:25,200
That's why the 100th to 200th pieces

616
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,079
are the worst.

617
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,200
I've never shared

618
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,240
this part of my history.

619
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,240
This story is actually cool.

620
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:40,920
I know that.

621
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,480
But the strong

622
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,200
don't peddle past stories.

623
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,039
You're here?

624
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,559
Wait downstairs.

625
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:58,920
My brother-in-law.

626
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:00,920
Bro...

627
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,559
Shut up.

628
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,119
It's ready.

629
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,279
Stop calling me that.

630
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,240
Just leave.

631
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,839
Why in a rush to kick me out?

632
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,640
Someone is inside?

633
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,400
Who is it?

634
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,960
Afraid I'll see her

635
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,359
or afraid to see me?

636
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,880
Impressive!

637
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,960
New fling every day?

638
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,440
Don't talk nonsense!

639
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,000
What?

640
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,400
When you dated my sister,

641
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,519
did I ever complain?

642
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,799
I always had your back.

643
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,960
You've got so many women,

644
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,720
but I've only had you.

645
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,880
Enough!

646
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,079
Take the money and go.

647
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:46,519
Fine.

648
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,440
I'll come again.

649
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,079
I received a gift,

650
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,039
very special.

651
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,119
Just an ordinary piece of work.

652
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,599
This is a hairpin, right?

653
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,079
Since childhood, no one

654
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,319
ever made anything

655
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,240
for me.

656
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,960
You even engraved a poem?

657
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,279
I yearn to send a letter to my beloved.

658
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,359
But mountains stretch, rivers flow.
I have no idea where my beloved is.

659
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,319
Why can't I

660
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,119
recognize it?

661
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,759
In ancient script.

662
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Just knowing the meaning.

663
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
I'm looking it up.

664
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,599
Yan Shu's poem?

665
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,279
I yearn to send a letter

666
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,359
to my beloved.

667
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,160
But mountains stretch, rivers flow.

668
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,839
I have no idea

669
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,319
where my beloved is.

670
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,440
You don't know where I am,

671
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,880
then how did you send this?

672
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,039
You know it's about you?

673
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,000
Where are you?

674
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:50,759
Wilderness.

675
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,960
Where exactly?

676
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,640
I'm telling the truth.

677
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:56,960
Why go there?

678
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,240
Just killed someone,

679
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,920
need to dispose of the body.

680
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,720
Let me guess.

681
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,160
Are you digging clay

682
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,839
for ceramics?

683
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,200
You're so smart.

684
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,559
When are you returning?

685
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,640
Should finish soon.

686
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,680
Dinner together?

687
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:16,720
Sure.

688
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,000
My friend

689
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,319
runs a private kitchen.

690
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,200
Pretty good.

691
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,440
Anything's fine.

692
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,839
Okay.

693
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,240
I'll book a table.

694
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,119
Sorry,

695
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,240
I'm late.

696
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:35,960
Need to wash my hands.

697
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,000
I've asked the chef to prepare.

698
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,200
My mom is coming to visit.

699
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,279
Don't drag me into it.

700
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,000
No need to say so.

701
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,799
I know you and my mom

702
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,880
are always at odds.

703
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,119
Don't make it sound trivial.

704
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,960
I could tolerate your mom,

705
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,799
but she's been hating me.

706
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,480
Even now, I still don't understand

707
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,200
why she hates me.

708
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,559
Not at all.

709
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,119
You always exaggerate things.

710
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,880
Please understand.

711
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,079
She's just an ignorant old woman.

712
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,720
No need to take her seriously.

713
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,240
Do I?

714
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,640
Since we got married,

715
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,759
I have been

716
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,000
showing her respect.

717
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,680
Like you said,

718
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,400
she's just an ignorant old woman.

719
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,200
But I'm not an ignorant daughter-in-law.

720
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,640
Since you met me,

721
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,680
you knew it.

722
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,319
Is it my fault?

723
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
Unreasonable.

724
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,640
You better

725
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,519
think carefully

726
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,759
before saying that.

727
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,759
I'm unreasonable?

728
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,400
When we got married,

729
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,279
your mom asked

730
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,240
many relatives to come,

731
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,160
and my parents

732
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,240
arranged hotels for them.

733
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,400
Those distant relatives

734
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,240
you couldn't name

735
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,640
could stay at five-star hotels.

736
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,400
Your mom even got an executive suite.

737
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,680
After we got married,

738
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,720
I treated your mom well.

739
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,440
We've kept a room for her.

740
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,440
Every visit,

741
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,319
I get her

742
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,359
new bedding.

743
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,599
I even hire a housekeeper

744
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,319
to save her from housework.

745
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Do you think

746
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,279
marrying an ignorant woman

747
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,160
who hates your mom

748
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,039
would be reasonable?

749
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,000
I mean,

750
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,960
you could be more tolerant.

751
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,759
How much more do you expect?

752
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,799
Why can't your mom

753
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,079
be tolerant?

754
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,519
She always tells me

755
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,640
you were outstanding

756
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:42,559
and accomplished,

757
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,359
the pride

758
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,279
of your village.

759
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,119
She keeps telling me this.

760
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,440
Think I don't deserve you

761
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,079
or worry you don't deserve me?

762
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,079
Alright, alright.

763
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,079
Stop it.

764
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:52,759
I know

765
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,519
you've always treated my mom well.

766
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,880
But you know

767
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,920
I come from a humble origin.

768
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,000
It was really tough

769
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,039
for my mom to raise me.

770
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,000
I know it.

771
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,599
You often tell me

772
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,799
how hard your mom worked.

773
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,640
You work so hard

774
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,559
to repay your parents

775
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,759
and ensure her comfort.

776
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,039
I understand all that.

777
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,200
But Zeng Jie,

778
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,559
your mom worked hard
because your family was poor.

779
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,480
My mom had an easy life

780
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,599
because my dad worked hard

781
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,200
when he was young.

782
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,119
You're now a university professor,

783
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,599
a respected scholar.

784
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,799
You can't threaten me

785
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,160
with this 'poor-me' mind.

786
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,799
Fine.

787
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,000
I'll stop.

788
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,759
Just put on a show.

789
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,920
My mom won't

790
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,880
stay long anyway.

791
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,759
Alright, let the show begin.

792
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,920
I'm always in a show anyway.

793
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,279
When is she arriving?

794
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,160
She'll take the night train,

795
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,400
arrive tomorrow morning.

796
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,920
Classes tomorrow, right?

797
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,319
I'll pick her up.

798
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,160
You?

799
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,119
Better not.

800
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,359
Last time you picked her up,

801
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,079
you made a mess.

802
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,000
Mom carried three bags,

803
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,000
and had to push your wheelchair.

804
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,839
You can't cross the overpass,

805
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,759
reach the ride-hailing pickup spot.

806
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,559
You and Mom stood there

807
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,119
for over an hour.

808
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,559
No, Mom was standing,

809
00:31:59,079 --> 00:31:59,920
while you sitting.

810
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
Then I had to rush

811
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,400
there,

812
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,640
leaving my students

813
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,599
sketch on their own.

814
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,480
I'll go pick her up.

815
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,519
I'll rearrange my schedule.

816
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,559
Alright.

817
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,039
I'll go buy groceries

818
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,559
and prepare lunch.

819
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,160
Why do you always go out

820
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,000
to buy groceries?

821
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,680
Why not order home delivery?

822
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,359
I like going to the wet market.

823
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,160
Don't want to stay at home.

824
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,119
I just don't want you

825
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,119
to get exhausted.

826
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,640
I'm under assessment
at the school this week.

827
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,559
So annoying.

828
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,279
I almost forgot.

829
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,039
You are

830
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,319
still an associate professor.

831
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,559
Here, Mom.

832
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:51,640
Put it here.

833
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,319
I'll take it.

834
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:55,880
Mom, you're here.

835
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,519
Come have the meal.

836
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,880
I hired a chef

837
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,359
this morning

838
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,319
to cook.

839
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,640
So many dishes!

840
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,640
Mom, take a seat.

841
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,599
Mom.

842
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,559
I made

843
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,880
your favorite soup.

844
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,119
Have some soup.

845
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:18,759
Sit.

846
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,279
By the way,

847
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,880
I bought some drinks

848
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,039
at the supermarket.

849
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,160
Already paid.

850
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,480
Go pick them up.

851
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:26,559
Okay.

852
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,880
Mom, eat without me.

853
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,599
Don't wait.

854
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,599
Come back early.

855
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,160
Okay.

856
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,279
Mom.

857
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,400
Have some soup.

858
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,799
Leave it here.

859
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,119
What?

860
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:49,960
Look at

861
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,240
your long face.

862
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,119
What do you want?

863
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,519
I'll stab you,

864
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,880
you shrew!

865
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,279
I'll stab you to death,

866
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,480
you shrew!

867
00:33:58,519 --> 00:33:59,680
Come on, kill me now.

868
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:00,839
Think I won't stab you?

869
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,079
You've wanted me dead.

870
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,119
You've wanted

871
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,480
another daughter-in-law.

872
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,799
Then find someone obedient

873
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,920
to visit you in prison

874
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,680
during holidays.

875
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,440
Shut up!

876
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,599
Stab me

877
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,840
and you can get a new one.

878
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,679
You'll know who has a problem
when she can't be pregnant.

879
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,000
Shut up!

880
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,760
You jinx!

881
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,320
Mom, calm down.

882
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,000
I really didn't mean to.

883
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:33,840
Honey,

884
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,360
I accidentally spilled soup on Mom.

885
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,639
I didn't mean to.

886
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,679
Mom, calm down.

887
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,760
Don't trust her.

888
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,719
Mom, calm down.

889
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,559
She hit me first.

890
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,440
Okay, Mom.

891
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,119
The blood on her face,

892
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,440
she did that herself.

893
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,760
I didn't hurt her.

894
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,960
Honey, I did it myself.

895
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,239
When Mom threw the soup,

896
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,079
I didn't catch it.

897
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,159
Don't blame her.

898
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,679
Cut the nonsense!

899
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,000
You!

900
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,800
Calm down, Mom.

901
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,039
I'll tear you apart!

902
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,119
Honey.

903
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,440
Calm Mom down.

904
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,400
Drop the act.

905
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,400
How dare you!

906
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,159
I didn't mean to.

907
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:07,760
Calm down.

908
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,599
Try again!

909
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,480
Stop this, Mom.

910
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,239
Alright, Mom.

911
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,239
Calm down.

912
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,920
She's lying.

913
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,679
Jie.

914
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,519
Let me tell you.

915
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,639
You have no idea.

916
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,199
Once you left,

917
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,800
she slapped me in the face.

918
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,599
Before I react,

919
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,519
(October 9, 2019, Wednesday)
she slapped me again,

920
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,920
yanked my hair,

921
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,920
and pinned me
against the table to beat me.

922
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:55,840
Impossible!

923
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,079
She can't even stand up.

924
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,320
You don't believe me?

925
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
She even broke a cup

926
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,639
and tried to stab me.

927
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,159
Then I grabbed a knife.

928
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:04,800
Fine, Mom.

929
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,599
It's all her fault.

930
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,440
It's all her fault.

931
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:06,920
Jie.

932
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,559
Let me tell you.

933
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,920
Just dump her.

934
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,400
She's pure evil.

935
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,440
You must

936
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,599
get a divorce.

937
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,639
You're now a renowned artist

938
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,639
and a public figure.

939
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:17,719
She doesn't

940
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,760
deserve you!

941
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,079
After the divorce,

942
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,360
find someone new

943
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,719
and gentle

944
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,880
who treats you well.

945
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,079
You've achieved a lot,

946
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,159
with handsome looks.

947
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,559
Just find another woman.

948
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,559
Mom.

949
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,719
Not at all.

950
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
What do you mean?

951
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:35,599
You...

952
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,119
You don't want to leave her?

953
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,639
Just because of her wealthy family?

954
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,400
Her father is

955
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:46,119
bedridden now,

956
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,239
know why?

957
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,119
Karma!

958
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,880
They are heartless.

959
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,679
Deserve punishment.

960
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,239
Right.

961
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,480
Know what she just said?

962
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,360
Well,

963
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,440
if you get divorced

964
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,159
and remarry,

965
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,559
then still can't have children

966
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,360
then we'll know

967
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,159
who has the problem.

968
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,400
What does she mean?

969
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,639
Mom.

970
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Listen to me.

971
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,000
I will

972
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,559
definitely get a divorce.

973
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:13,719
Before,

974
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,679
she can

975
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,159
match me in every way.

976
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,400
Not anymore.

977
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,079
How could I spend my life with her?

978
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,960
Then hurry up.

979
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,440
What are you waiting for?

980
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,079
Mom.

981
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,440
I told you on the way here.

982
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,239
I'm under assessment now.

983
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,480
If all goes well,

984
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,400
I'll soon become a full professor.

985
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,679
At this critical moment,

986
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,760
no scandals allowed.

987
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,000
If I have

988
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,400
a family issue now,

989
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,159
it'll ruin my career.

990
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,159
I see.

991
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,920
Calm down, Mom.

992
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,519
After the rating,

993
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,960
I'll make it done soon.

994
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,000
Okay?

995
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,360
Alright.

996
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,239
If you divorced,

997
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,599
you're entitled

998
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:52,400
to her money

999
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,400
and this house.

1000
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,519
This is joint marital property.

1001
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,599
I've consulted lawyers.

1002
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,840
You must claim your half.

1003
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:00,840
Jie.

1004
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,400
You are

1005
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,920
the most outstanding

1006
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,000
and the most awesome

1007
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,639
in our village.

1008
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,199
Let me tell you.

1009
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,039
You're awesome.

1010
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:10,880
Bai Xiaoling

1011
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,800
doesn't deserve you.

1012
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,199
She doesn't match you.

1013
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,960
Kick her out!

1014
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,679
Out!

1015
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,440
Okay, Mom.

1016
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,199
Calm down now.

1017
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:20,960
You'd go to her?

1018
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,639
I'll go teach her a lesson.

1019
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:24,960
Alright, Mom.

1020
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,920
Calm down.

1021
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:31,296
(October 9, 2019, Wednesday)

1022
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:55,960
What?

1023
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:58,840
I know

1024
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,159
my mom

1025
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,239
didn't tell the truth.

1026
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,840
No, your mom is right.

1027
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,119
She told you the truth.

1028
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,119
She didn't exaggerate things.

1029
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,239
I know my mom.

1030
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,079
She does like

1031
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,000
to exaggerate things.

1032
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,039
But in this...

1033
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:12,840
Stop it.

1034
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,039
Zeng Jie,

1035
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:14,960
just trust

1036
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,039
your mom.

1037
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,559
She would never exaggerate.

1038
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,840
Fine.

1039
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,119
Let's stop arguing.

1040
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,000
First, I never said

1041
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,079
whose fault it is.

1042
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,159
It's my fault.

1043
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,440
Now my mom insists on leaving.

1044
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,159
So you mean,

1045
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,159
I should leave?

1046
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
I didn't mean that.

1047
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,599
I'll move

1048
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,480
to my mom's place.

1049
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,559
Let your mom

1050
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,679
stay in my house

1051
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,079
and be with her son, okay?

1052
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,599
Don't sigh.

1053
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:45,599
I'll call a cab now.

1054
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,960
My mom insists on leaving.

1055
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,400
I'll book her ticket.

1056
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,239
I'll take her to eat first,
then take her to the station.

1057
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,199
Hire

1058
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,119
a housekeeper

1059
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:09,920
to tidy up.

1060
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:54,089
Come over here a bit.

1061
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:55,208
The one in the middle?

1062
00:40:55,692 --> 00:40:56,675
Zoom in now.

1063
00:41:04,724 --> 00:41:05,502
Master Zeng.

1064
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,130
I'm really worthless.

1065
00:41:09,664 --> 00:41:10,816
Who would want it?

1066

1091
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:02,485
to cook.

1092
00:42:04,307 --> 00:42:06,789
