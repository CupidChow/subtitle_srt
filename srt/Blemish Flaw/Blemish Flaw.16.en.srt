=Episode 16=

3
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,599
During the release on bail,

4
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,400
get plenty of rest.

5
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,519
I know.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,200
You can't get rid of the wheelchair yet.

7
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,079
It's fine. I'm used to it.

8
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,760
I prefer this over walking.

9
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,000
In about a year,

10
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,079
I'll find a doctor

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,519
to treat your legs.

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,640
No rush.

13
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,239
"No rush"?

14
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,439
You're almost 30.

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,319
Isn't it great?

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm only 30,

17
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,079
and I've figured everything out.

18
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,960
No one can ever

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,199
figure everything out.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,000
Even I haven't achieved that

21
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,560
at my age.

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,560
Let's take our time then.

23
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:22,919
Cheers.

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,919
Mr. Bai,

25
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,479
your reward.

26
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,439
I won't tell Mom.

27
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,520
Actually,

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I kept this

29
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,360
from your mom on purpose.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,120
I want her to keep nagging me.

31
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,439
Or she'll be bored.

32
00:02:56,724 --> 00:03:01,670
(The future is wide open)

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,280
You finally

34
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,960
came out for food.

35
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,039
(Why so anxious)
I finally have

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,120
some days off.

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,120
Right,

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,599
we found Lin Fang's body.

39
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,000
Zeng Jie has been

40
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,479
convicted of murder.

41
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,319
Lin Shan

42
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,160
is charged with harboring and extortion.

43
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,879
Now you can rest assured.

44
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,800
I know

45
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,080
the law is just.

46
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,008
I'm happy for Bai Xiaoling.

47
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,640
You went to see her?

48
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,479
Why do you look

49
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,560
exhausted?

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,439
We've been extremely busy

51
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,319
these days.

52
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,360
What's there to be busy about?

53
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,759
I can't share the details,

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,039
but I'm sure that something's wrong

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,159
and the truth

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
will be revealed.

57
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,240
(Good fortune)
Bravo!

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,439
Are you saying...

59
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,919
Big Hui,

60
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,680
I'm saying this because I trust you.

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,919
You've made many

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,960
analytical videos

63
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,840
and feel confident.

64
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,879
But I'm afraid I must

65
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,719
bring you down.

66
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,599
The gap between professional

67
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,159
and amateur work is enormous.

68
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
You and your fans might

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,879
think your analyses

70
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,600
are spot on,

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,480
but in fact,

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,399
your videos

73
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,199
are built on

74
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,360
solved cases.

75
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,519
The real investigation,

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,279
you know,

77
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,759
is extremely tedious.

78
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,519
We often spend months

79
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,399
conducting interviews

80
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,439
just to obtain a sliver of information.

81
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,759
It gets reduced

82
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,560
to a single line:

83
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,319
"After relentless police efforts",

84
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,000
and that's it.

85
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,360
The way you jump to conclusions

86
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,279
makes it exciting.

87
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,160
Many movies

88
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,560
and TV shows portray

89
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,480
police officers smoking a cigarette

90
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,920
and thinking for a moment,

91
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,560
then having an epiphany

92
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,199
to crack the case.

93
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,399
How is that possible in real life?

94
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,360
All we can do

95
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,839
is minimize errors

96
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,560
and oversight,

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,360
and deduce through all the clues

98
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,680
and evidence.

99
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,839
Not with whimsical guesses.

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
That's the difference

101
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,720
between the amateurs

102
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,439
and professionals?

103
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,319
No.

104
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,160
The real difference lies in

105
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,959
their perspectives.

106
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,560
Take Liu Wei's disappearance
as an example.

107
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,279
Your viewpoint was

108
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,839
fixated on the assumption

109
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,160
that she must be in trouble.

110
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,639
You examine every angle

111
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,879
from this bias.

112
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,959
It narrows your vision

113
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,879
and hides other possibilities.

114
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,040
Deep down, your judgment

115
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,079
has been clouded.

116
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,439
From my perspective,

117
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,439
there's no evidence.

118
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,279
So we can't jump

119
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,120
to conclusions.

120
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,519
Instead, we should

121
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,240
address and crack

122
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,680
each questionable detail

123
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,399
to build our investigation.

124
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,279
Wait.

125
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,439
Let me jot this down.

126
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,879
These insights

127
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,680
are meaningful.

128
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,360
I can use them

129
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,560
in my videos.

130
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,399
I asked you whether

131
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,639
you'd be an officer

132
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,480
because of

133
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,519
your exceptional

134
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,399
deductive reasoning

135
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,360
and attention to detail.

136
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,439
If you structure

137
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
your perspective...

138
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,439
Never mind.

139
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,399
For your line of work,

140
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,720
that's all you need.

141
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,639
Wait, I want to improve.

142
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,879
I only have 100k followers.

143
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,839

What's this?

146
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,879
Study it.

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,879
Think carefully.

148
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,439
Remember.

149
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,879
Try different angles.

(The Logic Behind Truth)

152
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,480
You said you usually

153
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,439
reverse the projector.

154
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,279
Yeah.

155
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,680
I use that

156
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,120
as ambient lighting

157
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,720
and to remind myself

158
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
not to take things at face value.

159
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,879
Then why did you revert it?

160
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,399
It's another reminder

161
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,759
to avoid

162
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,199
restricting myself

163
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,759
to habitual perspectives.

164
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,000

Don't bother.

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,879
I just want to show you

168
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,679
my deduction.

169
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,720
About what?

170
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,000
About you.

171
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:58,960
About me?

172
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,360
There are

173
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,399
11 video clips.

174
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,159
The earliest

175
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,360
dates back to July 2018,

176
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,768
five months before your accident.

177
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,679
The latest one

178
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,919
is from September 2019.

179
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,120
That's 14 months,

180
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,600
minus one month in hospital.

181
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,759
No recordings from then.

182
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,799
That is

183
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,399
roughly once per month,

184
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,879
even after you're riding

185
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,840
in a wheelchair.

186
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,120
It seems

187
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,200
Zeng Jie is a real monster.

188
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,639
There are timestamps.

189
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,679
So I looked into

190
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,240
the pre- and post-abuse periods.

191
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,759
There were four instances

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,279
where you both acted

193
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,000
normally after he abused you.

194
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,519
For example,

195
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,639
he assaulted you

196
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,720
on October 21, 2018.

197
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,000
The next day,

198
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,080
you two went together

199
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,360
to an event,

200
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,600
dressed in formal attire.

201
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,960
He hit you

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,840
in the morning

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,960
on September 2nd, 2018,

204
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,519
and that evening, you posted

205
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,399
photos of

206
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,679
yourself dining with him

207
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,600
and other friends.

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,159
It's all for show.

209
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
We have to act normally.

210
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,960
Should I go around

211
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,120
wailing to everyone

212
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,639
about my misery?

213
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:09,879
I believe you.

214
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,399
But there's another possibility.

215
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,480
Care to hear it?

216
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,000
Domestic violence is illegal

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,279
and unforgivable.

218
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,720
But when Zeng Jie hit you,

219
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,600
you took no disciplinary action.

220
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,639
No police report,

221
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,360
no legal consultation,

222
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,240
not even a proper reprimand.

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,960
Instead, you quickly resumed normalcy

224
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,799
as if nothing had happened.

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
To use your own words,

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
"It's all for show."

227
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,879
Under your tolerance,

228
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,480
Zeng Jie became increasingly

229
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,120
agitated and violent.

230
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,039
Put differently,

231
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,240
you were the victim,

232
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,759
but you also

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,559
enabled his behavior.

234
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,320
Right,

235
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,320
I bought a bag today.

236
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,399
These years,

237
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,600
luxury goods have kept appreciating,

238
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,639
better than your fragile ceramics.

239
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,240
There he goes again.

240
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,840
Master Zeng, your temper

241
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,120
keeps getting worse.

242
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,039
What?

243
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,360
Want to hit me again?

244
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,759
(I don't know when exactly)

245
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,600
you first considered divorce,

246
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,879
but last October,

247
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,840
you took concrete steps.

248
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,440
You knew that you needed evidence

249
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,559
of his infidelity

250
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,799
to best protect

251
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,159
your assets.

252
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,440
So you spent some money

253
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,360
and found someone

254
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,600
to seduce Zeng Jie.

255
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,279
Because the intermediary

256
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,240
chose Liu Wei,

257
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,159
I got involved a year later.

258
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:52,960
(Rest assured.)

259
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,240
I'll do my job properly.

260
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,200
Wei seduced your husband,

261
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,679
while you seduced Zhang Ye.

262
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,279
"Seduce"

263
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,159
isn't quite the right word.

264
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,639
You exploited Zhang Ye.

265
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,360
You knew

266
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,679
he was still into you.

267
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,279
(You never)

268
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,799
(planned to file for divorce.)

269
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,559
(You just wanted)

270
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,039
(to capture Zhang Ye's attention.)

271
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,600
You showed him how vulnerable

272
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,720
and helpless you were

273
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,039
to convince him that

274
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,559
Zeng Jie had been abusing you.

275
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,559
Then later,

276
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,559
he'd become

277
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,480
your perfect ally.

278
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,399
Besides,

279
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,720
he was a capable

280
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,440
law firm partner.

281
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,080
But Liu Wei caused you trouble.

282
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,639
She betrayed you

283
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,639
and took money

284
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,679
from Zeng Jie.

285
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,320
Neither of you could do anything

286
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,039
but face the consequences.

287
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,080
(Liu Wei told Zeng Jie the truth.)

288
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,720
(So you couldn't use the affair)

289
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,080
(against Zeng Jie.)

290
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,600
(That's when)

291
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,360
you got murderous.

292
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,919
(On the night of the fire,)

293
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,480
(you left early to rest.)

294
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,912
(You said you were going home)

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,279
(but went to the third floor.)

296
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,039
(Zeng Jie thought he had hallucinated.)

297
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,000
(But he hadn't.)

298
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,360
After the party,

299
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,840
you went downstairs.

300
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,039
(You knew Zeng Jie had drunk heavily)

301
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,879
(and would surely stay.)

302
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,720
(So you moved the brazier)

303
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,320
(next to the sofa.)

304
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,200
(When the fire broke out,)

305
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,120
(Zeng Jie was alone in the studio.)

306
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,759
He'd had too much to drink

307
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,720
and could easily have died.

308
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,080
But to your surprise,

309
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,200
(his workplace)

310
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,919
(had organized a fire safety training)

311
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,799
(two days before)

312
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,559
(and given him an emergency escape kit.)

313
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,399
So he narrowly escaped death.

314
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,480
After that,

315
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,559
you couldn't find another chance

316
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,039
to make a move.

317
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,440
(Ironically, this fire)

318
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,000
(was leveraged for publicity)

319
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,720
(and made Zeng Jie
a master reborn from ashes.)

320
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,960
If you divorced him

321
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,919
right then,

322
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,600
Zeng Jie would lose some money

323
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,279
but still have a promising

324
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,399
and carefree future.

325
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,559
You couldn't bear that.

326
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,600
He had to go.

327
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,519
That's why you devised

328
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,639
a long-term plan

329
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,159
and pushed Zeng Jie

330
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,320
step by step into desperation.

331
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,960
Bai Xiaoling,

332
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,919
you're truly remarkable.

333
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,120
Go ahead.

334
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,679
I can't wait to hear the rest.

335
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,159
A month later, you had a car accident.

336
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,399
More precisely,

337
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,000
it was an accident that never

338
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,159
truly happened.

339
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,159
You even meticulously livestreamed

340
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,600
the entire accident

341
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,320
(Little Fairy)
(to your friend)

342
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,039
(via phone.)

343
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,159
You made the accident

344
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,519
appear convincing.

345
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
(The car crashed into a roadside ditch)

346
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,159
(and you were injured.)

347
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,039
But in reality,

348
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,080
your injuries were

349
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,360
extremely minor.

350
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,559
The wheelchair is real

351
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,399
but you're not disabled.

352
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How I wish you're right.

353
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,360
Alright.

354
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,320
Let me explain

355
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,240
my deduction.

356
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,080
I obtained a used car

357
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,279
appraisal report.

358
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,720
(Used Vehicle Appraisal)
The evaluated car

359
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,480
was your vehicle.

360
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,039
Look.

361
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,879
It was sold last year

362
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,159
within two days.

363
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,200
The owner was a female driver

364
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,480
who drove into a ditch.

365
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,120
Only the engine cover

366
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
and chassis

367
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,399
have minor scratches.

368
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,159
The car is

369
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:01,960
perfectly fine.

370
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,320
The owner priced it shockingly low,

371
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,679
probably

372
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,679
traumatized by the accident.

373
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,919
The brakes weren't tampered with?

374
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,279
The brakes?

375
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,799
Of course not.

376
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,159
They are factory-original.

377
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,240
Still under warranty.

378
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,279
Who got the car here?

379
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,720
It's just an appraisal report.

380
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,600
Maybe I mistook the gas pedal

381
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,600
for the brake.

382
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,559
No way.

383
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,879
You know that.

384
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,399
And so do I.

385
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
That accident never

386
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,240
disabled you.

387
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,720
(You were hospitalized for a month,)

388
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,879
(spanning the New Year.)

389
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,000
(Zhang Ye visited you,)

390
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,159
(convinced that Zeng Jie
wanted you dead.)

391
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,320
Great story.

392
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,159
Continue.

393
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,360
After that,

394
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,840
your life became simple.

395
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,480
Of course,

396
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,200
only superficially.

397
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,399
(Almost every afternoon,)

398
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,399
(you'd be at the café,)

399
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,720
(reading on QQ Reader,)

400
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,399
(and go for groceries.)

401
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,600
(You're a pretty woman in a wheelchair.)

402
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,679
(So the merchants)

403
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,960
(quickly got to know you.)

404
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,440
(They knew you loved fish)

405
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,720
(and your husband loved meat.)

406
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,759
(They all thought you were optimistic)

407
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,039
(and caring.)

408
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,480
(In reality, Zeng Jie rarely came home.)

409
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,879
You kept buying meat

410
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,600
just to maintain your image

411
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,000
as a disabled, family-oriented,
and devoted wife

412
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,120
who dotes on her husband.

413
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,360
(You made them)

414
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,519
(your witnesses.)

415
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
(When public opinion)

416
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,720
(was boiling over,)

417
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,399
(they posted and reposted comments)

418
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,919
(to support you.)

419
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,759
(You fed)

420
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,559
(all that meat)

421
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,799
(to stray cats and dogs.)

422
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,120
Yeah.

423
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,559
I've followed you.

424
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,240
Reading at cafés,

425
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,559
getting groceries,

426
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,320
feeding leftovers to strays.

427
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,879
My daily routine

428
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,519
has become a conspiracy?

429
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,879
(Anatomy)
Looking familiar?

430
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,919
These were

431
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:57,879
the books saved

432
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,440
in your e-reader.

433
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,440
You must be mistaken.

434
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,400
I mostly

435
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,839
read novels.

436
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,240
Too bad I lost my reader,

437
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,079
or I'd show you.

438
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,480
Don't worry.

439
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,119
Your account still exists.

440
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,920
So your saved records remain intact.

441
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,359
Big Hui.

442
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,039
Are you saying

443
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,160
you suspect me?

444
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:20,839
Yes.

445
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,839
And there's more you should hear.

446
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,160
After being discharged,

447
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,119
you bought

448
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,960
six Damascus steel knives in six months.

449
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,599
The murder weapon

450
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,480
was the one

451
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,440
you took from home.

452
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,200
Of course,

453
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,200
you cleverly claimed beforehand

454
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,319
that Zeng Jie packed it himself

455
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,799
and even made the hotel staff

456
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:38,839
your witnesses.

457
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,799
Why did you get so many knives?

458
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,880
You were selecting the perfect one

459
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,640
while practicing the motions.

460
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,880
I also bought 12 steak knives

461
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
and two full kitchen knife sets.

462
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,279
A fruit knife is

463
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,359
easier to carry.

464
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,720
Makes sense.

465
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,039
So combining all this,

466
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,319
you think

467
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,400
I premeditated Zeng Jie's murder?

468
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,279
Three months ago,

469
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,039
I met you while investigating

470
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,359
Zeng Jie.

471
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,519
(You often)

472
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,839
(went to that cafe.)

473
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,880
(So I approached you.)

474
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,759
I know.

475
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,039
It hurt a bit

476
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,000
when I found out,

477
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,599
but I forgave you later.

478
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,319
No.

479
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,720
Bai Xiaoling.

480
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,440
You recognized me from the start.

481
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,440
You found out

482
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,160
when I mentioned

483
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,039
the Logic Behind Truth.

484
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,640
I'm a video content creator.

485
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,920
What kind of videos?

486
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,599
Mystery case analyses.

487
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,519
The Logic Behind Truth.

488
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,119
(Because I could help you)

489
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,160
uncover what you couldn't

490
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,599
easily learn about Zeng Jie.

491
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,920
The information about Lin Fang

492
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,519
was crucial.

493
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,279
What happened

494
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,319
to Lin Fang could

495
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,799
destroy Zeng Jie.

496
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,960
So you found Lin Shan

497
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,319
and gave him

498
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,720
a large amount of money.

499
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,480
I believe you asked him

500
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,839
to turn himself in

501
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,680
at a certain point

502
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,759
and expose Zeng Jie.

503
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,400
Actually,

504
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,759
I approached Zhang Xiaohong,

505
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,359
hoping she'd persuade Lin Shan.

506
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,160
But she turned me down.

507
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,640
I was shocked when Lin Shan

508
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,880
turned himself in.

509
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,319
But when I saw

510
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,079
your father's lawyer,

511
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,480
it all made sense.

512
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,160
(Lin Shan had been)

513
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
(Healthcare Center)
(part of your plan.)

514
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,160
(This connection)

515
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:24,119
helped me solve the final puzzle.

516
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,319
When you killed Zeng Jie at the hotel,

517
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,960
you were also stabbed twice.

518
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,039
It's reported those wounds came from

519
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,160
external force.

520
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,000
That means

521
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,440
you didn't stab yourself.

522
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,759
If my deductions

523
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,799
are correct,

524
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,359
you had

525
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,279
an accomplice in the hotel.

526
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,799
(Only the lobby)

527
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,799
(had cameras.)

528
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
(We can't find out)

529
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,160
(who's been in your room.)

530
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,400
You know what?

531
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,079
I obtained all the civilian

532
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,039
surveillance footage nearby

533
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,440
and finally identified your father.

534
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,319
He was cautious,

535
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,119
driving a borrowed car,

536
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,279
but made a mistake at one intersection.

537
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,319
He glanced out.

538
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,559
That's all?

539
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,359
That's all.

540
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,680
Great storytelling.

541
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,039
It's not about the storytelling.

542
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,839
Your planning was brilliant.

543
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,640
Do you know how exhausting

544
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,640
it is to analyze all this?

545
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,839
Big Hui,

546
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,359
you're truly impressive.

547
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,440
You got almost everything right.

548
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,720
But

549
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,920
you've only presented analysis

550
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,400
without evidence.

551
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,039
You flatter me.

552
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,759
I'm just an amateur.

553
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,720
Praise the professionals.

554
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
They've suspected you

555
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,119
long ago,

556
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,839
and launched a full investigation.

557
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:58,960
"They"?

558
00:21:59,079 --> 00:21:59,680
That's right.

559
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,519
Bai Xiaoling,

560
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,440
turn yourself in.

561
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,440
Will you ride the wheelchair

562
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,039
or walk with your own legs?

563
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,519
Big Hui,

564
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,480
what a pity.

565
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,160
I didn't get to taste
the coffee you made.

566
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,119
Actually,

567
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,519
this is not what I wanted.

568
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,039
But it's beyond change now.

569
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,680
No, it's not.

570
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,759
And I'd like to

571
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:15,799
change it.

572
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,799
Isn't it your imagination

573
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,839
running wild?

574
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,480
(Li De)
Do you automatically assume

575
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,960
Zeng Jie is about to kill her?

576
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,200
I came here because

577
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,000
he might hurt

578
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,799
Bai Xiaoling.

579
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,599
Unbelievable.

580
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,640
Alright.

581
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,599
Have fun for now.

582
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,160
Keep watching them tomorrow.

583
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
But let me warn you.

584
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,119
Do not cross

585
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,240
any boundaries.

586
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:14,304
(Li De)

587
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,599
What now?

588
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:21,720
Big Hui.

589
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,640
This is urgent.

590
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,359
What?

591
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,519
We suspected that

592
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,960
Zeng Jie had tampered

593
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,839
with the brakes

594
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:28,799
of Bai's car.

595
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,480
Yeah.

596
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,440
That car was sold

597
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,559
as a used car

598
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,240
last year.

599
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,559
I got a report

600
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,039
from the car dealer.

601
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,400
The brakes were factory-original.

602
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,680
No replacement.

603
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,000
No damage.

604
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,799
Nothing's for sure.

605
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:42,640
But it shows

606
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,799
that something's wrong

607
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:44,680
with your deduction.

608
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,920
(The brakes)

609
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,559
suddenly failed.

610
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,720
Mount Qingcheng.

611
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,440
He doesn't have a reason

612
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,319
to mend your relationship.

613
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:56,799
We're mistaken.

614
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:57,799
Yeah.

615
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:58,640
We're mistaken.

616
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,400
I shouldn't be

617
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,119
calling you.

618
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,079
But this is urgent.

619
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,079
And you're right there.

620
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:03,680
Be careful

621
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,440
and try your best

622
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,599
to stall Bai Xiaoling.

623
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,799
He's not killing her.

624
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:07,799
She is

625
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,960
trying to kill him.

626
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,279
Coming.

627
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,160
Who is it?

628
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,880
Big Hui?

629
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,119
How come you're here?

630
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,720
This is great.

631
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,440
You're alive.

632
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,359
You're not killed.

633
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,599
Are you insane?

634
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,920
Get lost. Or I'll call the cops.

635
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,559
No need.

636
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,160
I've done that.

637
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,119
They'll be right here.

638
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:36,440
Xiaoling.

639
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,480
I've figured it all out.

640
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,839
Li De and I figured

641
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,960
everything out.

642
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,960
Listen.

643
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,000
This human trash

644
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,839
is not worth it.

645
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,000
What nonsense?

646
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,079
Get lost.

647
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,200
Get lost.

648
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,000
Did you kill Lin Fang?

649
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,160
Did you?

650
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,400
Listen.

651
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,160
Let's bring him to justice

652
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,599
for what he's done to Lin Fang.

653
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,839
Don't break the law

654
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,000
just to take revenge.

655
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,480
Xiaoling.

656
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,440
I know life has been hard.

657
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,480
You've suffered

658
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,680
a lot in the past year.

659
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,599
You've been

660
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,759
on your own all along.

661
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,920
But it's different now.

662
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:15,960
Me.

663
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:16,880
Li De.

664
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,559
Zhang Ye.

665
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,720
We're investigating.

666
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,200
We've obtained enough evidence.

667
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,480
Listen to me.

668
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:26,519
Don't break the law.

669
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,640
Lin Shan received

670
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
a lot of money

671
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,920
from you, right?

672
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,759
You know very well

673
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,359
this is the best way

674
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,240
to punish Zeng Jie.

675
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,440
Isn't that right?

676
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,759
If you kill him,

677
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,039
no matter how well

678
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,000
you've planned it,

679
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,359
it's still risky.

680
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,720
Li De was looking

681
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:56,559
for evidence that

682
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,839
Zeng Jie damaged the brakes.

683
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,680
But he found the report

684
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,000
on your car

685
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,279
from the car dealer.

686
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,960
You know exactly

687
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,160
what it says, right?

688
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,480
Your car

689
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,799
wasn't damaged.

690
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,559
The brakes were intact.

691
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
Before the accident,

692
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:13,839
that vehicle

693
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,039
had absolutely no issues.

694
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,480
The accident didn't injure you.

695
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,079
Your legs

696
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,720
are perfectly fine.

697
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,519
Xiaoling.

698
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,359
It's best to

699
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
let the police

700
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,079
solve this problem.

701
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,319
Let the law punish Zeng Jie.

702
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,599
It's far better than

703
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,759
stabbing him yourself.

704
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,200
I just want to kill him.

705
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:42,839
Yeah.

706
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,079
I know.

707
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,400
If I were you,

708
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,559
I'd want to kill him too.

709
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
But what next?

710
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,559
It only offers

711
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,720
a fleeting satisfaction.

712
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,400
Nothing else.

713
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,079
Deep down, you know

714
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,119
only the police

715
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,960
can bring Zeng Jie to justice.

716
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,319
Killing him yourself

717
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,880
is just a way to vent your hatred.

718
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,359
I know you're in pain.

719
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
I know you're angry.

720
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,279
I understand all that.

721
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,319
But I disapprove of your decision.

722
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:10,759
Xiaoling.

723
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,519
As your friend,

724
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,440
I don't want you

725
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,000
to punish a villain

726
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:15,799
and end up

727
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,039
a criminal yourself.

728
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,720
Let's be rational.

729
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,000
Okay?

730
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,039
I've always been rational.

731
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,720
You've been meticulously planning

732
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,599
to kill him with cold calculation.

733
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,759
But you're not rational

734
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,960
about the bigger picture.

735
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,519
Zeng Jie ruined your youthful years,

736
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,160
but that's in the past.

737
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,880
You still have a bright future.

738
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,359
You're so young

739
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,119
and pretty.

740
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,599
And you're loved.

741
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,759
Do you have to

742
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:44,920
give up everything?

743
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,359
Your plan is not

744
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,720
that flawless.

745
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,079
Think about it.

746
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,519
Li De

747
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:56,480
and I

748
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,400
have both uncovered flaws.

749
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,640
Amateurs can't outplay

750
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,599
professionals.

751
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,200
I know

752
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,000
your father is waiting

753
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,400
somewhere right now.

754
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,599
Do you want to

755
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,960
drag him into this?

756
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,640
To punish Zeng Jie,

757
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,319
do you

758
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,759
and your father

759
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,880
have to sacrifice everything?

760
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,240
Is it worth it?

761
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,480
Trust me.

762
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,519

(Zhang Ye)
Ms. Juan.

787
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:34,195
This is Zhang Ye.

788
00:31:34,314 --> 00:31:35,274
Let me report to you.

789
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:36,835
Zeng Jie's sentencing

790
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:38,554
won't happen immediately.

791
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:40,794
But it's almost certain.

792
00:31:41,395 --> 00:31:42,435
I will

793
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:44,435
keep you updated about the details.

794
00:31:45,395 --> 00:31:46,195
Want to reply?

795
00:31:49,714 --> 00:31:51,234
I don't want you to see me off.

796
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:52,435
You kept telling me

797
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:53,595
to study abroad.

798
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:54,355
Why?

799
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:56,155
Now that I'm leaving,

800
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:57,835
you start nagging me?

801
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:02,234
Rest assured.

802
00:32:02,435 --> 00:32:03,195
I'll study hard

803
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:04,635
when I'm out there.

804
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:06,355
I won't be the same.

805
00:32:06,835 --> 00:32:08,074
You don't know

806
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:09,034
your daughter

807
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:10,155
at all, Dad.

808
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:11,714
Enough.

809
00:32:11,994 --> 00:32:12,754
Remember.

810
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:13,794
First,

811
00:32:14,074 --> 00:32:14,994
take care.

812
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:15,915
Second,

813
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:18,115
keep my mom company.

814
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:19,395
Third,

815
00:32:19,714 --> 00:32:20,915
although I've forgiven you,

816
00:32:21,115 --> 00:32:22,474
you must keep doing your best

817
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:23,955
or I'll be disappointed.

818
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:24,994
Cheers.

819
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:32,675
Zeng Jie

820
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:34,915
doesn't even remember

821
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:36,234
where he buried Lin Fang.

822
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:37,955
They dug around

823
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:38,875
for 20 days

824
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:40,115
and confirmed

825
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:41,074
that it was her body

826
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:43,754
through DNA matching with Lin Shan.

827
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:44,835
Is Zeng sentenced?

828
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:46,234
Not so soon.

829
00:32:46,794 --> 00:32:47,955
He's in the detention center.

830
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:49,635
His reputation is ruined.

831
00:32:50,155 --> 00:32:51,955
He can't get away with it.

832
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:54,835
What about Lin Shan?

833
00:32:56,955 --> 00:32:58,355
He's charged with extortion.

834
00:32:58,754 --> 00:32:59,514
And he unknowingly

835
00:32:59,514 --> 00:33:01,155
harbored the criminal.

836
00:33:01,994 --> 00:33:02,794
But

837
00:33:03,074 --> 00:33:05,274
he turned himself in
and reported Zeng Jie.

838
00:33:05,754 --> 00:33:06,435
So, he will

839
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:08,474
get a lighter sentence.

840
00:33:11,514 --> 00:33:12,675
Have you seen

841
00:33:13,355 --> 00:33:14,714
Bai Xiaoling lately?

842
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:15,234
No.

843
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:17,955
Didn't you

844
00:33:18,314 --> 00:33:19,474
visit her?

845
00:33:19,754 --> 00:33:20,435
No.

846
00:33:21,754 --> 00:33:22,514
I'm done.

847
00:33:24,714 --> 00:33:26,635
My tongue got numb
from kissing up to her.

848
00:33:28,395 --> 00:33:29,274
I'm tired of it.

849
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:32,675
But

850
00:33:33,234 --> 00:33:35,074
you did help her a lot.

851
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:39,314
You know what?

852
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:41,994
I always thought

853
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:43,754
she was a dumb,

854
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:45,155
pretty woman.

855
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:47,675
Now, I've realized who is

856
00:33:48,314 --> 00:33:49,195
the dumb one.

857
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,474
I'm the dumb one.

858
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:55,234
She's pretty,

859
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:57,554
smart, bold,

860
00:33:57,675 --> 00:33:58,754
and enduring.

861
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:00,314
I used to think

862
00:34:00,355 --> 00:34:02,474
I was her savior.

863
00:34:02,714 --> 00:34:03,915
But now I've realized

864
00:34:04,074 --> 00:34:05,474
that I'm nothing like a savior.

865
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,355
I'm just playing a secondary role

866
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:08,994
in her life.

867
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:10,355
It has always been

868
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:11,795
and will remain that way.

869
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:14,474
No.

870
00:34:15,674 --> 00:34:17,594
Not even a secondary role.

871
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,835
I'm an extra.

872
00:34:21,915 --> 00:34:23,594
I feel too embarrassed

873
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:26,435
to see her now.

874
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:28,194
I have no dignity.

875
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:29,835
Ye.

876
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:33,154
You never had dignity.

877
00:34:33,355 --> 00:34:33,915
Get lost.

878
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:35,154
Cheers.

879
00:34:35,194 --> 00:34:36,755
Bro, you seriously

880
00:34:37,154 --> 00:34:39,074
hurt my feelings.

881
00:34:39,154 --> 00:34:40,154
You know?

882
00:34:41,994 --> 00:34:43,235
I have closed

883
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:46,154
the chapter on my youth.

884
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:53,315
I'm Big Hui.

885
00:34:53,554 --> 00:34:54,114
I'm Tracy.

886
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:54,875
This is...

887
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:57,034
- The Logic Behind Truth.
- The Logic Behind Truth.

888
00:34:58,474 --> 00:34:58,915
Cut.

889
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,176
Thought you were alone.

890
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:04,235
We haven't dined out once

891
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:05,875
since your promotion.

892
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:07,355
I've been swamped with work.

893
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:08,875
I'd rather sleep more.

894
00:35:08,994 --> 00:35:10,114
Besides, didn't I lend you

895
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:10,955
the car for filming?

896
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:11,755
I did help.

897
00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:14,674
Is she even fit

898
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:15,835
to make videos?

899
00:35:16,395 --> 00:35:17,554
She's amazing.

900
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:18,634
Great writing skills.

901
00:35:18,674 --> 00:35:19,994
Exceptional analytical ability

902
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:20,955
and critical thinking.

903
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:22,514
She's even mastering photography.

904
00:35:24,315 --> 00:35:25,114
So impressive?

905
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:27,154
You have no idea.

906
00:35:27,514 --> 00:35:30,355
I gained over 100k followers
last month. Most came for her.

907
00:35:30,514 --> 00:35:31,355
My ad rates

908
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,355
have nearly doubled.

909
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:35,275
Congratulations.

910
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:38,955
She's perfect in every way,

911
00:35:39,435 --> 00:35:40,315
except for one thing.

912
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:42,074
That's not fair!

913
00:35:42,315 --> 00:35:43,514
You agreed to give me

914
00:35:43,594 --> 00:35:44,994
30% of the ad revenue.

915
00:35:45,114 --> 00:35:46,034
Why do I care

916
00:35:46,114 --> 00:35:46,955
about the costs?

917
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:48,235
Be reasonable!

918
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:49,435
Filming has a cost.

919
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,594
Post-production,

920
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,034
field trips for footage,

921
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:52,755
meals, gas...

922
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:53,715
These have costs.

923
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:55,114
You should have said that.

924
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:56,474
It's common sense.

925
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:00,235
We've been

926
00:36:00,355 --> 00:36:01,194
filming till now.

927
00:36:01,275 --> 00:36:02,154
What's this meal

928
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:02,915
we're having?

929
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:04,634
You're treating me

930
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:05,634
as my boss.

931
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:07,674
Why should I pay for your meal?

932
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:08,915
It's part of the cost.

933
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:10,034
I'm being fair.

934
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:11,554
I'm not trying to cheat.

935
00:36:11,994 --> 00:36:12,674
Why do you need

936
00:36:12,674 --> 00:36:13,594
so much cash?

937
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:14,674
You have no expenses.

938
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:15,275
Thanks.

939
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:16,915
I never realized

940
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:18,835
you're so penny-pinching.

941
00:36:20,634 --> 00:36:21,472
I'm buying a house.

942
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:24,154
After my surgery,

943
00:36:24,154 --> 00:36:25,435
I had about 200k left.

944
00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:26,875
I need 500k in two years

945
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:29,435
for the down payment.

946
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:30,994
So ambitious.

947
00:36:34,074 --> 00:36:35,594
Lin Shan will be out in two years.

948
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,395
I want to surprise him.

949
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:46,034
Where you going?

950
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:47,235
To the restroom.

951
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:53,435
If we're splitting costs,

952
00:36:53,715 --> 00:36:54,355
that means

953
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:55,395
I'm paying too.

954
00:36:56,955 --> 00:36:57,554
From now on,

955
00:36:57,554 --> 00:36:58,835
we mustn't splurge on meals.

956
00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:00,395
Three dishes for two people

957
00:37:00,395 --> 00:37:01,355
is too extravagant.

958
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:02,994
How is it extravagant...

959
00:37:04,074 --> 00:37:04,915
Besides,

960
00:37:05,114 --> 00:37:06,275
we should avoid

961
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:07,435
fancy places like this.

962
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:08,715
It looks pricey.

963
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:11,235
What are you looking at?

964
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:14,634
- No more fancy restaurants.
- Check, please.

965
00:37:14,634 --> 00:37:16,235
Street stalls are better anyway.

966
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:17,835
Put theirs on my bill.

967
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,674
Hey!

968
00:37:19,674 --> 00:37:20,154
Thanks.

969
00:37:54,435 --> 00:37:56,395
That Monet kid is new here.

970
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:59,074
He even got into Caorong University.

971
00:37:59,634 --> 00:38:01,634
He's working to pay tuition.

972
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:16,997
(Zeng Jie: Intentional homicide,
