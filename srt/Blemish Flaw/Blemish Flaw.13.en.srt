=Episode 13=

3
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,560
There are 131 hotels,

4
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,400
guesthouses,

5
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,359
and occasional

6
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,280
accommodations

7
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,760
for tourists on Mount Qingcheng.

8
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,760
Exclude those

9
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,879
under 500 yuan per night,

10
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,640
without suites,

11
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,000
not wheelchair accessible,

12
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,920
and overly flashy

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,680
or tacky.

14
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,040
Only a dozen remain.

15
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,359
Bai Xiaoling

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,280
and Zeng Jie

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,040
would only pick

18
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:51,920
among those

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,799
better options.

20
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,319
It's easy to find them.

21
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,879
Easy job, huh?

22
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,319
Mr. Li.

23
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,200
De.

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,280
Are you okay?

25
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,560
You look exhausted.

26
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,400
I'm fine. Just been really busy.

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,599
Go on. I'm listening.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Where were we?

29
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,199
You've already narrowed down

30
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,360
their hotel options.

31
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,520
Impressive.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,120
It's a tight scope.

33
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,360
I've narrowed it down

34
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,840
to these three hotels.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,800
They're

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,680
most likely here.

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,400
Wait.

38
00:02:38,112 --> 00:02:39,168
What are you trying to do?

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,439
I'll go on a trip

40
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,159
and "run into" my friend.

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,840
It's reasonable to meet up

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,919
for a meal, right?

43
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,240
It sounds reasonable,

44
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,719
but feels off somehow.

45
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,520
Bro.

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,080
Do you have

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,520
so little faith in me?

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,639
It's not that.

49
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm just cautious.

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,319
Who knows what trouble you'll stir up?

51
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,759
I'm going anyway.

52
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,240
What's the plan?

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't worry.

54
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,080
I'll abide by the law.

55
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,240
I'll simply check

56
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:08,960
the parking lots

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,840
for Zeng Jie's car.

58
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Fine. Go ahead.

59
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,639
Tell me when you arrive.

60
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,680
What for?

61
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,919
You'll monitor Zeng Jie?

62
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
Of course not.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,879
I hope it goes well.

64
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,199
What could go wrong?

65
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,400
Bai Xiaoling

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,240
called me today.

67
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,599
I think

68
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,919
she also anticipates

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,199
something bad.

70
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,039
If you were Zeng Jie,

71
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,360
how would you kill

72
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,240
Bai Xiaoling?

73
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
She's disabled.

74
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,560
I'd stage an accident.

75
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,960
A cliff fall

76
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,120
or drowning.

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,800
This is what

78
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,560
I fear the most.

79
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,319
Same here.

80
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,360
Do something if you care.

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
What can I do?

82
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,439
Arrest Zeng Jie?

83
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,280
You're joking.

84
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,560
What did she say

85
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,360
on the phone?

86
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,759
I won't tell you.

87
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,000
She mentioned Liu Wei.

88
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,199
Liu Wei?

89
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,199
She knows Liu Wei?

90
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,279
Yeah.

91
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,480
So does Zeng Jie.

92
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,759
Actually,

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,040
Zeng Jie met Liu Wei

94
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,079
through Bai Xiaoling.

95
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,040
Come on.

96
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,279
Shocked me too.

97
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,759
All my logic

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
and deductions

99
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,600
missed this angle.

100
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,519
What's wrong?

101
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,399
Keep going.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,199
Truth is indeed driven by logic.

103
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm going to grab

104
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,959
some snacks and coffee.

105
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,000
Want to eat here

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,839
or in the car?

107
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,720
In the car.

108
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,120
I'm ready.

109
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,199
Let's go.

110
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,240
Did you sleep well?

111
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,519
Absolutely.

112
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,279
This place makes me

113
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,639
feel incredibly relaxed.

114
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,240
We'll visit

115
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:23,879
easily

116
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,759
accessible places.

117
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,800
You won't be tired.

118
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,600
Why would I get tired

119
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,879
in my wheelchair?

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,279
I hope you don't get tired.

121
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,399
This is what I gave you

122
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,639
for your first birthday

123
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,519
after we met.

124
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,319
Yeah.

125
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,160
This is

126
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,160
the only scarf I have.

127
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,079
After we return,

128
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,360
I'll buy you another one.

129
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,720
A great artist

130
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,439
shouldn't have just one scarf.

131
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,120
I rarely wear scarves anyway.

132
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,879
One is enough.

133
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,600
And you

134
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,352
gave me this before we got married.

135
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,279
It's special.

136
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,720
Keep going.

137
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,639
Let me get closer to the river.

138
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,519
I'll do it.

139
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,040
Tell me if you

140
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:18,600
want to

141
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,560
eat and go back.

142
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,439
I'm not tired.

143
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,879
Are you tired?

144
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,639
No at all.

145
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,680
Nice spot.

146
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,839
Let's take some photos.

147
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,759
You haven't used

148
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,040
this camera in ages.

149
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,920
You never liked taking photos

150
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,000
with your phone.

151
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,199
Phones lack

152
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
depth of field.

153
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,240
How about firewood chicken

154
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,720
for dinner?

155
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,839
There's a nice place

156
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,120
not far from our hotel.

157
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,199
Let's just order room service.

158
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,040
You must be exhausted.

159
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,879
We finally got this trip away.

160
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,879
You can have some drinks tonight.

161
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,360
So quickly?

162
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,160
I'm celebrating.

163
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,920
Another one?

164
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,560
Come on, third glass.

165
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,639
Quick question.

166
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
Who is Chen Yuhe?

167
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,120
She's my colleague,

168
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,399
Dean Chen's daughter.

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,720
You've met her.

170
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,480
At the anniversary banquet

171
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,679
of the university,

172
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,759
didn't she

173
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,600
say hi to you?

174
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,848
How long have you been with her?

175
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,639
She's just a colleague.

176
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,039
Just be honest.

177
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,279
Was it before

178
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,320
or after my accident?

179
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,960
Zeng Jie, don't be shy.

180
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,279
You've done

181
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,480
plenty of shameless things.

182
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm asking directly

183
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,480
because I've verified it.

184
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,639
She's just a colleague,

185
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,039
Dean Chen's daughter.

186
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,480
Why are you dating Chen Yuhe?

187
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Because she's young?

188
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,039
Or because

189
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,320
her dad is your superior?

190
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,639
How can your superior bear to let

191
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:21,799
his daughter

192
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,639
have an affair

193
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,879
with a married man?

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,639
Are you planning to divorce me

195
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,960
to be with her?

196
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,919
Nonsense.

197
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,759
How could I do that?

198
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,039
Why not?

199
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,799
You only married me

200
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,639
for my money, didn't you?

201
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,639
Yet you put on this act,

202
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,519
pretending to be some artist,

203
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
and offered to sign

204
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,960
a prenuptial agreement

205
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,240
to convince me

206
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,240
that you don't care

207
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,360
about my dad's wealth.

208
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:53,840
You're drunk.

209
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,039
Three beers won't make anyone drunk.

210
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,960
Zeng Jie, admit it.

211
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,120
You've been

212
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,320
systematically draining

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,240
my family's assets.

214
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,039
You're quite something.

215
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,519
Someone's

216
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,240
been coaching you, huh?

217
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,440
This is ridiculous.

218
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,159
What's ridiculous about it?

219
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,480
That person

220
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,559
was Ms. Juan, wasn't it?

221
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,320
You remember Ms. Juan, don't you?

222
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,080
Is she also

223
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
your "colleague"?

224
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,240
Zeng Jie.

225
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,759
I never imagined

226
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,080
that my husband

227
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,000
actually dated a wealthy older woman.

228
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,879
You've been

229
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,759
sponging off others since way back.

230
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,879
Bai Xiaoling.

231
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,559
Watch your mouth

232
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,080
when you speak to me.

233
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,519
Ms. Juan was just

234
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,320
a client of mine.

235
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,720
She once bought

236
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,879
my paintings

237
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,080
and helped me during

238
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,080
my hardest times.

239
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,840
We're just...

240
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,159
I know what's between you

241
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,600
as well as you do.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,440
She gave you money,

243
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,840
took you to Japan for stomach treatment,

244
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,000
and taught you how to manipulate me.

245
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,919
Zeng Jie, stop dodging.

246
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,519
If you'd just admit your past,

247
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,039
I might respect your honesty.

248
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,320
Besides,

249
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,919
not every man gets to

250
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,000
live off an older woman's money.

251
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,480
Bai Xiaoling.

252
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,840
What do you want?

253
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,519
Nothing.

254
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,279
I'm in a wheelchair.

255
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,120
What can I do?

256
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,879
Then why did you

257
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,039
say that stuff?

258
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,480
I just want to know

259
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,039
what I mean to you now.

260
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,720
Will I end up like Lin Fang?

261
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,840
She died right in front of you,
didn't she?

262
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,480
Relax.

263
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,679
Even Lin Shan doesn't consider you

264
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,000
the murderer.

265
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,320
Why would I?

266
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:38,799
Zeng Jie.

267
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,720
I know you don't

268
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,480
want to continue this marriage.

269
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,200
You can't tolerate blemish flaws.

270
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,240
How could you endure

271
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,639
an imperfect marriage?

272
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,240
I've become the glaring blemish flaw

273
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,639
in your "perfect" life.

274
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,240
"Near-perfect".

275
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,919
What you want

276
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,120
is a life nearing perfection.

277
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,279
Bai Xiaoling.

278
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,639
Just say it.

279
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,960
What do you want?

280
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,840
I want you dead.

281
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,480
So?

282
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,120
Everything cool?

283
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,919
Undercurrents swirling.

284
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,639
You're staying in

285
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,000
a two-thousand-yuan hotel room

286
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,440
and soaking in a bath.

287
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,080
(Li De)
You don't

288
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,000
sound so nervous.

289
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,960
Zhang Ye is covering the expenses.

290
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,519
I'd never

291
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,600
splurge like this.

292
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,240
You found

293
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,639
Zeng Jie and Bai Xiaoling?

294
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,720
Obviously.

295
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,120
I came at dawn.

296
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,279
I'd feel humiliated

297
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,720
if I couldn't find them.

298
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,200
They're staying at

299
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,320
the first hotel

300
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,120
I suspected.

301
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,879
Alright.

302
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,960
You're brilliant.

303
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,080
This morning,

304
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,279
I checked this parking lot

305
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,320
but didn't find

306
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,720
Zeng Jie's car.

307
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,919
There weren't

308
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,720
many cars.

309
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,080
Most tourists had

310
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,039
already driven out.

311
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:16,399
I brought some things
for my sister and brother-in-law.

312
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,919
They said they wouldn't be back

313
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
until evening.

314
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,360
Your sister is...

315
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,159
The one in the wheelchair.

316
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,679
Yeah, right.

317
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,480
They just left

318
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,399
half an hour ago.

319
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,840
Your brother-in-law was driving.

320
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,440
Got it. Thanks.

321
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,240
No problem.

322
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,159
Did they mention whether they were going

323
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,159
to the mountains

324
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,279
or to the riverside?

325
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,000
(They went to the riverside first.)

326
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,312
(I stayed back.)

327
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,600
(They didn't seem to talk much.)

328
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,919
(About 40 minutes later,)

329
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,784
(Zeng Jie wheeled Bai Xiaoling away.)

330
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,360
I followed quietly.

331
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,600
They were driving

332
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,960
quite slowly.

333
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,559
(I suspect that Zeng Jie was planning)

334
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,799
(a car accident.)

335
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,480
(But surveillance cameras)

336
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,279
(are everywhere.)

337
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,200
(Plus, he might)

338
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,440
(injure himself.)

339
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,960
(So he wouldn't be so bold.)

340
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,960
They went to a restaurant.

341
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,039
I hid in my car

342
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,480
and had a bread.

343
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,200
That restaurant was decent.

344
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,159
I bet Zeng Jie

345
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,039
looked it up

346
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,240
beforehand.

347
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,600
What are you eating?

348
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,360
Canteen food.

349
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,879
On duty today.

350
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,799
Keep going.

351
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,720
Where did they go

352
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,399
after food?

353
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,720
Here's the crazy part.

354
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Zeng Jie took

355
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:18,840
Bai Xiaoling hiking.

356
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,759
What?

357
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,320
With a wheelchair?

358
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,399
They took the cable car up.

359
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
(Then they walked)

360
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,960
(somewhere with)

361
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,080
(wheelchair access.)

362
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,960
(He even took her)

363
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,080
(some photos.)

364
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,799
(He's got a fancy camera,)

365
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,120
(probably expensive.)

366
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,480
He's an artist, after all.

367
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,600
Please.

368
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,159
He makes ceramics.

369
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,639
He's not a photographer.

370
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,919
I'd be surprised if he

371
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,879
knows focal lengths.

372
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,240
(They stayed)

373
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,399
(for quite a while.)

374
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,440
(I suspect)

375
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,799
(he wanted to stage an accident)

376
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,144
(to make Bai Xiaoling fall.)

377
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,799
(Luckily, with so many tourists)

378
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,159
(around them,)

379
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
(he couldn't act openly.)

380
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,360
Your imagination's

381
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,639
running wild, isn't it?

382
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,159
You automatically assume

383
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,279
he's plotting murder?

384
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,399
I came here because

385
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,200
he might hurt

386
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,120
Bai Xiaoling.

387
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,279
Unbelievable.

388
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,919
Keep working.

389
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,039
I need to report

390
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,519
today's surveillance details

391
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,120
to my sponsor.

392
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,279
He chickened out?

393
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,399
Don't you think

394
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,600
he killed Lin Fang?

395
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,600
Of course I do.

396
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,159
And now he chickened out?

397
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,080
It's different.

398
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,679
He had nothing

399
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,759
to lose.

400
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,759
He'd risk

401
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,159
anything.

402
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,440
But now,

403
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,759
he's rich and famous.

404
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,759
So he hesitates.

405
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,039
Then why did he bring her

406
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:32,799
on this trip?

407
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,360
You think he wants to fix

408
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,519
their relationship?

409
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
I'll keep trailing them.

410
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,679
If he plans to

411
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,679
kill her,

412
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,919
he won't chicken out.

413
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,480
Most places they visited

414
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:43,919
are perfect spots to stage

415
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,799
accidents.

416
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,480
I believe he will keep

417
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,080
taking her to similar spots

418
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,200
in the next two days.

419
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,639
Watch him closely.

420
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,559
But I can't get too close.

421
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,159
I'll send someone there.

422
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,200
Alright.

423
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,720
I'll send them

424
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,600
tomorrow morning.

425
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,889
(Alarm 06:30 AM)

426
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:21,478
(In 7 hours 34 minutes)

427
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:59,151
(Public Security)

428
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,319
Urge them.

429
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,079
Got it.

430
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:18,680
What's wrong?

431
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,759
What happened?

432
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,039
Sorry, sir.

433
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,240
A minor issue occurred.

434
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,119
Seriously?

435
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,160
It's clearly not

436
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:24,799
minor.

437
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Just a routine

438
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,160
police check.

439
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:27,960
Stop lying.

440
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,240
I know the tenants.

441
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,119
- Let me in.
- Sir.

442
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,720
Sir.

443
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,319
Are you with them?

444
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,200
Yeah.

445
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,240
What exactly

446
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,839
happened?

447
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:35,720
Your name?

448
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,240
Yang Zhenghui.

449
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,519
How do you know them?

450
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:40,720
Well,

451
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,240
I'm

452
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,240
Bai Xiaoling's friend.

453
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,960
Is Bai Xiaoling okay?

454
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,359
Did Zeng Jie hurt her?

455
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,480
Sir,

456
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
please get changed.

457
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,160
We'll talk downstairs.

458
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,599
What happened in there?

459
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,279
Hello.

460
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,880
What happened?

461
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,680
Did you see her?

462
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,480
Y-You...

463
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,599
I-I'll head over now.

464
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:08,720
Listen.

465
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,279
Send me the address

466
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:10,960
of the police

467
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,480
station.

468
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,039
Alright?

469
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,160
Wherever you go,

470
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,200
send me your location.

471
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:14,759
Alright?

472
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,936
I'll be there in an hour.

473
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:18,920
Hurry up.

474
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,440
Well,

475
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,240
sorry, honey.

476
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,359
I have to go.

477
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,160
What's your problem?

478
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,279
Freeze.

479
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:27,960
Behave.

480
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,240
Hello? What's wrong?

481
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:32,720
(BBQ)
Calm down.

482
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,760
I'll be right there.

483
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:36,599
O-Officer,

484
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:37,440
can you tell me

485
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,039
how my friend

486
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:38,839
is doing?

487
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,240
You said

488
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,039
you were

489
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,880
her friend.

490
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,160
But those two

491
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:45,920
are married.

492
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,839
So what's...

493
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,000
I-I'm Bai Xiaoling's friend.

494
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,720
Things are complicated

495
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,119
between her and Zeng Jie.

496
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,240
To be precise,

497
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,359
I believe Zeng Jie

498
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,640
planned this trip

499
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,599
to kill Bai Xiaoling.

500
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,839
I followed them

501
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,319
to prevent any accidents.

502
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,720
But I failed to stop him.

503
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,319
Officer,

504
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,000
please tell me

505
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,799
how Bai Xiaoling is doing.

506
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,200
She's at the hospital.

507
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,559
(So you're saying that)

508
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,279
(you followed her here)

509
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,440
(because Zeng Jie might attack her?)

510
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,039
He already did it.

511
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,119
I didn't expect

512
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,039
that piece of trash

513
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,920
would dare to

514
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,839
hurt her in a hotel room.

515
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,759
Calm down.

516
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,640
Captain Wang.

517
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,759
He's from the Caorong Branch.

518
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,160
Criminal Police Team 1.

519
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,079
I'm Li De.

520
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:33,960
Wang Yuefeng.

521
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,448
Captain of Criminal Police Team 2
of Qingcheng Branch.

522
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,696
Nice to meet you.

523
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,279
Captain Wang.

524
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:40,799
I'm here

525
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,680
for this case.

526
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,160
I've been working on it

527
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
for quite a while.

528
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,880
Please transfer the case

529
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,599
to the Caorong

530
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:47,960
jurisdiction.

531
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,400
I figured

532
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,759
this is why you came.

533
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,799
The case happened in our jurisdiction.

534
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,200
By protocol,

535
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,640
it should be our case.

536
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,480
You need to apply

537
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,960
for a joint investigation

538
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,039
from superiors.

539
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,319
You can't just take it over.

540
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,519
Yeah, I know the rules.

541
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,480
Li De.

542
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,000
Alright, I'll handle

543
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,839
the application.

544
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:21,279
You've been

545
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,200
working on it.

546
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,000
So, let's join hands.

547
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,799
You know me?

548
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,240
This badge number

549
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,559
was your dad's, right?

550
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,440
You know my dad?

551
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,279
No.

552
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,960
But your brother

553
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,079
was my college roommate.

554
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,400
510110.

555
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,839
He carved it on the wall.

556
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,039
Four years.

557
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,200
I memorized it from seeing it.

558
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,559
You don't look like him much, but you

559
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,480
remind me of him.

560
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,448
Back to the case.

561
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,680
Officers.

562
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,960
C-Can I join

563
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,160
the discussion?

564
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,079
Where's the ambulance?

565
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,279
You brought me back to Caorong?

566
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,480
Yeah.

567
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,680
You lost consciousness
at the crime scene.

568
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,559
We transferred you back overnight.

569
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,119
Your lawyer

570
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,240
insisted on your return

571
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,359
for treatment.

572
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,519
My lawyer?

573
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,200
Zhang Ye?

574
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,359
Do you have other lawyers?

575
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,279
Bai Xiaoling.

576
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,640
Where's Zeng Jie?

577
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,160
According to medical reports,

578
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,240
there are

579
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,640
no injuries to your head.

580
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,920
Therefore,

581
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,960
you remember everything

582
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,880
that happened, don't you?

583
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,160
Clear as daylight.

584
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,720
Do you have questions

585
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,599
or should I give my statement?

586
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,640
Start with your account.

587
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,640
Zeng Jie is my husband.

588
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,079
We decided

589
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,119
to go on a trip some time ago.

590
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,480
You can see what I'm like.

591
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,559
So the itinerary

592
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,920
was arranged by Zeng Jie.

593
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,680
(We drove there.)

594
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:56,880
(He booked hotels)

595
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,640
(and planned the itinerary.)

596
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,440
(Being wheelchair-bound,)

597
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,720
(I hadn't gone out for ages.)

598
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,319
(So I was thrilled.)

599
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,279
(But while we were driving)

600
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,160
(around Mount Qingcheng,)

601
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,119
(I started feeling
that something was off.)

602
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,559
Be more specific.

603
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,599
Actually, days earlier,

604
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,359
my friends advised me not to go.

605
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,279
They suspected that

606
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,359
Zeng Jie might hurt me.

607
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,119
Who are your friends?

608
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,359
A video content creator

609
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,640
named Big Hui.

610
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:27,799
You said "they".

611
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,440
Who else?

612
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,359
Zhang Ye.

613
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,359
Big Hui and Zhang Ye

614
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,640
were investigating Zeng Jie

615
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,440
and uncovered some of his secrets.

616
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,680
They concluded

617
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,279
that if I went on this trip,

618
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,000
I'd be in danger.

619
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,839
Tell us about the trip first.

620
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:50,799
When did you start

621
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,599
feeling uneasy?

622
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,319
My marriage was going through

623
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,759
some difficulties.

624
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,880
I thought

625
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,960
he wanted to mend our relationship.

626
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,480
But yesterday morning,

627
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,559
he took me to the riverside.

628
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:06,920
I suddenly felt

629
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,200
that he was trying to push me

630
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
into the river

631
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,440
to stage an accident.

632
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,599
I'll do it.

633
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,039
What specific actions did he take

634
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,400
that made you feel this way?

635
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,400
He chose a steep path and pushed me

636
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,480
dangerously close to the riverbank.

637
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,880
I was too scared

638
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,119
to speak up

639
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,000
and only said comforting words.

640
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,720
This is what I gave you

641
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,160
for your first birthday

642
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,960
after we met.

643
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:37,839
Yeah.

644
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,519
This is my only scarf.

645
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,519
After we return,

646
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,799
I'll buy you another one.

647
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,400
A great artist

648
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,240
shouldn't have just one scarf.

649
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,400
You gave me this before we were married.

650
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:49,920
It's special.

651
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,480
(Fortunately,)

652
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,440
(there were many tourists nearby)

653
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:54,839
(taking photos)

654
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,920
(close to us.)

655
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,079
(After a while,)

656
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,759
(I pretended)

657
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,880
(to feel cold and left.)

658
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,319
After lunch,

659
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,799
he took me up the mountain.

660
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,880
There was a cliff section

661
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,640
(where he insisted on taking photos)

662
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,119
(and pushed me)

663
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,359
(dangerously close to the edge.)

664
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,960
Take more photos of me.

665
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,119
Sure.

666
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,279
When descending,

667
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,680
my hands were trembling.

668
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,720
Still, I said nothing.

669
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,400
On the way back,

670
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,599
I finally realized

671
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:39,759
that Zeng Jie

672
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,960
didn't come to fix our relationship.

673
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,200
He probably wanted me

674
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,240
to vanish completely from his life.

675
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,000
What's simpler than

676
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,359
staging an accident?

677
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,240
I realized

678
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,279
that he'd keep trying

679
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,799
to kill me

680
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,960
the next day.

681
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,799
So I argued with him

682
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,880
in the hotel room.

683
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,319
About what?

684
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,319
I'm disabled.

685
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,160
You think Zeng Jie has been

686
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,519
loyal to our marriage?

687
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,599
If I die,

688
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,440
he'd live a better life.

689
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,799
Why don't you get divorced?

690
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,880
As an artist,

691
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,960
abandoning his wife

692
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,319
would damage his reputation.

693
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,319
An accidental death suits him best.

694
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,319
He might even create a mourning piece

695
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,759
for his late wife,

696
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,279
crafting a persona

697
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,079
of a devoted grieving widower.

698
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,359
Did you say that

699
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,000
during the argument?

700
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,519
I just told him

701
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:41,799
I knew all about

702
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,200
his dirty secrets.

703
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,440
I wanted us

704
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,599
to stop this drama

705
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,680
and properly say goodbye.

706
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,279
Quick question.

707
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,319
Who is Chen Yuhe?

708
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,960
You remember Ms. Juan, don't you?

709
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,799
She is also

710
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,920
your "colleague"?

711
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,240
Zeng Jie.

712
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,480
I never imagined

713
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,319
that my husband

714
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,519
actually dated a wealthy older woman.

715
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,119
You've been

716
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,079
sponging off others since way back.

717
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,519
He flew into a rage

718
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,759
and started arguing with me.

719
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,319
Then he grabbed the knife

720
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,519
and swung it at me.

721
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,559
Bai Xiaoling!

722
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,359
Let's end this

723
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,039
right here.

724
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:22,720
How dare you

725
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,880
point a knife at me?

726
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,640
(I blocked it,)

727
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
(and my arm got sliced.)

728
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,359
(He charged at me.)

729
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,680
(He seemed to trip over)

730
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,559
(the dining table.)

731
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,720
(He stabbed my shoulder,
and the knife fell.)

732
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,079
(It landed beside me.)

733
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,759
(I was terrified.)

734
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,200
(I grabbed the knife)

735
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,319
(and swung at him.)

736
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,079
(I think I stabbed him.)

737
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,759
I think I stabbed him.

738
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,519
How many times?

739
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,079
Two or three times.

740
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,920
Or four times.

741
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,200
It was a mess. I can't remember.

742
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,200
Where is Zeng Jie?

743
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:21,960
Where did you find

744
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,160
the knife?

745
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,920
It's the fruit knife from home.

746
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,359
You use such a dangerous

747
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,000
fruit knife?

748
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,799
Zeng Jie bought it years ago

749
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,920
during an overseas trip.

750
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,960
Being an artist,

751
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,400
he often buys

752
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,119
unusual items.

753
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,519
(That knife worked well.)

754
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,759
(I use it a lot at home.)

755
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,519
(You brought a knife on your trip?)

756
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,559
(Zeng Jie packed it.)

757
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
I found it strange at first,

758
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,039
but he said hotel knives are dirty.

759
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,960
Officer.

760
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
How is

761
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:11,440
Zeng Jie doing?

762
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,119
Is he...

763
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,119
Jie.

764
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,079
I wish you had a child.

765
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,559
That woman

766
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,079
isn't wife material.

767
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,119
(Zeng Qiang's Grave)
Divorce her.

768
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,839
Find another girl.

769
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,720
Have a child.

770
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,400
I can look after your kid

771
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,079
for a few years.

772
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,720
Remember.

773
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,559
You don't even care about your dad.

774
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,759
What do you care about?

775
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,039
Nothing can stop you.

776
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Success requires

777
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,319
step-by-step effort.

778
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
It's okay.

779
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,759
Everything will pass.

780
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,519
Things

781
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,960
will get better.

782
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,920
I failed Xiaofang.

783
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,720
Sorry.

784
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,519
She was my only sister.

785
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,559
No bride price. Fine.

786
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,640
But it's only been a year.

787
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,359
I hoped you'd give her

788
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,559
a better life.

789
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,960
Professor Zeng,

790
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:24,240
thank you for helping me,

791
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,359
and for all your encouragement.

792
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,519
Having someone

793
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,160
as exceptional as you by my side

794
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,880
motivated me to work harder.

795
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,000
But

796
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,400
right now,

797
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,640
I can't commit to anyone.

798
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:44,160
If I could walk in there,

799
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:44,960
burn away

800
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,240
all the bad memories,

801
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,319
and emerge extraordinary,

802
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,640
that'd be great.

803
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,319
You've had such a hard life.

804
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,400
Professor Zeng.

805
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:57,640
But luckily,

806
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,640
I can offer you comfort.

807
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:00,799
However,

808
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,720
although I truly like you,

809
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,559
I won't

810
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,200
dedicate my entire youth

811
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,279
to you.

812
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,440
Zeng Jie.

813
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,000
I've never been

814
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,440
deceived and betrayed

815
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,599
like this before.

816
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,720
I've never

817
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,839
hated someone this much.

818
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,039
That was my first time drinking.

819
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,400
I was drunk in minutes.

820
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,519
The room was full of

821
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,200
messy easels everywhere

822
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,559
and canvases filled with crooked lines.

823
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,839
Yet I watched those

824
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,799
clumsy brushstrokes

825
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,400
gradually

826
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,480
come alive.

827
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,456
Transforming into clouds.

828
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,799
Clouds colliding with wind.

829
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,680
Wind bringing down rain.

830
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,640
Rain swelling into floods.

831
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,880
Harmony blending light with dust.

832
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,000
Dust blinding my vision.

833
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,119
Vision blurred by arrogance.

834
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,159
Vision blurred by arrogance.

835
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,719
Vision blurred by arrogance.

836
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:00,128
Frost cracking open...

837
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:04,000
Heavens establishing new forms.

838
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,456
Forms coexisting in harmony.

839
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,376
Criminal Police, Caorong Branch.

840
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:15,840
I'm Bai Xiaoling's friend.

841
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,216
Is Bai Xiaoling okay?

842
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:18,624
Did Yang Zhenghui hurt her?

843
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,760
"Yang Zhenghui"...

844
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,480
There are 131 hotels, guesthouses,

845
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,320
and occasional accommodations
for tourists on Mount Qingcheng.

846
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,800
Exclude the ones

847
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,648
under 500 yuan per night...

848
00:35:31,648 --> 00:35:32,192
Action.

849
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,592

under 500 yuan per night,

853
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:40,546
without suites,

854
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:41,984
not wheelchair accessible...

855
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:44,467
Again.

He could stay in Caorong.

What's it called?

859
00:35:54,144 --> 00:35:55,904
Caorong.

860
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:57,662
Alright.

861
00:35:57,984 --> 00:35:59,520
I bought 10 Americanos.

862
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,624
The cheapest is 16 yuan.

863
00:36:03,988 --> 00:36:07,296
I couldn't even spare
16 yuan for myself before.

864
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:09,792
Sorry.

865
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,984
Tell Bai Xiaoling not to travel.

866
00:36:13,984 --> 00:36:14,784
She listens to you.

867
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,696
She listens to me?

868
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:20,352
If she ever listened to me,

869
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,168
she would've divorced before the crash.

870
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,192
If she listened to me,

871
00:36:24,992 --> 00:36:27,328
she'd never have married Zeng Jie.

No one else would listen...

877
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:40,960
Sorry.

878
00:36:41,056 --> 00:36:42,048
What was it again?

879
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:44,032
To stop this drama.

880
00:36:44,032 --> 00:36:45,952
I just want us...

881
00:36:46,944 --> 00:36:47,776
I just told him

882
00:36:47,776 --> 00:36:48,928
I knew...

883
00:36:50,112 --> 00:36:51,264
Nice spot.

884
00:36:51,264 --> 00:36:52,544
Let's take some photos.

885
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:56,832
Sorry.

886
00:36:58,368 --> 00:37:00,896
This is my only scarf.

887
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,376
