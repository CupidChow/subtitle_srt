=Episode 12=

3
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,000
Why didn't you

4
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,640
answer my call?

5
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,479
Zeng Jie,

6
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,639
what brings you here?

7
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,360
Let me know if you come.

8
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,439
You're so busy.

9
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,199
I'll go see you.

10
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,879
Cut the crap.

11
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,319
Are you avoiding me lately?

12
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,319
Why would I avoid you?

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,879
I-I've been sick.

14
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,800
I had a fever.

15
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
Touch it.

16
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,759
Still hot.

17
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,000
Where's the fever?

18
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,520
I-It broke out last night.

19
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,639
It went down this morning.

20
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,520
I forgot to charge my phone.

21
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm still feeling weak.

22
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,280
I'm going to take a rest.

23
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,919
The tea's still warm.

24
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,159
Where did you rest?

25
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,360
Don't pretend with me.

26
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,599
Just answer me.

27
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,360
Has Yang Zhenghui contacted you lately?

28
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,599
No.

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,479
Any messages?

30
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,400
Nothing either.

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,800
Well, really nothing.

32
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,080
What's this about?

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
I'm not lying.

34
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,199
Besides,

35
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,199
isn't it better if Yang Zhenghui

36
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,800
didn't contact me?

37
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,080
Right?

38
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,479
What's wrong?

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,000
You look pale.

40
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,120
I don't know.

41
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,039
Recently,

42
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,400
strange people keep popping up.

43
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Stop your act.

44
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,800
Why put on an act?

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,919
I'm not pretending.

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,599
I saw my sister the other day.

47
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,680
What nonsense is it?

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,879
I'm serious! Why would I lie?

49
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,120
Right here.

50
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,240
I was sitting here that day,

51
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,039
I saw my sister

52
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,879
standing right there,

53
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,439
wiping the table.

54
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,879
You’re seeing things.

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,680
How is that impossible?

56
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,240
She was smiling at me from there.

57
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,040
Were you drunk?

58
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,959
How could I have been drinking

59
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,160
so early in the morning?

60
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,279
You made this up on purpose?

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,319
No way.

62
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,360
When are you

63
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,079
when do you plan to rebuild it?

64
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,920
Soon.

65
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:47,800
Alright.

66
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,839
If funds fall short,

67
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,319
I'll help however I can.

68
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,160
But remember.

69
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,600
If anyone come find you,

70
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,240
you must tell me.

71
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,600
No problem.

72
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,680
I'll follow your lead completely.

73
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:30,862
It scared me.

74
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,959
Compared to 1990,

75
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,920
modern forensic methods

76
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,879
have greatly advanced.

77
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,439
New technologies keep emerging.

78
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,879
As forensic technology

79
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,439
continues to develop and update,

80
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,439
the principle of solving all homicides

81
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,639
is persistently enforced

82
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,160
by countless officers

83
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,639
(Big Hui Video)
through blood and sacrifice.

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,040
The law's net stretches wide,

85
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,600
but not neglected.

86
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,079
No matter where criminals flee,

87
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,600
justice will find them.

88
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,120
The Kang Woodchipper Murder Case

89
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,160
marked the first time in Kang history

90
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,000
that a murder

91
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,319
without a body was solved.

92
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,920
(Look carefully.)

93
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,160
Do you know her?

94
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Why did you come to me?

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,720
You know her,

96
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:28,639
right?

97
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,399
I don't know her.

98
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,079
Even if I do, so what?

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,600
(Zeng Jie,)

100
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,839
someone just came to my mind.

101
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,720
Who?

102
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,120
Liu Wei.

103
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,839
(They were just here to check)

104
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,600
how Lin Fang died.

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,480
(I will find every way)

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,319
(to bring you down,)

107
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,079
making you lose your job

108
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,399
and ruining your reputation.

109
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,560
(You'd end up back)

110
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,600
(to the broke life,)

111
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,480
(full of blemish flaws.)

112
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,680
(Remember.)

113
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,959
(The Tomb of Zeng Qiang)
(You don't care about your dad's life.)

114
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,839
(What else do you care about?)

115
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,199
Nothing can stop you.

116
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,720
Master Zeng,

117
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,160
800,000 in cash.

118
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,040
You should be able to prepare it soon.

119
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,079
I calculated

120
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,639
how much 800,000 in cash would be

121
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,439
before getting this case.

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,000
Now you have quite a bit of money.

123
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,160
What's your plan?

124
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,560
When I used to livestream,

125
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,439
a big supporter

126
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,560
sent me a lot of gifts.

127
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,040
It wasn't that much.

128
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,600
For a mere streamer

129
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,639
like me who's never seen

130
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,600
much of the world,

131
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
it was really shocking.

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,680
But before long,

133
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,600
he stopped spending.

134
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,480
He told me

135
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
he went broke after his startup failed.

136
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,319
He gave me one piece of advice.

137
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,800
He said if I could earn

138
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,959
a large amount of money,

139
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,040
if I don't make investments

140
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,160
or start businesses,

141
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,839
I could live comfortably.

142
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,920
I'd first splurge a bit.

143
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
Go on a trip,

144
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,480
first class,

145
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,680
five-star hotel kind of trip.

146
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,079
Then I'd think hard

147
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,959
about what to do.

148
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,920
But whatever I do,

149
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,480
I will completely say goodbye

150
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,560
to my past life

151
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,240
and start fresh.

152
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,360
A brand-new start.

153
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,160
So,

154
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,799
I want to thank you.

155
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,279
I really like you.

156
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,000
But I want a future even more.

157
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,240
You sell yourself

158
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,120
for money

159
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,600
and blackmail people.

160
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,279
Do you deserve a future?

161
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,840
Master Zeng,

162
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,240
mind your dignity.

163
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,879
Do you deserve dignity?

164
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,519
I don't.

165
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,000
Of course, I don't.

166
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm shameless now

167
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,879
just to have dignity in the future.

168
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,279
Master Zeng,

169
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,799
did you earn dignity

170
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,799
by marrying your wife?

171
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,679
Weren't you after her money?

172
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,519
Wasn't she scheming

173
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,000
to divorce you for money?

174
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,360
What do you have

175
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,879
to look down upon me?

176
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,399
Come on.

177
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,080
We're all the same.

178
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,360
To you, 800,000 in cash

179
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,519
isn't much.

180
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,120
Don't lose your dignity
over this amount.

181
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,279
After all,

182
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,639
we used to like each other.

183
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,399
Get lost.

184
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,759
Don't let me see you again.

185
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,840
Everyone I knew before today,

186
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,080
I don't wish to see them again.

187
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,240
(Take your wife on a trip.)

188
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,840
At least,

189
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,799
pretend to be a good husband.

190
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,039
I can't pretend anymore.

191
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,799
It's too tiring.

192
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm exhausted.

193
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,360
Why are you looking at me?

194
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,600
If you want a divorce, just do it.

195
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,600
Don't look at me.

196
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,279
Like I've said before,

197
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,960
even if you get divorced,

198
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,759
I won't marry you.

199
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,840
When I'm with you,

200
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,200
it's the most relaxing.

201
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,919
Because I won't expect from you

202
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,639
what I'd expect from a husband.

203
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
I also won't expect

204
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,600
what I'd expect from a boyfriend.

205
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,720
When a woman

206
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,080
has no demands,

207
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,840
it's easier for a man.

208
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,799
It's just not the right time

209
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,559
for me to divorce.

210
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,000
Can we talk about something else?

211
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,919
Do you think discussing

212
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,000
whether you should divorce

213
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,960
is appropriate?

214
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,120
I really want my life

215
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
to start anew.

216
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,559
Then I wish you success.

217
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,759
But

218
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,360
don't involve me.

219
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,000
My life has always been fine.

220
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,600
After breaking up with you,

221
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,480
it'll still be good.

222
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,200
Breaking up?

223
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,919
It's about time.

224
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,679
After these years being with you,

225
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,919
I've known you well.

226
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,679
You're just like my dad.

227
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,840
You only care about yourselves,

228
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,519
selfish and self-serving.

229
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,720
I've been tired of it.

230
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,240
But I kept enduring it.

231
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,960
Look at you now.

232
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,720
Out of ten meetings,

233
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,360
you complain all ten times

234
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,080
about your marriage and your life.

235
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,200
It's utterly dull.

236
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,919
You used to make me feel relaxed.

237
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,080
I also made you feel relaxed.

238
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,960
So we could keep going.

239
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,440
But now,

240
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,039
you don't ease my mind anymore.

241
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,360
So it's time to stop.

242
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,320
Take your wife on a trip.

243
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,720
Change your mood.

244
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,519
Come back and get a divorce if you want.

245
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,639
If you don't want that,

246
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,440
just find another girl.

247
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,159
Anyway,

248
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,960
I'll quit.

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,279
Break up just after a few words.

250
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,879
Is it that casual?

251
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,240
Isn't us being together

252
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,080
even more casual?

253
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,559
That's right.

254
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,039
Don't try to detain me.

255
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:40,759
If you do,

256
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,879
you are not charming.

257
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,879
Ms. Juan.

258
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:54,480
Ms. Juan.

259
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,759
So you just can't let go.

260
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,120
Everyone's been young.

261
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,720
Are you still young now?

262
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,840
First love

263
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,840
is always unforgettable.

264
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,840
What's so funny?

265
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,879
What first love?

266
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,279
It was just first simp.

267
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,480
Ms. Juan, listen.

268
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,840
I first met Bai Xiaoling

269
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,960
in college.

270
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,360
She captivated all of us

271
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,279
at that time.

272
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,320
We investigated

273
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,840
her family background

274
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,240
very soon.

275
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,919
She was rich and beautiful.

276
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,879
I knew

277
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,399
I was certainly not her match.

278
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,240
At that time, I saw

279
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,399
those boys hanging

280
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,519
around her dorm.

281
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,360
Compared to them,

282
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,240
I

283
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,559
had no money,

284
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,000
and was ugly.

285
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,840
There was definitely no chance.

286
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,399
At that time,

287
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,320
I set myself a goal.

288
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,360
I must become strong

289
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,559
and go to grad school.

290
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,879
After graduating,

291
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,799
I had to pass the bar exam

292
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,200
in the shortest time possible,

293
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,039
and become a law firm partner.

294
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,919
So

295
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,759
Bai Xiaoling

296
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,080
was the benefactor in your life.

297
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,279
She really was.

298
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,960
If it weren't for her,

299
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,600
I might have ended up like some

300
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,480
college classmates,

301
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,440
idling away,

302
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,279
doing nothing.

303
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,080
I don't know

304
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,039
which little law firm

305
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,519
I would be working at.

306
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,279
Listen.

307
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,240
In my college years,

308
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,000
I did work hard.

309
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,000
Every night, I stayed up late,

310
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,799
reading books,

311
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,240
reviewing files,

312
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,039
studying cases.

313
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,559
When hungry, I'd take some buns.

314
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,120
When tired,

315
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,519
I'd glance at Bai Xiaoling.

316
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,159
Just looking at her,

317
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,559
I was filled with strength.

318
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,159
She also read

319
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,159
in the college library?

320
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,240
Could she really be in the library?

321
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,360
I glanced at this.

322
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,000
A placebo for the mind?

323
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,159
What does the "Zheng"

324
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,480
next to it mean?

325
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,159
At that time,

326
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,919
I set a threshold for myself.

327
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,519
A girl

328
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,000
as outstanding as Bai Xiaoling

329
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,336
couldn't possibly be single.

330
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,559
Many guys were after her.

331
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,399
She might make a few poor choices.

332
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,240
But there's a high probability

333
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,639
that she wouldn't choose me,

334
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,360
right?

335
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,279
So,

336
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,960
I have to face this reality.

337
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,519
I told myself

338
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,559
to give Bai Xiaoling three chances.

339
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,000
What do you mean?

340
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,919
He allowed Bai Xiaoling

341
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,279
to have three relationships.

342
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,359
Is that so humble?

343
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:06,279
What do you know?

344
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,440
What if she has more?

345
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,000
Then he would

346
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,519
give Bai Xiaoling another chance.

347
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,200
Isn't that lacking self-respect?

348
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,440
He'd still give her more chances,

349
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,079
one after another.

350
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,599
How many boyfriends
did she have in total?

351
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,799
In the photo,

352
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,599
isn't there a record?

353
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,279
Mr. Ye,

354
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,680
true love.

355
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,240
Ten years later,

356
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,240
I became a partner at the law firm.

357
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,480
And she

358
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,680
married Zeng Jie.

359
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,880
You didn't stay single
thinking about her, did you?

360
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,079
No, no, no.

361
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,880
Thinking about her, sure.

362
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,039
But it has nothing to do

363
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,359
with whether I marry or not.

364
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,440
Even if she's divorced now,

365
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,079
I still couldn't be with her.

366
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,519
It's unrelated to her being

367
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,039
in a wheelchair now.

368
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,160
Bai Xiaoling

369
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,680
is just his spiritual support,

370
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,079
and his utopia.

371
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,960
When he was struggling before,

372
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,799
Bai Xiaoling's existence

373
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,119
was motivation and encouragement.

374
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
Now that his life is better,

375
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,720
Bai Xiaoling's presence
is just a regret.

376
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,200
To make up for regrets,

377
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,480
there are many ways.

378
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,759
You don't lack women now.

379
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,119
What you lack is Bai Xiaoling's attitude

380
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,559
towards you.

381
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,119
Even if she's now

382
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,039
disabled,

383
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,319
or even if

384
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,119
she doesn't admit

385
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,880
her choice back then was wrong.

386
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,680
We women,

387
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,480
when young,

388
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,799
want to find someone

389
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,000
who can protect us,

390
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,279
has money,

391
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,079
and spoils us like a hero.

392
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,920
After maturing,

393
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,000
we become compassionate,

394
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,680
overly nurturing.

395
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,599
Young girls are easily fooled.

396
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,319
Mature women are perceptive.

397
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,039
Just like men.

398
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,279
When most men are young,

399
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,519
they can't find

400
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,319
a girlfriend to share hardships with.

401
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,519
After becoming wealthy,

402
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,039
they all feel

403
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,279
like they are the savior.

404
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,920
Young boys are stupid,

405
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,960
while guys at your age

406
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,920
are bad.

407
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,279
I'm a good man.

408
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,119
I'm good.

409
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:12,440
Come on.

410
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,160
Cheers.

411
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,920
It's alright.

412
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,920
What about you?

413
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,519
Well, me?

414
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,880
Why do you want to help Bai Xiaoling?

415
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,640
You don't even like her.

416
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,039
You're into video production.

417
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,880
Why do this?

418
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,519
How much can you make?

419
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:29,960
Not much.

420
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,640
Barely enough to get by.

421
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,079
The income is unstable.

422
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,599
Busy investigating lately,

423
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,720
I haven't updated

424
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,720
and had no income.

425
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,000
Before,

426
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,440
I thought my ex-girlfriend

427
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,839
was killed by Zeng Jie.

428
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,160
It turned out

429
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,240
she was perfectly fine.

430
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,839
Later, as I kept digging,

431
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,000
I uncovered more and more

432
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,039
of Zeng Jie's secrets.

433
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,160
Let's say it's my professional habit.

434
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,000
Now,

435
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,559
I want to help Bai Xiaoling,

436
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,200
because I think she's unfortunate.

437
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,599
Even if she's in a wheelchair,

438
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,599
she's still richer.

439
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,039
How could you think

440
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,359
she's unfortunate?

441
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:01,839
Ms. Juan,

442
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,880
those are wise words.

443
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,960
I invited you here today

444
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,000
for this meal,

445
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,400
just to ask

446
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,319
why you are helping Bai Xiaoling.

447
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:14,960
I'm

448
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,119
actually someone

449
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,200
who enjoys gossip.

450
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,039
I've already paid the bill.

451
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,680
You can take your time drinking.

452
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm leaving now.

453
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,839
Thanks.

454
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,000
Is this expensive?

455
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,240
It doesn't taste bitter.

456
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,319
It's decent.

457
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,920
Bordeaux Grand Cru.

458
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,960
Nearly ten thousand per bottle.

459
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:39,880
That's crazy!

460
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,559
Oh, my god!

461
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,000
After talking with Ms. Juan,

462
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,400
why do I feel more uneasy?

463
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,880
Being called poor makes you uneasy, huh?

464
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,359
No,

465
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,720
Ms. Juan knows Zeng Jie better than us.

466
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:55,839
But all night,

467
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,240
she didn't mention Zeng Jie's

468
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,000
character at all.

469
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,799
Instead, she seemed to probe us.

470
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,680
Seeing it this way,

471
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,359
I'm more sure

472
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,480
he'd go after Bai Xiaoling.

473
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,319
Going on a mountain trip

474
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,119
with Xiaoling in a wheelchair,

475
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,279
it'd make sense

476
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,240
if something happened.

477
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:09,920
Yes.

478
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,000
Stop her.

479
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,039
We can't let her go.

480
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,240
Don't you think

481
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,759
she really wants to go herself?

482
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,160
I've explained to her

483
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,319
and told her everything

484
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,000
about Zeng Jie.

485
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,759
It was useless.

486
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,200
L-Let me think.

487
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,000
Do you have any ideas?

488
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,599
I...

489
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,799
I'll go with her.

490
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,480
Deal then.

491
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,720
I can't stick around the whole time.

492
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,839
You go with her.

493
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,000
Mount Qingcheng isn't far.

494
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,400
If there is anything, call me.

495
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,519
I'll be there in two hours.

496
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,359
Here's the thing.

497
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,799
This time,

498
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,000
all the expenses

499
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,200
will be covered by me.

500
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,519
The money in this card

501
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,519
(Bank card)
is absolutely enough.

502
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,440
Password 061011.

503
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,200
Well, how could I possibly

504
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,160
use your money?

505
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,079
What comes after 06?

506
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,920
1011.

507
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,880
Bai Xiaoling student ID number.

508
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,400
You do really like her.

509
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,119
Does it look good?

510
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Fantastic.

511
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,519
You wear this too?

512
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,720
Yeah, I haven't worn it for long.

513
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,799
Those clothes on the bed.

514
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,279
Which one should I wear?

515
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,359
Anything looks great.

516
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,480
How about

517
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:38,640
we take them all.

518
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,000
It's only two days. No time to change.

519
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:42,680
Help me pick one.

520
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:46,799
How about this?

521
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,119
Sure.

522
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,240
Luggage's packed

523
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,359
in the living room.

524
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,400
Anything else you want to bring?

525
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,279
Satisfied with this room?

526
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,240
It's pretty good.

527
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,519
Thank you, honey.

528
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,400
Could you

529
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:37,960
help me

530
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,319
open the red suitcase?

531
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,200
Okay.

532
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,559
Open the zipper on the left panel.

533
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,480
Give me that fruit knife, please.

534
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,440
This knife is so cool.

535
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,240
My husband

536
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,720
bought it when he went abroad.

537
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,920
It's very handy.

538
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,440
He loves cleanliness.

539
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,240
Thank you.

540
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,000
Honey.

541
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,079
When we drove in just now,

542
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,319
there were locals

543
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,880
selling kiwis from a cart.

544
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,559
Don't you like eating them?

545
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,559
You want some, right?

546
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll go buy some.

547
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,079
Sure.

548
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
You still keep this?

549
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:23,960
I also keep

550
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,680
the clothes you left at my place.

551
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,119
Let me make it clear.

552
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,200
There's no way we'll get back together.

553
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:32,960
Don't worry.

554
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,160
I'm here

555
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,799
just to ask you something.

556
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,640
Then I'll leave.

557
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,319
I absolutely won't bother you again.

558
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,559
You'd better do.

559
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,759
Changing my number is a hassle.

560
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:42,759
I won't.

561
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,759
I will never contact you again.

562
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,599
Go ahead.

563
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,240
Last year, you left me

564
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,200
for Professor Zeng,

565
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,000
right?

566
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,160
What Professor Zeng?

567
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,359
Who is Professor Zeng?

568
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,440
Last year, you made

569
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,960
a ceramic dish at Light Strokes.

570
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,480
Didn't Professor Zeng teach you?

571
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,319
I once took

572
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,599
a trial class at Light Strokes.

573
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,839
I wanted to learn ceramics.

574
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:12,839
How would I know

575
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,680
the teacher's name?

576
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,279
He also taught you
what blemish flaws are.

577
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,000
Yes.

578
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,200
I asked at Light Strokes.

579
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,000
Nobody mentioned blemish flaws.

580
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,359
Only Professor Zeng

581
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,680
would care about blemish flaws.

582
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
No other teachers.

583
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,359
Only Professor Zeng
would care about them.

584
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,440
He is also

585
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,279
a perfectionist.

586
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,759
He often mentions

587
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,759
pursuing perfection

588
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,359
and striving for near perfection.

589
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,400
Wei.

590
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,039
I really don't blame you for anything.

591
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,559
I just want to get to the truth.

592
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,839
I never mind

593
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,559
that you lied to me before.

594
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,799
Yang Zhenghui, clarify what you mean.

595
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,200
What did I lie about?

596
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,559
Did you truly never lie to me,

597
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,039
Tang Wei?

598
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,200
I've been Liu Wei for years.

599
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,640
Before I met you,

600
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:06,519
I was Liu Wei.

601
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,880
This isn't lying to you.

602
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,400
I don't know

603
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,680
why you keep holding onto me?

604
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,039
But Yang Zhenghui,

605
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,519
I don't even know

606
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,279
Zeng Jie

607
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,599
or what he does.

608
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,359
How do you know his name is Zeng Jie?

609
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,000
You just said it yourself.

610
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,960
I've been calling him Professor Zeng.

611
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:24,599
I didn't say

612
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,960
the name Zeng Jie on purpose.

613
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,559
I meant to save you

614
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,559
some face.

615
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,200
But you insisted on bringing it up.

616
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:40,839
Alright.

617
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,240
I know Zeng Jie.

618
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,880
Not only do I know him,
but I've been with him.

619
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,319
But Yang Zhenghui,

620
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,000
when I was with you,

621
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,160
I didn't cheat on you.

622
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,240
We were just

623
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,039
casually together.

624
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,039
We also met casually.

625
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,559
We never planned to make it last.

626
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,720
After I met Zeng Jie,

627
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,599
I thought he was great.

628
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,759
He's the type I like.

629
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,440
Plus, he's rich

630
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,160
and talented,

631
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,359
making me admire him.

632
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,599
I just like him.

633
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,839
So I broke up with you.

634
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,519
Yang Zhenghui,

635
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,440
I only got together with him

636
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,680
after we formally broke up.

637
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,000
Yes.

638
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,680
You sent me a message

639
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:18,440
very formally.

640
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,440
Wasn't that formal?

641
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:20,960
And then?

642
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,119
What "and then"?

643
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,119
You and Zeng Jie.

644
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,279
We broke up.

645
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,200
He's married.

646
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,720
Didn't he cling to you?

647
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,079
As a married man,

648
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,839
how dare he cling to me?

649
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,440
Then why did you move,

650
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,359
disappear,

651
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,279
and change number?

652
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,079
Because I felt

653
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,720
that my life

654
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,359
in the past was a complete mess.

655
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,640
What was I even doing?

656
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,200
What kind

657
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,559
of people have I met?

658
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:50,480
Yang Zhenghui.

659
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,440
Actually, you are fine.

660
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,319
I mean it.

661
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,039
It's just

662
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:56,640
that you had nothing.

663
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,160
There was no future for us.

664
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,799
I want to start fresh,

665
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,319
forget everything in the past,

666
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,319
and cut all ties.

667
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,720
I don't want

668
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,599
to associate myself

669
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,880
with my terrible past anymore.

670
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
C-Can you understand me?

671
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:36,039
Take a call.

672
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:36,839
Wait a moment.

673
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:42,160
Hello?

674
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,640
Hello, Big Hui. Are you busy?

675
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,960
I want to tell you something.

676
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,160
Go ahead.

677
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,160
I...

678
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,079
I'm free to talk.

679
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:50,839
Free.

680
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,559
Actually, I wanted

681
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,759
to tell you long time ago,

682
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,680
but I didn't know how to start.

683
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,319
It's not a good thing.

684
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,000
To be precise,

685
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,039
it's a shame of mine.

686
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,640
But I didn't expect

687
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,079
it involves you.

688
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:07,680
Involves me?

689
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:08,720
Yes.

690
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:09,640
I've wanted

691
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,160
to tell you this for a long time.

692
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:13,759
I know Liu Wei,

693
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,799
and Liu Wei knows my husband too.

694
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,640
There was something between them.

695
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,720
Years ago,

696
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,680
my husband and I

697
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,319
started having communication issues.

698
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,440
I began considering divorce.

699
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,400
My family is financially

700
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,319
better off than his.

701
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,359
So if we divorce,

702
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,920
I will suffer a significant loss.

703
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,839
I know my husband

704
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,000
often has contacts

705
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,559
with other women.

706
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,240
But I can't find

707
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,519
enough evidence.

708
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,400
So...

709
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,799
Is this person reliable?

710
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:52,759
The boss said she is.

711
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,680
As your demands,

712
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,599
she is beautiful

713
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,400
and pretty classy.

714
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,599
She just wants the money

715
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,440
and she's willing

716
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,279
to do anything.

717
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,519
(What does she do?)

718
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,279
(Influencer.)

719
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,320
(Live streamer.)

720
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,319
(Not many followers.)

721
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:14,599
(These young girls)

722
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,559
(don't care much.)

723
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,160
Don't worry.

724
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,079
Once get paid,

725
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,559
I will do a good job.

726
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:21,759
(Through someone else,)

727
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,119
(I met Liu Wei)

728
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:24,680
(and paid her a deposit.)

729
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,319
(I told her)

730
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
(how to better approach Zeng Jie)

731
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,960
(and attract him.)

732
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,079
What are blemish flaws?

733
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,440
What are blemish flaws?

734
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,279
You can think of it

735
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,000
as an insignificant imperfection.

736
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,960
Just like

737
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,480
Pinhead-sized holes

738
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,480
in orange peels.

739
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,960
(Ordinary people wouldn't care at all.)

740
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,519
(But for some people,)

741
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,160
it's unbearable.

742
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,799
I've always wanted to smash it.

743
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Thanks to you.

744
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,359
It seems

745
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,079
she really understands you.

746
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,519
What did you say?

747
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,839
She was very successful.

748
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,680
She got it done

749
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,079
in a very short time.

750
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,119
Take it.

751
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,440
We're even now. You can go.

752
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,279
But

753
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,279
I didn't

754
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,440
expect her to be so cunning.

755
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,359
She took my money

756
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,559
and then

757
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,079
extorted my husband as well.

758
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,480
Zeng Jie,

759
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,640
I think there is something

760
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,240
you should take a look at.

761
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,519
It belongs

762
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:21,599
to you and Liu Wei.

763
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:22,880
I also have something

764
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,000
which belongs to you

765
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,519
and Liu Wei.

766
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:30,279
It's only right to get paid
for helping others.

767
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,559
Why can't I take it?

768
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
I've done what you

769
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,799
wanted me to do.

770
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,960
Yet you just don't let me go.

771
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,279
What do you really want?

772
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,119
If you don't let me go,

773
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,240
I'll fight you to the end.

774
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,359
Let's see who gives up first,

775
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,640
you or me.

776
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,960
It's not like I don't know

777
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,240
why you want a divorce.

778
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,359
Is it something to be proud of if told?

779
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,400
As long as you let me go,

780
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,160
I'll disappear immediately.

781
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:56,799
I was going to disappear anyway.

782
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,079
You will never

783
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,440
see me again.

784
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,359
I don't want to see

785
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,559
the current me either.

786
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:10,640
I was so angry I almost went crazy.

787
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,839
But fortunately,

788
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,839
I calmed down quickly.

789
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,640
Because I realized

790
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,480
that every step I've taken

791
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,000
to get here

792
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,240
was my own choice.

793
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,799
I have a family and an appearance

794
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,680
others envy.

795
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,119
Yet, my marriage is a failure.

796
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,839
I guess that's

797
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,720
what you call give and take.

798
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,039
Because of the Liu Wei incident,

799
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:39,359
I had a direct talk with Zeng Jie.

800
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:40,920
We made an agreement

801
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,039
that from now on,

802
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,079
no one should talk about this

803
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,480
disgusting and sordid experience.

804
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,160
We would try

805
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,000
to see

806
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,440
if our marriage can continue.

807
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,400
You know everything

808
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,400
after that.

809
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,440
After Zeng Jie Studio caught fire,

810
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,599
and I was disabled in a car accident,

811
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,440
it only took a year

812
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
for me to become who I am now.

813
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,519
Big Hui,

814
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,280
what you and Zhang Ye told me

815
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
about Zeng Jie,

816
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,920
I've actually known

817
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,079
some of them long ago.

818
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,000
I didn't want to admit because I wanted

819
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,760
to give myself

820
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,880
a bit of dignity.

821
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,679
This time, Zeng Jie brought me out.

822
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,079
Actually, we just want

823
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,239
to try and see

824
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,199
whether we can continue being together.

825
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,559
I do appreciate

826
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,079
you and Zhang Ye worrying about me.

827
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,079
I thought for long

828
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,400
before making this call to you.

829
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,559
Because I feel I shouldn't hide

830
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,840
things about Liu Wei from you.

831
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,800
Even though you already broke up,

832
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,920
it's actually a good thing you broke up.

833
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,519
A girl like her

834
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,119
doesn't deserve you.

835
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:58,760
There's no

836
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,159
such thing as deserving or not.

837
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,519
Who am I, anyway?

838
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,199
After all,

839
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,119
Wei is a beautiful girl.

840
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,159
I'm just

841
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,079
an ordinary

842
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,599
person, nothing special.

843
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,480
I really want to have you as a friend,

844
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,480
but the things I've done,

845
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,679
those dirty things,

846
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,199
make me feel

847
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,360
unworthy of your friendship.

848
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,880
Don't say that.

849
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:26,840
Don't say that.

850
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,840
Bai Xiaoling, you are actually

851
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,039
quite kind.

852
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:30,639
I mean it.

853
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:32,920
You can blame me

854
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,239
for the Liu Wei issue.

855
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,039
You can even scold me.

856
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,159
No.

857
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:45,920
I won't blame you.

858
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:46,960
Likewise,

859
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,440
I won't blame Wei either.

860
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,840
What right do I have anyway?

861
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,719
Bai Xiaoling,

862
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:15,880
if you still

863
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,760
consider me a friend,

864
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
listen to me this time.

865
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,239
Big Hui,

866
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:22,760
I know

867
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,480
you don't want me to travel.

868
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,079
But I'm already here.

869
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,760
W-What are you saying?

870
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,280
Where are you now?

871
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,719
W-Which hotel?

872
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,519

873
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,119

874
00:37:02,368 --> 00:37:03,136
It's okay.

875
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,824
It's okay, just a small issue.

876
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,952
Zeng Jie and I, after all,
came from poor families.

is a bit better, pretty average...
