2
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:32,853
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,799
(What?)

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,159
(Exactly.)

5
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,640
Ms. Juan

6
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,040
is actually my client.

7
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,560
What kind of client?

8
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,560
I helped her with her divorce

9
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,680
and won her a fortune.

10
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,400
Then,

11
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,560
she hired my law firm

12
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,280
as her permanent legal advisor.

13
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,079
We've had a pleasant collaboration
all these years.

14
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,879
This Zeng Jie

15
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,159
is such a creep.

16
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,239
In this case,

17
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,959
Ms. Juan isn't young, is she?

18
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:04,840
Right.

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,000
Wealthy,

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,079
competent,

21
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,240
and mature.

22
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,280
Zeng Jie?

23
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,479
An artist.

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,879
He used to

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,400
accompany you to Japan.

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,080
This painting is his work.

27
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,319
If it were poorly painted,

28
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,560
I wouldn't display it.

29
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,560
Zeng Jie's quite talented now.

30
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,800
He's become a master.

31
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,439
My judgment of people

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:34,960
is nice.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,560
Of course.

34
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,159
You are really discerning.

35
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,360
So,

36
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,639
Zeng Jie

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,520
also received your favors?

38
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,680
Just say it.

39
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,599
Why do you ask?

40
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,439
Who is he?

41
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,840
Him?

42
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,439
It's

43
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,479
a long story.

44
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,759
I'll explain.

45
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,400
I'll explain.

46
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,599
Ms. Juan,

47
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,960
I'll tell you everything,

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
including the reason

49
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,560
we're here to you.

50
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,879
So,

51
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,360
you think Zeng Jie is a murderer?

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,680
To be precise,

53
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,280
this speculation is logically sound.

54
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,599
You're not a cop.

55
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,520
Zeng Jie

56
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,960
has nothing to do with you.

57
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,199
Why do you investigate him?

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,400
This somewhat

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,759
relates to my profession.

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,039
Moreover, if Zeng Jie

61
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,840
commits crimes,

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,479
I want

63
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
to stop him.

64
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,240
What's it to you?

65
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,000
Well,

66
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,439
just for fun.

67
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:31,960
Ms. Juan.

68
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,840
Besides,

69
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,840
this truly doesn't concern you.

70
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,000
What's it to you?

71
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,120
He's my brother.

72
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,599
His girlfriend

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,479
was snatched by Zeng Jie.

74
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,240
You two have

75
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,080
different surnames.

76
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,000
Cousin?

77
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:47,800
Buddy.

78
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,879
Buddy.

79
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,120
Zeng Jie

80
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,719
is really something now.

81
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,520
Ms. Juan,

82
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,560
if you don't mind,

83
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,800
tell us something.

84
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,599
Right.

85
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,800
Zeng Jie has deceived

86
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,719
many girls.

87
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,520
Let me tell you.

88
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,840
Many of his female students...

89
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,199
In relationships,

90
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,800
it's either mutual consent

91
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,800
or transactional exchange.

92
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,719
Who's actually that naive?

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,360
True.

94
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,759
What you mention

95
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,639
does exist,

96
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,719
but we should

97
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,159
uphold some justice.

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,000
Naive.

99
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,319
I can tell

100
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,800
you're not married yet.

101
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,560
Got a girlfriend?

102
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,439
No.

103
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,480
Own a house?

104
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:21,920
No.

105
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,800
Can't afford it.

106
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,439
Then why bother?

107
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,160
Stay out of other's business.

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,000
Instead of wasting time,

109
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,439
you should focus on your own life.

110
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,920
You're not a child.

111
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,879
Be a man.

112
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,360
I shall never become

113
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,240
a man.

114
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,279
I will remain a child,

115
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,439
and then suddenly an old man.

116
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,759
Quoted from Kafka?

117
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,279
Interesting.

118
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes, yes.

119
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,079
He's cultured.

120
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,000
Alright.

121
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:47,759
Tell me.

122
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,680
What do you both want to know?

123
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,759
(I remember)

124
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,199
(it was many years ago.)

125
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,199
(I had a friend)

126
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,240
(who owned a shop.)

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,319
(I remember)

128
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,800
(the walls of his shop)

129
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,079
(were covered
with Impressionist paintings.)

130
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,759
(All reproductions,)

131
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,399
(but I adored them.)

132
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,199
(That's where)

133
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,399
(I first met Zeng Jie.)

134
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,839
(I remember)

135
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,160
(when I saw him)

136
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,360
(in his studio,)

137
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,000
(sitting before an easel,)

138
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,879
(covered in paint,)

139
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,839
(I found him so charming.)

140
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,959
(I could tell)

141
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,439
(he is a wolf in sheep's clothing.)

142
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,600
(But)

143
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,279
(his poverty)

144
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,279
(was driving him mad.)

145
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,680
This must be

146
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,360
the tragedy of life.

147
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,000
You waste time

148
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,240
during your prime years.

149
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,480
When you get older,

150
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,160
you'd regret it.

151
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,800
So Ms. Juan,

152
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,720
you first met Zeng Jie

153
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:51,879
at that time?

154
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,920
Zeng Jie was talented

155
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
and stubborn.

156
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,959
At that time,

157
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,639
I wanted to help him.

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,839
Women are often

159
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,079
sympathetic to the weak.

160
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,800
Help him with what?

161
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,160
Help him

162
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,959
to survive in this world.

163
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,959
This path is too slow.

164
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,439
I want to take a fast path,

165
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,480
but I don't have one.

166
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,920
Are you seeking a path

167
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,439
or shortcuts?

168
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,160
Not the same?

169
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,680
Of course not.

170
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,600
Paths

171
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,360
are for everyone.

172
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,800
But shortcuts

173
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,399
are only for the few.

174
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,720
Who are you?

175
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,040
He was still
in postgraduate studies then,

176
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,079
also his toughest period,

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,279
struggling to make ends meet.

178
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
And his dad's hospitalized
for treatment.

179
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,720
Back then,

180
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,319
I thought he had a hard life.

181
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,639
Guess

182
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,439
I pitied for him.

183
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,680
Ms. Juan.

184
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,399
He's so fortunate

185
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,800
that he could be

186
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,439
noticed by you.

187
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:07,920
Ms. Juan,

188
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
Zeng Jie had a girlfriend.

189
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,240
You knew it, right?

190
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,120
The one who became his wife.

191
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,199
Her name was...

192
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:13,839
Bai Xiaoling?

193
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,560
I think so.

194
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,160
After meeting her,

195
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,199
Zeng Jie even came to me

196
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,519
for dating advice.

197
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,959
No, that wasn't Bai Xiaoling.

198
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,399
That was the one

199
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,120
before her,

200
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,519
named Lin Fang,

201
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,600
a rural girl.

202
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,720
Well,

203
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,959
I haven't heard of it.

204
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,120
Nor do I care.

205
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,959
Why did you give

206
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,759
Zeng Jie dating advice?

207
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,519
Zeng Jie is an ambitious man.

208
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,519
I just helped him realize his potential.

209
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,720
I knew

210
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,839
he'll make his name.

211
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:44,839
And

212
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,319
I admire him greatly.

213
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,480
So I gave him a boost.

214
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,480
Ever invested in stocks?

215
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,639
If you pick

216
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,160
a potential stock,

217
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,639
and watch its value soar,

218
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,199
it'd make you feel so good.

219
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,879
What do you think?

220
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,920
Just as I thought before.

221
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,959
Zeng Jie can achieve
his status and influence,

222
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,560
must've overcome many hardships.

223
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,759
The road to success has been so arduous,

224
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,680
would he dare commit murder?

225
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,160
That's why he'd

226
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,600
fight to death to defend them.

227
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,279
Makes sense.

228
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,040
But Ms. Juan doesn't know

229
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,160
about Lin Fang.

230
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,120
Lin Fang wasn't threatening Ms. Juan,

231
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,680
but Bai Xiaoling.

232
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,160
Then who is Bai Xiaoling threatening?

233
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,680
Zeng Jie doesn't live off women now.

234
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,560
Bai Xiaoling

235
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,639
is threatening Zeng Jie.

236
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
So you believe

237
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,360
Zeng Jie would hurt Bai Xiaoling?

238
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,759
You just analyzed

239
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,639
all that earlier.

240
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,360
No, I mean,

241
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,960
you believe it now, right?

242
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,519
Yes.

243
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,320
If you tried to convince Bai Xiaoling

244
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,919
not to travel,

245
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,840
would she listen?

246
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,720
What?

247
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Listen to me?

248
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,799
If she ever listened to me,

249
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,440
she would've divorced before the crash.

250
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
If she listened to me,

251
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:51,759
she wouldn't

252
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,120
marry that creep Zeng Jie.

253
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,159
Calm down.

254
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,919
I know it is not easy for you,

255
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,440
as a backup.

256
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,279
What did you say?

257
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,799
Do I even qualify as a backup?

258
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,919
I'm just her old classmate

259
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,799
and not even a close one.

260
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,519
Right.

261
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,360
Right.

262
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,440
Seems it's not an option.

263
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,000
Let's investigate then.

264
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,279
What?

265
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,080
Find out where

266
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,159
her travel destination is.

267
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,639
We could take precautions.

268
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,559
Coming!

269
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,679
Who is it?

270
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,200
What do you want?

271
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,519
Did you extort money

272
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,200
from Zeng Jie?

273
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,399
A huge sum?

274
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,200
What?

275
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,120
If there's no proof,

276
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,000
don't slander me.

277
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,919
Or, I'll sue you.

278
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,559
Tell me

279
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,399
how Lin Fang died.

280
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,559
Don't mention Fang.

281
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,000
Or I'll act tough.

282
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,399
Come on.

283
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,039
Show me

284
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,960
how you act tough.

285
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:02,639
Come on.

286
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:10,799
What's wrong?

287
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,720
Don't touch me!

288
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,679
Don't you dare

289
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,480
extort me.

290
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,759
Let go!

291
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,279
Listen,

292
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,519
Fang had heart disease.

293
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,360
So do I.

294
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,519
Cut the act!

295
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,399
I just came

296
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,480
to ask some questions.

297
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,279
Stop pretending.

298
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,200
Cut the act.

299
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,159
Don't you want

300
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,799
to know how Fang died?

301
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,519
That's exactly it.

302
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,840
Listen,

303
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,720
leave now, or I'll kill myself.

304
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,120
Don't be shameless here.

305
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,200
If he's shameless,

306
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,159
he won't care about me.

307
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
He cares about you,

308
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,000
but he still could be shameless.

309
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,159
Just get to the point.

310
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,039
He'll be here soon.

311
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,720
You just want me to find out

312
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,159
how Lin Fang really died.

313
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,759
I'm certain

314
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,159
that Lin Shan must know something,

315
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,679
and it's related to Zeng Jie.

316
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,879
You

317
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,320
went to Lin Shan,

318
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,200
and Lin Shan would've informed Zeng Jie.

319
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,120
You

320
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,679
had investigated Zeng Jie.

321
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,759
That would make Zeng Jie nervous.

322
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,399
Lin Shan seized the chance

323
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,080
to extort a large sum from Zeng Jie.

324
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,039
That makes perfect sense.

325
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:08,879
But I think it

326
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,720
isn't that simple.

327
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,080
If Lin Shan truly knew

328
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,000
Zeng Jie's secrets,

329
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,600
he could've

330
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,440
extorted him

331
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,600
before I stepped in.

332
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,720
Makes sense.

333
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,919
Then this money

334
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,000
wasn't from Zeng Jie?

335
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,960
I can only rely on you now.

336
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,039
Remember,

337
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,279
don't let him suspect you.

338
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,120
Don't worry.

339
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,519
I've been watching

340
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,639
many crime-solving videos.

341
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,559
I can handle it.

342
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Enough. Stop eating.

343
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:34,960
Just leave.

344
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,559
He'll arrive.

345
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,519
Fine.

346
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,480
I've watched

347
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,240
all your videos

348
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,960
for many times.

349
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
You haven't updated for long.

350
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,519
The Logic Behind Truth.

351
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,879
We all seek the truth.

352
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,879
Truth always hides deep.

353
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,360
Only by clarifying the logic

354
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,080
can we obtain

355
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,759
the truth.

356
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,480
(The Logic Behind Truth)
During Zeng Jie's postgraduate studies,

357
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,320
his father fell ill
and was hospitalized.

358
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,799
The tuition,

359
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,799
living expenses,

360
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,919
and medical bills

361
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,840
crushed Zeng Jie

362
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,080
under financial pressure.

363
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,159
But

364
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,200
he had no way

365
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,039
to earn big money quickly.

366
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,600
When he was at a loss,

367
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,080
someone

368
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,440
showed up.

369
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,840
That's Ms. Juan,

370
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,039
around the same age

371
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,399
as Zeng Jie's dad.

372
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,440
She's wealthy

373
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,200
and decided

374
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
to offer Zeng Jie financial support.

375
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,840
Hey, can you stop shaking?

376
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,200
Try holding this.

377
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,159
It's so heavy!

378
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
I'll pay for a tripod, okay?

379
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,200
Tripods lack human touch.

380
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
You're not even filming.

381
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,320
Just say it.

382
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,080
Action.

383
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,919
To obtain Ms. Juan's money,

384
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,440
I bet you can tell

385
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,519
what the condition was.

386
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,399
We youngsters often

387
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,159
say things like,

388
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,000
"Madam,

389
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,480
I want to live off you."

390
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,559
as dark humor,

391
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,320
but not everyone

392
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,879
would make up their mind

393
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,039
to actually do so.

394
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,440
For three years,

395
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,919
Zeng Jie became Ms. Juan's

396
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,399
an on-call companion.

397
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,480
Beyond Caorong,

398
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,440
they traveled to

399
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,960
many destinations,

400
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,600
including two Japan trips

401
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,320
where he received medical treatment

402
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,559
for his weak stomach.

403
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,600
Before, he can only eat

404
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,440
plain foods.

405
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,840
But Ms. Juan found someone

406
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,440
to completely cure him.

407
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,120
With Ms. Juan's financial support,

408
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,159
Zeng Jie spent

409
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,000
many times his previous costs

410
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,720
to create a set of artworks

411
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,200
for the competition

412
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,399
and won first prize.

413
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,200
This marked
the beginning of Master Zeng's

414
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,759
road to fame.

415
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,039
But at this moment,

416
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,080
Ms. Juan was losing her interest

417
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,919
in Zeng Jie,

418
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,799
so they ended this relationship

419
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,200
with a significant age gap.

420
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,559
Zeng Jie knew very well

421
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,720
that he and Ms. Juan
won't end up together.

422
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,799
That's why he

423
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,840
maintained his relationship

424
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,960
with Lin Fang.

425
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,480
And they had even held
a rural wedding banquet,

426
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
making breakup difficult.

427
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,519
Ms. Juan didn't know about Lin Fang.

428
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,600
Even if she had,

429
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,759
she probably wouldn't have cared.

430
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,480
After they

431
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,320
ended their relationship,

432
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,120
Zeng Jie realized his life

433
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,720
wasn't as comfortable

434
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:15,879
as he'd imagined.

435
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,320
His modest salary

436
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,720
and the income from ceramics

437
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,200
couldn't provide him

438
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,639
with a luxurious lifestyle.

439
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,919
He refused poverty,

440
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,279
wanting to climb higher.

441
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,039
He knew conventional methods

442
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,639
wouldn't bring him quick success.

443
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,799
At this critical moment,

444
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,919
he met you,

445
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,440
Bai Xiaoling.

446
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,440
Young, beautiful,

447
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,720
from a wealthy family.

448
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:37,879
He knew marrying you

449
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
would quickly

450
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,519
transform his life.

451
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,759
His eloquence and status

452
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,960
had already captivated you.

453
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,200
All he needed

454
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,759
was to eliminate a small obstacle

455
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,399
in his path.

456
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,879
This obstacle

457
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,399
was his girlfriend,

458
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,039
Lin Fang.

459
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,200
To be with you...

460
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
To be with me,

461
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,879
Zeng Jie killed Lin Fang,

462
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,200
then he bribed

463
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,279
her only relative,

464
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,480
her brother Lin Shan.

465
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,159
After removing this obstacle,

466
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,320
he successfully married me,

467
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,919
while I knew nothing about this.

468
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,720
After marriage, Zeng Jie has been

469
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,399
having flings

470
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,600
with many women,

471
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,879
including your ex-girlfriend

472
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,960
Wei, right?

473
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,200
To avoid being caught,

474
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,320
he even tried to kill Wei.

475
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,399
But I know Wei survived.

476
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,440
Then he failed.

477
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,919
After failing to kill Wei,

478
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,240
Zeng Jie turned to kill me.

479
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,559
First he staged a fire

480
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,320
to burn me alive.

481
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,360
A month later,

482
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,879
he tampered with my car break

483
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,720
to cause a crash.

484
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
Now he's trying

485
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,559
to kill me again.

486
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,519
Big Hui,

487
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,080
is that what you want

488
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,120
to say?

489
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,440
Yes.

490
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,000
Zhang Ye, you're a lawyer.

491
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:38,960
You know the law.

492
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,159
Since when have you two

493
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,399
teamed up together?

494
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,919
I...

495
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,679
We're just...

496
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,720
We were scared

497
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,039
this theory might be true.

498
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,919
We didn't want you in danger.

499
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,559
Right.

500
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,320
Last year,

501
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,879
you came to Mr. Ye

502
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,759
and mentioned wanting a divorce.

503
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,759
Back then,

504
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,720
you must've discovered

505
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,080
some secrets of Zeng Jie.

506
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,600
Even if you don't trust me

507
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,080
or Mr. Ye,

508
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,679
at least trust

509
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,039
your own instincts.

510
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,919
Exactly!

511
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,039
What?

512
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,799
Yes, I wanted a divorce last year.

513
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:05,960
But that was last year.

514
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,679
Our relationship was strained then.

515
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,240
But now is different.

516
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,559
He's improved a bit,

517
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,799
so I changed my mind.

518
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,039
I want to give us another chance.

519
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,519
I chose to live

520
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,759
my current life

521
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,879
and I'm content with it.

522
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,879
Reading at the café every day

523
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,240
is delightful.

524
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,840
If we lose all love,

525
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,120
I'll reconsider divorce.

526
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,120
But not now.

527
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,120
This isn't about

528
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,200
divorce.

529
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,480
Zeng Jie poses

530
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,679
a serious danger to you.

531
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,360
He's dangerous.

532
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,799
You all think he's a murderer,

533
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,759
then go to police!

534
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,720
Big Hui,

535
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,000
you make crime-solving videos,

536
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,080
should know

537
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
how to report crimes.

538
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,600
Zhang Ye, you're a pro.

539
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,240
Right.

540
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,759
If Zeng Jie wanted me dead,

541
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:42,720
he had many chances.

542
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,720
Any day at home,

543
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,879
suffocate me with a pillow.

544
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,279
I couldn't even fight back.

545
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,039
According to both of you,

546
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,000
I've been teetering

547
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,240
on danger's edge for a year.

548
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,200
What a miraculous survivor I am!

549
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,919
I told you

550
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
she wouldn't listen.

551
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,480
She never listens

552
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,159
to me,

553
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,279
always maintaining

554
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,039
so

555
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,680
graceful.

556
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,079
If I ever divorce,

557
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,480
I'd still go to you.

558
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,960
Come on.

559
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,559
Just heed our advice this once.

560
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,559
What advice?

561
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,759
Divorce immediately?

562
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,559
Zeng Jie takes you

563
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,359
for a trip.

564
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,160
Don't go.

565
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:18,960
Why?

566
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,559
Will he kill me during the trip?

567
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,799
If you don't go,

568
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,880
you could avoid

569
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,880
the risk.

570
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,640
He wants to mend our relationship.

571
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,599
I can

572
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,839
tell this.

573
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,440
There's no reason

574
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,640
making him mend your relationship.

575
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,559
Bai Xiaoling, you don't get it.

576
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,039
People like Zeng Jie and me,

577
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:35,839
we all come from

578
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,200
humble origins.

579
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,319
My situation was better,

580
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,759
an average family.

581
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,720
But,

582
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,119
(Clue)
we're both from humble origins.

583
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,359
Humble origins?

584
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,200
This isn't the point.

585
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,400
Poor families

586
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
don't always produce

587
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,880
greedy people.

588
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,640
Understand?

589
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,240
But Zeng Jie...

590
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,079
He chose this path himself.

591
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:54,880
Get it?

592
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,000
Is that so?

593
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:56,839
Buddy,

594
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,480
through my legal consultations,

595
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,119
people like Zeng Jie

596
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,240
lack moral character.

597
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,799
Stop blaming family backgrounds.

598
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,160
Stop interrupting!

599
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,640
Does she listen to you?

600
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,200
She's truly stubborn.

601
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,480
Enough.

602
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,519
I'll take a stroll.

603
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,599
When are you and Zeng Jie going?

604
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,160
Probably in two days.

605
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,799
The weekend?

606
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,160
Maybe.

607
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:34,519
Where to?

608
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll tell you when I get back.

609
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,440
Let's meet at the café.

610
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,880
Find out where

611
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,680
she's going to.

612
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,799
Are you going too?

613
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,079
I'm not always right,

614
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,720
but I believe

615
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,599
in my deduction.

616
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,119
The point is how,

617
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,920
buddy.

618
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,119
You can do it, Mr. Ye.

619
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,440
Miss, these two new programs

620
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,400
are perfect for you.

621
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,079
We're running a promotion right now.

622
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,200
Take 20 sessions.

623
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:12,880
Okay.

624
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,599
One moment.

625
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,039
Ms. Bai.

626
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,759
I've reserved

627
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,799
this product for you.

628
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,880
(Caorong Bank, Financial Product)
Just come to handle

629
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,759
the paperwork then.

630
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,039
If it's inconvenient,

631
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,319
I can come to your place

632
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,119
to handle it.

633
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,759
Just tell me.

634
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,960
No need. I'm not that busy.

635
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,519
I'll come by myself.

636
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,680
I'm going to travel

637
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,119
with my husband in two days.

638
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,720
Alright.

639
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,000
I've paid you.

640
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,079
Don't worry.

641
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,000
Those flowers

642
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,200
will arrive next week.

643
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,359
I can deliver

644
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,440
them to you.

645
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:40,680
No need.

646
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,559
I'll pick them up myself.

647
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,480
(Male, Female)

648
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,279
Rest assured.

649
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,599
You paid me,

650
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,000
and I'll do the job well.

651
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,319
Advice for you.

652
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,640
Go to Yaotang Hotel

653
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
around 3 PM tomorrow.

654
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,440
In the center of the lobby
there's a ceramic artwork.

655
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,319
My husband will meet

656
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,599
someone there around 3 PM.

657
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,079
After the meeting, he'll pass by there.

658
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,480
You'd smash that artwork

659
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,839
right in front of him.

660
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:27,640
Why?

661
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,160
Because that piece

662
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,599
is my husband's work.

663
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,200
Are you sure

664
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,079
breaking

665
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,039
his work

666
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,079
would make him happy?

667
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:37,759
Yes.

668
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,559
Because that piece has flaws.

669
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,160
He's always wanted to destroy it.

670
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:42,839
Then you can

671
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,880
get to know him.

672
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,039
What if he demands compensation?

673
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,440
He won't.

674
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,759
If it really happens,

675
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,960
I'll cover the costs.

676
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,880
What kind of flaw does it have?

677
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,319
A blemish flaw.

678
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,000
What is it?

679
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,279
You can think of it

680
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,039
as an insignificant imperfection

681
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,440
that most people wouldn't even notice.

682
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,079
But for certain individuals,

683
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,920
it's unbearable.

684
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,599
What?

685
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,880
My girlfriend asked me to come along
for a livestreaming

686
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,039
with a big streamer.

687
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,319
Gain followers?

688
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,039
Think everyone

689
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,119
is a fool?

690
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,240
She's just being used

691
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,319
as a pawn.

692
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
What a bestie!

693
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,400
I thought you wouldn't come.

694
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,160
I told you to meet at the café.

695
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,400
I thought you meant

696
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,279
after the trip.

697
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,519
You assumed

698
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,440
I couldn't return?

699
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,960
No! Not at all.

700
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,759
The weather's getting chilly now.

701
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,440
Where are you heading?

702
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,319
What do you want?

703
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,480
I'm Just asking.

704
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,680
Do you want

705
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,000
to monitor news

706
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,559
of my destinations?

707
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
If anything happens,

708
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,839
you'll know it right away.

709
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,440
I'm Just asking, really.

710
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:20,599
Are you just asking,

711
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,640
or do you want answers?

712
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,720
I want to know.

713
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
Mount Qingcheng.

714
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,680
By the way,

715
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,359
I didn't

716
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,680
tell you something yesterday.

717
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:39,400
Go ahead.

718
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,039
Things about Ms. Juan

719
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,920
are true.

720
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,240
Mr. Ye and I asked her about it.

721
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,519
She knows you.

722
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,119
When Zeng Jie first met you,

723
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,000
he mentioned you.

724
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,400
Aren't you curious

725
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,240
why Zeng Jie told her?

726
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:55,920
Actually,

727
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,079
when Zeng Jie

728
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,000
started pursuing you,

729
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:58,920
many tactics

730
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,799
were coached by Ms. Juan.

731
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,319
Otherwise, Zeng Jie

732
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:02,839
couldn't

733
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,119
win over you so easily.

734
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,920
Hello, who is this?

735
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,599
Recognize my voice?

736
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,759
Ms. Juan?

737
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,039
How did you

738
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,160
get my number?

739
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,559
It's not that hard.

740
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,440
You're quite the celebrity.

741
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,799
If I couldn't get your number,

742
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,880
it'd mean you're failing.

743
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,960
Why contact me?

744
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,519
Nothing special.

745
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,000
I saw

746
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,440
the Sunrise painting today.

747
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,160
Made me think of you.

748
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,759
Bad timing now,

749
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,319
Master Zeng?

750
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,160
Suitable

751
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,720
for your refined taste.

752
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,319
All these years,

753
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,359
I watch you on TV often.

754
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,279
Impressive.

755
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,839
All thanks to you,

756
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,200
Ms. Juan.

757
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:12,599
How's your wife?

758
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,440
Pretty well.

759
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,319
Three floors here.

760
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,960
Except workspace,

761
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:29,880
I guess upstairs

762
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,480
has rooms for lodging?

763
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:32,799
Yes.

764
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,880
Stay here frequently?

765
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,079
When work piles up.

766
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,960
Got a marital issue?

767
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,519
If not,

768
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,119
you'd always go home
even with busy schedules.

769
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,640
Have some water.

770
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:54,920
This is what you offer?

771
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,640
I'll make some tea.

772
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,440
Ms. Juan,

773
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,279
why contact me suddenly?

774
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,119
Nothing.

775
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,240
Just thought of you suddenly.

776
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,799
Why so tense?

777
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,279
I won't bite.

778
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,400
Married several years already?

779
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,640
No kids yet?

780
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,359
No.

781
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,759
Divorcing?

782
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,519
Not yet.

783
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,799
Really?

784
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,279
My wife had an accident last year,

785
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,759
and is still wheelchair-bound.

786
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,680
Bai Xiaoling,

787
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,359
right?

788
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,240
Yes.

789
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,319
You remember her?

790
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,000
Of course, I do.

791
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:42,599
Back then,

792
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,759
I gave you some advice to get her.

793
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,039
Yes.

794
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,960
Her disability

795
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,200
keeps you from divorcing?

796
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,319
Makes sense.

797
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,759
You are

798
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,960
a celebrity now.

799
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,160
Dumping a disabled wife

800
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,880
would ruin your reputation.

801
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,200
Her family's resources

802
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,400
must've helped your career a lot, right?

803
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,400
A bit.

804
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,519
Don't be shy.

805
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,680
I mentioned this to you years ago.

806
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,160
After marrying her,

807
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,799
your biggest goal

808
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,799
should be to keep improving yourself.

809
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:25,680
Right.

810
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,680
It's all thanks to

811
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,000
your advice back then.

812
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,640
She's not a fool.

813
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,480
Has she discovered

814
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:38,480
your real purpose?

815
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,000
Yes.

816
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,400
But

817
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,440
she can do nothing about it.

818
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,559
You caused her the accident?

819
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,279
No,

820
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
I swear.

821
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,119
However,

822
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,599
this accident

823
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,680
did help me a lot.

824
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,359
After that incident,

825
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,720
she didn't press me

826
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,640
about returning the money so hard.

827
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,599
Zeng Jie,

828
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,400
you are quite fortunate.

829
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,000
Alright.

830
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,519
I'm leaving.

831
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,480
If nothing

832
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,160
unexpected happens,

833
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,160
I won't

834
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,400
come looking for you.

835
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:33,759
Ms. Juan,

836
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,000
any advice for me?

837
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,839
Regarding your wife?

838
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,319
The current her

839
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,079
is different now.

840
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,119
Get a divorce soon.

841
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,240
It's more beneficial.

842
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,799
It doesn't matter to pay some price.

843
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,519
Anyway, you've gained what you needed.

844
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:57,720
Well...

845
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,480
Get a divorce soon.

846
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,400
Set your terms higher,

847
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,519
she'll agree.

848
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,000
She wants a divorce anyway.

849
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,039
But

850
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,319
I...

851
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,359
You don't want to pay the price?

852
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,119
Do you want

853
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,720
to create another car crash

854
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,599
or some accident

855
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,599
to kill her?

856
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,640
Zeng Jie,

857
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,680
I advise you to stop this intention.

858
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,079
You've worked so hard

859
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,680
to reach where you are

860
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,759
and establish yourself in the city.

861
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,240
Everything you have now

862
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,759
was hard-earned.

863
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,400
Treasure it all.

864
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,480
Don't

865
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,279
ruin everything.

866
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,240
Ms. Juan,

867
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,279
if

868
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,119
you were Bai Xiaoling,

869
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,319
what would you do?

870
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,440
I'd devise a perfect plan.

871
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,720
Find a way

872
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,279
to kill you.

873
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,759
Take back everything that's mine.

874
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,599
I'd keep all of my property.

875
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:08,799
Or,

876
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,119
I'd do everything

877
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,319
to destroy what you have now.

878
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,519
Make you lose your job,

879
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:16,720
and ruin your reputation,

880
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,519
forcing you back

881
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:19,799
into your penniless life

882
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,440
filled with blemish flaws.

883
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,039
Otherwise,

884
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,720
how could I swallow

885
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,960
this injustice?

886
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,119
But don't worry.

887
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,920
Your wife

888
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,519
isn't me.

889
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,839
An ordinary woman

890
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,960
wouldn't act like I do.

891
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,480
(Know why I help you?)

892
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,799
(Think you're handsome?)

893
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,119
(There are many people)

894
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,680
more handsome

895
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,279
and younger than you.

896
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,400
I chose you

897
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,400
because you're like me.

898
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,799
You're willing to fight and sacrifice.

899
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,720
Just

900
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,799
like me.

901
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,640
I've told you about
my previous marriage, right?

902
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,319
The reason I'm telling you this

903
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,119
is to make you understand

904
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,519
choosing to marry Bai Xiaoling

905
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,279
is wise.

906
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
But remember one thing.

907
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,000
You must be absolutely clear about

908
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,720
what matters to you most

909
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:04,160
in this marriage.

910
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,119
Ms. Juan,

911
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,240
actually,

912
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:14,799
I want...

913
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,160
You want success.

914
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,200
So,

915
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,480
you need to be exceptionally rational.

916
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,759
If you want Bai Xiaoling to trust you,

917
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,559
you can't rely on submission.

918
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,440
You have to surpass her.

919
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,640
The stronger, more decisive,

920
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,920
and cleaner you are,

921
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,759
the more she'd admire you.

922
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,960
Really? Is that so?

923
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,799
Those who admire you

924
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,160
become people around you.

925
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,440
That's their misfortune.

926
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,200
Most successes

927
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,279
are meant for those

928
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,279
who can't share them with you

929
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,759
to admire from afar.

930
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,440
Find Liu Wei?

931
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,279
Wei and Zeng Jie

932
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,400
must be connected.

933
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,039
Find her,

934
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,559
and we'll get something.

935
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,680
How?

936
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,960
We've tried before.

937
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,079
Think about it.

938
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,559
What clues can we find

939
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:33,720
when we saw Liu Wei?

940
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:37,279
Incredible.

941
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,039
I knew

942
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:38,880
you'd start with it.

943
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,079
Right.

944
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:42,200
She was holding a milk tea cup.

945
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:44,920
(A gray cup,)

946
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,839
(with a blue lid)

947
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
(and an orange straw.)

948
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,359
The cup was quite full.

949
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,559
She just took a few sips.

950
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,240
Within 200 meters,

951
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,920
there must be a milk tea shop.

952
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,720
I'll go ask the staff about her

953
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,079
and maybe we can find her.

954
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,759
Just

955
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,200
an easy-peasy.

956
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,000
Big Hui,

957
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,720
you do have some skills.

958
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,400
You've decided to travel with him?

959
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,319
Different scenery, different mood.

960
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,240
I want to settle things with him.

961
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,680
The mistake I made

962
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,079
should be resolved by me.

963
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,839
You are just like me,

964
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,359
never accept defeat.

965
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,279
I accept it.

966
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,839
But I have

967
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,599
to reclaim my ground.

968
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,039
You just don't accept defeat.

969
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:14,378
♪Within the dim lights
there is a bright view♪

970
00:34:14,464 --> 00:34:15,968
Show me how you act tough.

971
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:19,584
Show me how you act tough.

972
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:25,654
Hey! What are you doing?
Don't try to extort me.

973
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:29,184
Don't mention Fang. Or I'll act tough.

974
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:32,192
Show me how you act tough.

975
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:38,176
Hey! I didn't touch you!
Don't try to extort me.

976
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:44,704
His eloquence and status had already
captivated you. All he needed was...

977
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
Sorry, one more.

978
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:50,592
No, come on.

979
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,008
This line again.

980
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:59,680
Humble origins meant
humble family backgrounds.

981
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:02,432
It refers to those without...

982
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:09,280
According to you,
Lin Fang's death relates to Zeng Jie.

983
00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:10,584
Lin Shan knew the truth.

984
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:13,280
All these years,
Zeng Jie's been paying Lin Shan,

985
00:35:13,504 --> 00:35:16,544
because Lin Shan
hid the truth for Zeng Jie.

986
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:17,600
Truth.

987
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:19,120
Cut!

988
00:35:19,572 --> 00:35:22,336
Alright, three, two, one, action!

989
00:35:23,136 --> 00:35:26,176
Ms. Juan, you've stayed young.

990
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,600
I start from here?

991
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,168
- Young...
- Start from here?

992
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:32,704
Yeah, exactly.

993
00:35:33,952 --> 00:35:36,224
I thought you'd go home first.

994
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,320
What's the line?

995
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:43,200
Well, what's the line?

996
00:35:44,704 --> 00:35:50,176
Do you want to create another car crash
or some accident to kill her?

997
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:54,694
♪So hypnotize before we pull the fight♪

998
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:59,744
I'd devise a perfect plan.
Find a way to kill you.

999
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:05,024
I've invited many friends
to hang out tonight.

1000
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,360
Including some girls

1001
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:10,720
studying acting and dancing.

1002
00:36:12,352 --> 00:36:13,632
What's wrong?

1003
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:15,804
I know.

1004
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:19,168
Since you told me last time,
I've been paying attention.

1005
00:36:20,372 --> 00:36:21,696
Cut!

1006
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:22,563
Cut.
