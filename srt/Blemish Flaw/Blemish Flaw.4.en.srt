=Episode 4=

3
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,799
I'm a policeman, not a criminal.

4
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,519
Do I look like a criminal?

5
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,439
(Stop)

6
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,519
- Where are you going?
- To the coffee shop ahead.

7
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
I can get there myself.

8
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,000
- I'll walk you there.
- No need.

9
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,719
I go there every day.

10
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,680
I can go there on my own.

11
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,039
It's a short walk.

12
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,280
I feel obligated

13
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,319
to walk you there as an officer.

14
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,120
Is this

15
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,599
congenital or...

16
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,560
- An accident.
- Getting treatment?

17
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,479
It's just for comfort.

18
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,680
I've come to terms with it.

19
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,159
Positive mindset.

20
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,719
That's all I have left.

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Officer.

22
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,319
I'm almost there.

23
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,879
I can get there myself.

24
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:37,960
Alright.

25
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,639
Take care of yourself.

26
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,039
He's quite skilled,
with both hands at a time.

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,639
Impressive.

28
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,319
It looks pretty good.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,719
So skilled.

30
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,520
He's also doing it.

31
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,400
He seems

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,120
more skilled.

33
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,360
I'm not sure.

34
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,800
Let's taste the coffee.

35
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,120
Alright then.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,719
It's so tasty.

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,000
I agree.

38
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,840
His coffee tastes better.

39
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,479
Hidden talent.

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,439
Two to one.

41
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,319
Not bad.

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,199
How about this?

43
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,960
Miss.

44
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,439
You ordered a pour-over.

45
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,719
I bet you know coffee.

46
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,719
Please evaluate these two cups.

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,319
Pick the one you prefer.

48
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,599
Three to one. Total defeat.
Three to one.

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,759
Just as I expected.

50
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,120
No way.

51
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,599
I told you this one is better.

52
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,719
I prefer this cup.

53
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,599
Try again.

54
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,040
They're similar.

55
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,839
Not at all.

56
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,480
Miss.

57
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,879
My treat.

58
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,079
Are you the owner?

59
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,279
He's my friend.

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
Are you the barista?

61
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,839
No, I learned

62
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,079
coffee-making with him.

63
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,079
I learned it

64
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:27,879
purely out of

65
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,000
personal interest.

66
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,120
That's why

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,240
I'm slightly better

68
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,720
than the baristas.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,160
Your coffee has a clean aroma.

70
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,240
Your brewing technique

71
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,560
seemed simple.

72
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,360
All those fancy tricks

73
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,000
are just for show.

74
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,759
The key lies in speed

75
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,040
and temperature.

76
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm much faster than average,

77
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,920
resulting in purer flavor.

78
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,160
Anything else?

79
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,920
What are you reading?

80
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,000
"Dune".

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,959
Science fiction.

82
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,319
A friend of mine

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,360
runs an escape room

84
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,720
with a sci-fi theme.

85
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,519
They're organizing trial sessions.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,560
Why not

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,439
(Big Hui)
try it with me?

88
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,680
Sorry, I can't.

89
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,800
What's the problem?

90
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,199
We'll bond through the game.

91
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,279
I really can't.

92
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,240
What about camping?
Let's have pour-over coffee

93
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,639
in the wild.

94
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,879
It will be different.

95
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Sorry, I also can't.

96
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,360
You're really reluctant, huh?

97
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,439
Camping doesn't require

98
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,560
much thinking.

99
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,480
Anyone with hands and feet can do it.

100
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,519
Big Hui, right?

101
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,639
Your coffee is great.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,959
But I have to go now.

103
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,120
I hope

104
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,160
I'll get to

105
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,399
try your brew again.

106
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,319
Sorry,

107
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,199
I-I didn't notice.

108
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,079
Don't apologize.

109
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,319
I'm glad

110
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,079
you didn't notice I'm disabled.

111
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,040
I had felt

112
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,399
normal for a few minutes.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,480
Don't bother. I got this.

114
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,319
Why didn't you tell me?

115
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,959
How do I know you hit on her?

116
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,759
Nobody has

117
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,800
hit on me for a while.

118
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:12,879
Thanks.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,959
N-No problem.

120
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,639
Today,

121
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,040
I visited Dad.

122
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,240
Is he okay?

123
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,160
No, he's in a terrible mood.

124
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,160
Last year, I told you

125
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,279
my parents wanted

126
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,240
some money back.

127
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
You said after New Year's Day.

128
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,199
But

129
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,680
it's almost October.

130
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,040
Do they know about the fire accident
at my studio last year?

131
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,199
Of course.

132
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,360
So they know

133
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,800
how much the rebuilding costs

134
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,800
and how many pieces I lost.

135
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,959
That's why

136
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,879
I haven't pressed you for ten months.

137
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,759
This is

138
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,199
a tough time.

139
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,560
- We need...
- Right now,

140
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,079
you're a master who's come back

141
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,160
with much greater influence.

142
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,399
Yeah,

143
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,560
but turning my influence into wealth

144
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,000
still takes time.

145
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,800
Fine.

146
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,759
I'll wait.

147
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,439
I'll hurry up.

148
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,120
Not coming home again?

149
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,279
Yeah.

150
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,240
I need to work overtime at the studio.

151
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,199
You know I have so many

152
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,160
undelivered works.

153
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:41,879
Yeah, I know.

154
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,399
You've worked hard.

155
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,680
I'll go upstairs myself.

156
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,240
Don't block the path

157
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,560
with your car.

158
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,399
Alright.

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,720
Go home

160
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,000
and get some rest.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,680
All I do is rest.

162
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,720
You're the one who needs rest.

163
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,560
I'm okay.

164
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,000
Don't stay up late.

165
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,560
If anything comes up,

166
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,920
call me.

167
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,039
Come on.

168
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,200
What?

169
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,519
I got designated drivers for both of us.

170
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:41,121
(Designated driver)

171
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,919
Nice.

172
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,960
So tell me,

173
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,240
any updates lately?

174
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,279
I toast you.

175
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,480
Big Hui, I told you

176
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,720
that I need something solid

177
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,399
to go on.

178
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,120
Without any evidence,

179
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:56,759
I really...

180
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,480
I toast to your police badge.

181
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,559
I didn't investigate you.

182
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,879
I just happened to learn that

183
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,080
your badge number

184
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,559
was reactivated twice.

185
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,320
(Li Shen)

186
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,960
Mom.

187
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,519
(Not the police academy!)

188
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,759
Dad told you

189
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,120
to work on academics or research.

190
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,399
Why the police academy?

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,039
Your scores were better.

192
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,960
But you joined the force!

193
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,440
I have to

194
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,879
reactivate Dad's badge number.

195
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,799
I don't want it

196
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,159
to remain archived forever.

197
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
Listen to me, okay?

198
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,960
Our family

199
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,399
doesn't need a third officer.

200
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,360
Study something else.

201
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,320
It'll put Mom's mind at ease.

202
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,360
(My dad drank with my brother.)

203
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,960
I never drank with them.

204
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,120
Li De.

205
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,879
I respect you.

206
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,080
I respect your whole family.

207
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,799
That's enough.

208
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,799
I don't

209
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,840
want to start crying.

210
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,200
Come on.

211
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,320
Tell me

212
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,840
your news.

213
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,279
I met this girl

214
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,799
a few days ago.

215
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,799
Well, not exactly.

216
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,799
But we did meet.
I don't have her WeChat.

217
00:10:59,399 --> 00:10:59,879
Wait.

218
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,600
What?

219
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,559
Listen.

220
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,200
This girl

221
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,399
is not exactly normal.

222
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:04,960
Good.

223
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,000
Just like you.

224
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,799
Come on.

225
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,080
She's...

226
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,279
Did you tell her

227
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,120
that you're

228
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,639
looking for your ex-girlfriend?

229
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,200
We didn't talk that much.

230
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
I haven't gotten
her contact information.

231
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,519
I'm looking for

232
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,480
my ex-girlfriend?

233
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,240
It's an investigation.

234
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,879
Nothing about feelings.

235
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:22,960
You could say

236
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,600
i-it's an occupational habit.

237
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,279
Since she's as abnormal as you,

238
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,960
she should

239
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,039
understand you.

240
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,519
She might even help
look for your ex-girlfriend.

241
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,120
No.

242
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,919
Investigate.

243
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,759
Yeah.

244
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,360
Enough.

245
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,440
Whatever you say.

246
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,600
You'll meet her

247
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,759
once I get to know her.

248
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,799
Seriously though,

249
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,559
how's your investigation going?

250
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,240
I met Zeng Jie the other day.

251
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,279
And?

252
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,960
I returned empty-handed.

253
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,039
He's clean?

254
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,679
Absolutely clean,

255
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,200
which is exactly the problem.

256
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,200
You see,

257
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,240
logically speaking,

258
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,519
having no problems
is a problem in itself.

259
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,360
Big Hui,

260
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,279
this isn't deduction anymore.

261
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,840
It's conjecture and delusion.

262
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,279
Assumptions lead to

263
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,039
problems.

264
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,639
Got it?

265
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,440
I haven't mentioned

266
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,960
the problems.

267
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,840
You said he's clean.

268
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,600
If

269
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,960
you find Liu Wei,

270
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,519
what will you tell her?

271
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,639
I don't know.

272
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,000
(We lock eyes.)

273
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,320
(She disappears.)

274
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,279
(I smile.)

275
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,080
There's nothing

276
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,639
I want to say.

277
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,320
I just want to know she's safe.

278
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,120
But I know she's not safe.

279
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,679
You know what scares me most?

280
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,320
Come here.

281
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,679
What's happening?

282
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,200
Get in here.

283
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,039
What's happening?

284
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,039
Let me go.

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Let me go.

286
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,440
What are you doing? Let me go.

287
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,840
(She was sold to)

288
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,240
(a remote mountain village)

289
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,039
(not marked on any map and couldn't be)

290
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,159
(pinned down on one)

291
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,559
(to marry a man who's too poor)

292
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,960
(to afford a wife for his entire life.)

293
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,320
(Imagine a college-educated)

294
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,440
(beauty streamer who ends up)

295
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,120
(as the wife)

296
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,679
(of a stranger in a village)

297
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,120
(that likely)

298
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,440
(has no internet access.)

299
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,440
No decent food.

300
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,200
No bed to sleep in.

301
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,080
With constant fear,
she is plotting to escape

302
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,120
every waking moment.

303
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,679
But every time,

304
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,159
the villagers catch her.

305
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,399
Then they

306
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,720
beat her up.

307
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,720
(It's been a year.
She's probably been forced)

308
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:37,559
(to bear)

309
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,720
(that old man's child.)

310
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:39,799
(No one will ever)

311
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,919
(call her Vivian again.)

312
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,480
(They only call her...)

313
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,759
No way.

314
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,679
How do you know?

315
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Such tragedies have happened before.

316
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,600
Nationwide surveillance coverage

317
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,919
is extremely high now.

318
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,000
If someone

319
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,519
is abducted in public,

320
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,360
we will notice immediately.

321
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,120
Let's hope so.

322
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,840
What do you mean by that?

323
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
I'm begging you.

324
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,879
Stop being

325
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,000
so paranoid.

326
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,919
By your made-up logic,

327
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,639
did Liu Wei

328
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,000
text you

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,360
a breakup notice

330
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,399
while she was

331
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,399
being kidnapped?

332
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,159
I told you.

333
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,919
That is my worst fear.

334
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
If it's true,

335
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,679
that's pure horror,

336
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,200
worse than death.

337
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,759
That scenario was made up.

338
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,080
But Wei is gone

339
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,159
for real.

340
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,960
You agree, right?

341
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,559
Yeah.

342
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,679
Would you like to hear

343
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,639
my theory?

344
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,960
Don't play the silent cool guy.

345
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,080
Just listen to me.

346
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,960
Point out anything that doesn't

347
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,000
make sense.

348
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,039
Go on.

349
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,360
Go on.

350
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,320
First,

351
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,200
I must admit

352
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,480
that my relationship

353
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,480
with her

354
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,080
was doomed from the start.

355
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,440
(We both knew it deep down.)

356
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,679
(Without a stable income,)

357
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,240
(we had big dreams)

358
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,360
(but no plans.)

359
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,159
(We were both)

360
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,279
(aimless.)

361
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,799
(Considering all that,)

362
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,480
(we were bound to break up.)

363
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,080
(With her qualities,)

364
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,720
(she could easily find)

365
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,279
(a wealthier guy than me.)

366
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,279
(But)

367
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,600
(she's cool.)

368
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:17,879
(She only cares)

369
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,320
(about her feelings.)

370
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,440
So when Zeng Jie appeared,

371
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,480
she was charmed.

372
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,000
She talked about

373
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,080
near-perfection

374
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,679
and blemish flaws.

375
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,559
Facing a young master painter

376
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
and a professor

377
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,039
with wealth,

378
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,360
even I would have

379
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,159
chosen him as a partner.

380
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,120
But

381
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,480
Wei wasn't being fickle

382
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,000
or gold-digging.

383
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,559
We simply didn't have

384
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,399
enough time

385
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,519
to deepen our bond.

386
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,679
At least, she showed me respect

387
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,519
and broke up with me

388
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,559
when she

389
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,039
started dating Zeng Jie.

390
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,600
You call this respect?

391
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:53,679
Yeah.

392
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,919
At least,

393
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,240
she didn't cheat on me.

394
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,840
Ridiculous.

395
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,399
Why is it ridiculous?

396
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,919
Let me speak up for Wei here.

397
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,080
She did well

398
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,840
by breaking up with me.

399
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,919
She respected

400
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,279
both Zeng Jie

401
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
and me.

402
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:14,799
But the problem is,

403
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,879
she gets attached too easily.

404
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:17,919
I told you

405
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,279
how we started dating.

406
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,639
Isn't it

407
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:21,960
completely absurd?

408
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,320
But we just

409
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,759
started dating.

410
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,360
Wei has always

411
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,360
been insecure since childhood.

412
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,840
So if some small gesture

413
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,759
makes her feel secure,

414
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,679
she genuinely develops feelings.

415
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:35,679
Zeng Jie

416
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,799
made her feel secure.

417
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,360
But she probably

418
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,120
didn't know

419
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,080
that Zeng Jie was married.

420
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,759
You're married?

421
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,679
How could you lie to me?

422
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,559
Very soon,

423
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,720
Wei discovered

424
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,399
that Zeng Jie was married.

425
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,480
She was devastated.

426
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,559
She probably fought

427
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,440
with Zeng Jie

428
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,360
and said something

429
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,000
threatening.

430
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,399
I'm going to destroy you.

431
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,120
I think

432
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,080
Wei was just venting

433
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,000
her anger.

434
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,799
She's seen

435
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,799
many liars before.

436
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,000
But Zeng Jie got scared.

437
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,079
Other bad guys may not be scared.

438
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,559
But he is different.

439
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,039
He must keep his status

440
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,279
and reputation.

441
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Besides, his wife comes
from a wealthy family.

442
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,720
His art career

443
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,400
is funded

444
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,559
by his wife's family.

445
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,480
He can't let

446
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,640
his affair with Wei

447
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,000
damage his reputation.

448
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,559
He might have offered Wei

449
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,400
some money.

450
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,519
Wei was furious

451
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,599
and turned him down.

452
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,240
He was even more scared.

453
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,240
What to do?

454
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,160
What to do?

455
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,000
Then

456
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,680
rage surged from his heart.

457
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,599
Evil intentions rose.

458
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,599
(He killed Wei.)

459
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,759
(Body disposal
is usually the trickiest.)

460
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,960
(But for Zeng Jie,)

461
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,720
(it was the easiest part.)

462
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,880
His kiln

463
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,400
could reduce everything to ashes.

464
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,640
(But he still feared leaving traces)

465
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,440
(because Wei)

466
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,440
(must have left)

467
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,599
(so many traces)

468
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,599
(in his studio.)

469
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,200
(So soon after,)

470
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,799
(he meticulously)

471
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,400
(planned a fire)

472
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,160
(that burned his studio)

473
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,319
(to the ground.)

474
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,359
I saw the report

475
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,279
on the fire.

476
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:52,720
Yeah.

477
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,240
Who'd believe that Master Zeng

478
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,039
would burn down his own studio

479
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,880
and destroy his own works?

480
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,519
Think about what I just said.

481
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,039
Doesn't it

482
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,720
make sense?

483
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,200
So you believe that is

484
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,079
the truth?

485
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,079
At least, it aligns with

486
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,240
the current outcome.

487
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,119
I know...

488
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,240
That's right.

489
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,480
I have no evidence.

490
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,680
Do you have any proof

491
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,519
that Wei

492
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,200
is safe and sound?

493
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,200
Big Hui.

494
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,160
Why didn't you notice

495
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,359
that Liu Wei was missing

496
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,880
and suddenly realize it

497
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,200
after a year of your breakup?

498
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,559
A year.

499
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,160
How am I supposed to find her now?

500
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,240
Tell me.

501
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,519
How can I help you now?

502
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,759
What's so funny?

503
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,359
You finally believe me.

504
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,279
I acknowledge your abilities.

505
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,119
The department meeting

506
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,920
dragged on forever today.

507
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,000
Did you eat?

508
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,519
Yeah.

509
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,920
Office meals.

510
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:12,799
You used to

511
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,880
hate Western food.

512
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,680
Why are you having these?

513
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:16,880
Just for a change.

514
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,200
It's convenient.

515
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,400
Don't trouble yourself cooking.

516
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,839
Should I

517
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,200
hire a cook

518
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:23,920
tomorrow?

519
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,039
I don't want

520
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,200
strangers in the house.

521
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:28,960
Are you leaving tonight?

522
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,440
There's still a lot to do.

523
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,400
Go back to work.

524
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,319
I know you're under pressure.

525
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,359
Alright.

526
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,200
I'll grab some clothes

527
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,480
and work overnight

528
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,720
at the studio.

529
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,480
I'll rush through those orders

530
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,160
and secure funds quickly

531
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,960
to ease your parents' minds.

532
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,160
Thanks, darling.

533
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:25,024
(Newspaper)

534
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:50,960
Go ahead.

535
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:52,559
My buddy says

536
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,880
you come almost every day

537
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:54,839
and sit here.

538
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,160
So I waited here.

539
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,759
When you crossed the street,

540
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:58,519
I started

541
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,920
brewing this pot.

542
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:00,920
It's perfect.

543
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:01,839
Right now,

544
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,279
the temperature's just right.

545
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Different coffee.

546
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,559
I know you've got taste.

547
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,240
It was Guatemalan-washed yesterday.

548
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,839
This is

549
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,960
Costa Rican Natural

550
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,799
blended with
Panama Esmeralda Green Label.

551
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,119
A taste of sunshine.

552
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,440
I made it for you.

553
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,200
You think I'm like sunshine?

554
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,759
Of course.

555
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,680
Absolutely.

556
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,640
Anything else to say

557
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
apart from that?

558
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,240
I meant to

559
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,200
apologize for

560
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,880
what I did.

561
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,200
But I thought about it.

562
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,240
You were right.

563
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,319
If I apologize,

564
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,359
it implies that

565
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,440
I find you abnormal.

566
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,200
So I just want to treat you

567
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,200
to coffee.

568
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,839
I'm having the coffee.

569
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:42,519
Please,

570
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,799
no more QR codes.

571
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,599
Rejecting others

572
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,160
isn't a pleasant thing.

573
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,119
Can we

574
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:47,960
just talk?

575
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,279
I don't want to talk,

576
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,559
but I did drink your coffee.

577
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,759
I won't be embarrassed.

578
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,079
If you want to stop,

579
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,079
just grab the water,

580
00:22:59,119 --> 00:22:59,880
and I'll leave.

581
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,519
Let's talk.

582
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,279
I can introduce you

583
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,880
to many traditional

584
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,240
Chinese medicine doctors.

585
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,599
Don't!

586
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,000
Let's change the subject.

587
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,920
You're quite wealthy.

588
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,880
I bet you've

589
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,839
seen many doctors.

590
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,200
How am I wealthy?

591
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,920
Diamond bracelet, diamond earrings,

592
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,759
leather bag,

593
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,839
and designer clothes.

594
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,400
I don't know your perfume,

595
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,960
but it must be high-end.

596
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,079
Your wheelchair is auto.

597
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,680
Sapphires on the watch yesterday.

598
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,599
Diamonds on this one.

599
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,680
So observant.

600
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,104
Occupational habit.

601
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,279
But you don't

602
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,119
look like a luxury store salesperson.

603
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,519
You must come from

604
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,160
a wealthy family. You enjoy reading.

605
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,079
This coffee shop

606
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,000
isn't far from the universities.

607
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:49,960
Your parents must be

608
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:50,720
educated.

609
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,559
For example,

610
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,640
a businessman father
and a teacher mother.

611
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,039
Can't I rely on my looks

612
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,319
to find a rich man?

613
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,839
That guy's preference must be

614
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:58,759
rather unusual.

615
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,839
Why did you hit on me?

616
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,640
I didn't.

617
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,559
Say that again.

618
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,880
I don't know either.

619
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:04,880
I...

620
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,359
I just feel

621
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,559
that you're different.

622
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,039
You have unusual preferences?

623
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,839
Not at all.

624
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:10,880
I didn't even notice

625
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,799
when I hit on you...

626
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,279
See?

627
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,279
You admit that you hit on me.

628
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,119
I really like

629
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,079
your personality.

630
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:18,920
So positive.

631
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm not positive.

632
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,480
Not one bit.

633
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,799
If you were sitting

634
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,480
in a wheelchair,

635
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,640
you wouldn't be positive either.

636
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:33,279
Will you ever recover?

637
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,559
Or are you recovering now?

638
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,759
By the way,

639
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,319
what do you do?

640
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,720
I'm unemployed.

641
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,319
Seeing a rich lady like you,

642
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,440
I thought

643
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,440
I'd give it a try.

644
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:56,640
Really?

645
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:57,680
Pretty much.

646
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,799
I'm a video content

647
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,839
creator.

648
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,160
What kind of videos?

649
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,799
Mystery case analysis.

650
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,599
Check it out

651
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,559
if you have time.

652
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,400
The Logic Behind Truth.

653
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,519
Want some dessert?

654
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:13,799
Blueberry mousse.

655
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,720
Charge it

656
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,680
to my card.

657
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,359
You don't have a card.

658
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,680
I'll get one

659
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,119
next time.

660
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:27,098
(Logic Behind the Truth)

661
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,680
We all seek the truth.

662
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,519
Truth always hides deep.

663
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:32,119
Only by clarifying the logic

664
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:32,799
can we obtain

665
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,640
the truth.

666
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,000
Hello,

667
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,240
welcome to

668
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,119
this episode of The Logic Behind Truth.

669
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,680
I'm your old friend.

670
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,519
Big Hui.

671
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,480
Today, we're going to talk about

672
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,160
the adhesive tape serial murder
in Country A.

673
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:47,000
Hello.

674
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,279
I need to work

675
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,559
overtime today.

676
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,680
Are you fine staying home alone?

677
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,480
I'm fine, don't worry.

678
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,799
Don't stay up too late.

679
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,160
Get some rest.

680
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,154
(Zeng Jie)

681
00:25:59,359 --> 00:25:59,960
Here,

682
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,000
I won't discuss

683
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,039
whether the death penalty
should be retained.

684
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,000
I just can't accept the fact

685
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,400
that scum like this

686
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
can't be restrained by morality,

687
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,680
and not even the law.

688
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,319
But I'm just

689
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,839
an ordinary video creator.

690
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,920
I can't make scum repent,

691
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,319
nor can I help

692
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:19,039
those who've been hurt.

693
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,440
All I can do

694
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,359
is to make quality content,

695
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,400
hoping for a more harmonious world.

696
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,119
Why are you silent?

697
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,839
I'm thinking what to order.

698
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,720
Troubled?

699
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:37,559
No.

700
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,160
Really?

701
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,799
Actually, I want to...

702
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,359
End this?

703
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:58,079
Last time we met,

704
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,039
you'd moved

705
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,640
to a modest but nice apartment.

706
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,759
Last month, you mentioned

707
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,759
running for

708
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,400
project team leader.

709
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,240
So, you made it.

710
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:10,759
Congratulations.

711
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Aren't you upset?

712
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,000
Watching you improve yourself,

713
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,279
how could I be upset?

714
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,559
It's just a pity.

715
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,839
You said it would take us two years

716
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,920
to try a new restaurant

717
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,599
each month.

718
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:30,519
There are

719
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,680
so many places left.

720
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,640
Professor Zeng,

721
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,240
thank you for helping me,

722
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,160
and for all your encouragement.

723
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,680
Having

724
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,759
a remarkable man like you

725
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,440
by my side

726
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,960
pushed me

727
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,200
to work harder.

728
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,599
But right now,

729
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,039
I can't commit to anyone.

730
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,839
(Money transfer)
And those

731
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,160
restaurants we missed,

732
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,039
I've sent you the list.

733
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,559
Today is September 27,

734
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,279
2019.

735
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,599
I'll always remember this day.

736
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,480
Okay.

737
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,680
Let's cherish today then.

738
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,839
I respect your choice,

739
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,559
though it pains me.

740
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,640
And

741
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,039
I'll miss you terribly.

742
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,279
Thank you for your respect.

743
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,279
This is goodbye.

744
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:33,880
Please don't.

745
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,240
Please don't.

746
00:28:56,371 --> 00:28:58,171
(Payment received)

747
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,039
Coincidental.

748
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,559
I'm here almost every day,

749
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,880
usually sitting here.

750
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,279
Not that coincidental.

751
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,079
Want a coffee?

752
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,440
Can I ask you something?

753
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:29,799
You mentioned

754
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,240
your friend's escape room.

755
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,240
Do I have to

756
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,240
go up and down there?

757
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,960
I should advise my friend

758
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,720
to develop

759
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,519
a low-physical

760
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,079
escape room concept.

761
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,279
Then can I go camping

762
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,440
without capable legs?

763
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,519
Absolutely.

764
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,119
I will

765
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,240
take care of you.

766
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,640
I haven't been outdoors in ages.

767
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,920
When do you want to go?

768
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,039
Today.

769
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:52,680
So soon?

770
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:53,759
Never mind.

771
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,000
Let's go.

772
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,440
We're off.

773
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,039
Wait.

774
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,839
Change into this first.

775
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,720
What's this about?

776
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,559
I'm a married woman

777
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,839
with distinctive features.

778
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,839
If my husband found out

779
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,440
I went camping with you,

780
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,559
it would be

781
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,640
awkward.

782
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,080
I don't mind explaining.

783
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,880
But people

784
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,839
prefer gossip

785
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,200
over explanations.

786
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,160
I thought

787
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,279
I had nothing to hide.

788
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,079
But now I suddenly

789
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,000
feel a bit guilty.

790
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,039
Well then,

791
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,160
let me satisfy

792
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,079
your curiosity as compensation.

793
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:28,720
I lost my legs

794
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,119
in a car accident last year.

795
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,480
Car accident?

796
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,680
I drove into

797
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,119
a roadside ditch.

798
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,319
I wasn't a bad driver.

799
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,839
The brakes

800
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,480
suddenly failed.

801
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,039
Are you sure...?

802
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,599
I'm sure I didn't press the gas.

803
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,680
Yeah.

804
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,079
And I'm sure

805
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,799
you're not some terrifying road menace.

806
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,119
(Little Fairy)
(It was one afternoon a year ago.)

807
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,759
Why are you going there alone?

808
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,119
Where is your husband?

809
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,240
He's busy.

810
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,960
I finally found a master to pray

811
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,960
for my father.

812
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:04,839
I can't wait

813
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,279
for my husband to finish work.

814
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,519
But he helped

815
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,400
service my car

816
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,480
yesterday.

817
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,759
When will you be back?

818
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,680
It's just over an hour's drive.

819
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,160
What's wrong?

820
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,720
Why isn't the brake responding?

821
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,240
No way.

822
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:23,920
Wrong pedal?

823
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,599
No way. It's not responding.

824
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,000
Can you slow down now?

825
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,799
What do I do?

826
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,079
I'm going too fast.

827
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:32,279
Stay calm.

828
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,880
I'll find someone to help.

829
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:35,279
How do I stop?

830
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:41,680
Theoretically,

831
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,240
I could still recover.

832
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,519
But only theoretically.

833
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,759
In reality,

834
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,440
I've accepted the fact that

835
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,920
I'll remain like this forever.

836
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,039
Don't pity me,

837
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,440
or feel awkward.

838
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,119
I admire your optimistic spirit...

839
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:57,960
Big Hui.

840
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Stop faking sincerity.

841
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,640
It's painfully fake.

842
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,359
I'll get changed first.

843
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:19,880
Try this.

844
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,319
Which agency are you from?

845
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,640
W-What agency?

846
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:30,759
You look

847
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,119
very attentive.

848
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,359
You even make coffee.

849
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,759
So I want to ask

850
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,759
your monthly rate.

851
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm sorry.

852
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,720
I'm her permanent hire.

853
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:44,839
So clueless.

854
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,920
Is camping so popular now?

855
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,599
This is a popular spot

856
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:53,640
for casual trips.

857
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,319
With some proper preparation,

858
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,000
we could go

859
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,839
somewhere wilder

860
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,200
and set up a tent.

861
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,200
I'll go around in my wheelchair?

862
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:00,880
No worries.

863
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,839
Most paths are

864
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,960
wheelchair accessible.

865
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:03,880
If not,

866
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,720
I'll carry you.

867
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,079
Don't bother.

868
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,400
I can't

869
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,680
do anything like this.

870
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,240
I hate burdening others.

871
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:11,440
Don't say that.

872
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,240
There's plenty

873
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,319
you can do.

874
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,440
Like what?

875
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,160
Ever watched live streams?

876
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,799
Wheelchair streamers

877
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,319
are new to the industry.

878
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,039
Disabled people?

879
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:21,960
No.

880
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,200
They just sit at computers

881
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,720
like they're in wheelchairs.

882
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,880
You want me to play the victim?

883
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,119
That's outdated.

884
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,359
Now everyone is

885
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,519
putting on a tough front.

886
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,720
Do you play games?

887
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,519
You're pretty.

888
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,240
Just don't mention

889
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,640
that you're married.

890
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,200
You'll get plenty of fans.

891
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,319
I'm bad at games.

892
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
It doesn't matter.

893
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:40,400
Practice

894
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,440
makes perfect.

895
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,839
Is your ex-girlfriend also a streamer?

896
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,680
Yeah.

897
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,039
She did livestreams

898
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,799
and made videos.

899
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,200
Is she good-looking?

900
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,079
Got any photos?

901
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,000
We dated briefly last year.

902
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,440
Then she dumped me.

903
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,320
So pretty. Why did she dump you?

904
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,280
You weren't good enough?

905
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,159
I don't deserve her.

906
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,119
She's young and beautiful,

907
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,199
ambitious and proud too.

908
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,199
An ordinary guy like me

909
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,239
is not good enough.

910
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,559
Still thinking about her?

911
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:23,960
Not at all.

912
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,480
But recently, I think

913
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,840
she's gone missing.

914
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,519
She blocked you?

915
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,719
That's normal.

916
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,320
But she has vanished.

917
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,840
No trace left anywhere.

918
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,199
It's like

919
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,519
she's been erased

920
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,400
from the world.

921
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:47,880
Big Hui.

922
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,519
You've broken up.

923
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,559
So, just let it go.

924
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:06,960
100,000 deposit.

925
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,159
You'll have remaining 200,000
after completion.

926
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,440
You're very pretty.

927
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,840
You're so pretty

928
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,199
with such elegance.

929
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,519
Why is your husband cheating on you?

930
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,800
Sis.

931
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,800
Are you cheating on him?

932
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,239
Still want the money?

933
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,480
Just making conversation.

934
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,559
Please don't mind me.

935
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,400
Sis.

936
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,280
I mind it.

937
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,400
If you want the money,

938
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,599
just do your job.

939
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,960
Less chatter.

940
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,639
Rest assured.

941
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,400
I'll do my job properly.

942
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,679
You have a boyfriend, right?

943
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,119
It doesn't matter.

944
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,519
I can cut him loose.

945
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,119
It wasn't serious anyway.

946
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,239
If he had any money,

947
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,559
would I be doing this for you?

948
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,599
Your boyfriend is pitiful.

949
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,840
How is he pitiful?

950
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,360
Being with me

951
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,760
was his karmic reward from past lives.

952
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,719
But your husband is luckier.

953
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,960
He has a beautiful wife

954
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,159
and still gets to date me.

955
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,119
My girlfriend

956
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,719
is accompanying a top streamer

957
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,000
and made me tag along.

958
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,009
Wait a second.

959
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,865
I learned coffee-making with him.

960
00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:05,408
I learned it...

961
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:06,720
Sorry, one more.

962
00:37:07,264 --> 00:37:08,704
I learned coffee-making with him.

963
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,880
I learned it...

964
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,799
Sorry, one more.

965
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,522
Did you tell her

966
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:16,643
you're looking for your ex-girlfriend?

967
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:21,950
There's another line, right?

968
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,552
Yeah.

969
00:37:24,512 --> 00:37:26,553
Nothing about feelings.

970
00:37:27,155 --> 00:37:27,680
Alright.

971
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:29,635
Sorry, I have another line.

972
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:31,520
Nothing about feelings. Then what?

973
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:36,756

00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,660
Move forward.

977
00:37:48,756 --> 00:37:49,206
Again.

978
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:58,368
Move your feet more.
Struggle more intensely.

979
00:37:58,368 --> 00:37:59,072
Okay.

980
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:06,304
Cut.

981
00:38:07,604 --> 00:38:09,201

Huh?

986
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,528
I have a friend who runs...

987
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,160
What was it again?

988
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,356
Caution: Reversing vehicle.

989

that doesn't make sense.

She fell for Zeng Jie when they met.

I can't see at all. It's useless.

999
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:56,992
She fell for him and...

1000
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:58,159
What a shock.

1001
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:01,376
Who'd think that Master Zeng
would burn down his own studio

1002
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:03,390
and destroy his own works?

1003
