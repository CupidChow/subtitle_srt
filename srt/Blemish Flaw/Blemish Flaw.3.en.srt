00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:33,304
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,640
Honey.

4
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,680
It was my fault yesterday.

5
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,519
I've been under too much pressure.

6
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,239
And I can't control my temper.

7
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
(Now brings you the update)

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,719
(of latest weather forecast.)

9
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,200
(From tonight to tomorrow,)

10
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,000
(overcast turning to cloudy.)

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,840
(East wind force...)

12
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,400
Still mad at me?

13
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,159
Honey.

14
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,479
Look at today's event

15
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,080
and my current position.

16
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,439
Nothing to worry about.

17
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,400
I am the one

18
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,080
with the best potential.

19
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,159
Indeed.

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,840
The company hasn't yet reached

21
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,159
full profitability.

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,280
But all operations

23
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,360
are running well.

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,680
The fund

25
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,919
is for art investments.

26
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,000
Honey.

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,759
Don't you trust my aesthetics

28
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:28,840
and influence?

29
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,240
My parents understand nothing

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
but bank balances.

31
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,240
I need to reassure them.

32
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,960
How to reassure them?

33
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,000
Art investments

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,599
take time.

35
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,879
Don't rush.

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,360
Once we get profit,

37
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,560
they'd stop worrying.

38
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,280
You should

39
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,159
at least let them get something.

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,199
Listen.

41
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,039
Let them get a portion

42
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,479
to reassure my dad.

43
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,560
The doctor said

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,520
emotional state

45
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,280
greatly impacts his condition.

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,400
A portion?

47
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,439
How much?

48
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
My dad invested about

49
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,120
25 million into the company.

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,039
Give him back 10 million.

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,960
That much?

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,840
That'd mean huge losses.

53
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,840
Then be it.

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,680
It's all family money.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,360
How can you say that?

56
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,240
That's the money my dad

57
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,159
earned.

58
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,960
I don't want them to worry.

59
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,319
Nothing to worry about.

60
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:34,879
I said...

61
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,560
Zeng Jie.

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,439
When you needed funds,

63
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,800
all of us supported you.

64
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,240
Now I want to reassure

65
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,840
my parents

66
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,680
and get a portion

67
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,759
of their investment back.

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,680
Just a portion,

69
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,719
not even half.

70
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,319
Can't you make it?

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,319
It's not like that.

72
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,919
But doing this

73
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,439
creates unnecessary losses.

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,400
What's the point?

75
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,240
Slow down.

76
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,319
Why drive so fast?

77
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,639
I accept losses.

78
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,680
It's our money,

79
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
anyway.

80
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,399
Slow down, Bai Xiaoling!

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,800
Don't drive so fast.

82
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,360
Fine, Bai Xiaoling.

83
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,040
As you say.

84
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:29,920
I'll arrange it soon.

85
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,759
How soon?

86
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,160
It isn't a bank deposit.

87
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,240
We can't get cash just

88
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,839
by a password.

89
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,000
It takes time.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,519
How long?

91
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,480
40 days.

92
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,439
40 business days.

93
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,399
Okay.

94
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,480
Bai Xiaoling, are you crazy?

95
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,279
I'm not.

96
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,319
I'm perfectly calm

97
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,199
and sane.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,680
Pull over.

99
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,439
I'll take a taxi.

100
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,720
40 business days, right?

101
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,439
Today is October 22.

102
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,560
By the end

103
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,639
of the year, right?

104
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,319
Yes.

105
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,519
Off work?

106
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,040
Come to my office.

107
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,160
It's so late now.

108
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,319
Aren't you eating?

109
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,439
Take a seat.

110
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,319
Take a seat, please.

111
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,240
Xiaoling.

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,879
I ordered some dishes today.

113
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Get to the point. I'll drink tea.

114
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,240
Alright, here.

115
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,959
Here, have some tea.

116
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,800
I've learned some of

117
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,000
your company's finances.

118
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,000
You own it,

119
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,560
but most assets

120
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,120
have been transferred

121
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,720
by various means.

122
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,560
Zhang Ye, I'm not

123
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,279
that clueless.

124
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,319
I came to hear

125
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,639
if you have any solutions.

126
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,639
Right.

127
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,800
Don't rush.

128
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,959
As a lawyer...

129
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,879
if I needed a lawyer,
I'd have hired one.

130
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:37,920
Came to you

131
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,360
because we're old classmates.

132
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,680
I want your opinion.

133
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,680
Here.

134
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,879
Have a piece of fish.

135
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,199
You don't like fish skin.

136
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,079
I'll remove it.

137
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,480
Xiaoling.

138
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,319
You couldn't find a suitable lawyer.

139
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,439
You came to me

140
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,120
because you trust me.

141
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:55,920
Yes.

142
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,759
We were classmates,

143
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,879
but if not for

144
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,279
your troubles,

145
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,160
would you even

146
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,040
remember me?

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Back in school,

148
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,319
you were my goddess.

149
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,480
I was your backup.

150
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,920
I didn't deserve you.

151
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,920
But these years,

152
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,160
I've been working hard.

153
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,120
Got my master's, then PhD.

154
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,639
Now,

155
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,560
I'm a partner of a law firm.

156
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,199
Do you know

157
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,839
when you got married,

158
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,319
how upset I was?

159
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,439
I was upset because

160
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,560
I thought my progress

161
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,879
was too slow to catch up

162
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,560
with you.

163
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,920
But

164
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,720
you married a poor guy.

165
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,800
When

166
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,959
you got married,

167
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,199
I texted you

168
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,439
asking you to do

169
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,839
a prenuptial agreement.

170
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,800
You didn't even reply.

171
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,319
I'm sorry, Zhang Ye.

172
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,959
But love

173
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,079
is unpredictable.

174
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,560
True.

175
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,399
My marriage has issues,

176
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,240
but I don't regret

177
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,040
what I did.

178
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,600
Because I did it myself.

179
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,600
At that time,

180
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,120
I'd never anticipate today.

181
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,319
Had I chosen

182
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,560
someone else

183
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,600
or even you,

184
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,800
maybe I would

185
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,680
still end up here.

186
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,000
Alright.

187
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,720
If you divorce now,

188
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,679
you'll lose your assets.

189
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,559
You have no evidence of your husband's

190
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,559
marital misconduct.

191
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,159
Divorce abandoning my assets?

192
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,840
It isn't legally

193
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,320
recognized in law.

194
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,480
The law only stipulates
the right of compensation

195
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,240
for damages for the non-fault party.

196
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,919
Article 46 of the Marriage Law.

197
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,559
So you mean,

198
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,840
if I divorce,

199
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,159
we must split assets equally,

200
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,600
correct?

201
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,799
Yes.

202
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,879
But your family is quite wealthy.

203
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,440
You probably don't care about

204
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,360
that bit of community property.

205
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,000
Right. My family is wealthy.

206
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,840
But my dad fell ill two years ago.

207
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
I don't know business,

208
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,559
nor am I interested.

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,159
So I sold the factories

210
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,039
he owned.

211
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,039
You invest all the money

212
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,840
into the company?

213
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,960
Your husband never studied finance?

214
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,279
His methods are extremely professional.

215
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,720
Xiaoling,

216
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,720
I have to ask.

217
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,159
Why are you getting divorced?

218
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,639
Are you having an affair?

219
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,519
No.

220
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,960
Then he is?

221
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,879
Probably not.

222
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,240
You fell out of love?

223
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
Get back to the point.

224
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,039
Zhang Ye,

225
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,720
aside from making me
lose half my assets,

226
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,440
what other suggestions?

227
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,919
Bigamy?

228
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,600
Definitely not.

229
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,639
Domestic violence?

230
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,080
Hard to get evidence.

231
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,919
Doesn't seem possible.

232
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,639
Abuse or abandonment of family members?

233
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:17,879
Unlikely.

234
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,240
A married person

235
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,720
cohabiting with others.

236
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,360
Your husband went through such pains

237
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,919
to snatch your family's assets.

238
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,200
It shows he's greedy.

239
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,000
He's often out in public,

240
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
proving he's not low-key.

241
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,519
A man chasing fame and fortune

242
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,720
couldn't possibly resist women.

243
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,120
So go find some evidence.

244
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,960
Only by getting the evidence

245
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,559
can you stand a chance.

246
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,759
I mean a chance,

247
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,120
not a guarantee.

248
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,360
Give me your phone.

249
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,279
I can't help you

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,919
with evidence.

251
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,840
But I know a lawyer

252
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,720
in this area.

253
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,399
You can try consulting him.

254
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,679
Other than this,

255
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,240
I have no other choice?

256
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
To keep the money,

257
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,000
you'll lose dignity.

258
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,799
Please give me a five-star rating!

259
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:38,229
(Submit Five-Star Rating Anonymously)

260
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,519
(You've come this far.)

261
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,639
(An advice)

262
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,200
(for you.)

263
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,360
(Stop agonizing.)

264
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,759
(Who is he?)

265
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,559
Professor Zeng.

266
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,600
Hello.

267
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,399
Who are you?

268
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,240
A video

269
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,159
content creator,

270
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,879
with a million followers.

271
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,519
Good!

272
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,279
Account?

273
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,600
The Logic Behind Art.

274
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,840
That's an interesting name.

275
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,799
What's your name?

276
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,440
Just call me Big Hui.

277
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,879
Talk over there.

278
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,799
Be careful.

279
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,360
Record it alone?

280
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,159
(No sound or lighting.)

281
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,240
This one suffices.

282
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,879
Video creators work this way.

283
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,759
Rest assured.

284
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,679
After editing the video,

285
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,879
we'll send it

286
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,679
for your approval.

287
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,759
This cup

288
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,320
is your work, right?

289
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,480
A student's.

290
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,679
I keep some

291
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,679
presentable ones.

292
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,360
Student works are this exquisite?

293
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,519
Remarkable!

294
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,279
I heard this studio

295
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,919
was rebuilt after a fire.

296
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,440
You came to interview me,

297
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,879
so I presume you've done some research.

298
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,480
The studio fire

299
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,519
and reconstruction

300
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,919
made the news.

301
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,399
Even TV reporters came.

302
00:13:57,408 --> 00:13:59,600
Art master who has gone
through a fire. I've seen it.

303
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,919
So there's no need to ask me

304
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,360
about the fire.

305
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,039
I've answered many times.

306
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,960
We don't need

307
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,600
to waste time

308
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,399
on this.

309
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,639
Have you ever conducted

310
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,720
any training classes?

311
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,080
Think I have

312
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,320
much free time and energy?

313
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,320
You're famous.

314
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,240
Run training classes

315
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,080
could earn you much.

316
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,840
But that'd drain

317
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,120
my reputation real quick.

318
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,840
I hardly teach

319
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,720
undergraduate courses.

320
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,320
Just mentor a few graduate students.

321
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,039
Do you know Liu Wei?

322
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,080
Who?

323
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,200
Liu Wei, or Wei.

324
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,039
A woman?

325
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:43,720
A woman.

326
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,679
Don't have such a student.

327
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,080
She might not be your student,

328
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,559
but you mentored her.

329
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,919
Do you think

330
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,840
I would mentor someone

331
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,919
whose name I can't remember?

332
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,320
This piece was mentored by you?

333
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,159
Really?

334
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,720
It's even worse than a beginner's work.

335
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,240
Know Light Strokes?

336
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,120
Of course, I know

337
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,720
the owner.

338
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,360
You never went there to mentor?

339
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,399
Judging by skill level,

340
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,720
if I mentored anyone,

341
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,759
I'd only mentor

342
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,519
the owner.

343
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,679
But Light Strokes

344
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,799
displays your photos.

345
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,600
Pool halls also

346
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,039
display Ding Junhui's photos.

347
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,120
Are you here for

348
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,919
the interview?

349
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,200
Look closer.

350
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,480
Do you know her?

351
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
What do you want?

352
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,720
You know her,

353
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,600
right?

354
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,399
No.

355
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,399
Even if I did, so what?

356
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,600
If you keep harassing me,

357
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,919
please leave.

358
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,399
She's disappeared.

359
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,399
Then report it to the police.

360
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,639
The date she disappeared

361
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,120
coincides exactly with

362
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,200
(Goat)
the fire at your studio.

363
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,159
- She made this?
- Yes.

364
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,679
At Light Strokes?

365
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,639
Yes.

366
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,639
Tang Dynasty artist Zhou Fang's work.

367
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,120
I had an award-winning collection

368
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,840
that drew inspiration from it.

369
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,600
Many ceramic students later

370
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,200
replicate this collection.

371
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,440
Unfortunately,

372
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,519
my set was destroyed

373
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,960
in last year's fire.

374
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,720
But you can find images online.

375
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:49,960
I've seen them

376
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,440
and compared them.

377
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:53,720
Her name?

378
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,919
Wei?

379
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,840
Right?

380
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,440
She's disappeared

381
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,200
and left a plate

382
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,360
she made at Light Strokes,

383
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,119
imitating my work.

384
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,240
Light Strokes displays my photos

385
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,319
and I know the owner.

386
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,200
So you think

387
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,039
I know her?

388
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:13,960
Then,

389
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,079
my studio's fire

390
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,799
happened around

391
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,880
the same time as her disappearance.

392
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,240
So you think

393
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,119
her disappearance

394
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
is connected to me?

395
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,039
Let's say,

396
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,119
you think

397
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,319
I'm the murderer?

398
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,839
I killed Wei

399
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,519
and set the fire

400
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,119
to burn down my own studio

401
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,680
to ruin evidence?

402
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:41,839
Is it

403
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,119
what you call

404
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,480
The Logic Behind Truth?

405
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,720
Behind art

406
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,839
lies inspiration and dedication.

407
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,319
The Logic Behind Art.

408
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,240
This title sounds

409
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,079
too sensationalistic.

410
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,000
And you only have 100,000 followers.

411
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,240
Are you just out of content ideas

412
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,039
and here to pick a fight?

413
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,799
To be honest,

414
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,319
I don't understand

415
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,640
your analysis narratives,

416
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,759
but I at least know common sense.

417
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,079
My studio caught fire

418
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,640
last year in November.

419
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,480
Today is September 30.

420
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,839
It's been almost a year.

421
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,720
She disappeared a year ago.

422
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,920
Yet you come

423
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,799
to me now?

424
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,200
Besides,

425
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,799
are you a police officer?

426
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,680
The materials used

427
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,240
for this...

428
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,480
Kaolin clay.

429
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:42,720
Clear glaze.

430
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,240
The same as Light Strokes'.

431
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,359
We use the same

432
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,319
raw material supplier.

433
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,119
Most ceramic artists

434
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,119
in Caorong City

435
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,960
use similar materials.

436
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,759
It's like every restaurant

437
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,799
serves plain rice.

438
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,200
This plate has blemish flaws.

439
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,640
You've studied ceramics?

440
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Actually, blemish flaws

441
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,079
are common

442
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,440
for beginners.

443
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,799
Use this plate as an example.

444
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,319
Its wheel throwing

445
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,079
and coloring

446
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,440
are both subpar.

447
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,440
So the blemish flaws

448
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,839
don't matter here.

449
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,680
Mr. Big Hui,

450
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,160
I think we could

451
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,279
end this conversation.

452
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:33,000
For both of us,

453
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,119
(this is)

454
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,519
(a completely meaningless)

455
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,759
(and useless conversation.)

456
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,720
(I don't understand your work.)

457
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,720
(Interesting?)

458
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,640
Not really.

459
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,400
I just don't have a choice.

460
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,279
Because

461
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,359
I don't want to get a low-paid,

462
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,160
regular work,

463
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,599
or overwhelmed by high-paid work.

464
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,720
I don't want

465
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,359
to marry rich

466
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,920
and live a dependent life.

467
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,119
I don't wake up early.

468
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,408
I love staying up late.

469
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,519
I don't want to

470
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,279
work hard or slack off.

471
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,599
Livestreaming

472
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,519
and making videos

473
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,599
are just ways I escape reality.

474
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,200
Of course,

475
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,279
I fantasize that someday

476
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,519
I might go viral,

477
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,039
earning quite a fortune.

478
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,759
If I had a fortune,

479
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,200
I could stop panicking

480
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,920
or worrying

481
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,880
for a while.

482
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,359
Then I could really think about

483
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
how to

484
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,240
completely

485
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,000
transform myself.

486
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,599
How?

487
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,119
No idea yet.

488
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:04,880
People like me

489
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,240
are just worthless.

490
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,079
But you

491
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,640
make me believe

492
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,119
that someone like me
can be extraordinary.

493
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,559
So is your boyfriend?

494
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,079
Ex-boyfriend.

495
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,279
He's a video creator.

496
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,559
He works hard,

497
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,200
collecting material, editing,

498
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,599
even composing original scores.

499
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,200
He keeps updating

500
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,559
and accumulating fans.

501
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,400
But it's useless.

502
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,119
There's no hope in sight.

503
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:34,759
What kind of videos?

504
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,759
The Logic Behind Truth.

505
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,839
Who can see the truth clearly?

506
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,440
Who cares about the logic?

507
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,559
(October 21)
It's past midnight.

508
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,440
Want me to stay

509
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,599
or leave?

510
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,119
I want you to stay.

511
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,119
And

512
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,200
you've never been worthless.

513
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,559
A charming man like you

514
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,920
must attract many women.

515
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,200
And many women

516
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,440
would fall for you.

517
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,640
Them and me,

518
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,319
what's the difference?

519
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,559
You're different.

520
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,599
Believe it or not,

521
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,240
but I really think

522
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,599
you understand me.

523
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,640
Many things you do

524
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,480
are what I wish you'd do.

525
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,440
Many things you say

526
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,680
are what I want to hear.

527
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,960
This is rare.

528
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,359
Soulmate?

529
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,000
I dislike that term.

530
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,480
But it's exactly what it is.

531
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,200
What if I pretended to be the version

532
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,480
you like

533
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:40,960
just to get close to you?

534
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,119
How is that possible?

535
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,960
How could you possibly know

536
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,039
what kind of person I like?

537
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:51,960
It seems

538
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,759
she truly gets you.

539
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,240
What did you say?

540
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,079
You know what?

541
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,880
I've fallen for you.

542
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,039
It seems I'm destined

543
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,319
to fall for you.

544
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,720
Though

545
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,079
I know

546
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,559
you're not a good man.

547
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,400
How am I not one then?

548
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,880
You

549
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,240
certainly aren't.

550
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:28,759
(Part-time Worker L)

551
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:29,240
Say it.

552
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:30,640
As you say,

553
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
I met your husband.

554
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,960
Just do things

555
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,000
as I instructed.

556
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,880
No need to update me on the details.

557
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,319
Don't want to hear it?

558
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,279
Fine.

559
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,119
After it's done,

560
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,960
I'll give you a full report.

561
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,319
You'd better hurry.

562
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,759
Don't drag it out.

563
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,079
Don't worry.

564
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,279
Maybe

565
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,680
your husband is more impatient than you.

566
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,480
I can't help you

567
00:23:59,079 --> 00:23:59,880
with evidence.

568
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,640
I know a lawyer in this area.

569
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,359
You can try consulting him.

570
00:24:13,696 --> 00:24:15,584
(Calling...)

571
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,039
Hello.

572
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,599
Zhang Ye recommended you.

573
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,480
Zhang Ye?

574
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:24,839
Got it.

575
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,839
Divorce lawsuit?

576
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,839
What's your name?

577
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,759
Hello.

578
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,839
Say something.

579
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,200
Don't be shy.

580
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,680
Investigate your husband?

581
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:44,839
I think

582
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,759
I should lower my hand.

583
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:52,920
Take a break.

584
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
What can I do?

585
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,000
My company's annual gala

586
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,920
requires all partners

587
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,640
to perform something.

588
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,720
So I hired

589
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,839
a tutor.

590
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,160
I come here every day.

591
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,400
Take a seat.

592
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,039
Just say it.

593
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,240
You called

594
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,000
the person I recommended,

595
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,319
but hung up without saying

596
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:19,880
anything.

597
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,200
He asked me

598
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,039
what's going on.

599
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,960
That's it?

600
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,000
Sorry for troubling you.

601
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,559
Two things.

602
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
First,

603
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,240
it's a coincidence.

604
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,519
I searched online for your husband.

605
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,079
Want

606
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,359
to know what I found?

607
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,799
The school forum

608
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,039
had a post uploaded
the day before yesterday.

609
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,599
Your husband

610
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,279
picked up a girl at a mall.

611
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,079
They went to

612
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,359
an expensive restaurant,

613
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:55,720
and

614
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,519
took some dishes to-go.

615
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,799
They went to the studio
in Shuiyuan Village.

616
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,240
After about

617
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,519
less than an hour,

618
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,319
the girl called a taxi and left.

619
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,559
She's not his student, right?

620
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,240
Who asked you to do that?

621
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,519
Not a colleague, I suppose.

622
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:19,440
Zhang Ye.

623
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,400
Why do this?

624
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,359
Doesn't seem like

625
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,440
a business partner.

626
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,240
Answer me.

627
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,880
I told you it's a coincidence.

628
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,960
Let me tell you

629
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,920
there's more.

630
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,240
He didn't go home

631
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,160
on the night of 22nd.

632
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,559
On the morning of 23rd,

633
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,480
he went to school.

634
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,359
At noon, he took

635
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,319
another girl there

636
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,400
and left in the evening.

637
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,759
Take a seat.

638
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,240
You can

639
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,559
take these photos

640
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,880
to start a quarrel with your husband.

641
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,839
But if you want to use them
as evidence in a divorce lawsuit

642
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:02,480
and expect him

643
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,119
to give up the assets,

644
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,960
that's impossible.

645
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,759
But these photos

646
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,079
can prove your husband

647
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,480
is a perfectly normal successful man.

648
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,240
His preference for girls,

649
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:18,039
especially young girls,

650
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,039
is perfectly normal.

651
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,039
The studio

652
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,319
is where your husband

653
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,680
frequently takes girls.

654
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,160
The best approach

655
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,400
is to install cameras

656
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,119
to record it as evidence.

657
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:30,799
I can investigate

658
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,319
your husband's public behavior

659
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,240
for you.

660
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,640
But I can't install

661
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,880
a candid camera for you.

662
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,880
However, as his wife,

663
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,519
you can do it.

664
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,440
You could buy

665
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,519
a security camera or similar device.

666
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,039
And second?

667
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,079
Well, second.

668
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,880
Remember this music?

669
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Get to the point.

670
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,799
During the New Year's party
in our sophomore year,

671
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,400
you danced with a boy

672
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,839
with this exact song.

673
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
All these years,

674
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I've never forgotten it.

675
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,000
May I

676
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,559
dance with you?

677
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,759
How much for the investigation?

678
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,680
Don't mention it.

679
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,279
Don't worry about that.

680
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,440
Don't interfere

681
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,200
in my affairs.

682
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,920
Such cases are complex.

683
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:45,720
Hard to get evidence

684
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:46,960
and clarify disputes.

685
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,992
With slim chances of winning.

686
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,720
Ordinary lawyers

687
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,559
wouldn't take them.

688
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,079
If you think

689
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,359
I have ulterior motives,

690
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,920
you're underestimating me.

691
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,960
I did fancy on you,

692
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,400
but it's over a decade ago.

693
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,920
Memories of youth.

694
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,279
Just memories.

695
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,720
I'm taking this case

696
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,000
for only one reason.

697
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,359
Even if I can't have you,

698
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,160
I don't want to see

699
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,599
you destroyed by another man.

700
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,480
Are you sure?

701
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:26,759
Yes.

702
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:28,920
Then...

703
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,079
Last time, I didn't tell you the truth.

704
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,359
I know Zeng Jie

705
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,519
has been having an affair.

706
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,519
That's why

707
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,480
I called

708
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,720
the number you left me.

709
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:45,920
You're still hesitating.

710
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,680
Haven't decided to

711
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:48,480
investigate him?

712
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,119
What's the point?

713
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,359
Even if you helped me

714
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,680
take those photos, so what?

715
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:54,359
You said,

716
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,799
those photos cannot be

717
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,160
used as legitimate evidence.

718
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:58,359
You also said

719
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,000
it is extremely complex.

720
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,720
Evidence and clarification...

721
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:02,559
I have

722
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,759
no experience in these.

723
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,920
These are all within my expertise.

724
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,079
Can you win?

725
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:13,559
Can you make

726
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,920
Zeng Jie end up with nothing?

727
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,279
No, you can't.

728
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,920
From the very start

729
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,119
of this lawsuit,

730
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,799
I've been on the losing side.

731
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,680
If we don't try,

732
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,759
you won't have a chance to win.

733
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,279
What chance do I have?

734
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,680
Zhang Ye, stop persuading me.

735
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,359
I've thought it through.

736
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,000
What's your plan?

737
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,160
It's my plan.

738
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:40,200
Stop

739
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,400
interfering in my affairs

740
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,160
and stay out of my life.

741
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,640
I know you won't

742
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,200
listen to me.

743
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,920
But don't negotiate with him.

744
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,200
If he gets warned,

745
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,319
it will get messier.

746
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,359
Need help,

747
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:56,440
contact me anytime.

748
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,799
We're doing our best.

749
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:28,799
We could

750
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:29,519
save her life.

751
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,119
But I can't guarantee her legs

752
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,000
can be saved.

753
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,200
(So, after this fire,)

754
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,359
(I made up my mind.)

755
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,119
The interview is out?

756
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,640
Yes.

757
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,240
Flowers.

758
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,960
Chose a ruin for the interview?

759
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,759
You're quite imaginative.

760
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,880
That reporter is quite attractive.

761
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,640
Does she also

762
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,119
admire you?

763
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,400
Just an intern.

764
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:14,680
A young girl.

765
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:15,880
Nothing remarkable.

766
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,440
Am I not a young girl?

767
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,039
You're a young woman.

768
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,519
I heard when the fire started,

769
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,928
you ran to the third floor

770
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:35,480
to look for your wife

771
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,039
before escaping.

772
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,720
Who told you that?

773
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,160
It's been all over Shuiyuan Village
since the fire.

774
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,279
How's your wife doing?

775
00:32:45,408 --> 00:32:46,688
Don't you have to stay with her?

776
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,359
I'll bring her

777
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,799
some food tonight.

778
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,759
She might not eat it.

779
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,200
She's been sleeping

780
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,920
most of the time.

781
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,440
Spend New Year's Eve with her?

782
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,279
You asked me to accompany you.

783
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,319
Fine.

784
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,279
I'll go with you.

785
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,599
After you finish playing
the devoted husband,

786
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,880
we'll go enjoy a meal
and the New Year's Eve.

787
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:18,432
(Central Hospital)

788
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,440
My dad's been pressuring me again.

789
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,960
About what?

790
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,159
Studying abroad.

791
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:44,800
Actually,

792
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,280
as the daughter

793
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,599
of Caorong University's principal,

794
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,280
you should have gone abroad.

795
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,239
So, he's still

796
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,199
doing this for himself.

797
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,360
When I was young, he divorced my mom

798
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,559
and never cared about me.

799
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:56,800
Now he suddenly

800
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,760
wants me to study abroad
to make him proud.

801
00:34:59,039 --> 00:34:59,679
Why should I?

802
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,599
It's for your future.

803
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,679
Think about it.

804
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,480
Now you're at the university

805
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,320
with a cushy job.

806
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,199
But there's

807
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,639
no real room

808
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,480
for advancement.

809
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,519
Thank you.

810
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,119
I don't even want this cushy job.

811
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,440
Work like a retired old lady.

812
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,960
I bet

813
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:16,960
I'll quit

814
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,000
the job soon.

815
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,039
Feeling guilty leaving your wife

816
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,760
at the hospital?

817
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,599
I just visited her.

818
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,199
Poor thing.

819
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,079
Falling for your tricks.

820
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,800
She should've been vigilant
before marrying you.

821
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,079
Why do you keep bringing her up?

822
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,039
Maybe I'm jealous.

823
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:57,920
Before meeting her,

824
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,639
I thought

825
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,000
she's some frumpy housewife.

826
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,360
But you brought her

827
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,400
to the alumni banquet.

828
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,639
She's the most stunning

829
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,480
there.

830
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
If you didn't lie

831
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,599
about being divorced,

832
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,000
I'd never date you.

833
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,960
I told you before

834
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,360
our love

835
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,719
has gone.

836
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,119
I only love you.

837
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,079
Save your breath.

838
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,519
I never wanted

839
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:27,800
to disrupt your life.

840
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:29,599
But now...

841
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,320
Now, you're

842
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,039
a perfectionist

843
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,039
trapped in an imperfect marriage.

844
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:37,119
Don't you feel awful?

845
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,880
Don't you want to escape it?

846
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,079
It makes me feel awful.

847
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,559
We're both unlucky.

848
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,679
Such a marriage

849
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,000
is like

850
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:58,679
a blemish flaw

851
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,280
on a ceramic.

852
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:01,960
Everything else

853
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,159
appears flawless,

854
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,079
but one blemish flaw

855
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,599
ruins its value.

856
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,119
And it

857
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,760
becomes defective.

858
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,800
And defective things

859
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,519
are worthless.

860
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,320
It's hard to find you.

861
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,559
With all the New Year's fireworks

862
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,800
out there.

863
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,679
I had plans

864
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,760
with friends for a party.

865
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,079
But before leaving,

866
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
I saw an interview

867
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,239
of your husband online.

868
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,360
So I texted you,

869
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,400
but got no reply.

870
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,559
Called twice, yet you hung up.

871
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,360
So I

872
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,760
got concerned.

873
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,000
This place is nice.

874
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,719
When I broke my legs two years ago,

875
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:01,880
I was hospitalized here.

876
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,559
It's pricey, but

877
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:04,960
nice facilities.

878
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,000
Right?

879
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,559
No flowers?

880
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,199
I brought some.

881
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:17,079
Smells good.

882
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:18,320
They're fresh.

883
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,199
You must think

884
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,519
I deserve this.

885
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,320
Before coming,

886
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,360
I had a hunch

887
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:35,480
your husband wouldn't spend
the New Year's Eve with you.

888
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,239
Of course,

889
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,679
if he were here,

890
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,679
I'd just leave

891
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,960
after taking a peek.

892
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,239
But I was right.

893
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,119
Normal.

894
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,039
On such a romantic day,

895
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,559
he wouldn't miss it.

896
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,320
The news said your accident

897
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
happened around

898
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,800
December 20?

899
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,440
The news reported it.

900
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,320
Why ask me?

901
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,800
After our last meeting,

902
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,519
you discussed with your husband?

903
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,639
I just wanted him

904
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:13,679
to return

905
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,239
a portion of the fund

906
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,920
to my parents.

907
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,280
Is that wrong?

908
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,000
No.

909
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,039
But

910
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,199
you did it wrong.

911
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,360
I've warned you.

912
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,039
but I knew

913
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,679
you wouldn't listen to me.

914
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,199
By confronting him,

915
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
he'd be alert.

916
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:32,840
And

917
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,280
I never expected

918
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,599
him to be this ruthless.

919
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
What do you mean?

920
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,079
Bai Xiaoling,

921
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,559
do you think your accident

922
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:47,760
isn't related to him?

923
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,920
Zeng Jie wants you dead!

924
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,960
It's not like that.

925
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
This was an accident.

926
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,199
Of course, it was.

927
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,239
If it weren't,

928
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,559
he'd be in prison already.

929
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,000
Listen,

930
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:06,800
I came here

931
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,199
to hear your side.

932
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
I believe this case

933
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,719
might be a premeditated murder.

934
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,159
You're overthinking it.

935
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,639
I know you care about me,

936
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,800
but right now,

937
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,559
I don't care about anything.

938
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,320
I don't care about

939
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,639
divorce or assets.

940
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:25,960
I just want my...

941
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,079
Thank you

942
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,239
for visiting me

943
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,800
and trying to help.

944
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,159
But I don't need it.

945
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,480
I deleted your contact.

946
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,800
From now on,

947
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,199
please

948
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,000
do not contact me.

949
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,599
Accepting fate now?

950
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,159
Bai Xiaoling,

951
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,199
this isn't you.

952
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:04,920
I'm no longer

953
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,440
the person I used to be.

954
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,760
Your injuries

955
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:14,960
are serious.

956
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,719
This has nothing to do with him.

957
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,119
It was an accident.

958
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,480
I won't say things like

959
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,480
"Contact me

960
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,159
if you need help."

961
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,320
Happy New Year!

962
00:42:06,848 --> 00:42:08,377
It's very likely she's gone.

963
00:42:09,632 --> 00:42:10,409
Zeng Jie.

964
00:42:10,784 --> 00:42:11,648
Sorry, one more.

965
00:42:11,648 --> 00:42:12,832
Remove it.

966
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:16,562
He needs a fire to destroy...

967
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:19,168
What's the line? I keep forgetting it.

968
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,312
But they don't eat there.

969
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:23,893
What's wrong with me?

970
00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:27,584
Doesn't seem like a business partner.

971
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:28,448
Answer me.

972
00:42:28,448 --> 00:42:29,676
I told you it's a...

973
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:33,068
Sorry.

974
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,160
