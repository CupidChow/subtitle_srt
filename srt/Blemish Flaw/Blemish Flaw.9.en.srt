00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:33,304
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,680
Who is this guy?

4
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,280
He's a video blogger.

5
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,519
Check his channel.

6
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,599
I want to know

7
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,760
what he has done,

8
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,359
and whom he frequently meet.

9
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,840
That's too vague.

10
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,640
Fine.

11
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,439
Let me check

12
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,359
this guy's basic info.

13
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,599
Anything else?

14
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,560
And this.

15
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,080
Isn't this your wife?

16
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,672
I want to know
who she's been meeting lately,

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,800
or if she's getting close

18
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,400
to anyone.

19
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,840
Got it.

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,319
Collect evidence of infidelity.

21
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,599
As always,

22
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,199
authorization.

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,360
Zeng Jie contacted your agency?

24
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,919
He probably got our contact

25
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,520
from someone.

26
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,120
He came to see me wearing glasses

27
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,639
and a mask.

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,319
Little did he know

29
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,960
I recognized him immediately.

30
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,759
Last year,

31
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,360
you commissioned me, right?

32
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,199
So

33
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,199
I'm giving you a heads-up.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,960
Bai Xiaoling is disabled now.

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,719
Cheating would be too difficult.

36
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,400
Besides,

37
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,120
she's not the type to cheat.

38
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:07,479
Listen.

39
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,400
Take this case first.

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,240
If you find anything,

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,879
don't tell Zeng Jie.

42
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,080
Tell me first.

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,319
By the way,

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,080
regarding that Yang Zhenghui

45
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,560
he wants investigated,

46
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,759
update me

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,319
on any findings too.

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,439
Absolutely.

49
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,560
I was so foolish back then.

50
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,120
Why did I have to threaten

51
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,919
to jump off?

52
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,479
I made myself disabled.

53
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,639
Do you think that fool

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,719
is thrilled about it?

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,680
Because finally,

56
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,479
he could dump

57
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,120
his burden.

58
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,080
I should just

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,159
live gloriously,

60
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,080
dress impeccably every day,

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
and appear before him

62
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,280
from time to time.

63
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,000
The past can't be changed.

64
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,680
Women care about love.

65
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,400
I understand.

66
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,240
You have no idea.

67
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm talking about Lin Fang.

68
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,280
Look.

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,560
Lin Fang

70
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,159
seems meek and mild,

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,840
but stubborn beneath the surface.

72
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,599
She was with Zeng Jie,

73
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
(Wine)
and they even held a wedding banquet.

74
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,639
How could Lin Fang

75
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,879
easily accept

76
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,280
being dumped by Zeng Jie?

77
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,720
A person like her,

78
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,959
once she sets her heart

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,879
on someone,

80
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,439
she'd cling

81
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,360
to them even in death.

82
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,480
Zeng Jie

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,319
struggled

84
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,879
from a village to reach the city,

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,519
nearly achieving elite status.

86
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,399
Why would he

87
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,800
let Lin Fang hold him back?

88
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,600
Unable to shake Lin Fang off,

89
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,360
Zeng Jie had

90
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,519
a motive to kill her.

91
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,319
That would be Lin Fang's own doing.

92
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,968
Men dread the wrong career,
for women, the wrong man.

93
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,720
If a woman loses her judgment,

94
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,759
she might really

95
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,600
lose her life.

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,839
Does Zeng Jie

97
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,879
seem like a killer?

98
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,240
I've never met him.

99
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,079
Only after you mentioned him

100
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,279
did I find something.

101
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,360
When Lin Shan brought me food,

102
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,360
I chatted casually and got him to talk.

103
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,800
His reactions felt off to me.

104
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,040
Zeng Jie

105
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,879
is now thriving.

106
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,040
It seems he's become
some kind of master now.

107
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Back in the day,

108
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,360
whenever he saw me,

109
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,079
he'd dutifully call me "Boss".

110
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,480
But now,

111
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,959
he wouldn't even recognize me.

112
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,800
How did your sister
end up with him back then?

113
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,319
My sister...

114
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,959
Who knows

115
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,279
how they got together.

116
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,079
But to be honest,

117
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,839
my sister had good taste.

118
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,720
Back then, she said Zeng Jie

119
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,839
was bound to succeed.

120
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
But my sister

121
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,399
wasn't destined for that fortune.

122
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,079
She barely enjoyed anything.

123
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,879
How did she suddenly

124
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,040
pass away later?

125
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,000
Fate's cruelty.

126
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,040
Forget him.

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,800
Mentioning him makes me angry.

128
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,680
He's your sister's husband.

129
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,879
Why are you so angry?

130
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,639
H-How could I not be angry?

131
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,360
My sister followed him since she was 18.

132
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,240
Now he's

133
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,680
thriving and successful.

134
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,519
And my sister?

135
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,240
She's gone for long.

136
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,600
Can I not be angry?

137
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,240
He said he was angry.

138
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
But when I looked at him,

139
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,279
it didn't seem genuine.

140
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,800
Could it be that

141
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,720
Lin Fang and Lin Shan

142
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,120
had a strained relationship?

143
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,720
Their parents died early.

144
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,759
No matter what,

145
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
they were siblings

146
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,759
who grew up together.

147
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,040
Then why would Lin Shan's reactions

148
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,000
be off?

149
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,560
This is just a hypothesis.

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,680
If

151
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,879
Lin Fang's death

152
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,439
was connected to Zeng Jie,

153
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,759
Lin Shan would likely

154
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,839
know about it.

155
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,279
So how could he

156
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,480
possibly just

157
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,680
let it go?

158
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,279
Yes.

159
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,879
Lin Shan arranged

160
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Lin Fang's funeral,

161
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,240
the death certificate

162
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,519
and also the deregistration.

163
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,759
Do you think

164
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,120
Lin Shan helped Zeng Jie cover up?

165
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,160
After my accident,

166
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,079
Lin Shan genuinely treated me well.

167
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,639
But I

168
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,399
know him well.

169
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,120
He's always been idle,

170
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,920
without even a job.

171
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,600
My hospital stay these years
cost at least several hundred thousand.

172
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,560
Where do you think

173
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
he got the money?

174
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,920
The only person

175
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,879
with money he knows

176
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,000
is Zeng Jie.

177
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,879
By your logic,

178
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,759
Lin Fang's death links to Zeng Jie,

179
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,120
and Lin Shan knew the truth.

180
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,759
These years,

181
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,519
Zeng Jie's been paying Lin Shan

182
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,079
for helping him

183
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,800
hide the secret.

184
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,360
It was a deal

185
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,079
between them.

186
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,759
If you find a way

187
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,279
to see

188
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,160
the money transfers,

189
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,208
you may find something.

190
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,120
Unlikely.

191
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,120
Zeng Jie is very cautious.

192
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,439
He wouldn't transfer

193
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,199
and leave traces.

194
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,560
He'd probably use cash.

195
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,879
Cash?

196
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,639
Yes. I just remembered.

197
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,160
He paid cash when the hospital

198
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,240
asked for payment.

199
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,560
If that's the case,

200
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,959
the logic checks out completely.

201
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,079
But how do we find evidence?

202
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,519
Lin Fang passed away

203
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,360
so many years ago.

204
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,160
And we don't know

205
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
how Zeng Jie did it.

206
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,319
Isn't that easy?

207
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,279
Lin Fang

208
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:00,800
was born

209
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,639
with a heart disease.

210
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,439
She always carried medication.

211
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,560
So if

212
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,279
Zeng Jie

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,680
deliberately induced her illness,

214
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,000
and didn't save her

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,680
or give her meds,

216
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,319
wouldn't she

217
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,160
have died from it?

218
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,160
But death might be better.

219
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,319
Better than lying here in bed like me,

220
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,639
just waiting to die.

221
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,480
You need to have faith in yourself.

222
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,000
Big Hui,

223
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,079
can you teach me to make videos?

224
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,759
I really love deduction.

225
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,480
I'll keep trying

226
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,879
to get clues from Lin Shan.

227
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,679
Trust me.

228
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
I can do this.

229
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,159
I trusted you too much.

230
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,120
What you did today

231
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,600
is really impressive.

232
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,240
But

233
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,720
I-I have a question.

234
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,279
Lin Shan has been so good to you.

235
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,559
If the truth turns out
as you speculated,

236
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,159
then Lin Shan would be a criminal.

237
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,399
How could you bear

238
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,080
to do this to him?

239
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,559
If the truth

240
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,639
really ends up this way,

241
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,840
Lin Shan would keep asking for money

242
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,799
from Zeng Jie.

243
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,440
A few tens of thousands yearly might be

244
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,519
manageable.

245
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,840
I'm afraid he really

246
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,240
wants to cure me.

247
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,080
Lin Shan asked around.

248
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,759
Send me to Beijing or Shanghai,

249
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,000
and I may actually be cured.

250
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,639
But the surgery costs over a million.

251
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,600
That's a lot of money.

252
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,679
What if he pushes Zeng Jie too hard?

253
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,559
Zeng Jie

254
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,320
killed Lin Fang.

255
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:27,960
Why not

256
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,879
kill Lin Shan too?

257
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,159
But back then, I didn't know

258
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,000
or think

259
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,759
about his sister.

260
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,600
Since you

261
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,320
mentioned it,

262
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,120
I've been worried.

263
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,039
I'd rather stay

264
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,799
disabled forever,

265
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,039
or have Lin Shan in prison for years,

266
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,039
than have him

267
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,840
die

268
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,720
without reason.

269
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,720
Tracy,

270
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,000
your mind

271
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,679
is sharper than I imagined.

272
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,200
But in the end,

273
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,639
they two have suffered enough.

274
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,039
One for an unfaithful man,

275
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,000
and the other for a disabled woman.

276
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,919
What a miserable life.

277
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:06,960
Right.

278
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,240
I've got one more question.

279
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,000
What is it?

280
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,799
It makes sense logically.

281
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,360
But...

282
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,200
Lack evidence.

283
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,120
I know there's no evidence.

284
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,720
So I'm just chatting with you.

285
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:21,639
So

286
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,279
following your logic,

287
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,799
Zeng Jie could kill Lin Fang.

288
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,720
He could also kill Liu Wei.

289
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,519
We discussed before

290
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,639
about the kind

291
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,840
of girls Zeng Jie goes after.

292
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,440
Poor family backgrounds.

293
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,000
Most are from other cities.

294
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,600
And Lin Fang's situation.

295
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,399
I think from the very beginning,

296
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,440
he'd had a backup plan.

297
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,720
Not necessarily kill.

298
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,399
But if someone

299
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,799
got in his way,

300
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,919
taking actions

301
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
would be much easier.

302
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,360
Don't you think this guy

303
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,039
is way too obsessed with women?

304
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,519
It's not just lust driving him.

305
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,559
He seems to use this pattern

306
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,360
to fuel his ego

307
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,679
or compensate for some inadequacy.

308
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,919
Does Zeng Jie

309
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,519
have unresolved trauma in his past

310
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,440
that we didn't find?

311
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,039
You're

312
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,480
all over the place.

313
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,600
Tell me.

314
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,759
What else did you find?

315
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,600
Nothing concrete yet.

316
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
Zeng Jie burned

317
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,120
all possible

318
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,919
evidence.

319
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,639
So

320
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,759
based on your theory,

321
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,440
if Liu Wei was murdered,

322
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,480
Zeng Jie Studio

323
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,559
is the primary crime scene.

324
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,960
If it isn't,

325
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,080
why would he burn it?

326
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,799
Makes sense.

327
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,720
A massive fire

328
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,440
destroyed the weapons and scene

329
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,200
all at once.

330
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,960
I regret it so much.

331
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,600
When Wei broke up with me,

332
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,080
I should've tried to stop her.

333
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,759
At least that might've saved her.

334
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,039
It's not your fault.

335
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,039
To be honest,

336
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,000
I really respect you.

337
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,840
You're still digging into her case

338
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,399
after all this time.

339
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:00,720
What a man.

340
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,600
Zhang Xiaohong

341
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,440
really surprised me.

342
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,279
When asked if she cared about Lin Shan,

343
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,519
her answer was really

344
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,799
generous.

345
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,000
What did you ask her finally?

346
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,240
I told her all about Bai Xiaoling

347
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,320
and what she had

348
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,320
with Zeng Jie.

349
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,360
I wanted to know

350
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,840
how someone like her,

351
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,000
with similar experiences

352
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,440
and physical disabilities,

353
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,200
would deal

354
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,200
with Zeng Jie.

355
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,320
You trust her so much?

356
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Just wanted to hear what she thought.

357
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,360
What did she say?

358
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
She said she's not sure.

359
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,480
She'll tell me

360
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,200
when she is.

00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,120
Get divorced early

390
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,000
and start fresh.

391
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,279
I can't accept this.

392
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,919
What can't you accept?

393
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:18,559
Life

394
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,240
is full of setbacks.

395
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,320
I chose him back then.

396
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,919
I ignored your advice

397
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,080
and married him.

398
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,039
This mess is mine,

399
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,200
and I'll clean it up myself.

400
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,519
How exactly?

401
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
After all that trouble,

402
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,879
what do you really get out of it?

403
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
He married you

404
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,720
and took everything he wanted.

405
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,960
You've lost everything

406
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
that's not yours.

407
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,039
I'll make him pay back

408
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,720
all your money.

409
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,759
Xiaoling,

410
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,720
stop sinking deeper into this.

411
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,519
You ignored my warnings

412
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,440
when marrying him.

413
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,679
Now, you do the same

414
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,000
about the divorce.

415
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,279
I have my own plan.

416
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,639
What's your plan?

417
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,480
Tell me.

418
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,240
I won't let anyone

419
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,759
take advantage of our family

420
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,559
and treat us like fools.

421
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,919
Thank you.

422
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:26,600
Next.

423
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,039
Okay.

424
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:28,440
Thank you.

425
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,120
(Kelly)

426
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,799
(visited)

427
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:38,960
(Detective Hale's office)

428
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,440
(and hired him)

429
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,519
(to look into her husband)

430
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,840
(Jackson's affair.)

431
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,960
(Soon,)

432
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,000
(Hale captured...)

433
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,159
An afternoon meeting was canceled.

434
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,639
I didn't receive your message.

435
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
I assumed you'd be at home.

436
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,799
I didn't cook for you.

437
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,759
It's fine.

438
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,799
I ate earlier.

439
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,559
Not hungry now.

440
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,399
Didn't go to the café today?

441
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,519
Visited my dad this afternoon.

442
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,639
Right.

443
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,320
I was about to tell you.

444
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:27,960
I finally freed up

445
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,000
some money.

446
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,159
Your parents will get it soon.

447
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,840
How soon?

448
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,080
Half a month.

449
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:35,840
How much?

450
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,360
About one to two million.

451
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,559
A drop in the bucket.

452
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,200
Better than nothing.

453
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,639
There's nothing to worry about.

454
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,584
- In the long run, the company...
- Okay.

455
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,200
At least it'll make them feel better.

456
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,039
I don't expect much anyway.

457
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,000
Xiaoling,

458
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,320
I know you have a lot

459
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,200
against me.

460
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,399
I don't want to explain too much.

461
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,120
Anyway, two years later,

462
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,039
you'll know it.

463
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,920
I know it.

464
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,200
You're stalling for two years.

465
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,160
Can we just

466
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,960
talk properly?

467
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,599
Agreeing to two years

468
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,799
just means talking properly?

469
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,519
Since you used the wheelchair,

470
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,599
your mood's been worse
than it was before.

471
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,000
Honestly, I can understand.

472
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,119
How can you?

473
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,799
You're perfectly healthy.

474
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:33,960
At best, you just

475
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,000
understand in words.

476
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,319
Along with my worsening mood

477
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,559
comes the deterioration

478
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
of my physical condition.

479
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,720
Every swallow is torture for me.

480
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,160
As I don't want

481
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,599
my legs to completely atrophy.

482
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
I don't want my body

483
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,559
to be ruined.

484
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,359
Maybe

485
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,039
I can accompany you for a walk?

486
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,079
I take walks daily.

487
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:05,599
No.

488
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,640
I don't have legs.

489
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,279
I walk in a wheelchair.

490
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,720
You know how much I loved traveling.

491
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,759
Now it's become an impossible dream.

492
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
You want to travel now?

493
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,720
When we first married,

494
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,240
you said you'd find time

495
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,400
to take me to the mountains,

496
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,359
watch how you find

497
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,279
and dig clay.

498
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,400
And now?

499
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,200
Still want that?

500
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,039
Zeng Jie.

501
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,599
Do you think I can still

502
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:44,920
climb a mountain now?

503
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,519
I can push you.

504
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,079
We don't need to go off-road,

505
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,680
just somewhere you can manage.

506
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Maybe then,

507
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,400
your mood would improve.

508
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,359
Do you even have time?

509
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,920
I'll adjust classes next week.

510
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,000
I can take a few days off.

511
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:06,440
No big deal.

512
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:07,960
Xiaoling,

513
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,440
I know deep down

514
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:10,680
there's

515
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,880
something really wrong
with our marriage.

516
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:13,839
But...

517
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,359
But after all,

518
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,960
we did love each other once.

519
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,079
I hope through my efforts,

520
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,440
I can mend

521
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,519
our relationship.

522
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,039
I understand.

523
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,759
During these years of marriage,

524
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,759
I've always been busy.

525
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,680
I really haven't

526
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,440
properly traveled with you.

527
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,480
It was your best friend

528
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,640
who went out with you

529
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,319
and had fun those years.

530
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,160
I never managed to be by your side.

531
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:51,960
Okay.

532
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,640
You plan the trip.

533
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,160
Dad.

534
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,240
How was yesterday?

535
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,279
How was Zeng Jie?

536
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,720
Actually, I should be asking you.

537
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,720
Do you want him to do well,

538
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,400
or poorly?

539
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,200
If you think he did well,

540
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,440
everyone's happy.

541
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,079
If you think he didn't,

542
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,160
then we

543
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,119
will have a rift.

544
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,079
Come on.

545
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,119
Before you're married,

546
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,720
you're already taking his side.

547
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,400
It seems

548
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,559
you really like Zeng Jie.

549
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,079
I deliberately

550
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,119
invited him to a Michelin restaurant.

551
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,240
Throughout the meal,

552
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,359
from ordering to tasting,

553
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,799
he showed

554
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,359
no signs of nervousness.

555
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,720
He even quietly

556
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,759
paid the bill midway.

557
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:52,960
This meal probably

558
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,240
cost him over a month's salary.

559
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,200
Yet I noticed he didn't

560
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,079
hesitate at all.

561
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,480
That shows he takes you seriously.

562
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,039
He checked out the restaurant

563
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,160
in advance,

564
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,920
just to give you

565
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,799
a good impression.

566
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,680
Of course, I know that.

567
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,160
But don't forget,

568
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,319
he's just an ordinary teacher.

569
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,839
He doesn't care about money.

570
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,799
He's an artist.

571
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,480
If he were truly an artist,

572
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,119
he wouldn't have rushed to pay the bill.

573
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,359
I think he was trying

574
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,119
to please me

575
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,160
while pretending to be
neither subservient

576
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,200
nor arrogant.

577
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,720
What's wrong with that?

578
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,279
Nothing at all.

579
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,319
It's good.

580
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,279
Very considerate.

581
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,599
But before he entered the subway,

582
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,359
I noticed something he did.

583
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,400
Please,

584
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,640
give me some money.

585
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:45,720
Of course,

586
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I'm not someone

587
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,160
showing sympathy

588
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,799
on every beggar I see.

589
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,680
But at the very least,

590
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,839
I won't turn a blind eye.

591
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,599
Empathy

592
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,920
is an innate human instinct.

593
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,200
But Zeng Jie's actions

594
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,079
show

595
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,319
he has

596
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,119
low empathy

597
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,920
and tends to be indifferent.

598
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,359
I know you don't like

599
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,240
what I'm saying,

600
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,319
but I think Zeng Jie

601
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,119
is inherently

602
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,400
not kind.

603
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,359
I might believe you

604
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,160
in anything else.

605
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,200
But on this one,

606
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,200
you must be wrong.

607
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,319
I met Zeng Jie

608
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,759
because of his kindness.

609
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:19,799
Yes,

610
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,000
you've told me that.

611
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,880
But have you considered

612
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,000
what if instead of two beauties

613
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,359
and a luxury car,

614
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,519
there were two old men

615
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,759
and a piece-of-junk car?

616
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,480
Dad, you're being a bit argumentative.

617
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,920
I'm good-looking.

618
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,640
That's the truth.

619
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,559
You can't use that truth

620
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:37,920
to label everyone liking me

621
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,200
as some lust-driven creep.

622
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,359
I'm not trying to argue with you.

623
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,960
I just need to see clearly

624
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,559
what kind of person this Zeng Jie

625
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,759
you fancy really is.

626
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,559
Even if he's putting on an act,

627
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,799
I'll accept it.

628
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,519
Men like him

629
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,799
are double-edged swords.

630
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,440
If he's

631
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,680
genuinely devoted to you,

632
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,039
that's wonderful.

633
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,119
But if he has ulterior motives,

634
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,200
then

635
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,200
what you'll risk losing

636
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,599
is your entire life.

637
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:08,839
He won't.

638
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:37,799
Zhang Ye?

639
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,920
Surprised?

640
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,880
How did you know I am here?

641
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:42,759
Let me give you

642
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,799
a bigger surprise first.

643
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,440
You investigated me?

644
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,640
Do I look that bored to investigate you?

645
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,720
Someone else was investigating you.

646
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,680
I happened to have hired him before.

647
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,960
When he sent documents,

648
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,240
I spotted your photo.

649
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,319
So I came to tell you.

650
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,720
Who's investigating me?

651
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,400
Care to guess?

652
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,039
Zeng Jie?

653
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,279
I took the liberty

654
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,319
to show these to your husband,

655
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,359
proving you haven't met anyone

656
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,440
except yourself.

657
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,000
Thank you.

658
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,559
I should thank you

659
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,519
for not blaming my action.

660
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,039
About last year's incident,

661
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,519
I should thank you too.

662
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,559
Let's drop the formal thanks.

663
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,559
I just

664
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,039
don't understand

665
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,119
why your husband investigates you.

666
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,720
And

667
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,200
who's this guy?

668
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,640
He's a friend of mine.

669
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,640
What friend?

670
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,720
I know he's your friend.

671
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,200
Obviously,

672
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,640
he can't be your lover.

673
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,400
You're not the type to cheat.

674
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,559
Thanks for trusting me.

675
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,559
Of course, I trust you.

676
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,799
The problem is your husband doesn't.

677
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,079
He ordered investigations on two people.

678
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,359
You,

679
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,759
and him,

680
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,480
Yang Zhenghui.

681
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,759
He hired a lawyer
to investigate Yang Zhenghui?

682
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,400
So

683
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,000
I came specifically to inform you.

684
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,559
You've been here every day lately?

685
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,119
The coffee's mediocre though.

686
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,079
You like the environment here?

687
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,079
I love the sunlight here.

688
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,119
Xiaoling,

689
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,160
let me add one more thing.

690
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,839
Now that your husband

691
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,200
is investigating you,

692
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,319
why aren't you divorcing him?

693
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,039
Get divorced, okay?

694
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,519
Let me help you, okay?

695
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,759
How long will you

696
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,680
keep struggling?

697
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,680
Thank you, Zhang Ye.

698
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,599
But I want to give

699
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,480
myself some time.

700
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,599
(Talking with a classmate.
Meet at the café tomorrow.)

701
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,400
Still delaying?

702
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,799
I'm not delaying.

703
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,559
I just want to be certain.

704
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,319
Fine.

705
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,680
Be certain.

706
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,000
When you've been certain,

707
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:31,880
come find me.

708
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,119
You deleted me before.

709
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,920
Add me again, okay?

710
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,200
I'll scan you.

711
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,240
Well, your wife

712
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,519
appears completely alone

713
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,720
with no signs of cheating.

714
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,680
When you showed up,

715
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,799
I got a bit excited,

716
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:02,799
thought it was a scoop,

717
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,839
but it was you.

718
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,680
But don't worry.

719
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,119
My assistant will follow up.

720
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,079
If there's any news,

721
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
we'll tell you promptly.

722
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,200
The other person?

723
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,119
Yang Zhenghui,

724
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:11,839
30 years old,

725
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,384
from Hunan.

726
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,039
He attended university in Caorong,

727
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,240
majoring in marketing.

728
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,960
After graduation,

729
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,240
he worked as an estate agent.

730
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Less than a year later,

731
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,079
he went to an advertising company.

732
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,880
He resigned after eighteen months.

733
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,400
Then he went

734
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,359
to Tibet with friends

735
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,079
to film a documentary,

736
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,119
but it flopped.

737
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,440
He also ran a blog

738
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,359
and had side jobs.

739
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,319
Three years ago,

740
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,559
he started a channel,

741
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,400
making videos

742
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,720
specifically on

743
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,200
case analysis,

744
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,319
called

745
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:36,920
The Logic Behind...

746
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
The Logic Behind Truth.

747
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,759
Exactly!

748
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,920
Over 100k followers.

749
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,160
When videos were popular,

750
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,240
he could earn some money.

751
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:42,839
However,

752
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:43,920
he also did some

753
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,359
driving gigs for money.

754
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,640
He hasn't updated

755
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,839
his short videos for a while.

756
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,200
What you've mentioned

757
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,680
are all basic information.

758
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,680
But if you want to investigate

759
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,079
what he wants to do

760
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
or what he is doing,

761
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,440
it's not that simple.

762
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,200
But rest assured.

763
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,240
I'll tell you

764
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
once there's progress.

765
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:02,920
Good work.

766
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,320
Professor Zeng,

767
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:06,200
why do you always wear
a mask and sunglasses?

768
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,119
Aren't you stuffy?

769
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,279
Investigate!

770
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,079
Okay.

771
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:12,240
I'm leaving.

772
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,519
What's it?

773
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,279
It's been over two days.

774
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,319
That Big Hui

775
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,799
still hasn't come to find me.

776
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,119
What then?

777
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,640
You want him to look for you?

778
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,839
No,

779
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,240
I want to figure out

780
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,759
who's actually targeting you
behind the scenes.

781
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,839
If he wants to find you,

782
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:45,599
he'll show up.

783
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:46,720
When he called me

784
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,039
that time,

785
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,240
he sounded urgent.

786
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,279
I don't know what he wanted.

787
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,960
Then you definitely shouldn't rush.

788
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:54,559
It's fine.

789
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,119
If he truly comes,

790
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,079
just tell the truth.

791
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,720
If he doesn't show up,

792
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,119
you can ignore it.

793
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,279
So be it.

794
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,200
Oh, Big Hui,

795
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,799
why don't you come find me?

796
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,839
Polishing is one
of the most charming parts

797
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,400
in ceramic making.

798
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,799
Layer by layer,

799
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,440
all the bumps,

800
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,799
uneven flaws

801
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,200
and wrinkles

802
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,839
are smoothed out

803
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,119
in this process,

804
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,759
making it closer and closer
to perfection.

805
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,440
Do you think it's boring?

806
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,559
I often

807
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,880
exfoliate and remove dead skin too.

808
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
If polishing life

809
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,640
could be simple as exfoliating,

810
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,680
that'd be great.

811
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,519
Right.

812
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,720
Master Zeng

813
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,480
can't even tolerate blemish flaws,

814
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,279
how could you not meticulously

815
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,720
polish your own life?

816
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,240
If you keep polishing like this,

817
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,079
will you polish me away too?

818
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,279
What nonsense are you talking?

819
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,839
You know exactly

820
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
how I care about you.

821
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,319
You care about me

822
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,200
because I don't care about you.

823
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,920
I don't want to marry you

824
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,799
or spend eternity with you.

825
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,599
That's how people are.

826
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:30,119
They don't learn
until they pay the price.

827
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,480
Just like my dad and mom.

828
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,920
Even after years of divorce,

829
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,240
they still only care about themselves.

830
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,640
How do you get along?

831
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:41,920
Get along?

832
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,200
I know she's acting.

833
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,279
She knows I know she's acting.

834
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
She knows I'm acting.

835
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,960
I know she knows I'm acting.

836
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,079
So we both just

837
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
keep up our own acts,

838
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,599
fully aware of each other's performance.

839
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,640
I often wonder

840
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,279
if our marriage

841
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,279
is an exception

842
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,480
or just like most others.

843
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,000
I don't know

844
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:18,920
what marriage is like.

845
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,640
And I don't want to know.

846
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,119
But your marriage

847
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,400
is already at stake.

848
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,000
Have you thought of leaving?

849
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:31,119
This marriage hasn't brought me

850
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,079
much happiness,

851
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,839
but it's not painful.

852
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,400
It's not

853
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,160
the best time to end it now.

854
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,559
Besides,

855
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,200
it hasn't become

856
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,960
an obstacle yet.

857
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,839
Otherwise,

858
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,759
I wouldn't ignore it.

859
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,039
Master Zeng,

860
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,759
you keep polishing.

861
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,359
I'll hang out with friends,

862
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
not being with you today.

863
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,920
Bye-bye.

864
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,640
Stop drinking.

865
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,279
The doctor said you can't drink.

866
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,200
Where did all the money

867
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,359
come from?

868
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,960
I worked at a gallery.

869
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,440
150 per piece.

870
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,759
I made 2,000 of them.

871
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,920
When you were ten,

872
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,119
I went to the city with villagers

873
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,319
to look for jobs.

874
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,200
A townsman's uncle

875
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,279
was the foreman.

876
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,640
He took us to do renovation jobs.

877
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,640
I did that job for over a decade.

878
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:08,880
Otherwise,

879
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,319
I couldn't afford your education.

880
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:13,640
Sit.

881
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,079
Back then,

882
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,960
when renovating homes,

883
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,720
the foreman taught us

884
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,880
how to judge if a boss is decent.

885
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,359
If they come to the site,

886
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,799
bringing us drinks or snacks,

887
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,640
and greet us first,

888
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:37,480
saying "Good work",

889
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,200
they're good people.

890
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,839
Those who come empty-handed

891
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,279
and boss us around

892
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,200
while constantly complaining

893
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:50,000
about everything

894
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:52,720
are bad people.

895
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,160
With good people,

896
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,279
work would be easier.

897
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,359
Just do the basics right.

898
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,400
If they want changes,

899
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,160
we can drag it out

900
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,920
to earn extra days' pay.

901
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,719
With bad people,

902
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,960
you must work meticulously.

903
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,679
Do it poorly,

904
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,159
and they'll replace

905
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,440
the whole crew.

906
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,960
They'll argue over your pay and never

907
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,800
give it to you.

908
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,320
After all these years,

909
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,320
I've learned just one thing.

910
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,960
Nice guys finish last.

911
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,559
Son,

912
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,119
those old sayings hold truth.

913
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,679
I carried buckets

914
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,079
up and down ladders,

915
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,920
painting walls for over a decade.

916
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,440
And I kept wondering

917
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,199
why city folks

918
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,880
get to live in such big houses,

919
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,559
while we only paint walls for others.

920
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,400
It never made sense to me.

921
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:00,719
Never.

922
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:02,880
The foreman said

923
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,760
people should accept fate.

924
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,760
I accepted it.

925
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,519
This is what my life will always be.

926
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:13,440
Son,

927
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,119
you're different.

928
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,760
You've made it

929
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,639
to university,

930
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,440
and are about to start graduate school.

931
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,039
You'll settle in the city

932
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,000
and change your fate.

933
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,119
If you succeed,

934
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:34,360
my years

935
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,519
of painting walls

936
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,800
would be worth it.

937
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,400
Lin Fang

938
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,320
is a good wife.

939
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,920
I'm very satisfied with her.

940
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,079
She is thrifty,

941
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,480
respectful to elders,

942
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,039
and never complains.

943
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,599
She is such a good wife.

944
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,800
What a pity.

945
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,880
Feelings can't be forced.

946
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,079
Son,

947
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:17,000
remember.

948
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,679
Since ancient times,

949
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,599
marriage

950
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,480
has always been a lifelong commitment.

951
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,440
Don't hold her back.

952
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,760
You're educated

953
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,199
and know more than I do.

954
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,960
But

955
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,599
there's one thing

956
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:37,880
I need to tell you.

957
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,760
Whatever you do,

958
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,199
don't hesitate.

959
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,559
Just do it.

960
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,360
Don't overthink

961
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,960
about anything else.

962
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,119
You just move forward with all efforts.

963
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,920
If anyone blocks you,

964
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
compete with them.

965
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,000
We scare nothing.

966
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,840
I get it, Dad.

967
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,639
So do you know

968
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,039
who's blocking you now?

969
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,320
Who?

970
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,800
Me.

971
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,719
Look.

972
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,199
You want to treat me

973
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,320
and get more money.

974
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,840
It's all holding you back.

975
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,719
You're my dad.

976
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,239
So what if I am?

977
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,679
Not even your dad.

978
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,239
Listen carefully.

979
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,239
Stop treating me.

980
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:34,599
What's the point of being cured?

981
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,719
I'd still be a cripple.

982
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,280
Except for spending money,

983
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,360
what else can I do?

984
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,639
I'm a burden to you.

985
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,400
If you're truly filial,

986
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,000
find me a peaceful way

987
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,039
and let me die.

988
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,599
Otherwise,

989
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,760
I'll drink paraquat.

990
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,320
Dad, listen to me.

991
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,079
Did you

992
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,039
hear what I said?

993
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:00,800
Don't give the money to your mom,

994
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,440
or use it to build a house back home.

995
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,239
Every penny should be spent

996
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,480
where it truly matters.

997
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:10,000
Consider these things carefully.

998
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,280
Be grateful

999
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,480
to your teachers

1000
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,360
and superiors.

1001
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,400
Thank them

1002
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,039
for enabling your graduate studies.

1003
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,039
Repay them when you can.

1004
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,760
In the future,

1005
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,360
stay at school as a teacher.

1006
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,599
Staying as a teacher

1007
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,480
isn't that easy.

1008
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:34,400
Of course, it's not.

1009
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,599
Changing fate

1010
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,000
isn't that easy.

1011
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,559
Once you become a teacher,

1012
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,000
it's not just a job.

1013
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,599
Your status and position will change.

1014
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,480
It's hard.

1015
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,960
Keep going, no matter how hard it is.

1016
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:48,679
Alright.

1017
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,400
Dad,

1018
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,639
I'll do as you say.

1019
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,559
But treat

1020
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,480
the illness first.

1021
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,039
I can

1022
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,239
figure the money out.

1023
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,199
Are you deaf or something?

1024
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,599
What's on your mind?

1025
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,159
Overthink everything.

1026
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,079
How can you achieve anything this way?

1027
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,239
Remember.

1028
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:12,039
If you don't even care about my life,

1029
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,280
you will care about nothing.

I find she's genuinely kind.

1085
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,440
Do you like her

1086
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,360

00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:14,679

she's so rich

1091
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,920

00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:47,480
is in danger around Zeng Jie?

1110
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,360
The fire last year

1111
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,320
erased Wei's traces.

1112
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,719

00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,920

Two birds with one stone.

1116
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:57,360
And the car crash.

1117
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,920
Zeng Jie just serviced his car,

1118
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,840
yet brakes failed.

1119
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,800
I wish you had evidence.

1120
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:05,480
You never trust me.

1121
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,239
It's not about trust.

1122
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,719
I truly hope there's evidence.

1123
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,639
You've got

1124
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,400
no evidence

1125
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:12,800

1126
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,239
at all.

1127
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,519
If I took the case,

1128
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,199
how can I help?

1129
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:16,760
I can't just

1130
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,840
arrest Zeng Jie and say

1131
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:18,840
I suspect you

1132
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,679
killed Liu Wei

1133
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:20,960
and Lin Fang,

1134
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:22,039
and will kill your wife,

1135
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:22,639
Bai Xiaoling.

1136
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:23,840
Don't ask me why.

1137
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:25,239
I deduced everything.

1138
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:27,880
I'm certain I'll find it.

1139
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,119
Wei.

1140
00:44:07,072 --> 00:44:09,792
His primary determination

1141
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:10,848
is to cross social class.

1142
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,512
He aims at social class.

1143
00:44:12,512 --> 00:44:14,582
The entire story
is about class transcendence.

1144
00:44:14,976 --> 00:44:18,528
If they are dissatisfied,
we can still negotiate

1145
00:44:18,528 --> 00:44:20,576
to earn wages for a few more days.

1146
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,720
That's already good enough.

1147
00:44:25,472 --> 00:44:26,592
Wait, that's not right.

1148
00:44:28,096 --> 00:44:30,656
Some students say
I'm overly obsessed with polishing.

1149
00:44:31,392 --> 00:44:34,016
Actually, they can't comprehend
the polishing process.

1150
00:44:36,864 --> 00:44:40,576
I regularly exfoliate too.

1151
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:44,704
Find me when you decide.

1152
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:51,680
You deleted me before.

1153
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,616
How about adding me back?

1154
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:57,792

00:45:00,192 --> 00:45:02,528
Do you know why
I have to eat these every day?

1156
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,560
Every swallow is torture for me.

1157
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,864
Because I don't want my legs
to completely atrophy.

1158
00:45:08,864 --> 00:45:10,560
I don't want my body to...

1159

I-I've completely fallen apart.

00:45:15,808 --> 00:45:18,798
So you're sharp-eyed
and quick-tongued, huh?

1161
00:45:19,264 --> 00:45:20,256
Curse them for cutting.

1162
00:45:20,256 --> 00:45:21,888
Curse them for not letting us cut.

1163
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:24,768
Cutting in.

1164
00:45:25,024 --> 00:45:26,656
It's not far from where we live.

1165
00:45:31,072 --> 00:45:31,968
Sorry, one more time.

1166
00:45:33,216 --> 00:45:34,176
Enough talk!

1167
