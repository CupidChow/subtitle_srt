00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:33,088
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,280
Do you know about Zeng Jie?

4
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes, I do.

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,599
Come tell me more.

6
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,680
I know there are several

7
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,640
who graduated

8
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,319
but didn't stay in Caorong City.

9
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,159
He's really

10
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,359
a busy man.

11
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,400
He's a creep.

12
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,640
Dude,

13
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,000
how do you know so much

14
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
about his dirty secrets?

15
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,239
To be honest,

16
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,959
my girlfriend back in school

17
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,840
got tricked by him.

18
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,519
My ex attended one

19
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,239
of his classes,

20
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,079
added his WeChat,

21
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,239
and got invited to an exhibition.

22
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,640
She got infatuated by him.

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,640
Later she started

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,519
dating him secretly.

25
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,799
In the end...

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,520
This Zeng Jie

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,599
didn't use clever tricks.

28
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,080
Just hit on his students.

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,680
Back then,

30
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,840
most guys were poor.

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,039
He spent money

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,080
we couldn't afford

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,840
to dazzle those girls.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,960
Does he specifically target

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,680
girls from

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,039
poor families?

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,680
Well, exactly!

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,800
But

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,800
those girls we met

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,240
didn't look poor at all.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,879
Many people nowadays

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,039
love pretending.

43
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,039
The poorer, the flashier they dress.

44
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,680
Just like I used to be.

45
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,120
So, Zeng Jie

46
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,520
targets them?

47
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,639
There might be exceptions.

48
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,240
I heard,

49
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,520
just rumors,

50
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,360
that our principal's daughter

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,719
is involved with him too.

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,240
The principal's daughter?

53
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,759
Chen Yuhe, I think.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,719
She's pretty.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,479
She has a cushy job at school.

56
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,159
She seems to have

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
a relationship with him.

58
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,800
She definitely isn't

59
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,120
the poor type.

60
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,599
Dude,

61
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,400
think it carefully.

62
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,800
Do you know anyone

63
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,680
close to Chen Yuhe?

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,439
I need to inquire.

65
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,199
Okay.

66
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,159
Dude,

67
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,439
want to take down him?

68
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,280
Did he

69
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,800
snatch your girlfriend?

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,680
Where did you find this guy?

71
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,400
I got in Caorong University's

72
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,080
alumni group

73
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,159
and knew him there.

74
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,800
He absolutely loathes

75
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,840
Zeng Jie.

76
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,039
His ex

77
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,840
and every girl

78
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,520
he fancied

79
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,800
had flings with Zeng Jie.

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,919
I have night duty. No.

81
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,479
Go on.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,560
So,

83
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,840
what's your conclusion?

84
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,719
Zeng Jie is quite busy.

85
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,360
He hit on

86
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,240
so many girls.

87
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,159
I bet

88
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
what this guy knows

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,039
is just part of it.

90
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,159
But all these girls

91
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,080
share one trait.

92
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,560
Being poor?

93
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,240
Right.

94
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,439
These girls,

95
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,199
Liu Wei,

96
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,919
and Lin Fang

97
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,800
are from

98
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,680
humble origins.

99
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,680
He targets

100
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,439
such girls.

101
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,280
Using his status and position,

102
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,879
plus small favors,

103
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,039
he preys on these young,

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,319
inexperienced girls,

105
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,120
making them

106
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,159
believe he's a good guy.

107
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,520
Lin Fang probably doesn't count.

108
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,240
Zeng Jie wasn't rich back then.

109
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,439
But his wife

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,039
and that rich lady

111
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,319
are both wealthy.

112
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,599
And Chen Yuhe,

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,472
the principal's daughter.

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,319
This is his trick.

115
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,319
He manipulates women

116
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,079
who's useful to him

117
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,439
and treats those young girls

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,639
as playthings.

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,839
Let me tell you.

120
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,480
He's worse than a creep.

121
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,360
He is pure evil.

122
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,279
He understands girls well.

123
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,519
That's why he targets

124
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,240
these simple and innocent girls.

125
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,120
He knows what girls need most

126
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,759
to establish

127
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,959
themselves in society.

128
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,000
He knows the trick

129
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,800
to deceive them.

130
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,079
So you think these

131
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,639
deceived girls don't know about it,

132
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,480
don't resist,

133
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,279
or seek revenge?

134
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,680
But Liu Wei fought back.

135
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,600
And Lin Fang.

136
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,040
I thought Lin Fang's death

137
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,399
is connected to Zeng Jie.

138
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,839
Just a thought.

139
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,680
I know.

140
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,720
We need evidence.

141
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:48,920
Right,

142
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,000
you mentioned in your message

143
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,440
that Zeng Jie visited Japan
during his postgraduate studies.

144
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,792
Yes.

145
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,360
A girl got tricked

146
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,680
into going to Japan by him.

147
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Wait.

148
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,839
Postgraduate?

149
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,040
(Oucheng Garden)
What you mentioned

150
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:00,879
happened three

151
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,759
or four years ago.

152
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,959
But actually,

153
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,079
he went there three times.

154
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,368
The first two trips were
during his postgraduate studies.

155
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:07,319
Logically speaking,

156
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,079
he should've been poor and needed money.

157
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,120
Which was when he was dating

158
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,079
Lin Fang.

159
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,160
He didn't go there with Lin Fang?

160
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,319
Not sure.

161
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,959
But Lin Fang never went abroad.

162
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
Sports car rich lady?

163
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,040
Maybe

164
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,000
Zeng Jie went

165
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,839
with that rich lady.

166
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,680
Don't you realize

167
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,759
your thoughts are messy?

168
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,560
Why are you digging so deep

169
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:28,920
into him?

170
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,319
For a case like this,

171
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,879
we need to dig deep into him.

172
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,040
If we understand

173
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,800
Zeng Jie well,

174
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,759
we can deduce

175
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,439
his motives

176
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,839
for committing crimes.

177
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,199
You've watched

178
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,120
too many crime shows.

179
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:40,959
Wrong.

180
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,319
That's not true.

181
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,519
This is literally my job.

182
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
My current followers

183
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,519
aren't many,

184
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,360
but you can't doubt

185
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,160
my expertise.

186
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,240
Moreover,

187
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,199
my video...

188
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,279
Hold on.

189
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,600
Look.

190
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,839
A fan's calling.

191
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,680
Hello, Tracy.

192
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,040
Can't we talk over the phone?

193
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
Tomorrow afternoon?

194
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,920
Alright, sure.

195
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,040
She wants to see you?

196
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,639
Regarding Lin Fang,

197
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,120
she wants to discuss with me

198
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,040
about deduction

199
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,879
and analysis.

200
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,160
We'll meet tomorrow.

201
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,079
Impressive!

202
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,079
This fan

203
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,879
is a professional?

204
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,240
We're all amateurs here.

205
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,639
You're the professional,

206
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,319
bro.

207
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,279
I have things to do.

208
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,800
Just drop by for a coffee.

209
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,759
I'll leave soon.

210
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,319
Why telling me this?

211
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,639
I didn't ask you out.

212
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,720
Just happened to run into you.

213
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm here every day.

214
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,000
Is running into me rare?

215
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,480
Can I ask you a question?

216
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,639
Go ahead.

217
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,920
I might not answer.

218
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,079
You come out every day.

219
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,639
Doesn't your husband worry?

220
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,000
He trusts you that much?

221
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,720
Shouldn't he

222
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,519
trust me that much?

223
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,040
So you trust him that much too?

224
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,040
Why do you worry

225
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,399
about me and my husband?

226
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,720
My husband is an artist,

227
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,879
the youngest professor

228
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,000
at Caorong University.

229
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,160
Certainly, many women

230
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,319
admire and like him.

231
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't you mind?

232
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,959
I mind others being better than me.

233
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,920
But why do I mind

234
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,160
others being worse?

235
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,240
Makes sense.

236
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,560
Are you interested

237
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,600
in my husband

238
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,920
or in me?

239
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,040
I'm Just asking.

240
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,160
Fine.

241
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,720
Then I'll ask too.

242
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,480
You mentioned

243
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,000
your ex has disappeared.

244
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,279
Have you found her?

245
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,040
You said

246
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,040
you don't love her

247
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,720
anymore, right?

248
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,759
Right.

249
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,279
You have a good memory.

250
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,439
But still searching.

251
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,959
Why?

252
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,399
I don't want her

253
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,879
to just disappear.

254
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,879
I don't want her

255
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,600
to disappear from this world.

256
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,519
Disappearing from my life

257
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,079
is nothing.

258
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,759
Will your husband come
looking for you here?

259
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,240
You should leave.

260
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,440
Save me the explanations.

261
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,279
Why are you here?

262
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,600
Had business nearby.

263
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,000
Just dropped by.

264
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,519
With a friend?

265
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,480
A pour-over and an iced latte.

266
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,519
Sometimes,

267
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,840
I'd even order milk and sit

268
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,919
all afternoon.

269
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,240
Often drink multiple cups.

270
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,960
Don't drink mine.

271
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,080
You usually

272
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,200
sit here alone?

273
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Of course, alone.

274
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,360
But I don't always sit here.

275
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,279
With no friends?

276
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,399
What for?

277
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,080
To push my wheelchair?

278
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,440
Just thought you might be lonely.

279
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,799
You could invite

280
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,720
your friends

281
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,080
to go shopping with you.

282
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,519
I don't want

283
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,879
to burden others

284
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,679
with my inconvenience.

285
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,919
So lately,

286
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,279
you've been alone.

287
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,360
Haven't seen others?

288
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,559
There are staff and customers here.

289
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,559
And I pass countless people

290
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,399
on the streets.

291
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,519
How could I not see others?

292
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,679
I mean...

293
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,679
Zeng Jie,

294
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,200
just get to

295
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,679
the point.

296
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,919
You suddenly

297
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,000
mentioned Liu Wei before.

298
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,720
Why?

299
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:51,679
Because

300
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,679
I suddenly thought of her.

301
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,879
Why?

302
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,919
Starting today,

303
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,039
let's just forget about this.

304
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,559
Don't ever mention it,

305
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,000
unless we want a divorce.

306
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,639
This dirty secret

307
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,159
stays buried forever.

308
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,879
Want a divorce?

309
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,039
I'm just curious

310
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,279
why you suddenly

311
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,600
mentioned someone

312
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,879
we haven't mentioned for over a year.

313
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,759
What exactly happened

314
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,120
that made you think of her?

315
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,120
Or someone

316
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,360
made you think of her?

317
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,360
Calm down.

318
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,799
I just can't figure it out.

319
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,879
I don't want to mention her.

320
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,039
Then why?

321
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,720
Liu Wei had a boyfriend.

322
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,440
Do you know?

323
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,519
Why would I know?

324
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,279
I know.

325
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,399
Liu Wei told me

326
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,000
her ex-boyfriend

327
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,559
was a video creator,

328
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,279
named Big Hui.

329
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,600
What kind of videos?

330
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,879
Shall I go check?

331
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,120
Anyway, that matter's settled.

332
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,200
Can't become a barrier

333
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,120
between us anymore.

334
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,519
Mentioning her,

335
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,879
for you,

336
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,360
for me,

337
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,000
isn't any good thing.

338
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,080
But

339
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,639
you mentioned her today.

340
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,039
I just don't want this matter

341
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,039
to affect our life again.

342
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,080
Has it?

343
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,240
I just hope...

344
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,320
Between us,

345
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,039
there's nothing left to be affected.

346
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,440
Zeng Jie,

347
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,919
I don't think

348
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,720
you really care about our life.

349
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,080
Anything

350
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,399
affecting your life?

351
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,159
Most of my life

352
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,519
is at work.

353
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,240
Nothing to be affected.

354
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,519
Good then.

355
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,360
Hope there's nothing

356
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,720
unpleasant

357
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,600
to affect Professor Zeng's work.

358
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,120
I said it wrong.

359
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,840
Associate Professor.

360
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,320
(Lin Shan)
(Emergency.)

361
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,679
Go attend to your matters.

362
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,639
Don't neglect your work.

363
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,480
Thanks for dropping by.

364
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,600
Need me to pick you up later?

365
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,080
Shouldn't you

366
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,639
be working overtime at the studio?

367
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,480
No need.

368
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,200
Fine.

369
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,480
I'll go pay the bill for you.

370
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,759
She comes here every day?

371
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,960
Yes.

372
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,960
Always alone?

373
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,759
Yes.

374
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,720
Well done!

375
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,320
Is it necessary?

376
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,799
Making it look like an affair.

377
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,480
When are you leaving?

378
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,879
I can stay a bit longer.

379
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,639
Okay.

380
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,600
Let's talk.

381
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,679
About what?

382
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,919
Change your clothes.

383
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:44,759
Go somewhere else.

384
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,200
Where to?

385
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,600
When my husband was parking,

386
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,600
and you saw him.

387
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,679
You know him?

388
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,279
You're investigating him?

389
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,120
Did you approach me

390
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,559
to investigate him?

391
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,480
Yes.

392
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,840
Your ex-girlfriend was Liu Wei, right?

393
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,480
What's her relationship with my husband?

394
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,240
I don't know.

395
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,320
But I'm certain they're connected.

396
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,519
Did Liu Wei tell you?

397
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,120
I figured it out myself.

398
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,960
This is

399
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,279
an imitation of my husband's

400
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:28,960
work.

401
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Liu Wei made this.

402
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,440
Though I don't understand ceramics,

403
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,679
this plate was poorly made.

404
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:38,600
That's why Liu Wei

405
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,159
couldn't be my husband's student.

406
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,360
She's not.

407
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,799
Yet she once told me something.

408
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,399
Pursue perfection
and approach perfection.

409
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:49,960
No blemish flaws allowed.

410
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,279
In my opinion,

411
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,440
she must've encountered

412
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,799
someone who said these to her.

413
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,080
Maybe she attended my husband's

414
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,039
classes or seminars.

415
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,360
But after her disappearance,

416
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,360
Zeng Jie's studio in Shuiyuan Village

417
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,240
caught fire.

418
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,720
Everything was burned down.

419
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,879
When my husband's studio caught fire,

420
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,879
I was there.

421
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,159
It truly was an accident.

422
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,879
But accidents can be engineered.

423
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,799
Exactly.

424
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,279
But many friends were present that day.

425
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,200
He couldn't

426
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,559
possibly start the fire then.

427
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:21,759
I had

428
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,039
visited your husband,

429
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,519
but found nothing.

430
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,519
Yet Wei did disappear.

431
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,159
I had

432
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,039
to investigate Zeng Jie.

433
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,039
Therefore,

434
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,519
I know many things about him.

435
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,000
Many things?

436
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,399
Right.

437
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,159
He had multiple affairs.

438
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,320
To be honest,

439
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,919
he's never truly faithful.

440
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,279
He married you

441
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
because of your wealth.

442
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,600
He wanted your family's money.

443
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,639
My parents are indeed well-off.

444
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,960
But he built his success from scratch.

445
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,559
That's what everyone thinks.

446
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,120
You told me

447
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,840
about how you met Zeng Jie.

448
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,000
But I believe

449
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,640
it was a scheme

450
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,759
that he carefully planned,

451
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,240
to make you gradually

452
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,519
accept him.

453
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,079
In that case,

454
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,640
I am such a fool.

455
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,279
Or rather,

456
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,279
Zeng Jie is too cunning.

457
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,839
Do you know Lin Fang?

458
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,799
Who?

459
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,079
You don't know her?

460
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,440
A saleswoman at the Artist Village,

461
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,359
average background.

462
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,240
She was Zeng Jie's ex-girlfriend,

463
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,559
or rather,

464
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,480
his ex-wife.

465
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,480
Are you kidding me?

466
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,240
In rural areas,

467
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,200
people host a wedding banquet.

468
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,759
Know this custom, right?

469
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,920
Come on.

470
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,960
Congrats!

471
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:50,759
Here.

472
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,839
Here.

473
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,240
Eat up.

474
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,240
Alright.

475
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,519
Get wedding candies.

476
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,799
Get wedding candies.

477
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,200
Come on.

478
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,119
Seems you truly didn't know.

479
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,279
I've checked.

480
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,000
Lin Fang is dead.

481
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,640
The timing of her death

482
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,359
is when you and Zeng Jie

483
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,519
started dating.

484
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,759
I told you I had business today.

485
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,160
I need to meet someone

486
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,759
who might know about Lin Fang.

487
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,599
A young, healthy girl

488
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,440
would never die suddenly.

489
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,000
If Lin Fang's death

490
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,000
is related to Zeng Jie,

491
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,799
then I'm even more certain

492
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,400
Wei's disappearance

493
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,240
must also involve him.

494
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,079
Why not go to the police?

495
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,400
These are just my deductions.

496
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,519
I have no evidence.

497
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,200
So you're speculating

498
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,000
that my husband is a killer

499
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,880
or even a serial killer?

500
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
I have another deduction.

501
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,200
Zeng Jie is someone who worked hard

502
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,440
to make a name for himself.

503
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
He tried hard

504
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,640
to change his fate.

505
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,720
Before you, he met a rich lady

506
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,920
driving sports cars.

507
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,279
I'm still investigating her.

508
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,400
But clearly,

509
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
their relationship

510
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
didn't last.

511
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,240
Then he met you

512
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,839
and married you.

513
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,039
He got financial support

514
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,480
from your family.

515
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,240
From being an assistant professor,

516
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,279
to becoming a famous
young artist overnight.

517
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,200
He's been

518
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,279
using you.

519
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,160
He doesn't love you.

520
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,319
That's why after marriage,

521
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,079
he kept

522
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,519
having affairs.

523
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,559
When you were still physically able,

524
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,720
he didn't go too far,

525
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,559
avoid being caught.

526
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,000
During that period,

527
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,119
Wei met him.

528
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,000
Wei had a fiery personality,

529
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,519
refused to be his plaything.

530
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,359
So he had to silence her.

531
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,759
After that,

532
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,039
he increasingly felt

533
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,200
you hindered

534
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,559
his affairs.

535
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:34,960
Therefore,

536
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,440
on the night of Zeng Jie's studio fire,

537
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,160
he claimed

538
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,079
to search for you on the third floor.

539
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,799
Because

540
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,039
he assumed you were there.

541
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,559
But, you weren't.

542
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,720
What if you were?

543
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,279
Would he help you escape

544
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,839
or block your escape?

545
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,279
Zeng Jie had fireproof equips

546
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,039
prepared in advance.

547
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,400
People usually don't maintain

548
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,160
such precautions.

549
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,759
You survived the fire,

550
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:56,440
then

551
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,440
got a car accident.

552
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,519
You mentioned

553
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,240
before the crash,
he took the car for maintenance,

554
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:01,680
right?

555
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,319
After interacting with you,

556
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,000
I believe you're a decent person.

557
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,279
I thought to fully investigate

558
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,200
everything first

559
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,119
before telling you the complete truth.

560
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,640
Big Hui,

561
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,279
thank you for your concern.

562
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,079
But I must tell you

563
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,440
you don't know Zeng Jie.

564
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,079
He's not that horrible

565
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,039
as you imagine.

566
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,799
The real horror is you being trapped

567
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,960
in lies.

568
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,680
I'm disabled,

569
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,519
already living

570
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,680
without hope.

571
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:38,440
If the truth is this cruel,

572
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,720
I'd rather be trapped in lies.

573
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,720
Really?

574
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,680
You addressed him "My husband",

575
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,319
but now you used "Zeng Jie".

576
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,839
This shows deep down

577
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,000
you've started

578
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
to believe what I said.

579
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:55,880
Big Hui,

580
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:57,960
I really

581
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,759
don't want to lose you as my friend.

582
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,920
You must realize

583
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:01,759
someone like me

584
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:02,880
has no real friends.

585
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,920
Zeng Jie has stomach issues?

586
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,359
You are wrong.

587
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,240
His stomach is healthier than mine.

588
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,240
Tomorrow,

589
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,640
will you still come to the café?

590
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:23,759
I don't know.

591
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,640
Let me think.

592
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:28,839
I don't know

593
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,960
how to face someone

594
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,680
who thinks my husband's a murderer

595
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,240
and keeps investigating him.

596
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,519
If tomorrow,

597
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,680
I don't go to the café,

598
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,039
Big Hui,

599
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,359
let's not meet again.

600
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,680
Give me another chance.

601
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,519
Two days.

602
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,680
If you don't show up

603
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,920
in two days,

604
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,440
I'll leave you alone.

605
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,480
(He claims to be Lin Fang's classmate,)

606
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,680
but Lin Fang

607
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,680
went to elementary school
in the village,

608
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,160
middle school in town.

609
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,079
Her classmates

610
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,359
all came from nearby towns.

611
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,440
There's no such person.

612
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,880
So,

613
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,680
he's definitely lying.

614
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,680
But

615
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,240
the clothes he dressed

616
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,039
made me really nervous.

617
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,559
Who is he?

618
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,240
How should I know?

619
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
Lately,

620
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,880
I'm under assessment.

621
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:32,839
That's it then.

622
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,839
Must be your rivals
trying to sabotage you.

623
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,079
Ridiculous!

624
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,640
Why sabotage me?

625
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,400
Fine.

626
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,519
In that case,

627
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,880
if someone asks me anything,

628
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,839
I'll tell him the truth then.

629
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,519
So,

630
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,519
what did you tell him?

631
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,160
He knows about

632
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,400
your wedding banquet with Lin Fang.

633
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,000
But I told him

634
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,240
it doesn't mean
you two got the certificate.

635
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,839
And

636
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,319
you've been separated
from my sister for years.

637
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,000
She's been dead for ages.

638
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,240
Died from illness.

639
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:35,759
Right.

640
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Yes, exactly.

641
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,359
But

642
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,519
he called me again

643
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,960
this morning

644
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,039
and said

645
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,319
to meet

646
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,640
tomorrow for another talk.

647
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,640
Must've found something.

648
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,079
Think about it.

649
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,359
I didn't even know him,

650
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,039
yet he tracked me down

651
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:56,880
in my hometown.

652
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,440
Weird.

653
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:02,799
My history with Fang

654
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,079
ended years ago.

655
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,720
People around me now

656
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,799
shouldn't know about this.

657
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,279
If others find out

658
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,880
about the wedding banquet,

659
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,599
would it affect

660
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,720
your assessment

661
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,880
in university?

662
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,000
No.

663
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,359
Not really.

664
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,599
What if your wife finds out?

665
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,000
Nothing big.

666
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Then,

667
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,680
if he's investigating

668
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,200
how Lin Fang died.

669
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,680
Shan,

670
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,799
Fang...

671
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,319
You know it.

672
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,279
She had heart disease.

673
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,640
Heart disease?

674
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,319
I don't know.

675
00:24:59,279 --> 00:24:59,920
Shan,

676
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,079
well...

677
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,599
What do you mean?

678
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,079
Scared?

679
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,079
Not at all.

680
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:12,839
Shan,

681
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,559
all these years,

682
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,160
I've done

683
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,079
everything I should.

684
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,839
I know.

685
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,759
You're my brother-in-law.

686
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,720
I have to

687
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,480
protect you.

688
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,160
Right.

689
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:32,920
Besides,

690
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,240
I'd come to you

691
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,799
once trouble comes.

692
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:38,920
Yes, Shan.

693
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:42,400
Shan,

694
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,920
tell me more about

695
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,559
that guy.

696
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,759
He wore a black jacket

697
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,559
with some blue,

698
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,759
with a zipper here.

699
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,559
Looks about

700
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,119
in his thirties.

701
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,319
Not very tall.

702
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,920
Looks energetic.

703
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,480
Take a look

704
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,359
if it is him.

705
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,079
Not sure.

706
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,279
Can't remember.

707
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
A while back,

708
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,880
I just gave you

709
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
100,000 yuan.

710
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,559
That's for the house renovation.

711
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,240
But

712
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,839
I want to start a business.

713
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,000
Open a livestock farm.

714
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,079
What do you think?

715
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,279
How much?

716
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,400
Initial investment is

717
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,680
around 500,000 yuan.

718
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,480
How much then?

719
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,440
I don't need your help.

720
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,200
I'll figure it out myself.

721
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,319
Don't, Shan.

722
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,640
Look,

723
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:48,960
you start a business,

724
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,039
and I have to support you.

725
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:54,839
This money

726
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,640
counts as my investment.

727
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,359
Lately,

728
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,160
I'm tight on cash.

729
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,400
I'll transfer you 50,000 later.

730
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:19,880
Phone.

731
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's him.

732
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,960
Yes, that's the guy.

733
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,960
You know him?

734
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,400
I don't know him.

735
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,440
But he's been

736
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,599
causing me trouble lately.

737
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,200
Weird.

738
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,960
How did he know

739
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,880
about Lin Fang?

740
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,799
Besides us two,

741
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,119
who else knows

742
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,319
about Lin Fang?

743
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,680
Those in Artist Village

744
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,559
might know.

745
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:05,519
But this happened

746
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,279
many years ago.

747
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,839
How did he

748
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,920
dig this up?

749
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,200
Just a wedding banquet.

750
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,200
Didn't you say it's nothing?

751
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,519
I'm worried he'll dig deeper.

752
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,160
But what if...

753
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:32,759
(Video Surveillance)
Here's 20,000.

754
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,319
I'll switch cards.

755
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,319
He must've found out

756
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,319
I worked at Artist Village before.

757
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,680
That's not a secret anyway.

758
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,200
He's gone to Artist Village.

759
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,119
Someone blabbed.

760
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,799
If he

761
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,680
comes to you again...

762
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,799
I know what to do.

763
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,680
When have I ever

764
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,039
messed up your plans?

765
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,599
I always support you.

766
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,440
Check the bag behind.

767
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,039
Ms. Juan.

768
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,920
Ms. Juan, this...

769
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,920
I...

770
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,680
You need 400,000 yuan, right?

771
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,880
After you

772
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,960
finish painting,

773
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,279
it'll be too late.

774
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:32,480
No, Ms. Juan.

775
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,880
How can I accept

776
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,799
this much money?

777
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,240
This...

778
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,039
It's not about the amount,

779
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,000
but timing.

780
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,440
You'll know

781
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,640
400,000 yuan

782
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,400
means nothing.

783
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,319
But right now,

784
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,640
it could collapse you.

785
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,839
Made you yam porridge.

786
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,920
Feeling better?

787
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,519
Added some ribs.

788
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,440
Eat it

789
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,359
while it's hot.

790
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,279
Here.

791
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,039
Take this.

792
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,079
I asked my boss

793
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,640
to pay me two months in advance.

794
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,960
Plus some savings.

795
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,440
Use this first.

796
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,000
The hospital

797
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,799
has been pushing you for payment.

798
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,200
Just take it.

799
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,839
I'm going home

800
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,079
to discuss with my brother.

801
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,799
The house back home

802
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,400
could still sell for a good price.

803
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,599
It's okay.

804
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,759
Everything will pass.

805
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,119
Things

806
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,519
will get better.

807
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,240
Definitely.

808
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,079
I need

809
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,759
to go to school

810
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
to meet my teacher

811
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:20,960
in the evening.

812
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,599
Want me to go with you?

813
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,880
No need.

814
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,480
Tonight,

815
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,440
I'll stay at the dorm

816
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,359
and not come back.

817
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:31,400
You

818
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,640
need to get proper rest.

819
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,079
Water.

820
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,640
Stomachache again?

821
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,559
You're so young,

822
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,880
how's your stomach this bad?

823
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,279
Maybe because of

824
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,160
the seafood yesterday.

825
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,720
You need

826
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
treatment.

827
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,759
Don't ignore it.

828
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,599
Or, you can't

829
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,799
enjoy delicious food.

830
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,920
Give me

831
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,839
your passport.

832
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,599
I don't have a passport.

833
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,319
Then go apply for one tomorrow.

834
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,599
After you get it,

835
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,279
I'll arrange your visa.

836
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,599
I'll take you to Japan this month-end.

837
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,480
What for?

838
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:38,880
To eat sashimi.

839
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,519
Japan has the highest number of people

840
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,519
suffering from stomach diseases
in the world.

841
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:47,119
They're experts in treating them.

842
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,279
I'll take you for treatment.

843
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,279
Don't let this pain

844
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,440
annoy you.

845
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,519
Take this.

846
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,319
The latest model.

847
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,079
Ms. Juan,

848
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,240
mine still works fine.

849
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,719
It works fine.

850
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,519
But you can

851
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,360
still use a finer one.

852
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,440
Okay.

853
00:34:30,963 --> 00:34:34,944
When you talk, this and that circle...

854
00:34:42,131 --> 00:34:42,848
Because...

855
00:34:46,035 --> 00:34:46,880
Cut!

856
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:48,508
Because...

857
00:34:51,443 --> 00:34:52,704
My fault. Sorry.

858
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,504

Conflict will lead to a crack,

862
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,928
so the greater the conflict,
the bigger the crack.

863
00:35:10,016 --> 00:35:12,086
Just like this cracked wall.

864
00:35:12,992 --> 00:35:14,419
Sorry, I said the wrong line.

865
00:35:14,419 --> 00:35:16,288
One more. Sorry.

866
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,624
Later I learned from others

867
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:22,112
when I was little... When I was two...

868
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:24,384
- Sorry, my fault. One more.
- Okay.

869
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,744
Let's go to a hot spring
on the weekend with my friends.

870
00:35:28,704 --> 00:35:29,632
Where to?

871
00:35:32,768 --> 00:35:35,008
When have I ever caused trouble?

872
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:37,088
Yesterday, someone...

873
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:39,032
Sorry, one more.

millet porridge,

877
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:54,880
and yam porridge... One more.

878
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:57,984
My sister cooked him

879
00:35:58,496 --> 00:36:01,056
millet porridge and yam porridge...

880
00:36:01,216 --> 00:36:06,016
My sister cooked him millet porridge,
yam porridge and pork rib soup.

881
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:08,322
Hey.

882
00:36:12,224 --> 00:36:15,008
That's for the house.

883
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:19,296
I want to open a livestock farm.

884
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:20,544
What do you think?

885
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,240
How much do you want?

886
00:36:23,136 --> 00:36:26,560
Initial investment is
around 500,000 yuan.

887
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,680
How much then?

888
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,744
