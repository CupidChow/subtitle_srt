=Episode 7=

3
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,640
Ma'am.

4
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,200
Is this Lin Fang's home?

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,519
Lin Fang is dead.

6
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,480
I know.

7
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,840
Her family members?

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,159
She only had an older brother.

9
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,439
He is never home.

10
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,760
When did she pass away?

11
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,319
About four or five years ago.

12
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,719
She did odd jobs out of town.

13
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
Her brother visited her once

14
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,199
and said that

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,400
she had died of illness.

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,319
He didn't

17
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,719
even bring her corpse back.

18
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,159
Do you know if Lin Fang

19
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,439
was dating someone?

20
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,759
Dating someone?

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,120
She was married.

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,120
M-Married?

23
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
Just one year before she died,

24
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,879
she came back here

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,240
and held a wedding banquet.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Her family was

27
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,960
quite poor.

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,240
So was her husband.

29
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,439
That guy couldn't

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,719
even afford

31
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,280
the bride price.
Her brother was furious...

32
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,879
Take a look.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,439
Is this

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,319
her husband?

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,360
I can't tell.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,599
Go ask her brother.

37
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,759
Do you know

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,080
what her brother does now?

39
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,879
In your city folks' terms,

40
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,159
I'm a freelancer.

41
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,560
You don't farm?

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,759
For what?

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,719
For some petty income?
I leased out the land.

44
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,520
So you do nothing at all?

45
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm planning

46
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,800
my business venture.

47
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,879
You say you're Lin Fang's classmate.

48
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,159
Why haven't I seen you before?

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,639
I've never met you, sir.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,960
My sister died years ago.

51
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,840
Why are you here now?

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,879
I want to ask you something.

53
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,159
How did Lin Fang die?

54
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,280
My sister had a tragic life.

55
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,840
When she was ten,

56
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,960
our parents died.

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,599
After middle school,

58
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,919
she went to work.

59
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,719
Then she died in her twenties.

60
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,520
Didn't she get married?

61
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,520
Yeah.

62
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,960
She married some guy

63
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,199
who was quite poor.

64
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,000
No bride price.

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,599
I supported her all those years,

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,159
but got nothing in return.

67
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,479
She married Zeng Jie, right?

68
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,879
You know him?

69
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,639
I've heard.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,639
The artist.

71
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,959
Yeah.

72
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,519
He's no country bumpkin

73
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,519
anymore.

74
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,360
Now they call him Master.

75
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,000
He's some big shot now.

76
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,759
When did Lin Fang

77
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,120
marry Zeng Jie?

78
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,319
It's been four years.

79
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
My sister died in 2015,

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,439
less than a year

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,560
after the wedding.

82
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,759
We country folk hold banquets first.

83
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,079
They didn't even get
the marriage certificates.

84
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,959
So technically,

85
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,279
Master Zeng could remarry

86
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,600
without it counting

87
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,839
as a second marriage.

88
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,879
Are you still

89
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,959
in contact with Zeng Jie?

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,920
He's a professor now.

91
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,639
Why would he talk to me?

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,399
But he was your brother-in-law.

93
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,519
How could he cut ties?

94
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,240
How exactly did Lin Fang die?

95
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,839
Aren't you her classmate?

96
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,839
Don't you know

97
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,519
she had congenital heart disease?

98
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,160
Oh, right...

99
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,480
Sir.

100
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,560
So, was Zeng Jie good to Lin Fang?

101
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,560
How do I put it?

102
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,040
If he wasn't good,

103
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,720
why would my sister marry him?

104
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
She married him

105
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,000
without the bride price

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,839
and threatened

107
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,480
to cut ties with me when I opposed.

108
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,240
But then again,

109
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,160
I can't recall anything
he's done for her.

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,439
My sister always took care of him.

111
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,639
Zeng Jie has a congenital

112
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,560
stomach disorders.

113
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,439
My sister was always making

114
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,639
different meals for him.

115
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,839
Millet, pumpkin, yam

116
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,160
porridge, pork rib soup...

117
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,319
But Zeng Jie has always

118
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,839
been popular with women.

119
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
Just a year after my sister passed away,

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,079
he found another woman.

121
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,839
She is so pretty.

122
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:00,920
Sir.

123
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,720
Do you know if Zeng Jie

124
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,920
was seeing someone else?

125
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,560
A rich lady?

126
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,000
Why are you asking about him?

127
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,439
What's it to you?

128
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,519
Just making conversation.

129
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,839
You said he was popular with women.

130
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,439
I'm jealous.

131
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,240
You're just passing through?

132
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,240
Yeah.

133
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,959
If nothing else, I'll head

134
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
to see my wife.

135
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:32,720
Your bag.

136
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:33,519
Here.

137
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,040
Thanks.

138
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,120
Off to see my wife.

139
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,560
Who's your wife?

140
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,319
Lin Shan!

141
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,680
Have you no shame?

142
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,120
I've told you so many times.

143
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,279
I might never walk again.

144
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
Stop wasting your time.

145
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,079
If you never walk again,

146
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,279
then I'll have to take care of you.

147
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,839
Which one of your relatives

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,639
has come to help you?

149
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,639
It's just me, isn't it?

150
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,000
Apart from me,

151
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,519
who cares about you?

152
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,040
I don't need you.

153
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,920
I know you want me gone.

154
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,199
But since you can't move,

155
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm sticking around.

156
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,279
Now,

157
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,040
eat your meal.

158
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
After that,

159
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,279
I'll help you with your exercises.

160
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,519
No.

161
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,199
By the way,

162
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,480
I've paid

163
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,600
the hospital fees

164
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,000
for the next six months.

165
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,680
Who told you to pay for me?

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,680
Just follow the doctor's orders.

167
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,959
The doctor said

168
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,399
you still have a good chance
of recovering.

169
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,600
Besides,

170
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,480
who else can I spend money on?

171
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
You're my wife.

172
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,879
Get lost, Lin Shan.

173
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,759
I told you my legs won't recover.

174
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,199
Stop wasting money.

175
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,160
Are you insane?

176
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,800
Get out now.

177
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,600
Alright.

178
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,480
I know you want me

179
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,480
gone.

180
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,240
But now,

181
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,839
eat your meal.

182
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,000
After you eat and exercise,

183
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,439
I'll get lost.

184
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,920
Come on.

185
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,519
You know Lin Shan?

186
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,959
We're from the same village

187
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,399
and he visits often.

188
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,480
What's he like?

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Just asking.

190
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,279
I'm Lin Fang's classmate.

191
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,079
I'm here on business and paying respect.

192
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,879
Lin Shan

193
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,439
is not a bad guy.

194
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,840
But

195
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,399
every village

196
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,039
has its troublemakers.

197
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,759
His parents died young.

198
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,720
They had no money.

199
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,879
That little land

200
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,200
doesn't rent for much.

201
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,240
Years ago,

202
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
he worked out of town,

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,120
but came back

204
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,840
for his sister.

205
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,360
What does his wife do?

206
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,960
He doesn't have a wife.

207
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,559
Zhang Xiaohong

208
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,399
used to be our town's

209
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,080
belle.

210
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,360
A few years back,
she went to work in the south.

211
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,480
They said she was at a nightclub.

212
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,879
Two years ago,

213
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,120
she fell down some stairs

214
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,000
and became

215
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,200
partially paralyzed.

216
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,000
She's still in the hospital.

217
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,240
Lin Shan

218
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,919
has feelings for her.

219
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,159
He keeps calling her

220
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,240
his wife.

221
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,440
But honestly,

222
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,159
he's just running his mouth.

223
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,759
I see.

224
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,799
Sir,

225
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,440
Lin Shan gave you this painting, right?

226
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,279
Yeah.

227
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,279
He told me it's some

228
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,879
world-famous artwork.

229
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,320
A few years back,

230
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,360
he owed me

231
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,519
a few hundred yuan

232
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,080
and used this as collateral.

233
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,519
You got a steal.

234
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,840
This painting would cost

235
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,000
at least 1,000 otherwise.

236
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,279
Thanks, sir.

237
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,368
(Caorong Community Health Service
Center, Health Center Labor Union)

238
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm Lin Fang's classmate.

239
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,000
Lin Shan is her brother.

240
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,159
I'm here on business

241
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,200
and thought I'd visit.

242
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,399
I know you.

243
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,679
I watch your videos.

244
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,120
Big Hui.

245
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
The Logic Behind Truth.

246
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,639
This is awkward.

247
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,279
I guess I'm famous.

248
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,720
You knew Lin Fang

249
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,679
or Lin Shan?

250
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,120
Why did you come to see me?

251
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,559
Is it for a case analysis?

252
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,080
What case are you analyzing?

253
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,120
Ignore him. He's in a vegetative state.

254
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,000
Grab a chair.

255
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,559
Sit.

256
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,440
He can't talk.

257
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,919
I didn't come

258
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,519
to analyze any case,

259
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,200
but to investigate something.

260
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,080
Could you...

261
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,440
Yes.

262
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,320
What do you

263
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,960
want to know?

264
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:48,720
Tell me.

265
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,080
How did Lin Fang die?

266
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,279
From heart disease.

267
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,320
When she died,

268
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,480
I was working down south.

269
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I heard she was also

270
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,279
working.

271
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,639
Her heart gave out

272
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,639
and she died.

273
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,360
Do you know the guy

274
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,919
she held the wedding with?

275
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,039
Her brother mentioned him.

276
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,279
A village boy.

277
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,320
He made something

278
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,600
of himself later.

279
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,159
Lin Fang wasn't destined

280
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,080
to be his wife.

281
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,799
You're saying her death

282
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,600
had nothing

283
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,039
to do with her boyfriend.

284
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,399
How would he be involved?

285
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,960
You're here for this?

286
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,720
Did her boyfriend do something?

287
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,840
I don't know yet.

288
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,759
I haven't found much.

289
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,120
Could it be

290
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,559
that her boyfriend

291
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,559
made it big,

292
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,320
and thought she wasn't good enough

293
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,159
for him...?

294
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,000
We're not making up stories here.

295
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,200
I know.

296
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,120
Don't you always say that?

297
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,159
The Logic Behind Truth.

298
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,759
Yeah.

299
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,799
You met Lin Shan?

300
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,840
He said pretty much

301
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,480
the same things as you.

302
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,519
May I ask

303
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,720
how you...?

304
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,879
I guess I was unlucky.

305
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,279
It's my fault.

306
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,879
When people like me

307
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
refuse to live

308
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,519
a grounded life

309
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,879
and try to rewrite destiny,

310
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,519
we end up with nothing.

311
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,519
(I went to work
in Guangdong when I was 17.)

312
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,072
(Factory jobs paid little.)

313
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,960
(Two years later, a friend
told me to learn dancing.)

314
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,799
(Then I joined a dance troupe.)

315
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,799
(Not some idol group,)

316
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,080
(just a low-tier one.)

317
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,559
(Sometimes we'd perform)

318
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,720
(at corporate galas.)

319
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,759
(Those were big gigs.)

320
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,000
(Usually,)

321
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,159
(we danced at nightclubs.)

322
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,720
(I'm an ordinary girl)

323
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,879
(with no education or connections.)

324
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,240
(What good is it)

325
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,919
(to be young and pretty?)

326
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,039
(When a rich man treated)

327
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,240
(me nicely, I thought it was true love.)

328
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,000
So he abandoned you?

329
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,039
He once told me to jump off

330
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,440
a building

331
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,639
if he left me.

332
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,279
Jumping won't solve anything,

333
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,960
Tracy.

334
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,399
We're both adults here.

335
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,960
Stop being childish.

336
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
You know very well

337
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,840
my parents would never

338
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
let me marry you.

339
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,240
That's not what you said before.

340
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,440
I-I...

341
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,879
I meant hypothetically.

342
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,919
Just a hypothesis.

343
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,559
It was my aspiration.

344
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,919
We could work toward

345
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:31,919
this beautiful future

346
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,000
together.

347
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,200
Even if my family arranges

348
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,360
a marriage for me,

349
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,480
we could still be together.

350
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,200
I'll give you 50,000 monthly.

351
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,120
You think I want your money?

352
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,399
Let's not talk about motives.

353
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:49,519
Let's talk reality.

354
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,600
How can a girl from an average family

355
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,759
with no elite education

356
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,840
find a job that pays

357
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,879
over 10k a month?

358
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,879
I'll take care of it.

359
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,799
I can totally provide

360
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,759
for you.

361
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,440
Most importantly,

362
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,840
we'll still be together.

363
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,679
Okay, Tracy?

364
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,519
Is this being together?

365
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,799
You're making me

366
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,759
a despicable mistress.

367
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,039
That's not what I want...

368
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,720
Fine.

369
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,519
Obey your family then.

370
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,559
Marry your social equal.

371
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,279
No!

372
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,879
Tracy.

373
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,279
No, don't jump.

374
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,080
You really jumped?

375
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,120
Truth is, I wanted his money.

376
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:26,919
Being with him

377
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,120
meant no dorm life,

378
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,600
no sharing bathrooms

379
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,440
with roommates,

380
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,679
no cheap

381
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,559
makeup,

382
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,480
and no obsessing

383
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:38,399
about buying discounted items.

384
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,440
When I was dating him,

385
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,559
I almost forgot

386
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,360
that my family

387
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,000
is from this town

388
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,799
in this village.

389
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,799
I'm not Tracy.

390
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm Zhang Xiaohong.

391
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,519
At home, I feed the pigs

392
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,200
and work the fields.

393
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,600
Those fancy imported

394
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,240
foot care lotions he bought me

395
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,080
could only wash off

396
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,799
the dirt

397
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,240
around my ankles.

398
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,639
I shouldn't have daydreamed

399
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,000
or expected some man to change my fate.

400
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,320
What a joke.

401
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,679
It seems

402
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,799
Lin Shan loves you the best.

403
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,279
He's just a fool.

404
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,879
Who are you to Tracy?

405
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm her brother.

406
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,600
Why are you here?

407
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,080
The police said

408
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,600
that I was

409
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
totally innocent.

410
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,440
She couldn't handle

411
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,120
the fact

412
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:48,960
that we broke up.

413
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,720
But still,

414
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,679
we were dating once.

415
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,039
Out of humanitarian concern,

416
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,879
I'm willing to give her

417
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,960
some support.

418
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,720
What are you saying?

419
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,399
You think you can sleep with her
and just walk away?

420
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,679
Buddy,

421
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,039
don't put it that way.

422
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,399
When we were together,

423
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,440
I paid the rent

424
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,799
for her apartment

425
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,840
and gave her tens of thousands of yuan

426
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,279
for clothes and bags.

427
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,799
When she had troubles at home,

428
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,840
I gave her money to fix them.

429
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,320
We've broken up,

430
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,799
but I'm still offering

431
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,799
humanitarian aid

432
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,200
when she's in trouble.

433
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,879
Haven't I done enough?

434
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,240
I did everything I could

435
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,559
as her ex-boyfriend.

436
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,360
Here is

437
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,360
100,000 yuan.

438
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,080
Give it to her.

439
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,559
100,000 yuan?

440
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,920
I'll kill you.

441
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,440
Beat him!

442
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,279
I'll kill you.

443
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,960
Beat him. Get him off me.

444
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,696
(Good luck. Tomorrow will be better.)

445
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:44,352
(Little Fairy, Be better)

446
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,480
My stay

447
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,759
in the hospital

448
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,039
must've cost

449
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,960
hundreds of thousands.

450
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:51,720
I have no idea

451
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,240
where he got that money.

452
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,359
After what happened,

453
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,200
my family abandoned me.

454
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,599
Only Lin Shan was here.

455
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,960
He calls you his wife.

456
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,680
If I could walk again,

457
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,039
I'd definitely marry him.

458
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,920
I have

459
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,519
long figured out

460
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,960
what kind of life

461
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,920
I want.

462
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,119
But I know

463
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,640
I won't recover.

464
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,119
Surgeries in Shanghai

465
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,279
or Beijing

466
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,799
cost millions.

467
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,319
I just want

468
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,920
Lin Shan to stop helping me.

469
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,400
He had a tough life.

470
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,720
His parents and sister

471
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,240
died young.

472
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,960
If he ends up with

473
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,079
a disabled woman like me,

474
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,200
how could he

475
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,039
have a real life?

476
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,319
Big Hui,

477
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,000
let me join you

478
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,319
for the case analysis.

479
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,720
Y-You?

480
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,400
I love watching

481
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,480
mystery dramas.

482
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,640
And I've watched

483
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,279
tons of videos like yours.

484
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,920
I'll help analyze

485
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,039
and write scripts.

486
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,079
I'm drowning in free time.

487
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm so bored.

488
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,359
I'll think about it.

489
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,319
Don't worry.

490
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,160
I won't tell Lin Shan

491
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,279
you came to me today.

492
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,079
Sure.

493
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,279
Alright.

494
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,559
See? I get it.

495
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,279
Tell me about

496
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,240
your investigation.

497
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,839
How do I address you?

498
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,680
Xiaohong or...

499
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,400
Tracy.

500
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:53,519
Call me

501
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,119
by my big city name. Tracy.

502
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,519
Tell me about the investigation.

503
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:02,592
(Awards, Zeng Jie)

504
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,599
Hello, Master Zeng.

505
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,880
How bad do you feel?

506
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,599
My mom came and left

507
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,720
the same day.

508
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,839
You know how terrible I feel.

509
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,200
Entertain me with it

510
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,279
over food.

511
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,319
Managing in-law relationships
is the trickiest art.

512
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:35,200
You know who handles this best

513
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,920
among everyone

514
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,640
I know?

515
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,680
My dad.

516
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,319
His approach

517
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,359
is simple.

518
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,039
He never

519
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,599
let my mom and grandma

520
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,000
stay together for too long.

521
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,400
In that case,

522
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,359
I can't live

523
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,279
with my mom.

524
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,880
If you want a peaceful life,

525
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,319
keep your distance.

526
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,759
It's the same for us.

527
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You like me

528
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,200
not just because

529
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,119
I'm smart,

530
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,519
pretty, and young,

531
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,400
but also

532
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
because we rarely

533
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,680
see each other.

534
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,799
If we spend too much time

535
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,839
together,

536
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:11,839
you may find

537
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,920
blemish flaws

538
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,279
in me

539
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,559
and I'd

540
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,680
find countless flaws

541
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,039
in you, too.

542
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,400
Stop stressing over this.

543
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,400
Anyway,

544
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,279
you're already getting divorced.

545
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,359
(I drafted a letter)

546
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,720
(and invited)

547
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,680
(the White Horse General)

548
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,119
(to the banquet today.)

549
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,720
- What are you looking for?
- A book to read.

550
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,039
What kind of book?

551
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,119
I haven't decided yet.

552
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,519
Reading always

553
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,599
calms me, though.

554
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,000
Your books are

555
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,319
way too sophisticated.

556
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,079
If you want to feel better,

557
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
try reading

558
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,559
power fantasy web novels.

559
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,799
I won't escape reality.

560
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,640
That's because

561
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,519
your reality

562
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,480
is enviable.

563
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,000
No.

564
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,559
That's because I fought for it.

565
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:35,839
Shan.

566
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,880
It was an accident, Shan.

567
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,519
Hit me all you want, Shan.

568
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:40,200
Shan.

569
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,160
I'll kill you.

570
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,400
My sister.

571
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,640
She's my only sister.

572
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,920
It's fine without bride price.

573
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,799
But it's only been a year.

574
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,640
I hoped you'd give her

575
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,519
a better life.

576
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,480
It's only been a year.

577
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:01,519
Shan.

578
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,559
Shan.

579
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,799
It was an accident, Shan.

580
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,279
Please.

581
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,240
It was an accident.

582
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,039
Shan.

583
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,000
Shan.

584
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,640
You'll always be my brother.

585
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,519
I'll make big money

586
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,599
and provide for you.

587
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,359
You'll make money?

588
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,200
Shan.

589
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:17,839
Things are

590
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,559
different from before.

591
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,119
Look.

592
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,039
My artworks

593
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,079
have won awards.

594
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,000
I'll make big money

595
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,079
and take care of you.

596
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,039
Shan. I promise.

597
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,079
Get lost.

598
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,640
You'll take care of me?

599
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,160
My sister gave you all her savings.

600
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,480
You expect me to believe you?

601
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,480
Shan, trust me.

602
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,200
Trust me, look.

603
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,039
I swear

604
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,480
things are different now.

605
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,119
I've even been kept on as faculty.

606
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,599
My works have won awards.

607
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,759
I will make money

608
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,759
very soon.

609
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:46,799
It's all yours.

610
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,599
Shan.

611
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,440
Tell me.

612
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,920
Where is my sister?

613
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,839
Bring her back to me.

614
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,960
I-I forgot, Shan.

615
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:00,039
We were sketching in the mountains.

616
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,599
She ate something

617
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,720
and suddenly collapsed.

618
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:03,839
I had no choice...

619
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,759
You abandoned her

620
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,839
in the mountains?

621
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,079
I buried her.

622
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,240
Shan, I buried her.

623
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,799
How could I bear

624
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,160
to leave her out there?

625
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,759
Shan.

626
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,359
I buried her.

627
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:15,680
I buried her.

628
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,240
I'm sorry, Shan.

629
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,559
I'm sorry.

630
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,200
I'm sorry, I messed up.

631
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:23,359
I shouldn't

632
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,279
have taken her

633
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,279
to the mountains.

634
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:26,920
Things went wrong.

635
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,640
And I couldn't do anything.

636
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,920
You couldn't do anything?

637
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,720
You did it on purpose.

638
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,319
That's not true, Shan.

639
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,680
It's been

640
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,759
a whole month.

641
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,200
When are you going
to tell me if I don't find you?

642
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,160
I was scared.

643
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,440
Shan.

644
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,359
I failed Fang.

645
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,640
I failed you, too.

646
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,200
Shan.

647
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,839
I regret it so much.

648
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,759
My sister died of heart disease.

649
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,519
Her heart failed.

650
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,400
Yes.

651
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,200
That's it.

652
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,759
She died away from home.

653
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,319
Yes, Shan.

654
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,519
That's right.

655
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,039
Come home with me

656
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,559
to build her a grave.

657
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,000
Of course.

658
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,160
I'll erect a tombstone

659
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,000
for Fang.

660
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,599
I'll build a tombstone for her.

661
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,400
I swear I will.

662
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,160
Listen, Zeng Jie.

663
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,839
I'm doing you a favor here.

664
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,200
Do you know how to explain this

665
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,920
to others?

666
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,400
Yes, Shan.

667
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,160
Don't worry.

668
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,160
That's the story.

669
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,440
Build her grave

670
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,400
by the end of the month

671
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,400
with or without her body.

672
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,519
Okay, I got it.

673
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,759
It'll be done

674
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,160
by the end of the month.

675
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,519
I'll get it done, Shan.

676
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,880
I got it, Shan.

677
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,160
I'll follow through.

678
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,119
Guaranteed.

679
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,279
And prepare 100,000 yuan for me.

680
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,640
Okay.

681
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,240
Shan.

682
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,400
As you say.

683
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,720
By the end of the month.

684
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,079
Listen to me.

685
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,000
100,000 yuan alone

686
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,440
doesn't resolve this issue.

687
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,400
Lin Fang

688
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,720
never married him

689
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,000
in the legal sense.

690
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,640
That's common in rural areas.

691
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,480
A wedding is considered official.

692
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,240
Many people formalize paperwork

693
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,680
only to send their kids to school.

694
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,599
This proves nothing.

695
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,400
When Lin Fang died,

696
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,400
Zeng Jie wasn't married to Bai Xiaoling.

697
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,039
Don't you think she died

698
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,000
at a convenient moment?

699
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,400
Are you saying

700
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,240
that Zeng Jie killed Lin Fang

701
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,240
to marry Bai Xiaoling,

702
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,319
who's wealthier?

703
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,720
Wealthier?

704
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,480
Their statuses were worlds apart.

705
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,480
Why didn't Lin Shan

706
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,000
suspect anything?

707
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,720
According to Zhang Xiaohong,

708
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,039
Lin Shan spent about

709
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:37,960
200,000 yuan on her.

710
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,440
But that's recent.

711
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,599
Lin Fang died four years ago.

712
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,160
So tell me.

713
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,119
Where did Lin Shan

714
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,119
get the money from?

715
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:45,759
So we need to

716
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,119
look into Lin Shan

717
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,960
for answers.

718
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,039
You're pretty impressive.

719
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,559
You visited Lin Fang's hometown

720
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,519
and easily got

721
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,640
all this information.

722
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,559
I went fully prepared.

723
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:58,279
What do you mean?

724
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,559
Check out my outfit.

725
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,119
Wait.

726
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,640
Why did we come here?

727
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,079
Do you know this place?

728
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,680
Of course, I do.

729
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,039
The bars sit

730
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:15,880
across the street.

731
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,119
When I first

732
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,279
graduated from college,

733
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,400
I worked at an agency

734
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,720
and distributed flyers there.

735
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,839
Seven years ago,

736
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,559
I won first place in the provincial

737
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,720
police academy

738
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:28,559
competition.

739
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
I was so excited

740
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,880
and told my brother.

741
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,039
He promised to buy me

742
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,279
late-night snacks

743
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,160
after his mission.

744
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,119
I waited till dawn.

745
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,039
That night,

746
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,200
he was killed in action

747
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:52,759
right on that street.

748
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,119
It's fine.

749
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,200
It's been years.

750
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,279
He's still with me.

751
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,319
Say it again?

752
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:37,839
I've signed

753
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,160
the prenup.

754
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,839
Just add your signature.

755
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,119
I won't get any of

756
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,519
your family's money.

757
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,640
If we ever

758
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,200
get divorced,

759
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:47,799
I'll leave

760
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,680
empty-handed.

761
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,359
Do you have to be so serious?

762
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,640
Stop laughing.

763
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,359
Xiaoling, I know you don't care.

764
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,359
Just sign it to reassure

765
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,759
your dad.

766
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,240
He hasn't said it.

767
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,519
But I can see it.

768
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,720
He's worried

769
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,960
that I'm after your money.

770
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:09,759
Professor Zeng.

771
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,319
Now you're offending me.

772
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,319
I've got looks

773
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,519
and a great figure.

774
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:14,440
But you claim

775
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,119
you're not after my beauty?

776
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:18,480
Xiaoling.

777
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,359
I've won over the beauty.

778
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,000
Now let me ease your dad's

779
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:22,640
mind.

780
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,039
Besides,

781
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,279
I'll be richer

782
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,960
than your dad very soon.

783
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,359
Then I definitely won't sign.

784
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,279
Otherwise,

785
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,119
how can I get your money?

786
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,279
It's been half a year
since we first dated. She's extremely

787
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,359
happy with me.

788
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,599
And she's

789
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,599
relying on me

790
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,680
because I'm a university professor.

791
00:30:59,079 --> 00:30:59,440
No,

792
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,480
I was just a teaching assistant

793
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
when we first dated.

794
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,759
I became an associate professor
just last month.

795
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:08,160
I've also won two international awards.

796
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,920
Of course,

797
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,200
none of this would have

798
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,720
happened without you, Ms. Juan.

799
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,279
While dating her,

800
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,880
I've maintained proper conduct.

801
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,400
In fact, I had many chances

802
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,720
to be alone with her

803
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,640
early on,

804
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,279
but I respected her boundaries.

805
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,799
So,

806
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,480
from the very beginning,

807
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,720
I was aiming for marriage

808
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,720
as the ultimate goal.

809
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,839
But now,

810
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,920
we have a minor problem.

811
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,559
I've met her parents.

812
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,599
Her dad is a businessman

813
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,960
with extreme wealth.

814
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,440
She hasn't said it outright.

815
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,839
But I can tell

816
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,720
he's still guarded against me.

817
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,440
He suspects

818
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,559
I'm after their family fortune.

819
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,519
How can I

820
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,559
tell her father that

821
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,759
I'm an artist

822
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,759
and genuinely

823
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,119
don't care about his wealth?

824
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,279
You don't?

825
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,119
Ms. Juan,

826
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,000
you're

827
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,799
the only person

828
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,000
I can speak honestly to.

829
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,359
I'll just say it.

830
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:32,960
If I marry Bai Xiaoling,

831
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,319
I'll never have to struggle like before.

832
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,000
Plus, she's young and beautiful.

833
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,880
I can't let go

834
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,759
of such an opportunity.

835
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,559
But now,

836
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,680
I don't know

837
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
how to secure this.

838
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,240
Get a lawyer.

839
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,160
Have her sign a prenup,

840
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,599
specifying that

841
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,559
her family assets will never

842
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,559
be connected to you.

843
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,960
If you two ever

844
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,839
get divorced,

845
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,680
no matter what happened,

846
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,400
you'll leave empty-handed.

847
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:14,799
All the talk

848
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,319
isn't as concrete

849
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,079
as a prenup.

850
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,559
Yeah.

851
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,319
But...

852
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,880
No buts.

853
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,200
If she's

854
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,680
genuinely simple, kind,

855
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,680
naive, and silly,

856
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,279
she won't sign the prenup.

857
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,400
Moreover,

858
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:32,640
she'll fight

859
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,160
her father for your sake.

860
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,039
But what if

861
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,640
she signs it?

862
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,039
With your intelligence,

863
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,240
even if she signs it,

864
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,119
you'll figure something out.

865
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,519
Her father

866
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,799
is a wealthy man,

867
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,240
so he can't be foolish.

868
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,519
Even without the prenup,

869
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,240
once he approves of

870
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,279
your marriage,

871
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,799
he'll certainly establish

872
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,119
asset protections in advance.

873
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,280
So,

874
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,119
you'd better propose

875
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
to sign the prenup

876
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,360
and earn yourself a ticket

877
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,400
into this family.

878
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,679
Stop contemplating.

879
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,280
Success requires

880
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,440
step-by-step effort.

881
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:59,008
♪Some lights only exist in darkness♪

882
00:34:59,178 --> 00:35:02,840
♪Some whispers outshout desperate cries♪

883
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,039
The director is so confident?

884
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,039
You'll regret it

885
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:05,639
if you don't

886
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,480
(Buy a house in 2012, or be wifeless)
buy a house in 2012.

887
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,760
Is he crazy?

888
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:08,920
We're the crazy ones.

889
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,880
We've graduated

890
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,920
from college,

891
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,800
and we're still

892
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,480
handing out flyers.

893
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,519
Stop complaining.

894
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:15,719
Jobs are hard to come by.

895
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,079
Besides, at least

896
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,400
we get some base salary.

897
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,039
Base salary?

898
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,199
Base salaries are shackles

899
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,559
for young people.

900
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,119
You know?

901
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:27,400
What? You want to go home?

902
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
It's still early.

903
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:29,880
Let's go drink

904
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,119
until we're wasted.

905
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:31,719
Let's go.

906
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,760
You got

907
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:33,920
the time wrong?

908
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,800
No, no.

909
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,159
You didn't.

910
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,199
But you thought

911
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,400
you had a girlfriend.

912
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,400
Well, you don't.

913
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,119
How dare you be late?

914
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,920
Why would you marry him

915
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,559
when he can't pay the bride price?

916
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,679
You're giving yourself

917
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,400
away.

918
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,239
Brother.

919
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,639
Don't call me brother.

920
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:50,960
Listen up.

921
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,440
I need money to get married.

922
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,199
All women want a bride price.

923
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,440
What are you thinking?

924
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,679
Brother.

925
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,039
I'm not your brother.

926
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,000
Sir.

927
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,239
It's a brilliant choice to make me

928
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,280
your legal advisor, you know?

929
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:07,760
Listen.

930
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
I'll take down those who

931
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,039
copy your products.

932
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,840
That's right!

933
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:14,239
Feel free to copy

934
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,079
anyone's product.

935
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,960
What's our goal?

936
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,920
No.1 in Caorong.

937
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,360
Your pig feed will rank

938
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:24,039
first in the province and in China.

939
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,639
Alright.

940
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,079
My brother

941
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,559
won the provincial

942
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,320
police contest.

943
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,039
I thought you didn't

944
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,119
want him to join the force.

945
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,800
What can I do?

946
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,119
Everyone in my family

947
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,880
is destined to wear this uniform.

948
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:38,800
Stay alert.

949
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
I'll clock out early

950
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,559
and treat

951
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,400
my brother.

952
00:36:50,528 --> 00:36:53,472
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

953
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:03,948
You think I want your money?

954
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:06,848
I'll shoot with these.

955
00:37:07,232 --> 00:37:08,900
You're in a colorful world.

956
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,141
Shan.

957
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:18,168
I'm different from before.

958
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:19,616
My artworks

959
00:37:19,616 --> 00:37:20,544
have won awards.

960
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:21,797
I'll make big money

961
00:37:21,797 --> 00:37:23,360
and take care of you.

962
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,256
My money is yours.

963
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:29,824
I'm Lin Fang's classmate.

964
00:37:29,824 --> 00:37:31,372
Lin Shan is her brother.

965
00:37:31,372 --> 00:37:32,864
I passed by here and...

966
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:35,584
Sorry, another take.

967
00:37:35,584 --> 00:37:36,608
I was passing by...

968
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:39,072
Do you know about...

969
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:42,432
Stop.

970
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:43,168
