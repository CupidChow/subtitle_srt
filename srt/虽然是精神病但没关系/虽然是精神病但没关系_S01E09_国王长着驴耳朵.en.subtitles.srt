1
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,706
I...

2
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,583
got suspended.

3
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,419
They're not going to
pay me during my suspension,

4
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,380
and I'm probably going to get sued.

5
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,343
Everything is so messed up.

6
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,513
You said before

7
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,890
you'll run away with me

8
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,392
whenever I want.

9
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,272
I want to

10
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,441
go on a trip with you.

11
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,072
Right now.

12
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,246
Let's go.

13
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,607
CHAPTER 9
KING DONKEY EARS

14
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:35,947
Where should we go?

15
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,449
Don't you think it'd be nice to go abroad?

16
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,618
South America and Europe both sound nice.

17
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,080
Let's go somewhere hotter than here.
How about Africa?

18
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,833
Serengeti, the wildlife refuge.
What do you think?

19
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,799
"What in the world have I done?"

20
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,513
Is that...

21
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,849
what you're thinking right now?

22
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,102
No, not at all.

23
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,937
You'd better not be thinking that.

24
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,398
You impressed me by punching that guy

25
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,025
and even asked me to take you on a trip.

26
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,611
Don't tell me
you're starting to regret it.

27
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,655
No, of course not.

28
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,699
I'm not regretting it.

29
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,035
Then let's go to Serengeti.

30
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,914
I don't have a passport.

31
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,792
Are you from outer space?

32
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,296
-Who doesn't have a passport these days?
-Me. I don't.

33
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,051
-We can go to Jeju Island.
-We won't be able to return today.

34
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,636
"Return today"? Are you joking?

35
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,680
Last time, you offered to take me
to a mountain or a field.

36
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,015
That won't take more than a day.

37
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:45,642
Okay, fine.

38
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,727
Then for one night--

39
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,687
If we're spending the night,
let's take Sang-tae.

40
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,488
-What are you doing?
-Think carefully before you answer.

41
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,656
Stop the car.

42
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,617
Do you want to go for a day
or spend the night with me?

43
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,576
Stop the car!

44
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,161
Do you want to spend the night with me

45
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,456
or die with me?

46
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,959
Ko Mun-yeong!

47
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,973
Are you nuts? Why would you risk your life
to joke around?

48
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,768
Who says I'm joking around?

49
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,022
Please. At least count to three
before you do anything impulsive.

50
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,860
Did you count to three
before you punched that guy?

51
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,616
Get out.

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,785
If I stay with you,

53
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,079
it'll make me
want to crash into something.

54
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,964
Damn it! Gang-tae, that darn asshole!

55
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,300
He wanted to go on a trip.
Is he teasing me or what?

56
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,763
Is he really teasing me?

57
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,099
What the heck? How dare he tease me?

58
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,560
How am I going to get back at him?

59
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,488
Hey, buddy.

60
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,074
You're so strange these days.

61
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,576
I didn't have lunch.

62
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,787
You always skip meals,

63
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,914
and you quit your job
like it's your hobby.

64
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,626
But you punched someone today
and got suspended.

65
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,545
I'm surprised you have an appetite.

66
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:25,968
This is good.

67
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,556
Buddy, you must be sick in the mind.

68
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,767
Let's go get a checkup.

69
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,272
-Do you also think I'm a little strange?
-Not just a little. Very.

70
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,612
-What's the matter with me, Jae-su?
-It's the lunatic virus.

71
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,906
-"A virus"?
-That day,

72
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:51,285
when Ko Mun-yeong
hurt your hand with a knife,

73
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:56,040
her lunatic virus must have
entered your blood vessels

74
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,585
and totally messed up your brain.

75
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,260
You almost convinced me.

76
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,761
I almost thought of writing a novel.

77
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,182
-Do you know the word for that in English?
-"In English"?

78
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,309
Gosh, do you think I'm dumb?

79
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,104
You want to know what it is in English?

80
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,397
My gosh, come on.

81
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,190
It's "Nobel" as in
Nobel Prize in Literature.

82
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,192
My goodness, I guess you didn't know.

83
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,990
Yes, novel. That's what I said.
Novel Prize in Literature.

84
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:29,991
My gosh, seriously.

85
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,452
Okay, fine. My pronunciation sucked.
I admit that, okay?

86
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,246
-Jae-su.
-Yes, I know.

87
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,332
Gosh, that's enough.

88
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,876
End of conversation. Just drop it.

89
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,835
I...

90
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,296
want to have fun.

91
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,091
Sure. Why not?

92
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,136
It's been a while.
Let's go for a ride on Alberto.

93
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,220
Where do you want to go?

94
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,894
-Serengeti.
-Sereng... What?

95
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,938
He's not that kind of person.

96
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,983
He's a very patient guy.
I can't believe he punched someone.

97
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,568
It's just like when you fart.

98
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,945
If you hold it in 99 times

99
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,781
and finally let it out,
it could kill people.

100
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,534
You... You have no manners.

101
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,745
Don't talk about farting
when we're eating.

102
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,998
It's making me lose my appetite.

103
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,958
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

104
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,213
Eat... Eat your own side dishes.

105
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,967
But how did he end up punching someone?

106
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,554
Back in the days,
I also beat up guys who used to bully you.

107
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,723
He probably got angry for the same reason.

108
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,143
Back when I was young,
I had a crush on Sun-deok.

109
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,895
But I got rejected three times.

110
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,397
That's... That's quite a surprise.

111
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,983
But... But how did you reject him?

112
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,110
"I don't like you!
I really don't like you!"

113
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,612
That's how I rejected him.

114
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,282
He was very unusual
ever since he was young.

115
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,784
It was a 50-50 chance.

116
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,620
He was either a genius or an idiot,
so I just rejected him.

117
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,414
You regret it, don't you?

118
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,625
My goodness, how did you know?

119
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,169
I regret it very much.

120
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,964
Don't leave any food on your plate.

121
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,550
Did you see that?

122
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,718
She still has feelings for me.

123
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,845
Don't be delusional. Drink your soup.

124
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,308
Director.

125
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,854
I'm sorry for bothering you
during your meal.

126
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,898
But can you come with me for a moment?

127
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,484
What's going on?

128
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,695
-You can keep eating.
-Okay.

129
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,199
Why can't she get discharged?

130
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,118
We're not saying she can't get discharged.

131
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,995
-But there's a procedure--
-I don't care.

132
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,956
-Let's go.
-Please calm down.

133
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,792
-The director will be here--
-How do you expect us to calm down?

134
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,002
Her ex-husband...

135
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,964
We brought her to this hospital
so that jerk wouldn't find her.

136
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,758
But that lunatic managed to find her here.

137
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,971
You should just come with me
to the States.

138
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,764
You can get treated there.

139
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,850
No, I don't want to go.
Just go by yourself.

140
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,476
Stop complaining! Let's go!

141
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,355
If you must leave...

142
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,320
What? What do you want?

143
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,948
Our hospital administration
is handled over there.

144
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,867
You need to pay before you go.

145
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,414
-You need to pay.
-We'll pay, okay?

146
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,082
-Let's go, Mom.
-My goodness.

147
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,586
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

148
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,631
Hurry up. Come on.

149
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,552
Ms. Lee A-reum isn't ready
to get discharged.

150
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,513
Are you really going to let her leave?

151
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,311
What else can we do to stop her
from leaving?

152
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,773
Her family won't let her stay.

153
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,613
-Come here.
-What is it?

154
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,781
Be quiet.

155
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,825
Jeong-tae. Listen to me carefully.

156
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,118
I'm listening.

157
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,914
You see, A-reum...

158
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,082
What about her?

159
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,001
Well, the thing is, A-reum...

160
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,504
No! A-reum...

161
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,930
Hey, Jeong-tae.

162
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,434
You shouldn't let people find out
that you and A-reum are a couple.

163
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,895
So just try your best to hold it in.

164
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,107
-I'll try to find a way.
-Damn it.

165
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,736
Jeong-tae.

166
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,574
Tomorrow, someone who can help you
will show up from the west.

167
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,827
What? A ghost from the west?

168
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,414
Someone who can help him
will show up from the west.

169
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,624
A person. Not a ghost.

170
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,335
He snores, grinds his teeth, and farts.

171
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,712
He does it all simultaneously.
It's like a darn orchestra.

172
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,261
I bet every single hole
in Lee Sang-in's body opens up

173
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,514
when that guy goes to sleep.

174
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,767
My gosh, it's hilarious.

175
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,728
If you can't stand him,
you can sleep in our room.

176
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,230
-It's empty.
-Can I really do that?

177
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,486
-I also have a favor to ask you.
-"A favor"?

178
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,615
It's regarding Sang-tae.
Tomorrow, can you--

179
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,825
Sure.

180
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,162
-But I'm not done talking.
-There's no need to explain.

181
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,956
I'll help you out no matter what.

182
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,791
That's what you call loyalty.

183
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,043
Thanks.

184
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,005
Then who do you like more? Me or Sang-tae?

185
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,341
-Do I really need to answer that?
-What?

186
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,470
I'll see you.

187
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,144
I like you, too.

188
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,485
-"Those two guys are
-Those two guys are

189
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,029
-trying to take over our house.
-trying to take over our house.

190
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,072
-They're a pair of rascals."
-They're a pair of rascals.

191
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,115
I hate them.

192
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,536
I really hate Dooly and his friends.

193
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,123
It's not even their house,
but they do whatever they want.

194
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,667
I like Ko Gil-dong.

195
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,629
"Ko Gil-dong"?

196
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,257
He let those guys into his territory.

197
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,802
He's a nice guy.

198
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,431
-What do you think?
-I like him.

199
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,268
I... I also like Gil-dong.

200
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:35,064
This... This guy's name is Teary.
His real name is Ko Gil-dong.

201
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,775
His name is Teary. This right here
is actually a piece of thread,

202
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,818
but it's also a teardrop.
His name is Ko Gil-dong.

203
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,029
-Do you also like him?
-Yes.

204
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,574
Ko Gil-dong is a caregiver
for Dooly, Douner, and Ddochi.

205
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,827
I mean, he's their guardian,
and he gives them a place to sleep,

206
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,330
gives them food, and protects them.

207
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,999
Just for your information,
I'm Gang-tae's guardian.

208
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,169
And a guardian should be
dependable and trustworthy.

209
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,422
I'm an adult and his older brother.
That's who I am.

210
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,265
We really click, Sang-tae.

211
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,267
We're like best friends.

212
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,231
"Best friends"?

213
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,318
Best friends.

214
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,363
My gosh, we're best friends.

215
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,448
Yes, best friends.

216
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,659
Best friends.

217
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,497
Sang-tae, I'm home.

218
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,300
Can we talk?

219
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,305
Best friends.

220
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,065
Are we not going anywhere tomorrow?

221
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,196
Did you overreact like that earlier
to have fun for just one day?

222
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,491
One day is more than enough for me.

223
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,244
I dreamt of that day

224
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,540
my entire life.

225
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,716
You're so annoying.

226
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,220
So are we going tomorrow?

227
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,514
Sometimes,

228
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,060
you're like a tamer, not a caregiver.

229
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,811
"A tamer"?

230
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,856
I feel like you're taming me.

231
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,865
I think it's the opposite.

232
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,704
I keep doing things I wouldn't normally do

233
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,458
because of you.

234
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,253
Earlier,

235
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,340
I couldn't hear

236
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,135
or see anything.

237
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,060
I must have been out of my mind.

238
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,273
I really couldn't hold my anger.

239
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,277
No, you weren't out of your mind.

240
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,283
You were stunning.

241
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,656
Should we leave the house
tomorrow morning?

242
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,950
Yes, sure.

243
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,327
Good night.

244
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,172
I want to twist that deer's neck.

245
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,507
Shut up, you stupid deer!

246
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,832
Ju-ri.

247
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,794
Where are you going?

248
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,885
Seung-jae.

249
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,971
Have you ever been in a one-sided love?

250
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,892
No, I would never do something so dumb.

251
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,185
It's such a waste of time.

252
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,397
I know, right?

253
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,192
It's a waste of time.

254
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,694
You deserve way better.

255
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,032
-Do you know who I have a crush on?
-Mr. Moon Gang-tae.

256
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,496
I'm very slow when it comes to work.

257
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,333
But when it comes to love,
I'm very quick-witted.

258
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,880
Let's be honest and realistic.

259
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,966
You're a lot better than Mr. Moon.

260
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,136
He may be good-looking,
but he has absolutely nothing...

261
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,766
You're right.

262
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,062
He doesn't have anything to offer.

263
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,276
He really doesn't.

264
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,113
I must've thought

265
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,578
I could be the one to fill up

266
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,416
his empty life.

267
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,045
What's the matter with me?

268
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,721
I must be drunk.

269
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,056
Let's go inside after we finish this.

270
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,939
I personally think
you should be with a guy

271
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,402
who's older than you, and has a laid-back

272
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,240
and broad-minded personality,
with the characteristics of a businessman.

273
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,994
I'm sure you'll be able to find
a guy like that somewhere nearby.

274
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,933
She's finally doing her money's worth.

275
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,858
No, you weren't out of your mind.

276
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,069
You were stunning.

277
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,780
I must be out of my mind.

278
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,574
What?

279
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,036
No, it's nothing. Go back to bed.

280
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,122
-Go back to sleep.
-Okay.

281
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,545
If you're out of your mind,
you need to go to a hospital.

282
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,714
It means you're sick.

283
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,618
I must have been out of my mind.

284
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,162
I really couldn't hold my anger.

285
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,582
He shouldn't have held back
his desire either.

286
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,793
My gosh.

287
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,813
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

288
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,731
DIRECTOR O'S MUSIC CLASS

289
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,151
-It's okay to not be okay
-It's okay to not be okay

290
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,696
-It's okay
-It's okay

291
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,700
-It's okay to be sick at heart
-It's okay to be sick at heart

292
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:10,078
-I'm really okay
-I'm really okay

293
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,582
-It's not because of the director
-It's not because of the director

294
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,169
-It's not because of my medicine
-It's not because of my medicine

295
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,839
-I'm okay because I'm strong
-I'm okay because I'm strong

296
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:24,551
-I'm really okay
-I'm really okay

297
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,802
I love you guys.

298
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,556
THERAPY ROOM

299
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,151
It's sunny outside.

300
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,237
Why don't we go for a walk?

301
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:57,167
Sang-tae, I have plans today,
so I'm going to be a bit late.

302
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,463
So wait for me at Jae-su's.
I'll go pick you up in the evening.

303
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:05,008
"We really click, Sang-tae.
We're like best friends."

304
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,886
-What?
-Best friends.

305
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,764
Ms. Ko and I are best friends now.

306
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:14,267
That means we're buddies and besties.
It means we're really close.

307
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:18,146
Your best friend is Jae-su.
My best friend is Ms. Ko.

308
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,859
I also have a best friend now.
I have a best friend.

309
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,824
Don't you miss your daughter?

310
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,201
I heard her fairy tale class is
really fun.

311
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,995
Maybe I should watch her teach one day.

312
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,252
She's just like that woman.

313
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,672
-"That woman"?
-Everyone

314
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,384
got fooled by that woman.

315
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,762
She has the face of an angel.

316
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,640
But there lives a demon inside.

317
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,564
Everyone is good and bad.
We all live with both traits.

318
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,608
That woman is a monster.

319
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,194
She killed someone.

320
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,573
I'm telling you. She killed someone.

321
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,869
Where is that monster?

322
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,454
She's dead.

323
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,165
I killed her.

324
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,634
I'm sure

325
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,761
I killed her.

326
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,680
But she came back.

327
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,433
She came back to kill me.

328
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,519
She's going to kill me.

329
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,198
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST

330
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,951
Ms. Park Ok-ran.

331
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,829
You're not allowed in here.

332
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,664
Why were you reading this

333
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,375
when I wasn't done reading it myself?

334
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,923
Well, I was just...

335
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:12,886
See?

336
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,805
It's because you touched something
that wasn't yours.

337
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,058
I hate it

338
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,477
when people do that.

339
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,573
Are you okay?

340
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,244
Yes, I'm okay. It's just a paper cut.

341
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,037
-I'll give you a bandage.
-No, it's okay.

342
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,958
By the way, I noticed that
Mr. Joo Jeong-tae went outside today.

343
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,668
Wasn't it Mr. Kan Pil-ong's turn?

344
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,294
Yes.

345
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,423
But Director O signed a permit
for Mr. Joo Jeong-tae this morning.

346
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,011
I bet someone made a deal
behind the curtain.

347
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:56,930
"A deal"?

348
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,517
Are you ready?

349
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,395
I'm going in, okay?

350
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:20,954
Are you doing a circus show?

351
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,622
Are you running away?

352
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,667
I mean...
Can't you wear something comfortable?

353
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,669
I feel comfortable naked.

354
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,546
Don't you have anything normal?

355
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,464
-I don't want to look normal.
-Why not?

356
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,343
Because it's normal.

357
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,347
-At least wear comfortable shoes--
-What did you pack?

358
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,020
Are we evacuating?

359
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,273
Well, we might get hungry
when we're outside...

360
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,568
My goodness.

361
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,322
Did a patient call you or something?

362
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,952
I just thought we might need it
just in case...

363
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,329
Don't make it so obvious

364
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,497
that this your first time going somewhere.

365
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,129
You just need to take care of me.

366
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,348
-Don't pick up.
-Hello?

367
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,725
Who is that jerk?

368
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,227
Two club sandwiches, please.

369
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,778
You should eat it while it's warm.

370
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,780
You had something urgent to tell me?

371
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,907
I can't talk properly when I'm hungry.

372
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,370
Do you have plans?

373
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:45,830
Yes.

374
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,832
A date with Ms. Ko?

375
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,088
I told you already.

376
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,300
I'm amazing
when it comes to reading people's minds.

377
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,930
Then

378
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,766
can I ask you something?

379
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,686
Go ahead.

380
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,818
What's the psychology
behind people who overdress

381
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,695
and wear things that are way too fancy?

382
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,825
I'm guessing it's because

383
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,661
they want to show off, right?

384
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,544
It's the opposite.
They want to protect themselves.

385
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,047
They think they're too weak,
so they use clothes for protection.

386
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,551
It's like an armor.

387
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:47,058
So you should do a good job
of protecting her.

388
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,601
I'm talking about Ms. Ko.

389
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,987
My best friend...

390
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,031
When... When are we
going to have our meeting?

391
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,491
-Sang-tae.
-Yes?

392
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,452
What kind of women
did Gang-tae hang out with?

393
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:13,042
Nurses, patients,

394
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,546
teachers at my school, landlords...

395
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,674
No, I'm not talking about
those kinds of women.

396
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,385
-What kind of women does he like?
-He doesn't like women.

397
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,222
-Does he like men?
-He likes me.

398
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:30,018
"You're my favorite person
in the whole world, Sang-tae."

399
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,936
Gang-tae only hangs out with me.

400
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,690
No wonder he doesn't know how to have fun.

401
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,070
I should make sure he has a blast.

402
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,739
No. Mang-tae.

403
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,575
I gave you Mang-tae.

404
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,578
-What?
-You can play with Mang-tae.

405
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,954
Gang-tae will play with me.

406
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,373
And I... I will play with my best friend.

407
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,542
-Can't I play with Gang-tae?
-No, you can't.

408
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,337
Gang-tae can only have fun with me.
He's my little brother.

409
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,549
Do you also adore Gang-tae?

410
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,093
Yes, I really adore him.

411
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,722
He... He has beautiful eyes.
He has the most beautiful eyes ever.

412
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,517
Have you ever hated him?

413
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,733
I guess you have.

414
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,611
When did you hate Gang-tae?

415
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,075
Aren't you going to tell me?

416
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,872
Sang-tae.

417
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,668
Do you know the story called
King Donkey Ears?

418
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:40,421
Yes, the guy goes into the bamboo forest
and shouts,

419
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,632
"The king has donkey ears!"

420
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,426
Yes, that's right.
If you keep a secret to yourself,

421
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,554
you end up getting frustrated.

422
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,139
You need to tell someone
in order to relieve your stress.

423
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,436
When did you hate Gang-tae the most?

424
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,363
My phone is...

425
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,240
Hey, Jae-su.

426
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,201
I need to talk on the phone.

427
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,635
Maybe you were right about that.

428
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,973
You said that Ms. Ko's mother
may not be someone whom she misses

429
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,351
but someone whom she still fears.

430
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,021
It's just my guess.

431
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:42,442
We can't trust everything
that a dementia patient says,

432
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,570
but that doesn't mean we can entirely
rule out the possibility.

433
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,113
What if

434
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,575
the writer Do Hui-jae actually isn't dead?

435
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,619
What if she just disappeared?

436
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,995
Then we know one thing for sure.

437
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,875
She'll definitely come back
to see her husband and daughter.

438
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,046
Let's hope I'm worried for nothing,

439
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,382
but just in case,

440
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,426
I wanted to ask you

441
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,138
to protect Ms. Ko and be there for her.

442
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,854
"NONSTOP" BY OH MY GIRL

443
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,401
Your brother is very calculating.

444
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:27,779
What do you mean?

445
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,115
He's all about give and take.
He doesn't give away anything for free.

446
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,745
Isn't that why you guys are best friends?
Because you two are alike.

447
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,811
Aren't you scared of riding motorcycles?

448
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,354
No, it doesn't. Hand me the helmet.

449
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,189
It's so scary.

450
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,691
-Jeez.
-Super scary!

451
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,777
Wait up!

452
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,323
Isn't it so nice to be home for a change?

453
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,951
Ms. Kang will throw a samgyeopsal party
for you this evening.

454
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,286
Why are you following me, Jae-su?

455
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,871
To hang out with you.

456
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,582
So you want me to leave?

457
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,585
You're so mean.

458
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,546
I closed up the restaurant for the day

459
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,423
and drove Alberto
all the way up the mountain

460
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,299
in this heatwave just to pick you up.

461
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,592
Right. You did that, boss.

462
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,095
Yes! I am your boss.

463
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,724
What kind of part-timer wants to hang out
with his boss at his place?

464
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,606
What?

465
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,653
What's that?
Is Ms. Kang making kimchi already?

466
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,030
Kimchi is made in the winter.

467
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,906
November 7th is the first day of winter.

468
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,704
My, I feel so refreshed.

469
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,874
Gosh, our very own illustrator

470
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,918
Mr. Moon is here.

471
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,130
Hello! Mr. Lee Sang-in,
the CEO of SangSangESang Publishers.

472
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,007
-Hello.
-What on earth are you doing here

473
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,760
half-naked in broad daylight?

474
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,511
As you can see, I'm enjoying my vacation.

475
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:19,223
Usually, I book a resort overseas
every summer

476
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,559
and do nothing but read books
for about a month.

477
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:25,104
This was not planned, but I ended up
spending my summer like this here.

478
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,984
Mr. Moon, take a dip.

479
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,861
-It's so refreshing.
-No, I don't want to.

480
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,279
I don't like water. I hate water.

481
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,864
Jeez, why did you do that?

482
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,699
Wait, Sang-tae. Wait up!

483
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,290
Where are we headed?

484
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,084
You wanted to see
the mountains and fields.

485
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,877
Then I guess the mountains first?

486
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,563
Is this the deviation
you've been dreaming of?

487
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,359
Are we going to tie a rope
around our ankle and jump or something?

488
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:13,986
Shall we?

489
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,073
-Let's go.
-No.

490
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,325
Why not?

491
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,576
I'm scared.

492
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,789
-Why are you laughing?
-Well...

493
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,749
Hearing you say the word, "scared"--

494
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,834
You think it's funny?

495
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,336
Do you think it'll be fun
to cross this stupid bridge?

496
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,298
I just

497
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,802
wanted to come up high
and enjoy an open view.

498
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,055
I can't come here with Sang-tae.

499
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,894
I saw it, so it's all good now.

500
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,104
Let's go back down.

501
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,064
So you're saying

502
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,567
you can't hang out
with Sang-tae like this?

503
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,945
Okay, fine. Let's do this.

504
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,449
But carry me on your back.

505
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,706
Wait here. I'll be right back.

506
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,710
Hey! Carry me on your back!

507
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,546
I said, carry me!
Give me a piggyback ride!

508
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,090
Darn it. Crap.

509
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,220
Shit! It's shaky.

510
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,765
That's why it's called the Shaky Bridge.

511
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,392
Why is it freaking shaky?

512
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:28,978
Wait up.

513
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,314
Why don't you sing a song
if you're scared?

514
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,773
A song?

515
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,570
If I

516
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,406
Feel lonely

517
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,783
If I

518
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,701
Stop.

519
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,494
Why?

520
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,205
You sound scary.

521
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,331
Do you have a death wish?

522
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,335
If I

523
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,086
Gosh, I'm hungry.

524
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,671
What will you feed me?

525
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,758
Since we're in the mountains...

526
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,426
How about raw squid?

527
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,511
-What?
-Well, let's see.

528
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,096
Is there a good restaurant nearby?

529
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,356
Go stand over there.
I'll take a picture of you.

530
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,774
You said you're hungry.

531
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,275
Come on.

532
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,116
-Hurry up.
-Smile.

533
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,829
I told you to smile, not cry.

534
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,539
Just take it, will you?

535
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,251
Strike a cool pose.

536
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,346
Enough. I don't want photos.

537
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,765
Okay. If it's embarrassing,
I'll take it with you.

538
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,683
Sit back down.

539
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,310
Sit down.

540
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,897
One, two, three.

541
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,193
Smile. Don't cry.

542
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,372
Hello?

543
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,965
We were told to expect someone
who can help us from the west.

544
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,842
It was true.

545
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,177
My gosh.

546
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,389
What is going...

547
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,393
Can you explain this?

548
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,187
Oh, what happened was...

549
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,982
You know, I'm supposed
to stay out overnight tomorrow.

550
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,900
Can Jeong-tae go instead? Joo Jeong-tae.

551
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,571
A-reum!

552
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,824
We just got into a taxi

553
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,659
and said we'd go as far as we could.

554
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,370
That's why we ended up here.

555
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,332
181,800 WON

556
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,136
CHEAP GUESTHOUSE
300M

557
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,016
We spent all the money we had
on the taxi ride,

558
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,893
so we couldn't pay for the room.

559
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,812
-We're totally broke.
-That's right.

560
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,899
How did you get my number?

561
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,029
This reads,
"Call in case of an emergency."

562
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,076
EMERGENCY CONTACTS

563
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,828
Out of everyone here,
you're the closest to me.

564
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,957
Spending time with a patient
outside the hospital--

565
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,627
It's not allowed.
I know that it's against the rules.

566
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,837
So just lend us some money
to pay for the room.

567
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,090
It was hard for me to get out for a night.

568
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,218
I'll stay here with A-reum
just for the night

569
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,719
and return to the hospital tomorrow.

570
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,180
They also accept credit cards.

571
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,976
No, I can't do that.

572
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,145
-Why not?
-Why can't you?

573
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,939
Strictly speaking, this is all your fault.

574
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,149
Patients can't date one another,

575
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,276
so you told me
to just hold back my feelings.

576
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,487
-So I listened to you and did just that.
-Right.

577
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,115
But when A-reum's ex-husband
slapped Ms. Ko in the face,

578
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,575
-what did you do?
-He didn't hold himself back.

579
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,078
Well, in that moment--

580
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,205
Because you punched him,

581
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,332
A-reum's parents came to see her
at the hospital,

582
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,500
and they discharged her.

583
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,335
That means we will have to
part ways tomorrow.

584
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,214
And you can't even pay
for us to stay here for a night?

585
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,301
This is so cruel.

586
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,762
Very cruel, indeed.

587
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:35,724
Apologize to them.

588
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,894
It looks like it was your fault.

589
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,313
I paid for the room next to theirs.

590
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,776
Hey.

591
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,074
I told you that we can't stay overnight.

592
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,952
My gosh, are you Cinderella or what?

593
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,458
Sleep here by yourself.

594
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,002
I bet they'll elope tomorrow.

595
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,130
The woman will move to the States soon,

596
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,800
and the man has to return
to the psychiatric hospital tomorrow.

597
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,303
I mean, look at those eyes.

598
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,305
Do you think they can be apart?

599
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:20,728
Your rationality can never win
against your desires.

600
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,068
Will you let the patient run away?
How irresponsible.

601
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,865
Or will you break them apart
despite knowing how in love they are?

602
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:34,700
That's so cruel.

603
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,371
Let's just stay with them here tonight.

604
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,875
That way, you can take him back
to the hospital tomorrow.

605
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,335
Right, Mr. Caregiver?

606
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,137
I've been

607
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,014
suspended from work,

608
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,099
so I refuse to work.

609
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,072
See? We're so screwed.

610
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,865
We'll be okay, A-reum.

611
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,502
All right.

612
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,295
Do you guys know
when Gang-tae will be here?

613
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,673
It'd be nice if he could join us.

614
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,842
-Well, he'll get here pretty late.
-Did he get a part-time job again?

615
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,594
No, he had to meet someone.

616
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,512
Who?

617
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,639
Oh, I'm sure he's out
meeting up with people he knows.

618
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,599
He has lots of time
now that he's been suspended,

619
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,519
-so he's probably out clearing his head.
-Gosh, that's good.

620
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,647
When will he get to take it easy
if not now?

621
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,191
My gosh,
you've been grilling meat nonstop.

622
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,193
Here, Ju-ri. Have some.

623
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,736
I'll eat it myself.

624
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,533
Gosh, this is embarrassing.
Even my arm is getting tired.

625
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,076
Don't be like that. Just eat this.

626
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,077
Here.

627
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,912
Why are you being like this, seriously?

628
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,965
Are you enjoying working with Ms. Ko?

629
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,466
We will work later.

630
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,927
"Later" means sometime before you die.

631
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,804
What? Before you die?

632
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,391
Jeez, so she's working on a book
that will be published posthumously?

633
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,019
Gosh, Mun-yeong...

634
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,313
Have you two gotten quite close?

635
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,189
Yes, we're best friends now.

636
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,108
Best friends don't keep secrets
from each other.

637
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,068
Then you should've brought her.

638
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,362
I told her I'd love
to invite her over for a meal one day.

639
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,823
She said no.
She went somewhere fun by herself.

640
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,701
I... I would've been happy
to hang out with her.

641
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,620
You didn't want to hang out with me.

642
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,997
You're really hurting my feelings,
Sang-tae.

643
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,999
That's very odd.

644
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:50,002
She wouldn't want to go out in this heat.

645
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:53,172
Maybe they went together.
Ms. Ko and Mr. Moon Gang-tae.

646
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,063
You sure work in publishing.

647
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:14,151
You're incredibly creative, Seung-jae.

648
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,028
Right? She really is.

649
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,697
Hey, maybe I should have you sign
a publishing contract as a writer.

650
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,871
Well, how about a beer for everyone?

651
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,039
I'd love that.

652
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,248
I'll go.

653
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,464
I'll give her a hand.

654
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,637
Mr. Lee, do you mind picking up
some coffee milk for me?

655
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,680
You crazy little brat...

656
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,938
They're probably together now, right?

657
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,025
Gang-tae and Mun-yeong.

658
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,194
Not sure.

659
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,197
And who cares?

660
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,158
I mean, you're with me now.

661
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:12,751
I'm beginning to understand
why Mun-yeong has stuck around you

662
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,753
for so long.

663
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,839
That's a compliment, right?

664
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:24,054
But to tell you the truth,
it's actually the other way around.

665
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,390
I'm the one that's sticking around her.

666
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,059
Why?

667
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,230
Well...

668
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,401
Because she cannot be left alone.

669
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,989
She's very lonely.

670
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,368
But she doesn't want anyone to know that,

671
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,829
so she pushes people away.

672
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,956
She's complicated.

673
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,884
I have to say, they're so alike.

674
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,389
Do you think that's why
they're attracted to each other?

675
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,559
Ju-ri.

676
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,979
There can be countless reasons

677
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,648
as to why we fall for someone.

678
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,193
For example, you might fall for
how pretty they look when they cry.

679
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,113
Or you might fall for them
when they get drunk and swear at you.

680
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,158
Or it might be when they
unexpectedly slap you in the face.

681
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,041
Mr. Moon must've also

682
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,210
found some kind of reason

683
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,047
to fall for Mun-yeong.

684
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,569
The owner of this guesthouse said
we can drink this.

685
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,196
She made this fruit marmalade herself.

686
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,869
You haven't called him yet?
Shall I call him?

687
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:11,870
No, don't.

688
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,580
I'll go call him now.

689
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,346
Hey.

690
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,307
Did you eat dinner?

691
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,393
Yes, we had samgyeopsal.

692
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,186
My gosh, you guys must've had a feast.

693
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,896
What are you up to now?

694
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,856
What are you up to?

695
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,733
What? Me?

696
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,986
Well, I'm...

697
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,157
I'm chatting with you on the phone.

698
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,159
When will you be back?

699
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:55,539
Oh, I'll be back very late.

700
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,083
Around midnight? Or around 1 or 2 a.m.?

701
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:03,672
No, I may have to sleep here tonight.

702
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,925
Don't wait for me.
Just go to bed, Sang-tae.

703
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,221
And make sure you close the window screens
before you go to bed.

704
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,432
Don't sleep on the floor.

705
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,559
Also, make sure the fan is rotating.

706
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,396
If you get bored

707
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,648
or can't fall asleep, call me.

708
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,739
You too.

709
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,534
Call me if you get bored.

710
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,851
Oh, I've seen that face on TV dramas.

711
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,311
What do you mean?

712
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,688
The face of a man
who is cheating on his wife.

713
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,031
I don't want to be a mistress.

714
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,282
I want to be a faithful wife.

715
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,450
But those two

716
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,535
can't be best friends, can they?

717
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,751
Sang-tae was happy

718
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,337
about being best friends with you.

719
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,174
Well...

720
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,677
I'm also fond of your brother.

721
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:33,720
He's cute.

722
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,190
There was something

723
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,152
my mom wished for her whole life.

724
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,615
Seeing Sang-tae with a friend.

725
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,205
A real friend who truly understands him.

726
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,125
Just one.

727
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,299
I had a friend like that
a long time ago as well.

728
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,720
A friend who understands me.

729
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,611
THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES

730
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,991
-Nam Ju-ri!
-Nam Ju-ri!

731
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,702
-Nam Ju-ri!
-Nam Ju-ri!

732
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,288
-Nam Ju-ri!
-Nam Ju-ri!

733
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,124
-Nam Ju-ri!
-Nam Ju-ri!

734
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,417
-Nam Ju-ri!
-Gosh!

735
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,462
-Look at that!
-Hilarious!

736
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,629
What an idiot.

737
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,839
That girl

738
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,301
-was afraid of her classmates.
-Nam Ju-ri is a crybaby

739
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,512
-Nam Ju-ri is a crybaby
-Nam Ju-ri is a crybaby

740
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,724
-Nam Ju-ri is an idiot
-Nam Ju-ri is an idiot

741
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:01,933
But those kids

742
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,269
were afraid of me.

743
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:21,828
Get lost.

744
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,623
Hey. Shall we

745
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:27,501
become friends?

746
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,675
I liked it because I was no longer bored.

747
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,552
And she liked it

748
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,347
because her classmates
no longer bullied her.

749
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,976
But the thing is...

750
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,019
Ready or not!

751
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,897
-Rock-paper-scissors! I won!
-She didn't want just one friend.

752
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,234
She wanted to be everyone's friend.

753
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,736
And I

754
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,614
-didn't like that.
-We won!

755
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,283
So?

756
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,287
Did you harass those kids?

757
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,164
Yes.

758
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,917
I thought she'd only be friends with me

759
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,962
if she became lonely again.

760
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,713
Let's do it together.

761
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,681
What do you think? Did I do a good job?

762
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,117
But I was wrong.

763
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,339
Don't... Don't come close.

764
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,802
Go away.

765
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,639
I said, go away!

766
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,103
Please.

767
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,273
Please go away.

768
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,125
A friend who truly understands you

769
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,378
does not exist.

770
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,924
You should reconcile with her.

771
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:40,550
I don't want to.

772
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,014
-Why not?
-Because I have a best friend now.

773
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,811
And I also have you.

774
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,608
Hey.

775
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,235
Your cheeks are...

776
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,528
Goodness.

777
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,332
-What's wrong?
-This is booze.

778
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,249
What?

779
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,127
No, the lady said
it's raspberry marmalade.

780
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,505
I guess she didn't put in enough sugar.

781
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,716
No, Jeong-tae!

782
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,718
I won't drink this.

783
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,929
You saw me spitting it out just now.

784
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,568
Hey.

785
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,155
Go sleep in the other room

786
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,116
and send Jeong-tae here.

787
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,994
Those lovebirds
have to part ways tomorrow,

788
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,245
so just leave them be.

789
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,458
Don't turn your back on me.

790
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,389
I see that you smile a lot like an idiot

791
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,057
when you're drunk.

792
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,896
I have fun

793
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,857
when I'm with you.

794
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,612
I keep on smiling.

795
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,660
This won't do.

796
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,038
What do you mean?

797
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,834
-Hey.
-What's the matter?

798
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,919
-Come here.
-Why are you being like this?

799
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,880
-Who's more in love?
-Calm down, please.

800
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,965
The one who's more patient.

801
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,175
-Ko Mun-yeong!
-Moon Gang-tae!

802
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,218
Why?

803
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,639
Because love is all about patience.

804
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,284
Okay, fine. Let go of me now.

805
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,243
I'll just go to sleep.

806
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,082
I said I'll go to sleep.

807
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,139
Please.

808
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,892
Stay still and just go to sleep.

809
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,566
Come on. Just sleep.

810
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,570
I heard you can fall asleep easily

811
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,615
when someone caresses your hair.

812
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,870
CHEAP GUESTHOUSE

813
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,008
I told you

814
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,804
that I can no longer

815
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,808
hold myself back.

816
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,733
I guess

817
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,529
I can't run away anymore.

818
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:30,465
Don't go. Don't leave me, Mom.

819
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:34,552
Gang-tae, I'm here.

820
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,723
I'm here. Don't leave me.

821
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,749
Moon Gang-tae!

822
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,713
Moon Gang-tae!

823
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,305
Don't go.

824
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,015
Don't go...

825
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,904
MY BROTHER

826
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,748
The number you have dialed...

827
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,551
Moon Gang-tae!

828
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,346
Moon Gang-tae...

829
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:17,989
Where were you?

830
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:19,949
Well...

831
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,120
To get what I couldn't give you last time.

832
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,622
What?

833
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,346
Don't trample on them this time.

834
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:44,974
They're beautiful.

835
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:49,687
So are you.

836
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,747
Oh, you guys are still here.

837
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,249
The other couple
left early in the morning.

838
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,418
Pardon me?
Their shoes are still here though.

839
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:37,754
I have no idea.

840
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:42,884
Gang-tae.

841
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,813
With this, we can stay together for
a month without worrying about anything.

842
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,566
I thought we'd have to part ways
in the morning,

843
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,359
so I didn't get any sleep last night.

844
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,322
Who knew Ms. Ko would give us money
so that we could run away together?

845
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,073
Isn't she so cool?

846
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,288
-A-reum.
-What is it?

847
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,581
I really don't think

848
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,875
this is right.

849
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,835
What do you mean?

850
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,253
Running away like this

851
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,924
will turn our love into nothing
but a petty and cowardly act.

852
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,302
-What are you talking about?
-You see...

853
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,680
The truth is,
I still go crazy when I see alcohol.

854
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,308
Even last night,
I struggled to restrain myself.

855
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,144
Had you not been with me,

856
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,021
I would've drunk until I dropped.

857
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:39,273
I have not yet

858
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:42,944
recovered enough to take care of you

859
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,239
and be responsible for your happiness.

860
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:50,117
We can just try our best together.

861
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:03,256
No, I need to get through this on my own.

862
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,591
I will get through this.

863
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:08,302
I promise you that I'll fully recover

864
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,763
and come to you.

865
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,808
So please

866
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,063
wait for me. I won't take long.

867
01:04:57,018 --> 01:05:00,980
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

868
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,448
Thanks so much, Gang-tae.

869
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,325
I owe you one.

870
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,627
Is he a fool?

871
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,254
Why let her go if he loves her?

872
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,298
Because he loves her a lot.

873
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,801
Sometimes, that's why
you must let someone go.

874
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,804
So they broke up
because they love each other?

875
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:35,473
That's complete bullshit.

876
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,394
I will never let you go.

877
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:42,980
Don't be so sure of it.

878
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,399
You never know what could happen.

879
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,028
I'll go check in on Sang-tae.

880
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,572
Be quick.
I'll kill you if you take too long.

881
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:12,718
Are you serious?

882
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:15,429
Mr. Moon and Ms. Ko came together?

883
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:19,141
Yes, he must've been
that special someone from the west.

884
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:22,186
Thanks to them, A-reum and I
made some unforgettable memories.

885
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:23,187
Really?

886
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,899
That means they're seeing each other.

887
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,109
Yes.

888
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:30,403
It might be fun to plan a double wedding
down the road.

889
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,030
-Would you officiate our wedding?
-My gosh.

890
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,490
-Me?
-Yes.

891
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,709
It's almost done.

892
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,461
Why didn't you pick up?

893
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:48,629
What?

894
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,134
Oh, my phone is dead.

895
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:54,552
You called?

896
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,595
Yes, 4 times. No, 9... It was 17 times.

897
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,973
Why? Did something happen?

898
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,896
Where have you been? Where...

899
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,108
I told you

900
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,277
that I had to go to Seoul to see someone.

901
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:13,446
By yourself?

902
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,823
Yes, by myself.

903
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,495
I can change the water for you.

904
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,539
No, one must take care of one's own tasks.

905
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,541
One must take care of one's own tasks.

906
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,793
One must take care of one's own tasks.

907
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:44,810
Big news! You need to hear this.

908
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,607
Mr. O, please be quiet
when you're inside the hospital.

909
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,401
Gosh, whatever. That's not important now.

910
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,487
-Hey, follow me.
-Ms. Park.

911
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:58,240
I'm going to tell you something,
but you two must keep it to yourselves.

912
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,377
I'm starving. What's taking him so long?

913
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,527
Dr. Kwon, you're a psychiatrist,

914
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,278
so I can trust
that you're discreet, right?

915
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:37,988
Yes, sure.

916
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:43,285
What I'm about to tell you
must stay between us, okay?

917
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:49,708
Mr. Moon Gang-tae and Ms. Ko Mun-yeong
are getting married soon.

918
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,252
-What?
-Seriously, for real.

919
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:54,004
Apparently, Mr. Joo Jeong-tae
saw them on a trip together.

920
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:56,966
They even slept in the same room
at a guesthouse, so they're obviously...

921
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:27,746
My gosh, that looks amazing.

922
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,503
Did the three of you go on a trip
in a camping car?

923
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:36,255
No.

924
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,633
Then did you, by any chance,

925
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,303
run into Mr. Joo Jeong-tae
outside the hospital?

926
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,766
No, I ran into him
in front of the hospital.

927
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,059
You're lying.

928
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,941
I told you not to lie.

929
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,072
Sang-tae, what's the matter?

930
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:08,162
Who do you like more?
Me or Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

931
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,334
Why do you ask?

932
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,586
Who do you like more?
Me or Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

933
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:18,214
My gosh. He likes you more, of course.

934
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:22,176
I want you to answer my question.
Answer my question!

935
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,060
Of course,

936
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:35,397
I like you more.

937
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,988
No, that's a lie.

938
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:46,867
It's a lie. It's all a lie.

939
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,494
-No, I mean it.
-It's a lie.

940
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:49,828
I told you not to lie!

941
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:53,457
Don't lie to me! It's all a lie.

942
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,294
No.

943
01:10:58,587 --> 01:10:59,588
Sang-tae.

944
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:02,132
I'm not lying.

945
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:10,057
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

946
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:12,851
I won't do it again, okay?

947
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,687
"I want him to die.

948
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,274
My brother...

949
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,485
I just want my brother to die!

950
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:24,363
I just want my brother to die."
You said that.

951
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:28,158
You said you wanted me gone.

952
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:31,954
You said to Mom every day
that you wanted me to die.

953
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,999
That's why you pushed me into the river
that day.

954
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,002
I shouted for help.

955
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:41,422
I shouted... I kept crying for help,

956
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:42,631
but you ran away.

957
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,842
You left me alone in the water
and ran away.

958
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:48,053
You wanted me dead. Every single day...

959
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:51,598
I bet you wanted to kill me.

960
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,643
-No...
-Everyone.

961
01:11:55,269 --> 01:12:01,275
Listen, everyone!
He's trying to kill his older brother!

962
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,987
-No.
-Everyone!

963
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:08,157
He's trying to kill his older brother!

964
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,366
No...

965
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:16,707
Listen, people! He is...
He's trying to kill his older brother!

966
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:18,208
No, that's not true.

967
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,668
No...

968
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,129
-No...
-Listen, people!

969
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:28,886
Everyone,
He's trying to kill his older brother!

970
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:30,971
-No...
-Everyone, listen.

971
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,223
-No.
-My brother...

972
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:36,352
Listen,
he's trying to kill his older brother!

973
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:37,436
No, that's not true.

974
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:41,774
Listen to me.

975
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:45,944
-Sang-tae, no.
-He's trying to kill his older brother!

976
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:48,822
It's not true.

977
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,407
No, that's not true.

978
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:56,288
No, Sang-tae. That's not true.

979
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,665
I'm not lying.

980
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,876
Sang-tae.

981
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,211
Why did you save me?

982
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,588
You should've just left me to die.

983
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:50,884
Try your best to stay strong. Who knows?

984
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,387
Sang-tae might be the one
to help you one day.

985
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:54,430
I...

986
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:56,890
had a dream.

987
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:57,850
What you just said

988
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,227
sounds like you

989
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,354
begging me to stop you.

990
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:05,149
I miss him.

991
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:09,528
It seems like you know
a lot about Do Hui-jae.

992
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:12,614
Should I just kill him?

993
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:17,744
