1
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,770
Ko Mun-yeong.

2
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,815
Let me go.

3
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,526
Please. Let's talk--

4
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,778
It had three pairs of wings.

5
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,656
That mutant butterfly

6
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,242
is one of a kind.

7
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,749
It's the butterfly brooch
that my mom designed.

8
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,585
But what's that butterfly doing

9
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,964
in Sang-tae's mural?

10
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,510
No.

11
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,596
It's not what you think.

12
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,893
You should've said that
when I first asked.

13
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,855
I'm not running away.

14
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,318
So stop following me.

15
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,695
I need some time to think on my own.

16
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,824
Let's talk later.

17
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,363
Mr. Lee.

18
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,868
Can you check up on Mun-yeong?

19
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,998
I'll tell you the details in person.

20
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,334
Please do me a favor.

21
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,225
Hello?

22
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,523
Over here.

23
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,235
He went underneath the sink
and won't come out.

24
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,778
What's wrong with him?

25
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,244
What... What is that mommy

26
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,413
and baby butterfly doing there?

27
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,999
What... What are they doing in my mural?

28
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,918
Someone drew them.

29
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,003
No, that's not good.

30
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:32,921
Sang-tae.

31
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,090
Come on out.

32
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,677
The... The butterfly that killed my mom
came after me.

33
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,347
It... It came after me.

34
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,474
It came all the way here. Oh, no.

35
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,772
It's not a mommy

36
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,691
and baby butterfly.

37
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,278
It's a mutated butterfly
that has three pairs of wings.

38
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,864
"A... A mutated butterfly"?

39
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,119
So it's not the butterfly I saw?

40
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,037
No.

41
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,124
They're mutant butterflies,
but they're actually quite common.

42
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,379
I also saw a few in the garden.

43
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,382
I... I never saw one.

44
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,469
That's probably because
you're scared of butterflies.

45
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,472
Someone must've added it to your mural

46
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,308
because it's very interesting and unique.

47
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,728
Why... Why would someone do that
to my mural?

48
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,188
That's so rude.

49
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,524
I know, right?

50
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,987
I'll catch that person
and teach that person a lesson.

51
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,908
Now, come on out.

52
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,253
It's a different butterfly?

53
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,422
Sang-tae.

54
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,091
You promised me

55
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,677
that you won't run away

56
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,346
even if the butterfly appears.

57
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,890
Yes, I promised.

58
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,560
A promise isn't something you
can take so lightly,

59
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,020
so I won't run away.

60
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,525
But... But every time I see a butterfly,
I get a headache.

61
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:22,530
If you help me out a little,
I'll be able to overcome it.

62
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,658
Okay, I will.

63
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,285
You're amazing, Sang-tae.

64
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,621
Sang-tae.

65
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,292
Because of you,
your brother can't go to work,

66
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,377
and I can't cook lunch.

67
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,046
You're bothering everyone.

68
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,298
Okay. I'm... I'm sorry.

69
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,843
Can you take care of my brother today?

70
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,888
An apology won't cut it.

71
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,099
I want you to stay here
and be my assistant for the day.

72
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,017
Here.

73
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,898
Will... Will you pay me?

74
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,441
That depends on how hard you work.

75
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,610
It... It depends again?

76
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,322
I... I need to put down my bag
before I wear this.

77
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,866
-Oh, dear. Take it off.
-Oh, dear.

78
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:07,909
Oh, dear.

79
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,335
-Should we erase it?
-Yes.

80
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,669
What are you all doing there?

81
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,760
Apparently, Sang-tae wasn't the one
who painted this.

82
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,514
He kept shouting, saying he wants it gone,
so we're thinking of erasing it for him.

83
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,016
Yes, you should do that for him.

84
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:43,820
CHAPTER 14
THE HAND, THE MONKFISH

85
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,405
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

86
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,661
I saw the butterfly, too.

87
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,706
Someone must've done it as a joke
while I was gone on a business trip.

88
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,542
Let's check who it was.

89
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,503
What? What's Ms. Park doing there?

90
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,927
You should check out her books
when you have some time.

91
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,221
No, I wouldn't be able
to relate to those stories.

92
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,765
I like cruel and foolish love stories
or horror novels.

93
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,350
Does he like the Mom? Dooly's mom.

94
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,019
I gave it to Sang-tae as a gift.

95
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,897
Sang-tae and I have gotten quite close.

96
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,857
Did the three of you go on a trip
in a camping car?

97
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,942
My daughter...

98
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,114
I have to say,
with all the stuff she's been through,

99
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,867
Ms. Ko grew up pretty well.

100
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,425
Where did it go? I'm sure it was here.

101
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,718
Where did it go?

102
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,893
I'm sure it was here.

103
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,355
It was here.

104
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:45,942
Die.

105
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:50,404
Die, you... You monster.

106
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,322
You will

107
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,992
end up like your mother.

108
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,496
My mom

109
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,249
was murdered.

110
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,416
That butterfly...

111
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,003
That butterfly killed my mom.

112
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,548
That butterfly killed my mom.

113
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,762
I love you, my daughter.

114
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,599
You are my other self.

115
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,041
I'm so sorry.

116
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,838
I can't even look at you right now.
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,757
She was right in front of me,

118
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,177
but I had no idea.

119
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,932
I let that woman look after Sang-tae

120
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,730
and even thanked her for it.

121
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,443
It's all my fault. Don't blame yourself.

122
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,155
Now that we know who Do Hui-jae is,

123
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,407
we should focus on finding her
as soon as possible.

124
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,619
I'll ask the police
to start investigating.

125
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,954
You don't need to come to work
for a while.

126
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,956
Just stay with your brother and Ms. Ko.

127
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,547
But I wonder why she stayed
in the hospital for such a long time

128
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:37,303
when there are surveillance cameras
everywhere.

129
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,833
I had such a fun time.

130
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,797
Mr. Ko.

131
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,136
I...

132
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,139
no longer have

133
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,393
any regrets in life.

134
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:31,982
You have no regrets?

135
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,203
You told me you loved me.

136
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,250
How can you say that
when you told me you loved me?

137
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,836
You killed the woman you loved.

138
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,675
So you have no right
to die in peace, honey.

139
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,264
Don't you have anything to say to me?

140
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,768
It's been 20 years.

141
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,689
I've waited for 20 years.

142
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,153
What a pity.

143
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,165
Do you know

144
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,627
why I let you live?

145
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,217
Watching you live your life in pain
for such a long time

146
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,306
and seeing you die so miserably...

147
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,771
felt so exhilarating.

148
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,454
I had such a hard time, you know.

149
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,416
There are surveillance cameras everywhere.

150
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,920
And O Ji-wang, that cunning man,
is very quick-witted.

151
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,630
So I have to say,

152
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,799
it was very thrilling.

153
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,136
No.

154
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,348
No...

155
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,644
Don't do anything

156
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,772
to Mun-yeong.

157
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,692
You mean our beautiful daughter?

158
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,861
She grew up so well, didn't she?

159
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,989
You have no idea

160
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,452
how hard I tried to take care of her
all those days.

161
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,846
You said you want to die.

162
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,817
Well, let me help you.

163
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,913
Let go, you bastard! I'll kill you all!

164
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,081
Let go!

165
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,265
You should prove

166
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,934
that you're not a coward.

167
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,614
I put in so much effort
to make sure she became perfect.

168
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,117
But I really don't like

169
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,746
how she behaves these days.

170
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,670
Do you know what you need to do
to make children obey their parents?

171
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,301
They become extremely obedient

172
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,556
when you take away
what makes them the most happy.

173
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,937
No... Please...

174
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,745
Goodbye.

175
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,379
No...

176
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,132
No...

177
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,929
Mun-yeong...

178
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,484
Mun-yeong.

179
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,611
Mun-yeong.

180
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,535
Mun-yeong.

181
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,287
Mun-yeong.

182
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,377
Mun-yeong.

183
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,504
-What do you want?
-What?

184
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,507
I was just wondering if you're doing okay.

185
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,176
I'm never okay.

186
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,929
You came running here to ask me that?

187
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,725
No, not exactly.

188
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,477
I wanted to know
how you're doing with your new book,

189
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,979
so I dropped by to check.

190
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,939
I sent you the manuscript
via email this morning.

191
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,316
Oh, really?

192
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,112
I can't believe you're already done
with the draft. You're amazing.

193
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,824
You really do get things done quickly
once you start concentrating.

194
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,118
What do you think? Is it fun?

195
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,369
Is it a masterpiece?

196
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,543
All my works are a masterpiece.

197
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,380
Yes, right.

198
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,424
You should go.

199
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,510
I stayed up all night to finish it,
so I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap.

200
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,430
Okay. You did great.

201
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,891
Get some sleep. I'll be off now.

202
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,158
Hey.

203
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,242
Goodness.

204
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,537
No, she's not okay at all.
It looks really bad.

205
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,874
She's never looked at me
with a smile on her face.

206
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,627
I have a bad feeling about this.

207
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,171
I'll wait right here.

208
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,215
So come and tell me what happened.

209
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,258
Okay.

210
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,469
I'll be right there.

211
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,556
Gang-tae.

212
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,477
I... I made 30,000 won today
for working part-time.

213
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,145
No, this is my snack.

214
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,815
Here. It's your allowance.
It's 10,000 won.

215
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,359
And here's 10,000 won for Mun-yeong.

216
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,485
This is mine.

217
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,155
It's okay. You can have it all.

218
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,658
You don't want allowance?

219
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,165
Sang-tae, let me give you a ride.

220
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,752
Can you stay at the rooftop house
for a while?

221
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,506
All... All by myself? Why?

222
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,593
Did... Did you guys fight?

223
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,888
You... You fought with Mun-yeong again,
didn't you?

224
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,182
Yes.

225
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,686
I made a mistake.

226
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,230
So she's really angry.

227
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,774
I need to ask her to forgive me.

228
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,527
I... I told you guys not to fight.

229
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,281
Did I or did I not tell you
that it's better to kiss than to fight?

230
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,369
I'll call you after we make up.

231
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,371
Let's go.

232
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,501
Just... Just say you're sorry.

233
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,920
Be... Be polite. You need to be polite.

234
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,381
If you're polite,
you won't get scolded as much.

235
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,591
Okay.

236
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,510
FIRST FLOOR NURSES' STATION

237
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,805
I wonder who drew that butterfly
on the wall.

238
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,599
Mr. O.

239
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,977
When is Ms. Park coming back
from her vacation?

240
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,730
I hope she never comes back.

241
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,566
She took five days off.

242
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,573
Don't you think she might be burned-out

243
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,242
because of what happened
to Mr. Ko Dae-hwan?

244
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,579
I'm not sure.

245
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,291
Gosh, how strange.

246
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,210
FIRST FLOOR LOBBY STAIRWAY

247
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,629
Why can't I find the CCTV footage
of the lobby stairway?

248
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:18,175
I had to send the video file somewhere,
so I moved it to a flash drive.

249
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,552
-Who is it for?
-You don't need to know.

250
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,055
Ms. Nam, can we talk?

251
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,390
Okay.

252
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,061
File her resignation?

253
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,022
Why? Is Ms. Park sick?

254
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,443
You'll soon find out why.

255
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,904
I know it's going to be hard,

256
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,158
but I'd like you to oversee the nurses

257
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,746
since you've been
working here the longest.

258
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,874
And make sure the patients
don't get stirred up by this.

259
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,085
Okay.

260
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,129
My goodness.

261
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,382
Thank you.

262
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,969
Director O.

263
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,972
Yes?

264
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,225
If something's bothering you,

265
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,020
you should drink and talk with my mom
like you did in the past.

266
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,773
Don't just keep it to yourself.

267
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,735
I'll do that as much as I want

268
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,029
once I become jobless soon.

269
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,663
"Jobless"?

270
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,250
Is he planning to retire?

271
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,142
I can't believe this.

272
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,811
How could there be
such an ill-fated relationship?

273
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,192
Do you think we are ill-fated?

274
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,445
Then what else would you call this?

275
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,742
Don't tell me you're going to stay
with Mun-yeong

276
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,078
even after you found out what happened.

277
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,747
I am.

278
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,042
Mun-yeong is...

279
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,128
She's just Ko Mun-yeong to me.

280
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,589
Not Do Hui-jae's daughter.

281
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,896
Do Hui-jae

282
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,857
was born into a prestigious family
of doctors.

283
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,194
But for some reason,

284
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,237
she dropped out of med school
on her third year

285
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,281
and picked up a pen instead of a scalpel.

286
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,659
After she got married,
she cut ties with everyone in her family,

287
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,038
stayed in this castle,
and did nothing but write.

288
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,335
Goodness.
I've known Mun-yeong for ten years.

289
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,755
But this is all I know.

290
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,259
She went through
such a terrible childhood,

291
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,679
but people from publishing companies
bothered her

292
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,223
day and night.

293
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,312
They wanted publishing rights
for the final book

294
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,189
of the series her mother wrote,

295
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,608
The Murder of the Witch of the West.

296
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,985
They were like a bunch of pests.

297
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,489
What happened to the last book?

298
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,784
As you already know,
it never got published.

299
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,830
The final draft just disappeared.

300
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,526
Mun-yeong.

301
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,823
Did my mom...

302
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,621
really kill...

303
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,669
your mother?

304
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,884
The butterfly that tormented your brother
all his life

305
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,638
and made your life miserable...

306
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,102
Was that really my mom?

307
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,288
It's not true, right?

308
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,169
I'm mistaken, right?

309
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,882
That can't be true.

310
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,357
Since when did you know?

311
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,445
I only recently found out.

312
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:36,970
Mun-yeong.

313
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,222
Listen carefully.

314
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,350
You're not like your mom.

315
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,480
No matter what happens,

316
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,233
I won't leave you.

317
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,946
To me,

318
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,242
you're just Ko Mun-yeong, the girl I liked

319
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,870
ever since I was a boy.

320
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,381
Hypocrite.

321
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,584
Gosh, this sly fox
is ignoring my calls again.

322
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,462
Jae-su, have some instant noodles.

323
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,590
Sang-tae.

324
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,052
Are you sure Gang-tae sent you here

325
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,055
because Ko Mun-yeong is pissed at him?

326
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,809
I mean, that sounds like a big fat lie.

327
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,438
The soft-boiled egg is for you,
the hard-boiled egg is for me.

328
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,947
I feel like they sent you here

329
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,160
so they could spend time
doing intimate and romantic stuff

330
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,788
while you're gone.

331
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,166
Jae-su.

332
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,084
Right? Do you agree?

333
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,963
She looked sad. It was a sad expression.

334
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:18,840
What?

335
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,719
Mun-yeong's face...

336
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,390
The expression on her face...

337
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,727
She was scared.

338
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,521
She was sad.

339
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,275
Why?

340
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,320
Why did she look that way?

341
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,660
What brings you here?

342
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,123
Ju-ri asked me to check up on you.

343
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,959
She told me you seem to be
going through something.

344
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,211
My goodness.

345
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,216
She must've learned a few things
while working at the psychiatric hospital.

346
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,220
What is it?
Are you really going to retire?

347
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,973
A part of me wants to, and a part of me
feels like I'll be asked to.

348
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,229
I can't seem to do anything
after having been betrayed

349
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,816
by someone I really trusted.

350
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,778
You say you can't do anything,
but you look like you're doing fine.

351
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,613
What happened?

352
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:29,452
I put on airs,
thinking that I knew everything.

353
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,913
I kept Ms. Ko and Sang-tae here,

354
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,041
thinking that this place

355
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,794
will help them heal and get better.

356
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,671
But it only ended up hurting them.

357
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,798
What should I do, Sun-deok?

358
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,050
I feel so bad for them.

359
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,264
Gosh, I thought I should know better
at this age.

360
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,061
Adults can't always be right.

361
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,148
We make mistakes until the day we die.

362
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,819
You can't always save people
just because you're a doctor.

363
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,112
You're not Jesus Christ.

364
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,159
"It's okay to not be okay."

365
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,120
It says it right there.

366
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,582
Sun-deok.

367
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,502
Do you want to be the next director?

368
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:24,048
My goodness. Next director, my ass.

369
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,106
-I'm home.
-Hey, welcome home.

370
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,402
Let's have rice balls for dinner tonight.

371
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,863
That sounds great.

372
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,283
But are you making rice balls
for volunteer work or something?

373
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,242
Why are there so many?

374
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,537
Once we're done,
we just need to put them in the freezer.

375
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,664
And whenever you get hungry,
just microwave them.

376
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,042
It's the best
when you can't be bothered to cook.

377
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:03,338
I need to deliver these
to Ms. Ko's place tomorrow.

378
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,216
What? Why... Why would you go there?

379
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,261
I heard Sang-tae will be
staying at the rooftop house for a while.

380
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,889
That obviously means

381
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:17,310
something is going on
between Gang-tae and Mun-yeong.

382
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,189
And I'm pretty sure
they'll skip their meals.

383
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,983
I don't know what's going on,

384
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,526
but when you're having a hard time,

385
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,863
food is what gets you going,
not your mentality.

386
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,452
Ma'am...

387
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,667
I... I respect you so much.
I really love you.

388
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,335
What's wrong with him?

389
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,672
Either eat your food, cry,

390
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,675
or tell her that you like her.
Just do one.

391
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:54,931
It's delicious.

392
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,142
Here.

393
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,449
Can we talk when you're done eating?

394
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,203
Sure, of course.

395
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,838
Can I come in?

396
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,797
Yes.

397
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,219
Take a seat.

398
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,554
Oh, okay.

399
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,349
My gosh, I'm getting all nervous
for some reason.

400
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,185
Yes, please sit down.

401
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,271
What did you want to talk about?

402
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,567
Well, do you think it'll be okay?

403
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,111
Pardon? What do you mean?

404
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,696
Well,

405
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,408
it was weird to just leave
the hospital like that this morning.

406
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,660
I keep calling, but there's no answer.

407
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,705
I'm just really worried.

408
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,540
Do you know what's going on?

409
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:06,711
Well, I don't think you need
to be worried.

410
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,921
How could I not worry?

411
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:09,881
Ju-ri.

412
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,925
Enough already.

413
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,762
-Sorry?
-How much longer

414
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,930
will you go on about Moon Gang-tae?

415
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,724
I mean, I get it.

416
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,685
Whenever I think about him,
even I can't help but worry,

417
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,729
and my heart aches for him.

418
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:25,646
No.

419
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,607
I'm talking about Mun-yeong.

420
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:33,571
I can't stop worrying about her.

421
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,202
I really like you.

422
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,373
Right. To be honest, I also

423
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:45,833
like...

424
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,294
Mun-yeong.

425
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,718
My gosh, how lovely.

426
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,596
The friendship between you two is...

427
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:03,059
Oh, gosh. What I ate earlier is giving me
an upset stomach.

428
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,478
Please excuse me.

429
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,271
Get some rest.

430
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,956
Hey, is everything okay?

431
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,167
Call me if you're bored.

432
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,433
JU-RI

433
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,820
I was devastated

434
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,406
just like you are now.

435
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,830
I kept denying it
because I just didn't want to believe it.

436
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,584
"Why is it

437
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,463
that things like this only happen to me?"

438
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,969
I deeply resented it.

439
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,851
But none of that matters.

440
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,146
When I see you

441
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,610
smile at me,

442
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,073
I forget everything else.

443
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,286
The butterfly

444
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,123
and even my mom.

445
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,168
I forget everything else

446
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,715
except for the two of us.

447
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,845
You see, Mun-yeong...

448
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,390
You didn't do anything wrong.

449
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,102
That goes for all of us.

450
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,360
We did nothing wrong.

451
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:51,560
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

452
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,407
Do you want to grab a drink with me?
It's been a while.

453
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,034
No, I don't want to drink
with an old fart.

454
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,454
Must you talk so rudely to your father?

455
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,041
What's going on? What's gotten into you?

456
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,420
Hey, you never spend time with me.

457
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,716
Since when did you care about me?

458
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,426
When I pestered you to hang out with me,

459
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,094
you always spent time with your patients.

460
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,597
I tend to neglect those
who are close to me, you know.

461
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,517
Cut me some slack.

462
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,276
What do you want? Soju or beer?

463
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,072
Makgeolli.

464
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,658
Sure, whatever.

465
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:52,955
Cha-yong.

466
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,462
I'm sorry.

467
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:14,393
I have something

468
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:21,650
To say to you

469
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:28,532
I have something

470
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:35,748
To say to you tonight

471
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:42,129
I will give

472
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,095
Everything to you

473
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,726
I will give you

474
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:02,733
My heart full of love

475
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,865
If it is for you

476
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:15,579
There is nothing I cannot do

477
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:23,337
I will present to you the stars

478
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:29,635
So that you can hold them in your hands

479
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,684
I have something

480
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:43,566
To give you

481
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:51,323
I have something

482
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:58,164
To give you tonight

483
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,028
Jeez, Jae-su is killing me.

484
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,739
He's been snoring nonstop. So loud!

485
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,657
Gosh.

486
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,164
What?

487
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,834
No calls?

488
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,590
Have they not made up yet?

489
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,512
They'd better make up soon
so that I can go home.

490
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:08,776
KO MUN-YEONG

491
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:16,492
The number you have dialed
is not available...

492
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,620
Gosh, should I just stop by her place?

493
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,581
Ju-ri, I'm going to order some coffee.

494
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,084
-Do you want some coffee too?
-I want an iced Americano coffee.

495
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,752
Oh, I'll get a latte.

496
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,634
An iced Americano coffee and a latte.

497
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,427
Done.

498
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,642
I haven't seen Mr. Moon since yesterday.

499
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,894
He took some time off.

500
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:44,812
What?

501
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,105
Out of the blue?

502
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,066
-Really?
-Why do you ask?

503
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,906
Because of what happened a while ago,

504
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,034
I wanted to treat him to a nice meal
or something.

505
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,287
You can do that when he's back.

506
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,669
By the way, did anyone call for me?

507
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,838
Who?

508
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:13,632
Your father?

509
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,217
Yes.

510
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,679
What would you like us to do if he calls?

511
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,392
Well...

512
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,103
I'll talk to him.

513
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,896
-Okay, got it.
-Thanks.

514
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,024
Have a good day.

515
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:32,985
Gosh.

516
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,656
I hope she's not thinking
of donating her liver to him.

517
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:39,950
Who knows?

518
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:45,164
By the way, why did Mr. Moon
suddenly ask for time off?

519
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,886
Ko Mun-yeong.

520
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:02,931
Let me in.

521
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,210
Some strange things

522
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,963
have happened around your father.

523
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,882
That's how I found out about it.

524
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,135
The fact that your mother

525
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,388
is alive.

526
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,766
Park Ok-ran.

527
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,144
Is that patient my mom?

528
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,939
Is that why

529
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,817
you came to me that night?

530
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:56,693
No.

531
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,240
It's

532
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,868
the head nurse from the hospital.

533
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:06,829
What?

534
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,748
Park Haeng-ja.

535
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:12,918
Yesterday,

536
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,131
she drew the butterfly on Sang-tae's mural

537
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,716
and disappeared.

538
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,677
That can't be.

539
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,263
That woman is my mom?

540
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,890
I know that almost two decades
have passed,

541
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,768
but even if she'd had plastic surgery
all over her face,

542
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,689
I would've recognized her.

543
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,862
Both your father

544
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,698
and Director O

545
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,702
have known her for so long

546
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,998
but had no idea.

547
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:56,712
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

548
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:00,799
The director would like to speak
with the patient's guardian.

549
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,013
No way.

550
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,310
The butterfly brooch in the basement
is gone too.

551
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,645
I'm sure it was there.

552
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,231
That means Mom was here.

553
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,734
She's been watching Dad

554
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,944
as well as us, right by our side.

555
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,738
She's been watching everything.

556
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,574
Leave! Get out of this house immediately.

557
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,867
Get out! Now!

558
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,160
Ko Mun-yeong.

559
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,831
I will never leave you
when you're here all alone.

560
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,791
I promised I'd protect you.

561
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,376
No, you can't protect me.

562
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,670
So go protect your brother. Please!

563
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,923
Leave! Please!

564
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,508
Get out!

565
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,388
Please run...

566
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,768
How is this possible...

567
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,646
Please, I beg you.

568
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,065
Please.

569
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,722
Hey, it's... It's me, your brother.

570
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,726
Is... Is Mun-yeong okay?

571
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,147
Is she still really mad at you?

572
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,943
You guys haven't made up yet?

573
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,243
Mun-yeong

574
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,496
is not feeling well.

575
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,623
She's not feeling well?

576
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,459
What's wrong with her?
Is she feeling sick?

577
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,006
When you're in physical pain, you cry.

578
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:07,342
But if your heart is aching,
you whimper like a dog when you sleep.

579
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,264
Is... Is she whimpering like that?

580
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,182
Yes.

581
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,644
I hear those whimpers.

582
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,480
Oh, no. What do we do?

583
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,360
She's not been let off the leash?

584
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:31,158
You can...
You can just cut it off for her.

585
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,411
-Sang-tae.
-Yes?

586
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,456
Sang-tae.

587
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:39,750
Hey.

588
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,586
Are you... Are you crying?

589
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,174
No.

590
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:49,885
I'm okay.

591
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,263
She'll be fine,

592
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:55,891
so don't worry.

593
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,915
I'll deliver...

594
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,751
I'll... I'll go.

595
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,961
Would you?

596
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,923
But you said you can't go there
until Gang-tae calls you.

597
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,591
That's right. You don't have to come.

598
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,927
I'll go with Seung-jae.
We'll be back in no time.

599
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,137
I have work to do.

600
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,224
No, I... I have to go there.

601
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,644
Ms. Kang,
do you know how to make porridge?

602
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,354
The kind that people eat when they're ill?

603
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:43,980
Porridge? Why?

604
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,441
-Enjoy your coffee.
-Thank you.

605
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,943
Thank you.

606
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,319
Thanks for the coffee.

607
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:55,200
How come I haven't seen Mr. Moon
for the last couple of days?

608
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,452
-He took some time off.
-I see.

609
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,247
I wanted to brag about these to him.

610
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,877
My gosh, Ms. Lee A-reum is so pretty.

611
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,963
Is she doing well in the US?

612
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,174
I want to be discharged soon
so that I can go see her.

613
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,636
Oh, please let me know
when Mr. Moon is back.

614
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,979
Mr. Moon is so popular
among all the patients.

615
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,899
Right? Ju-ri also had
the biggest crush on him, you know.

616
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,569
Excuse me. We're from
the police department.

617
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,696
We're here to speak with Director O.

618
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,907
Come with me. This way, please.

619
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,954
What's going on?
What are the police doing here?

620
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,332
Are they here because of Ms. Park Ok-ran?

621
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,594
Sang-tae. Slow down.

622
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,928
Wait up. Be careful!

623
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:58,930
Jeez.

624
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:01,683
Sang-tae!

625
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,400
Why did you bring Sang-tae?
He'll get all worried.

626
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,153
I always act like I believe your lies,

627
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,407
but not this time.
I can't let you get away with this.

628
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,285
What do you mean?

629
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,121
Just put it away. Let's get out of here.

630
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,373
I feel smothered here.

631
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,971
Mun-yeong, are you feeling sick?

632
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,267
Aren't you hungry at all?

633
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:48,146
I... I brought you some porridge.

634
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,565
This isn't store-bought.

635
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,818
Ms. Kang made this veggie porridge.

636
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,362
Leave.

637
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,073
You should leave, Sang-tae.

638
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,285
You need to have some porridge
to get well soon.

639
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,330
You like quail eggs, Mun-yeong.

640
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:08,500
I'll feed you, okay?

641
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,378
You're not feeling well today,

642
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,840
so it's okay to be fed like a little baby.

643
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,552
Sang-tae.

644
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,679
Yes?

645
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,181
I'm sorry.

646
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:25,934
It's my fault.

647
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,353
Forgive me.

648
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:32,899
Forgive you?

649
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:38,029
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

650
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:44,327
If you want to apologize for something,
you have to look at the person and say it.

651
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,539
It's rude to just say sorry
without even looking at the person.

652
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,107
Here, have some.

653
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,744
Forgive me.

654
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,790
Okay. I'll forgive you if you eat this.
Here.

655
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,258
My arm is getting tired, Mun-yeong.
Come on. Have some.

656
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,724
Yes! Good girl.

657
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,060
Look at you. You seem to like it.

658
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,520
My gosh, you're such a good girl.

659
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:56,816
How about just three more spoons?
Just three more, okay?

660
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,279
When you're feeling sick,
it's very important to chew well

661
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,822
to make sure you can digest it.

662
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,824
Mun-yeong, you're such a good girl.

663
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:08,453
Here. Good job.

664
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,501
Don't fight with Gang-tae.

665
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,337
You two should just make up.

666
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,258
A kiss is better than a fight.

667
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,301
Okay?

668
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,105
Don't cry.

669
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,149
I guess you're feeling very ill,
Mun-yeong.

670
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,695
You must've been feeling really ill.

671
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,321
I'll give you some more.

672
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,408
I'm sorry, Sang-tae.

673
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,951
All right. You ate this,

674
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,703
so I will forgive you.

675
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,580
Just two... Two more spoons.

676
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,374
Good girl.

677
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,470
So that butterfly

678
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,473
was drawn on Sang-tae's mural.

679
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,475
Ko Mun-yeong

680
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,061
freaked out and ran away
as soon as she saw that,

681
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,690
and you've been trying to look after her

682
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,151
all by yourself,
looking utterly distraught.

683
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:31,619
Is the butterfly

684
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,334
her mother?

685
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,053
That was the conclusion I arrived at
after racking my brain all night.

686
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:50,764
I guess I'm right.

687
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,770
-Don't tell Sang-tae--
-Of course I won't, dude.

688
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,272
I'm not that dumb.

689
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,652
Thanks.

690
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,615
And I'm sorry.

691
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,744
Gang-tae.

692
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,496
Yes?

693
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,039
Just accept it.

694
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,708
Then you'll feel much more at ease.

695
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,001
Accept what?

696
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,587
The fact that you're weak.

697
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,515
You're not strong at all.

698
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,391
You're a total weakling.

699
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,269
Both you and that woman, Ko Mun-yeong.

700
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,606
It's always those who are weak
that act all tough.

701
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,024
I can't stand it.

702
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,944
Since you're so weak,

703
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:50,156
you can't just walk away from weak people.

704
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,244
You want to lean on them, and vice versa.

705
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,122
That's why weaklings are
attracted to each other like magnets.

706
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,583
So you'd better stick together.

707
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,963
You weaklings should join forces
and stick together.

708
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,008
Then you guys will become invincible.

709
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,181
I'm sure you've heard of the saying,

710
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:18,935
"United we stand,

711
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,980
divided we are dead meat."

712
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,860
President Kim Dae-jung said that.

713
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,119
President Rhee Syng-man.

714
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,996
Not President Kim Dae-jung.

715
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,375
Oh, is that right?

716
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,377
I guess I was wrong again.

717
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:04,230
She had five spoons of the porridge.
Five spoons.

718
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,316
I fed her.

719
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,277
Thank you.

720
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,613
You're the best, Sang-tae.

721
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,325
By the way,
did Mun-yeong do something very bad?

722
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:16,743
What?

723
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,579
She kept saying sorry.

724
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,374
She kept crying, asking me to forgive her.

725
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,420
I said to her that
I'd forgive her if she ate the porridge,

726
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,505
and she did.

727
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,341
So I forgave her.

728
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,181
Really?

729
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,099
Yes, I gave her my forgiveness.

730
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,726
You did?

731
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:49,817
By the way,

732
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,820
are you feeling sick too?

733
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:58,993
Sang-tae.

734
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,374
Give me a hug.

735
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:08,586
Come here.

736
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,344
And...

737
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,514
pat me on the back.

738
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,058
Okay.

739
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:27,981
Sang-tae.

740
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,524
Yes?

741
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,027
I'm scared.

742
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,947
What? You're scared?

743
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:39,409
That's because you're the younger one.
The little brother.

744
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,331
Will you protect us?

745
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:49,502
I'm older than you guys,
so I'll protect you both.

746
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,921
I'm your guardian.

747
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,218
I'm relieved.

748
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,682
Thank goodness
I have a big brother like you.

749
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,285
You'd better not ignore my calls.
I'll be really mad.

750
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,286
Okay, I won't.

751
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,455
Call me when Mun-yeong is feeling better.

752
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,998
She needs to check my homework.

753
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,416
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

754
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:29,959
-Bye.
-Get back safely.

755
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,044
All right.

756
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,549
THE HAND, THE MONKFISH

757
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,645
"Once upon a time,

758
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,647
a beautiful baby girl

759
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,025
was born into a wealthy family.

760
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,531
She was as beautiful
and flawless as magnolias.

761
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,908
Her mother loved her so much

762
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,286
that she pledged she'd do anything
for her baby.

763
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,874
She said she would even present to her
the sun and the moon.

764
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,672
When the baby started eating solid foods,

765
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,175
her mother was thrilled.

766
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,303
'My sweet child.

767
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:08,182
I will feed you
everything you want to eat.

768
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,810
Open your mouth wide.

769
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,439
Like this.'

770
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,987
When the baby started walking,

771
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,823
her mother ran hurriedly to where she was.

772
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,659
'My sweet child.

773
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,370
I will carry you.

774
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,082
Come on. Hop on my back.'

775
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,962
After raising the baby
by always providing her

776
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,924
with everything she needed,
the mother said this.

777
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,262
'My beloved child.

778
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:50,224
I need some rest now.

779
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,144
Can you

780
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,481
get me some food?'

781
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,985
Then the child spoke.

782
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:06,657
'Mom, I have no hands.

783
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,453
I never used them,

784
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,955
so they've vanished.'

785
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,794
'Then my sweet child,

786
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,047
can you carry me on your back?

787
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,509
My legs hurt.'

788
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,221
Then the child said this.

789
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:34,852
'Mom, I have no feet.

790
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,564
You always carried me on your back,

791
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,235
so I've never even stepped on the ground.

792
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:48,157
But instead, I have a huge mouth.'

793
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:55,248
And she opened her humongous mouth.

794
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,505
Then the mother shouted in anger.

795
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:08,886
'You weren't my perfect baby after all.

796
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,764
You're like a useless monkfish.

797
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,518
All you can do is eat what I feed you.

798
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,312
You can't do anything on your own.
You're an utter failure.'

799
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:25,528
Then the mother threw the baby
into the faraway sea.

800
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:33,828
Ever since that day,
it's been said that fishermen can hear

801
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:38,958
a baby's cry on spooky, windy days
out on the sea.

802
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:44,589
'Mom.

803
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:47,675
Mom.

804
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,762
What did I do wrong?

805
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,141
Please

806
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,060
come and get me.

807
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:01,689
Please

808
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,275
come back

809
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,236
and get me.'"

810
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,593
This book was your only failure,

811
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,554
but it's my favorite one
out of everything you've written.

812
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,601
Since you're a writer too,
I'm sure you're well aware of this.

813
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,729
All failures

814
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,773
must be discarded.

815
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:55,219
MYSTERY CRIME FICTION
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST

816
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,404
SUICIDE BOMBER

817
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,582
It's been a while.

818
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:28,794
I know I owe you one.

819
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,173
I'd really like to repay you.

820
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,387
I'll give you something to write about.
It's been too long.

821
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:41,682
Mr. Lee!

822
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,143
We have a huge problem!

823
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:46,937
Mr. Lee!

824
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:49,857
Lee Sang-in!

825
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:51,859
Sang-in!

826
01:07:58,407 --> 01:07:59,617
Hey, Mun-yeong.

827
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:02,453
What is it?

828
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:04,038
What?

829
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,916
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST
TO BE RELEASED SOON

830
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,127
Darn it. What the heck is going on?

831
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,840
SANGSANGESANG WILL PUBLISH
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST 10

832
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,219
What do we do, Mr. Lee?

833
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:22,264
Everyone is calling me to ask
if we're actually publishing

834
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:23,849
the final book of the series.

835
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,018
Who published
the first article about this?

836
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:29,188
The newspaper company
Suicide Bomber is signed with.

837
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,314
Suicide Bomber?

838
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:32,608
Isn't he the critic
Mun-yeong pushed down the stairs?

839
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:36,445
Just answer the calls.

840
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:37,947
Tell everyone that it's true.

841
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,576
Have you lost your mind?

842
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,246
You'll go to jail if you get caught
for telling such a lie.

843
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,414
Please don't make a mess
you can't clean up.

844
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,292
I'll take care of everything,
so just do as I say.

845
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,585
I have to go see Mun-yeong.

846
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,631
Damn it. This is nuts, Mun-yeong!

847
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,285
Come to me.

848
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:26,829
Mom.

849
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:31,876
SANGSANGESANG WILL PUBLISH
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST 10

850
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:39,341
MR. LEE

851
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:43,345
Hello.

852
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,182
I read the article.

853
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:56,567
My gosh.

854
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,445
Yes, hello.

855
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:02,740
Hello!

856
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:10,289
How have you been?

857
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,749
Well, pretty good.

858
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,919
Ms. Park, you look so beautiful today.

859
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:18,797
You... You look like a different person.

860
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:19,882
Really?

861
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:23,886
I bet you didn't recognize me.

862
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:25,971
No, I didn't.

863
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:31,227
That's right.
I'm a different person today.

864
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,486
MY BROTHER

865
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,595
SANG-TAE

866
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:26,323
Hey, why... Just why?

867
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,285
What's with that crazy article?
What were you thinking?

868
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,828
Why cause trouble?

869
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:32,413
You know

870
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,374
that I'm not the type to wait patiently.

871
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,626
I know

872
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:40,838
exactly what to do to provoke my mom

873
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,840
and have her come to me.

874
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,551
Mun-yeong, please.

875
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:48,637
Gang-tae

876
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,098
can't catch the butterfly

877
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:53,559
because he is

878
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:55,686
a coward.

879
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,397
I have to do it.

880
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,358
Yes, you're right.

881
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:05,154
Do Hui-jae contacted me.

882
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,825
-She told me to bring the manuscript.
-To where?

883
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,785
I'll meet her alone. You just stay here--

884
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:14,621
No, she's after me.

885
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,207
Where are you meeting her?

886
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,210
-Mun-yeong.
-I asked you where you're meeting her.

887
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:22,880
Sang-tae!

888
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,186
SANG-TAE

889
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,396
-Sang-tae, where are you--
-Oh, Mr. Moon.

890
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:49,031
You're always looking for your brother.

891
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:51,742
Sang-tae.

892
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:53,994
Sang-tae.

893
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:56,497
Sang-tae.

894
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:57,956
Sang-tae!

895
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,333
Sang-tae!

896
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:01,543
If you hurt him,

897
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:03,962
I will not forgive you.

898
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,841
Only those who did something wrong
seek forgiveness.

899
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,885
I didn't do anything wrong.

900
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,137
Where can I meet you?

901
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,140
The cursed castle.

902
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,913
Are you really going to be okay
on your own?

903
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:38,997
Yes.

904
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:41,375
Please take Mun-yeong

905
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,669
somewhere far away.

906
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:45,754
Take her as far as you can go.

907
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:49,425
So where are you supposed to meet her?

908
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:50,801
What?

909
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:52,928
We're almost there.

910
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,558
Where are you meeting her?

911
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:10,571
Stop the car.

912
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,657
I said, stop the car. Now!

913
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:16,285
Ko Mun-yeong,
please listen to me this time.

914
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:17,619
You must not go there.

915
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,205
-Stop the car. I said, stop!
-Mun-yeong!

916
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:22,875
Gang-tae is there alone.

917
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,668
He's there all alone!

918
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,004
-Pull over. Now.
-Mun-yeong, don't do this.

919
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:29,089
-I said, pull over!
-Mun-yeong!

920
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,549
Pull over! Now!

921
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,758
Mun-yeong!

922
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,556
Mun-yeong!

923
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:40,851
Ko Mun-yeong!

924
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:05,435
Sang-tae.

925
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,314
Sang-tae.

926
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:10,899
Sang-tae!

927
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,109
Sang-tae.

928
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:22,638
Stop pretending.

929
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,181
Stop pretending like it doesn't hurt.

930
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:26,016
You're going to do it

931
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,768
in front of me. Not just Sang-tae.

932
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:29,394
Why is everyone

933
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,897
so nice to me?

934
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,857
Let's just think of it as a nightmare.

935
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:35,609
I can do it.

936
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:37,069
Is your daughter...

937
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:39,237
an artwork to you?

938
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:43,533
She won't listen to me because of you!

939
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:44,951
Give it up.

940
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:47,204
That messed up ending you're dreaming of

941
01:17:47,954 --> 01:17:49,039
will never come.

942
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,920
