1
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,411
You're so warm.

2
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,712
I'm hungry.

3
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,622
BATES MOTEL
PARKING LOT

4
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,634
Nice move.

5
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,929
-You're cold, so go inside and warm up.
-Okay, let's do that.

6
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,181
By yourself.

7
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:16,821
Hello.

8
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,282
My gosh.

9
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,952
You're both soaked.

10
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,914
For one night or just for a few hours?

11
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,793
-Well--
-Which room do you want?

12
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,837
The mirror room? The themed room?

13
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,922
-Or costumes?
-No.

14
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,798
Well...

15
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,260
Come here.

16
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,930
Come here. Come on.

17
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,475
-Do you want any add-ons?
-Sorry?

18
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,560
A love chair? A vibrating bed?

19
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,188
How about handcuffs or a whip?

20
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,816
I'll give you ten percent off
if you pay cash.

21
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,110
Let's go.

22
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,363
How about a whirlpool tub?
Don't tell anyone--

23
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,781
-Come on. Let's go.
-No.

24
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,032
I like this place.

25
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,661
Come on. I'll take you home.

26
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,872
-I don't want to freeze to death.
-Our rooms are steamy hot.

27
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,377
-Do you live far from here?
-That's not the point.

28
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,129
Why bring your motorcycle
in this torrential rain?

29
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,675
-Then just take a taxi home.
-Give me money for the ride.

30
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,261
Hey, don't tell me--

31
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,389
Right. I didn't bring anything.
Not even my wallet and phone.

32
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,307
Then if I hadn't come--

33
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,435
I would've walked all night in the rain,
like a crazy woman.

34
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,773
Can you please think before you act?
Don't be so impulsive and reckless.

35
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,110
Anything can happen
on that dark, remote road.

36
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,988
How could you keep walking
all by yourself? You're fearless.

37
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,615
If something bad happened...

38
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,038
Why are you mad?

39
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,291
Who cares if I walk all night

40
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,126
or put on a strip show in the rain?

41
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,961
Why are you upset?

42
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,214
Were you worried about me?

43
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,675
Are you upset?

44
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,845
Does your heart ache?

45
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,768
Do you...

46
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,896
like me?

47
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,363
Well, I'm asking
because I really have no clue.

48
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,865
You know that.

49
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,201
You'd better not act like you know
and understand everything about me

50
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,662
when you know nothing.
Don't be delusional.

51
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,290
You're all empty inside.

52
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,500
You're just loud.

53
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,544
Like an empty can.

54
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,840
I'm an empty can who won't understand
how you feel until the day I die.

55
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,720
What do you feel now?

56
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:47,930
Tell me.

57
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,101
Why are you all quiet?

58
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,145
Are you an empty can too?

59
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,901
I...

60
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,112
I...

61
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,073
Just say it.

62
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:11,871
"I love you."

63
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,749
We'll get a room.

64
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,128
Just...

65
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,756
Any clean and warm room would do.

66
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,174
It's 50,000 won.

67
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,476
What? You have no money?

68
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,687
What about your phone?

69
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,107
Even my mom has to pay on the spot.

70
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,024
Bye.

71
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,281
I guess you ran out in a hurry

72
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,243
that you couldn't think before you acted.

73
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:54,997
It's okay.

74
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,708
It's natural for men to act instinctively.

75
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,168
Go start your bike.

76
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,719
Hey.

77
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,434
There's a cheap motel down the street.

78
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,811
They let you pay later. Go there.

79
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,189
-Thank you.
-Sure.

80
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,742
CHAPTER 5
RAPUNZEL AND THE CURSED CASTLE

81
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:52,889
Get off.

82
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,649
His taste is so...

83
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,700
Dry yourself first.

84
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,496
Give me your clothes. I hate dinosaurs.

85
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,959
This is fascinating.

86
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,253
You can take care of all your needs here,

87
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,297
eating, sleeping, and relieving yourself?

88
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,341
This reminds me of an animal stall.

89
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,136
Don't you feel like
you're a domesticated animal living here?

90
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,642
What? Was that rude?

91
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,644
Go get changed.

92
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,481
-Where's your brother?
-Downstairs.

93
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,484
-Don't call him over.
-I won't.

94
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,862
-I don't want you around him.
-Are you jealous?

95
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,615
Don't go near my brother, ever.

96
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,784
-Is this a warning?
-Whatever it is.

97
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,621
-Just leave him alone.
-Will he want the same thing?

98
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,999
I should ask him directly.

99
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,337
What? What's the matter?

100
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,131
What's with that gaze?

101
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,386
-What does my face tell you?
-You're handsome.

102
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,472
-No, my facial expression.
-You look obnoxious.

103
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,433
I'm talking about my mood, emotions,
and the state I'm in.

104
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,434
Not interested.

105
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,066
Take a look at their faces
and try to read their emotions.

106
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,818
Learn it, even if you don't care.

107
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,363
If you don't like to feel the emotions,
just memorize them.

108
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,658
Make an effort
unless you want to live alone forever.

109
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,120
-I don't want to. Why should I?
-You should still do it.

110
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm not autistic.

111
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,919
-I'm just--
-You're not the zombie kid either.

112
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,006
The kid with no emotions,
but only the desire to eat.

113
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,467
Do you think what he wanted
was to satiate his hunger?

114
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,054
Or someone's warmth?

115
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,808
What do you think the answer is?

116
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,020
Food? Was satisfying his desire
all that mattered?

117
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,037
Warmth.

118
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,875
This is what he truly wanted.
He didn't want to be just fed.

119
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,420
-You wanted to impart that message.
-You're wrong.

120
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,214
-I'm wrong?
-You're wrong. Food was all that mattered.

121
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,425
He's a zombie, so he has no emotions.

122
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,136
He wanted a full belly
even if it was his mom's limbs.

123
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,847
"Warmth"? Bullshit.

124
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,184
That's just the sickening pity
of sentimentalists like yourself.

125
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,644
You got it all wrong.

126
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,940
I'm hungry. Give me something to eat.
Before I chew off your limbs.

127
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,837
Who's pitying whom?

128
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,141
WHEN USING THE SHAMPOO, PUMP THREE TIMES

129
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,103
SANG-TAE

130
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,025
WHEN BRUSHING TEETH,
DON'T GO OVER THREE MINUTES

131
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,945
Hypocrite.

132
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,496
Why... Why does he hate me?

133
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,664
Sang-tae.

134
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,083
Do as I say, please!

135
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,304
Sang-tae.

136
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,640
Are you still mad?

137
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,355
I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier.

138
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,983
I'll never do that again.

139
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,610
Forgive me.

140
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,285
Sang-tae, please.

141
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,663
That must hurt.

142
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,541
You're hurting yourself.

143
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,378
Someone slapped me in the face today.

144
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,718
I was slapped so hard

145
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,637
that my gums bled,

146
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,349
and I can't even hear well.

147
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,605
My face is all swollen,
so I look like Mr. Lumpy now.

148
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,816
-What do I do?
-"Mr. Lumpy"?

149
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,284
Where's Mr. Lumpy? Mr. Lumpy.

150
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,871
My lumps are all gone.

151
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,082
Gosh, I can't believe it.

152
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,469
Lying is bad. It's deception.
The cops will arrest you.

153
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,388
Pinocchio is bad.
The shepherd boy is also bad.

154
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,599
Since you lied to me,
you deserve a scolding.

155
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,644
You need a spanking.
Will you keep doing it knowing it's bad?

156
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,896
Answer me. Why are you all quiet?

157
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,649
It's because you know you are bad.
Does it hurt?

158
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,910
Have you... You haven't eaten yet, right?

159
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,495
Have a seat.

160
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,499
Are you happy you got spanked?

161
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,501
Why do you keep asking for it?

162
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,878
Are you doing this on purpose?

163
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,005
I got what I deserved.

164
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,090
Jeez.

165
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,009
All right. Come and eat.

166
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,177
Come on.

167
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,263
No.

168
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,473
What? What is it?

169
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,434
Well, would you mind...

170
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,775
Are you hiding your wife somewhere here?

171
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,737
-No, it's my landlady who's over 60.
-I could tell.

172
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,239
She must be a seasoned cook.

173
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,490
Just eat.

174
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,262
I want to live with this lady.
She's a great cook.

175
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,391
-What do you eat at home?
-I don't eat.

176
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,896
I don't have a mom
who'd give me her limbs.

177
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,273
At least you have a live-in cook.

178
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,152
Damn it.

179
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,515
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

180
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,827
Why are you standing here?

181
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,496
Didn't you hear that sound just now?

182
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,289
No.

183
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,418
The power is back on.

184
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,339
I heard someone humming a song
from over there.

185
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,591
Oh, that.

186
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,261
What exactly is "that"?

187
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,972
Didn't Ms. Yoo Seon-hae tell you?

188
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:59,101
Sometime after midnight,
you can hear a ghost humming a song

189
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,771
at the end of the hallway
on the second floor.

190
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,154
I clearly heard it.

191
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,280
What? A ghost?

192
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,868
-She was probably talking nonsense, right?
-Well, I'm not sure.

193
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,995
Ms. Yoo Seon-hae...

194
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,586
has been making a living
communicating with ghosts.

195
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,212
What?

196
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,301
She was a shaman.

197
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,183
Wait up!

198
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,520
I should make some coffee.

199
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,317
I saw nothing special while making rounds.

200
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,318
Okay, thanks.

201
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,113
-Where's--
-He went to wash his face.

202
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,490
-You sure?

203
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,661
-Do you want some coffee?
-Sure, thank you.

204
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,288
How are Mr. Ko Dae-hwan's vitals?

205
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,624
His blood pressure is still
on the high side,

206
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,584
and he's having some sleep disorders.

207
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,130
Well, by the way...

208
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,094
-Earlier in the garden...
-Yes?

209
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,639
Why do you think he did that
to his daughter?

210
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,814
Some post-surgical complications
can result in sudden aggressive outbursts.

211
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:27,731
Here.

212
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,110
What if that wasn't the cause?

213
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,698
Then what? Are you saying
he attacked her to kill her?

214
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,704
No.

215
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:44,832
To live.

216
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,169
I mean, because he didn't want to die.

217
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,589
If he became aggressive like that
to protect himself...

218
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,174
Die!

219
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,010
Ms. Nam.

220
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,012
Yes?

221
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,559
You said you and Ms. Ko Mun-yeong
know each other.

222
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,018
Shall we

223
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,480
become friends?

224
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,816
But you tried to hide it,

225
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,152
which means you two aren't really
on good terms.

226
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,196
Go away, please!

227
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,158
Then now,

228
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,952
ask yourself this.

229
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,873
Are you emotionally involving yourself
when it comes to those two?

230
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,793
You shouldn't let countertransference
happen. You're a professional.

231
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,130
A THERAPIST'S EMOTIONAL ENTANGLEMENT
WITH A CLIENT

232
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,536
Finish it quick and lie down here.

233
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:10,042
We must've been a servant
and a mistress in our past lives.

234
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,378
You're working so hard.
You look scrumptious from behind.

235
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,218
I mean, you look stunning,
not "scrumptious."

236
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,221
-My bad.
-Get up.

237
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,141
-I'll give you money for a cab to go home.
-No, I'll sleep here tonight.

238
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,187
-Who says you can sleep here?
-I can do as I want.

239
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,397
-Get up.
-No, I'll sleep here.

240
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,733
-I'll drag you out.
-You brought me here.

241
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,611
I never said you could sleep here.
Come on. Get up.

242
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,696
You clothed me and fed me,
so let me sleep.

243
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,616
-I'm not raising a newborn. Let go.
-Let go, or I'll scream.

244
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,369
-Get out!
-Sang-tae!

245
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,626
Hey, buddy! Let's have dinner together!

246
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,716
Hey, why... Gosh, why did you come out?

247
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,260
-Sorry, Jae-su.
-Jeez.

248
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,055
Hey, why are you covered in sweat?

249
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,308
Oh, my room is very hot.

250
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,769
Gosh, it's so hot. You don't feel hot?

251
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,230
Hey, are you having hot flashes or what?

252
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,483
You're acting so weird today.

253
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,736
What do you mean?

254
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,033
I thought you'd probably be eating
all alone looking sad,

255
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,618
so I came to keep you company.

256
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,538
-Oh, I've already eaten.
-What? Already?

257
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,958
Yes. Your food will get cold.
Go downstairs and eat.

258
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,169
-Go on.
-Hey, something's fishy here.

259
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,630
You even left Sang-tae downstairs.

260
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,048
Because you were with him.

261
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,801
-You prick, what are you up to all alone?
-Hey!

262
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,929
Gosh, Jae-su.

263
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,101
-You're using force?
-No.

264
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,602
-You're pretty strong.
-No.

265
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,397
-You know who I am, right?
-Of course.

266
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,898
-You do, right?
-Yes.

267
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,483
-You'd better watch out.
-Okay.

268
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,030
-I'll be downstairs. Call me if need be.
-All right, will do.

269
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:15,959
Open up.

270
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,794
Let me in.

271
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,799
Can you let me in?

272
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,970
Sure, if you let me sleep here.

273
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,060
-Open it first. Then--
-Then you'll drag me out.

274
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,856
No, I won't do that.

275
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,316
For real?

276
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,278
Yes, for real. Open the door first.

277
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,697
Okay.

278
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,537
Here, this is open.

279
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,256
We look like Romeo and Juliet,
staring at each other like this.

280
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,260
You're right. The ill-fated mortal enemies

281
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,222
who should've never crossed paths.

282
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,682
No, they were meant to be. It was fate.

283
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,644
Their tragic fate killed both of them.

284
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,396
Do you know why they both died?

285
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,232
Because only Juliet drank
the sleeping potion.

286
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,318
If they drank it together,
they wouldn't have died.

287
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,154
So let's fall asleep together,
side by side.

288
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,326
What the... Your logic makes no sense.

289
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,078
-Let me in.
-I'll sleep here tonight.

290
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,788
-Open the door.
-Sleep beside me.

291
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,289
Open up before I break it.

292
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,791
How about Sang-tae joins us?

293
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,209
Sang-tae!

294
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,460
What? It burst?

295
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,838
Why would the pipe burst out of the blue?

296
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,798
Shall I come up and--

297
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,675
No, no need. Don't come up.

298
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,634
You startled me.

299
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,054
-I guess it's because the pipe is old.
-It's dirty.

300
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,057
-I should call a plumber tomorrow.
-You often get a cold?

301
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:54,975
All the time.

302
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:59,771
There's water everywhere.
I should stay up all night to clean.

303
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,651
No, it's okay.
Just take care of Sang-tae for me.

304
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,529
Right. Thanks, Jae-su.

305
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,907
Yes. Today, you're my favorite.

306
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:19,958
Open the door.

307
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,710
You're a good actor.

308
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,380
Why did you become a caregiver,
not an actor?

309
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,808
Your lies carry a sense of sincerity.

310
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,686
It makes me want to believe them.

311
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,274
My brother...

312
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,653
Sang-tae

313
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,450
is always looking at my face.

314
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,539
My eyes,

315
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,252
the shape of my brows,
the corners of my mouth,

316
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,006
-and every single wrinkle on my face.
-He's angry.

317
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,884
He studies my face

318
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,304
to figure out my mood.

319
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,475
Even when I'm in unbearable pain

320
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,936
and extremely devastated,

321
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,898
my brother believes

322
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,152
that I'm happy

323
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,406
if I force myself to smile.

324
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,338
All I care about is what he thinks.

325
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,803
It's fine even if it's fake.

326
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,349
Putting on a smile

327
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,771
isn't hard to do.

328
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,443
-"You have no common sense.
-You have no common sense.

329
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,487
-Are you jealous?
-Are you jealous?

330
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,197
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

331
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,367
-This isn't good.
-This isn't good.

332
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,829
-I know how he is. He's usually nice,
-I know how he is. He's usually nice,

333
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,456
-but loses it when he's mad.
-but loses it when he's mad.

334
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,793
-I have a bad feeling about today."
-I have a bad feeling about today.

335
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,336
You jerk!

336
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,676
Then smile at me.

337
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,388
You said it's not hard to do. Smile.

338
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,228
Just sleep. It's late.

339
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,481
Were you like this even as a boy?

340
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,070
I saw your photo.

341
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,827
Did you put on a fake smile
even when you were little?

342
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,249
I don't know.

343
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,085
I don't remember.

344
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,421
Then what about that woman?

345
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,174
The woman you liked.

346
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,968
You said my eyes reminded you of her.

347
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,472
Do you still think about her?

348
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,644
-Do you miss her?
-No.

349
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,481
I want to forget her.

350
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,236
She must've been a total bitch.

351
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,571
No, quite the contrary.

352
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,616
I was a jerk.

353
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,953
She saved my life,

354
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,378
but I ran.

355
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,589
Like a coward.

356
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,927
And I've been running away

357
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,846
since then.

358
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,477
Then why did you pick me up earlier?

359
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,189
You ran to me instead of running away.

360
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,358
Right, I regret it.

361
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,779
But I have to say,

362
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,323
I was quite smitten.

363
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,200
What is...

364
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,162
Hey, Jeong-tae!

365
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,330
What? What's up? What's this sound?

366
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,750
-Call the nurse. The nurse!
-What?

367
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,501
-Darn it.
-Hurry!

368
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,587
What's wrong? Professor Ko!

369
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,965
What's the matter? Can you hear me?

370
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,806
Gosh, he's so loud.

371
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,518
Jae-su, you're snoring so loudly.

372
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,979
Jae-su, are you that tired?

373
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,774
You're tired
because you're healthy, right?

374
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,527
Are you okay? Gosh, you're too loud.

375
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,569
Way too loud.

376
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,975
Oh, boy.

377
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,315
My dear daughter, you must be exhausted.

378
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,860
Your butt has shrunken to half its size.

379
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,324
-All right.
-I'll take this upstairs.

380
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,371
Goodness.

381
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,343
Hey.

382
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,930
What are you doing here?

383
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,978
I'm obviously here so early
because I slept here.

384
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,479
What about you?

385
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,191
Do you deliver milk as a side job?

386
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,860
No, I live here.

387
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,987
This is my place.

388
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,783
So,

389
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:55,246
you're the one who suggested
that he should move

390
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,415
into this house?

391
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,377
That's right. I recommended
that he should live here

392
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,338
and also told him about the hospital.

393
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,381
He made the choice though.

394
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:08,593
It sounds like he returned
to Seongjin City because of you.

395
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,138
Do you like him?

396
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,558
You do. Have you told him?

397
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,644
-It's none of your business.
-I have.

398
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:22,815
"I love you.

399
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,318
I love you!

400
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,613
I said, I love you!"

401
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,617
Like that. With all my passion.

402
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,745
-Don't lie.
-I really did.

403
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,583
He kept clinging to me
looking like he wanted something from me,

404
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,002
so I gave him what he wanted.

405
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,924
Are you giving alms or what?

406
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,677
You thief.

407
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,721
-What?
-Don't drool over him.

408
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,598
He was always mine.

409
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,560
Is everything you set your eyes on yours?

410
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,898
If you can't make it yours,
you'd even destroy it to possess it.

411
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,318
Then you'd play with it
and toss it out when you get bored.

412
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,613
You call that "love"?

413
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,615
That's just obsession

414
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:14,742
and greed.

415
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:18,621
Two-faced bitch.

416
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,083
You bad-mouth people
but act all coy to their faces.

417
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,045
You always act nice, weak, and innocent.

418
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,466
That's why you never had any friends
in school. Do you get it now?

419
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,219
You crazy...

420
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,181
You evil witch.

421
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,769
Do you want to die?

422
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,606
-Gosh, go to hell!
-Hey, are you on something?

423
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,942
-What the… You need to be on something!
-You…

424
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,944
-Hey, let go!
-You!

425
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:50,862
Are you high?

426
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,447
-Hey!
-Why you little...

427
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,700
-This is why you'll always fail.
-Damn you!

428
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,744
-Have you lost your mind?
-Ko Mun-yeong!

429
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,375
Let her go.

430
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,504
Let go.

431
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,009
-What's going on?
-What's all this noise?

432
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,385
-What's happening?
-What?

433
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,780
Wait, that bitch hit me first!

434
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,782
Enough.

435
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,787
What? Why am I getting crap for this?
That bitch hit me first.

436
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,206
I don't care who started it.

437
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,583
-Then why are you taking her side?
-"Her side?"

438
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:46,834
"Ko Mun-yeong!"

439
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,087
You only shouted my name earlier.

440
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,673
Don't be so childish. Just go home.

441
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,804
Come with me.
You need to move out of this shabby house.

442
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,056
-You can't stay here.
-Mind your own business.

443
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,517
I decide where I live. And one more thing.

444
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,395
You don't own me.

445
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,650
How much did you hear?

446
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,241
"I love you.

447
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,328
I said I love you." From that point on.

448
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:27,959
Here.

449
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,295
I'm paying you back with money
for the love you showed me.

450
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:52,900
Damn it.

451
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,903
That two-faced bitch.

452
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,046
Sang-tae, wait! Sang-tae!

453
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,632
Sang-tae.

454
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,847
Sang-tae, I...

455
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:31,647
The pipes are fine. Nothing burst.
Everything works fine.

456
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,401
Nothing burst. Everything's working fine.

457
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,197
Nothing burst.

458
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,991
Nothing burst...

459
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,659
Sang-tae.

460
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,661
I'm sorry.

461
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:47,997
I lied.

462
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,459
Lying is bad. If you lie,
the cops will come and get you.

463
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,461
You promised me you'd never lie again.

464
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,091
I'm sorry. I promise I'll never lie again.

465
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,302
Forgive me just this once.

466
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,098
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong...

467
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,977
Why was she wearing those clothes?

468
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,272
-What?
-The denim shirt and T-shirt.

469
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,274
"It goes with anything."
You got it on sale

470
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,777
at Bomul Mart.
It was 9,900 won, the BOGO deal.

471
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,863
They're yours.
I know they're your clothes.

472
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,202
I let her borrow them.
It rained last night, you know.

473
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,330
Her clothes got soaked,
so I let her borrow mine.

474
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,291
-What about my clothes?
-What?

475
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:38,965
I also have nice...
I have a lot of nice clothes too.

476
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:45,137
I'll let her borrow yours next time
she comes over. The one with dinosaurs.

477
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,431
The one with the ultrasaurus.
It was 27,000 won.

478
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,101
That's more expensive than 9,900 won.

479
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,687
Although higher prices
don't always mean better quality.

480
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,940
Okay, I'll make sure she wears that one.

481
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:57,733
I promise.

482
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,029
Okay?

483
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,365
Come on.

484
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,249
Get up and have some food.

485
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:22,133
You need energy
to cry as much as you want.

486
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:25,928
Get up!

487
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,097
I don't want to eat anything.

488
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,435
She's that girl, right?

489
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,147
The friend you brought
back when I used to run that diner.

490
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,898
She was never my "friend."

491
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,945
Did she pull out a lot of your hair?

492
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,448
Did you lose?

493
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,450
Is that why you're crying?

494
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,206
Ko Mun-yeong...

495
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,500
He shouted only her name.

496
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,546
He glared at her
without even glancing at me.

497
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,176
He always talks so politely to me,

498
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,011
but he talked very casually to her.

499
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,931
You're crying your eyes out
because of that?

500
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,809
He's closer to me.

501
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,104
Why does he call me "Ju-ri" so politely
and why is she…

502
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,440
Why does he call her
"Ko Mun-yeong" like that?

503
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:26,238
And those clothes too.
We bought them together at a BOGO sale.

504
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,825
I can't believe he let her wear them.

505
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,286
And she slept in his room...

506
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,791
How could he let her sleep in his room?

507
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:43,422
Well, he said
there was a bit of a situation.

508
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,300
You know that he'd never fool around
with a girl

509
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,344
in his room behind his brother's back.

510
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,972
Don't you worry.
You'll definitely get your chance.

511
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,104
Mom, how did you know?

512
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,898
What? The fact
that you have a crush on Gang-tae?

513
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,567
Everyone in this neighborhood knows.
Here, eat.

514
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,823
Why keep it all inside?

515
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,575
Since this happened,
you should just tell him.

516
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,203
-What if he rejects me?
-Just keep at it.

517
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,497
What if he runs away?

518
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,374
Chase him to the end.

519
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,920
I, too, had to make such efforts
to bring you into this world.

520
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,509
Here.

521
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,139
But I must say, Mun-yeong has grown
into such a pretty lady.

522
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,100
Pretty, my ass!

523
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,643
She is not pretty.

524
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,688
NEW SEONGJIN PUBLIC BATH

525
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,774
Hey, will you please pick up your phone?

526
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,068
Goodness.

527
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,703
-Hello?
-Mr. Lee.

528
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,289
-We're in trouble.
-I told you.

529
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,625
Nothing's important to me
unless it's a life or death situation.

530
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,086
We're all about to die.

531
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:05,880
What?

532
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,423
When you read someone's book,

533
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,051
you can easily see
how that writer thinks and feels.

534
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:16,307
Then I guess you also know
what I'm going to do next.

535
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,269
But I, too, can attack you
with the tip of my pen.

536
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,187
Goodbye.

537
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,364
He got surgery for brain hemorrhage
and woke up in two days.

538
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,742
No wonder he has been so quiet lately.

539
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,785
Sir, take a look at this.

540
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,955
He's demanding a huge amount
of compensation.

541
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,332
If we don't comply,

542
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,084
Ms. Ko will be arrested
or end up destroying her career.

543
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,920
What should we do?

544
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,298
Check how much cash we have...

545
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,718
No, never mind.
Tell the accounting manager to join us.

546
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,305
The manager quit a while ago
and can't be reached.

547
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,766
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

548
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,893
You never asked.

549
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,231
Sir, the printing house
and the distribution warehouse

550
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,525
keep calling us
asking for the overdue payment.

551
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,736
-How did things go at Seongjin City?
-Is she working on her next book?

552
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,613
We're going to be okay, right?

553
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,534
-Mr. Lee!
-Mr. Lee!

554
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,868
-Sir, wake up!
-Mr. Lee!

555
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,119
-Mr. Lee!
-Mr. Lee!

556
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,247
-My gosh. Mr. Lee!
-Sir.

557
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,331
Mr. Lee.

558
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,425
-Are you okay, sir?
-Be quiet for a second. Hold on.

559
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,593
Give me a minute.

560
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,410
Gosh, no way.

561
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,165
Seung-jae.

562
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,961
Yes?

563
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,171
Do you hike?

564
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,631
Yes.

565
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,467
I used to be the leader of a hiking club.

566
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,568
Did you sleep with her?

567
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,322
Are you guys dating?

568
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,036
Do you like that lunatic?

569
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,374
Are you drunk already?

570
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,129
Then why did you ride Alberto
in the rain for her?

571
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,673
Why did you bring her home
when you don't like her?

572
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:58,344
Why feed her and let her sleep over?
Was it for charity? A new religion?

573
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,349
The beer is a bit bland.

574
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,602
Gang-tae,

575
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,854
don't act out of the ordinary.

576
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:13,400
-You'll die in the prism of your life.
-It's prime, not "prism."

577
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,157
Anyway, you should be careful.

578
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,408
Did you forget already?

579
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,621
She hurt you with a knife
the first time you met her.

580
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,097
Yes, she did.

581
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,143
My gosh, are you reminiscing?
Is it taking you back and all?

582
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,939
-What are you talking about?
-Hey.

583
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,817
People who are insane
don't act based on logic.

584
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,152
They turn into monsters
the moment they lose it.

585
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,572
Look. Let this scar be a reminder.

586
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,825
Next time, it might not be your hand.
Gosh…

587
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,912
She might just go for your neck.

588
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:13,711
You're right.

589
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,672
I should avoid her, right?

590
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,590
Of course. Don't ever get involved.

591
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,011
I should stay out of her sight.

592
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,473
Exactly. Don't even go near her.

593
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,063
But the thing is,

594
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,240
I am growing forgetful these days.

595
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,034
-Forgetful about what?
-Everything.

596
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,164
My scars.

597
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:52,916
The butterflies.

598
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,838
Even Sang-tae.

599
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,637
I sometimes forget about them all.

600
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,351
So

601
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,063
you should remind me like this

602
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,025
from time to time

603
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,070
and help me come to my senses.

604
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:26,992
Okay.

605
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,039
I get it. So stop smiling like that.

606
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,293
Why?

607
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,087
-Do I look like Joker?
-No.

608
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,008
You look like Chucky.

609
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,167
I'm paying you back with money
for the love you showed me.

610
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,419
It'll be enough for a ride.

611
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,258
Damn it.

612
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:31,265
Did he give me that to get rid of me?
Am I only worth 30,000 won?

613
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,809
He lives like a poor beggar.

614
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,563
That cheap jerk! How dare he?

615
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,273
Darn it.

616
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:40,899
Cheap jerk!

617
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,321
That cheap jerk.

618
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:53,912
Cheap jerk.

619
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:13,974
My gosh.

620
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,979
Why is he so fickle? It confuses me.
Does he have a split personality?

621
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,385
Sang-tae, are you sleeping?

622
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,357
Sang-tae, who do you like more?
Me or Ko Mun-yeong?

623
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,116
I like you more.

624
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,538
You're my everything.

625
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,690
Who is it?

626
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,280
Mun-yeong.

627
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:55,826
We're doomed.

628
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,538
Why is she here?

629
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,042
I'm here

630
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,171
because Mr. Lee tricked me
into coming here.

631
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,844
With our company building deposit,

632
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,930
I paid that darn Suicide Bomber
the money he asked for,

633
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,349
gave our team the overdue salary
and severance pay,

634
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,560
and paid all our subcontractors.

635
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,563
-And now, I'm broke.
-You didn't give me my severance pay.

636
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,775
You bought me this suitcase
and asked me to go on a business trip.

637
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,402
-Are you a con artist?
-Hey!

638
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,363
I brought you here
to take responsibility for your future.

639
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,615
How will you do that
when you've gone bankrupt?

640
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,076
Hey, I haven't gone bankrupt.

641
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,580
I still have Ko Mun-yeong. She's my hope.

642
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,581
Right?

643
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,708
-Get out.
-This is so annoying.

644
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,086
-Mun-yeong.
-Why do I have to save you

645
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,421
from this mess you're in?

646
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:52,257
Hey, come on.
Don't you know who caused this--

647
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,675
You caused this to happen.

648
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,262
Yes, that's right.

649
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,514
It's all because I was an incompetent.

650
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,892
-It's all my fault.
-Incompetent jerk.

651
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,268
Now, leave.

652
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,687
Mun-yeong, don't be like this.

653
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:09,066
Just let me stay by your side
and help you publish your books.

654
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:12,027
You even asked me to live with you.
Don't you remember?

655
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,154
Didn't you run away?

656
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,823
Someone else will move in here.

657
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,785
Who?

658
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,496
No way.

659
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:15,298
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

660
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:19,678
Young man.

661
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,930
Hey, young man.

662
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:32,607
Thank you.

663
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:47,581
I've had my eyes on you
for the past couple of days.

664
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,751
And I noticed that you're very handsome.

665
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,214
You also have a nice build
and seem very reliable.

666
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,303
EMPLOYEE CARD

667
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,846
"Moon Gang-tae"?

668
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,432
You also have a great name.

669
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:09,978
How old are you?

670
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:11,813
I'm 30 years old.

671
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,649
What do your parents do?

672
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,320
They're dead.

673
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,322
Both of them?

674
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,241
Oh, dear.

675
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,079
Do you have a girlfriend?

676
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:32,834
No.

677
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,756
So that nurse has a crush on you?

678
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:39,758
Pardon?

679
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,594
That's good.

680
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,679
What do you mean?

681
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,727
I'd like to introduce you to a nice lady
who would be perfect for you.

682
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,980
No, it's okay.

683
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,774
It's not because she's my daughter.

684
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,194
She really is a great catch.

685
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,031
You should meet her
when she visits me one day.

686
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,533
Well, I'll think about it.

687
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,078
I need to get back to work.

688
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,666
Let me know if you have a change of heart.

689
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,006
They'll be a really good match.

690
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,978
This isn't it.

691
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,024
No.

692
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,155
This isn't it.

693
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,960
How about green?

694
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,675
Gosh, no.

695
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:05,593
This one?

696
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,054
My goodness.

697
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,809
The first step is always the hardest.

698
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,396
But once you take your first step,
things will get easier from then on.

699
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:25,071
Now, it's time for you to show me
what you're capable of.

700
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,783
No, no! This isn't right!

701
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,452
No!

702
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,871
-I'm sorry.
-Why did you do that? That was bad.

703
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,581
-Come here.
-I won't do it again.

704
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,750
-Sang-tae.
-You can't do that.

705
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,002
The director isn't sane either.
Don't you agree?

706
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,673
Why are you crying again?
You promised you wouldn't cry.

707
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:44,841
You ruined it.

708
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,344
-A-reum.
-Because I'm jealous.

709
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,554
I also want to play tag like that.

710
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,767
Hold my hand. Let's go take your medicine.

711
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,852
-You need to get scolded!
-No!

712
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,645
Do you want to get scolded?

713
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:00,607
It's funny

714
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,818
how people who should be wearing
a patient gown aren't wearing one.

715
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,738
-Why did you do that? Why?
-My goodness.

716
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,198
Do you want to get scolded?

717
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,334
Ms. Ko.

718
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,503
How do you feel?

719
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,380
Never good. Why did you call me?

720
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,677
I heard what your father did to you.
I'm very sorry.

721
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,764
It wasn't you who strangled me.

722
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,725
But still, I was the one who told you
to take him out for walks.

723
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,645
Then it was a medical accident.
You can't just end it

724
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,313
with an apology.

725
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,193
Then let's do this.

726
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,030
You can strangle me instead.
Here. Go ahead.

727
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,952
What a crazy old man.

728
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,457
The sound of a ghost humming?

729
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,418
Yes.

730
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:05,839
By any chance, do you know what time
it was when you heard that last night?

731
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,008
I don't know.

732
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,761
I don't even know what date it is today.

733
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,389
I just heard it on my way to the bathroom.

734
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,812
Then did you happen to see anyone
in front of room 203

735
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,106
or in the hallway?

736
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,986
She said it was a ghost humming,
so it was probably a ghost.

737
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,157
Ms. Nam.

738
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,786
-Do you believe her gibberish?
-It's not gibberish.

739
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,539
I swear I can hear it.

740
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:43,835
That's called auditory hallucination.
And it's proof that you're crazy.

741
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,506
Hey, I'm not crazy.

742
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,009
Yes, I'm sure you heard what you heard.

743
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,017
Then are you saying I'm crazy?

744
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,051
Standing here with you like this

745
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,678
reminds me of the past.

746
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,350
Do you remember what you said to me,

747
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,603
crying on the rooftop
after getting slapped by a patient?

748
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,147
back at Yongrim Hospital?

749
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:50,568
"Why don't you slap me
and make yourself feel better?"

750
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,699
I didn't know you'd really slap me.

751
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,868
I must've been crazy. Why did I do that?

752
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:07,585
But thanks to that,
we became really close, didn't we?

753
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,300
Or are we not?

754
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,096
Are we not close?

755
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:21,766
Ju-ri.

756
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,440
Do you want to slap me again?

757
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:32,902
Why?

758
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:37,240
Because I feel like you'll get upset
in a little while.

759
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,250
Are you

760
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,503
rejecting me already?

761
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,255
Don't bother

762
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,592
wasting your emotions on me.

763
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,761
I don't deserve any of that.

764
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,805
Because

765
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,017
you're going to leave anyway?

766
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,147
It doesn't matter. Just...

767
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:14,277
Just let me keep liking you.
That's up to me.

768
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,911
Do me a favor.

769
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,209
I hope

770
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,465
you don't run away

771
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:40,678
because you find me uncomfortable.

772
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,472
If you do,

773
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:47,602
it'll make me feel really pathetic

774
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,234
and sad.

775
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,657
Just continue to live with us at our house

776
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,826
while you're in Seongjin City.

777
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:11,250
My mom really likes you guys.

778
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,168
And...

779
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:17,715
Sang-tae likes living with us as well.

780
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,514
Please do that for me.

781
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,918
O Ji-wang is bad. O Ji-wang.

782
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,295
O Ji-wang...

783
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,923
O Ji-wang is a bad person.

784
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,553
He may be a doctor, but he's a bad person.

785
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:07,056
O Ji-wang is really fast. He's bad.

786
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,101
He needs to learn his manners.
Koreans should be courteous.

787
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:15,356
Sang-tae.

788
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,945
-Do you want to have fun with me?
-Yes.

789
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,371
FACILITY MANAGEMENT CHECKLIST

790
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:37,211
The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a voicemail--

791
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:47,472
How much did you pay for this car?

792
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,974
Is it more than one million won?
Two million won?

793
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,934
It costs 100 to 1,000 times more.

794
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,480
How much money do you have?
Are you rich?

795
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,732
I'm 100 to 1,000 times richer than you.

796
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,486
I guess you like money.

797
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:04,906
Yes, I like money, cars,
and I like you, too.

798
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,866
I like you 100 to 12,000 times more.

799
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:11,662
But where are we going? It's dark outside.

800
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,252
Where did he go?

801
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:20,755
I'm on duty again.

802
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,050
Are you looking for your brother?

803
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,134
Have you seen him?

804
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:28,721
He left earlier with Ms. Ko.

805
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,682
Why was she here?
She had no class today.

806
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,184
I don't know.

807
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:43,820
Is it okay

808
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,031
if I touch you?

809
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,419
Oh my gosh.

810
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,014
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

811
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,433
-Do you like this place?
-Yes.

812
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,562
-Would you like to move in with me?
-Yes.

813
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,023
-Then sign this.
-Okay.

814
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,862
ILLUSTRATION CONTRACT

815
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,338
Where is my brother?

816
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:27,715
He's with me.

817
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:29,967
I warned you

818
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,512
to stay away from my brother.

819
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,642
The employee will live...

820
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:41,729
The employee will live in...

821
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:44,106
-I was bored, so we hung out.
-the employer's...

822
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,358
Why not come pick him up?

823
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:49,362
Where are you?

824
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:52,698
We're at the cursed castle.

825
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:54,742
Okay.

826
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,161
Do you even know where it is?

827
01:05:58,537 --> 01:05:59,372
Yes, I know.

828
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,586
How?

829
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,005
-Because I've been there.
-What?

830
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,177
That day when you saved me,

831
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:17,431
and I ran away from you.

832
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,518
Are you telling me

833
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:24,730
that you knew?

834
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:28,567
I'll see you soon.

835
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:09,984
Sang-tae.

836
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,779
Should I tell you an old tale?

837
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:16,365
Yes.

838
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,494
A long time ago, deep inside the forest,

839
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,872
there lived a little girl

840
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:25,791
in a cursed castle.

841
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:32,214
The little girl's mother
always told her daughter

842
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,135
that she's too special

843
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:40,431
to live among everyone else
outside the castle.

844
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,018
The mother told her

845
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,980
that she must only live inside the castle.

846
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,488
However, the little girl

847
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:58,532
felt like she was imprisoned.

848
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,913
So she prayed to the moon every day.

849
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:07,917
"Please

850
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:14,006
send me a handsome prince
who can save me from here."

851
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:20,679
"Will he come today?

852
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,266
Will he come tomorrow?"

853
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:26,727
The little girl

854
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,481
waited every day
for her prince to show up.

855
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,419
Earlier, I was too--

856
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:38,591
Get lost.

857
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:28,367
SPECIAL THANKS TO JUNG SANG-HOON
FOR MAKING A GUEST APPEARANCE

858
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,192
Let's live together.

859
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,069
This is our home now.

860
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,321
This is not our home!

861
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:08,490
It's mine! No! That's mine!

862
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,700
Gang-tae.

863
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,411
You took good care of him until now.

864
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:15,539
Now, it's time for you
to let him do what he wants.

865
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,334
No, I'm against this team!

866
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,463
You cause trouble
because you can't even control yourself.

867
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:24,340
So how are you going to care for him?

868
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,551
Sang-tae. Have you ever
heard the story of Bluebeard?

869
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:33,557
