1
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,857
A long time ago,

2
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:12,197
there lived a beautiful girl in a castle
located deep inside the forest.

3
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,245
She was always alone,
so she was lonely and bored.

4
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:24,250
So one day, she left the castle
to find herself a friend to play with.

5
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,799
She offered them
all sorts of amazing gifts,

6
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,093
but nobody ever accepted her.

7
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,555
Later on, she found out why.

8
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,392
A monster who brings along
the shadow of death.

9
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,645
That's what the people called her.

10
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,023
"She's a monster. A monster."

11
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,114
She was very angry
at every living soul in the world.

12
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,033
And she needed to take it out on someone.

13
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,696
Ever since she unexpectedly saved
the boy from dying,

14
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:40,201
the scary shadow that always
followed her around suddenly disappeared.

15
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,875
And the boy always
followed her around instead.

16
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,588
He always went with her
whether it was day or night

17
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,591
and whether she was in the mountains
or a field.

18
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,680
On a clear and sunny day,
the girl asked him this.

19
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,934
"Hey, will you always stay by my side?"

20
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,396
"Of course. I will never run away."

21
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,649
"Even if I do this?"

22
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,417
The girl was all alone again,

23
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,754
and the shadow of death came back
and whispered this.

24
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,134
"No one can ever stay by your side

25
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:43,139
because you're a monster.

26
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:48,394
Do not ever forget that.
Do you understand?"

27
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,940
Yes, Mother.

28
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,575
CHAPTER ONE
THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES

29
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,712
This stop is Daun Vocational School.

30
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,757
The next stop is...

31
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,435
I mean, he threw a huge fit
in the middle of class.

32
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,687
My goodness.

33
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,438
No!

34
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,947
There's no use in trying to stop him.

35
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,157
And this isn't the first time.

36
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,575
Your expression...

37
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,995
What if there was a dangerous tool
next to him?

38
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,663
It would've led to an accident.

39
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,426
I don't understand
why we need to walk on eggshells

40
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,386
-because of Sang-tae.
-Is he angry?

41
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,721
Is he angry?

42
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,182
Anyway, we need to think of safety,

43
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,310
-and he's too much for us to handle.
-Angry…

44
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,564
Just send him to a special needs school
or a local community center.

45
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,899
That will be best for everyone.

46
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,236
-Your expression shows your emotions
-Tell me what you think.

47
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,612
What do you think?

48
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,657
Will you please say something?
My gosh, seriously.

49
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,883
He's angry.

50
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,052
THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES

51
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,575
MOON SANG-TAE

52
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,344
Sang-tae.

53
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,555
Aren't you hungry?

54
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,355
What do you want to eat?

55
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,444
You weren't planning to stay
for long anyway.

56
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,450
I'll find you a better school
once we move. I promise.

57
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,417
-Are you that upset?
-Jjamppong.

58
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,502
-What?
-Tangsuyuk with sauce on the side.

59
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,338
Let's go to Yangjagang, not Jageumseong.

60
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,884
Okay, let's stuff ourselves with food
at Yangjagang.

61
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,303
The food is really good there.
Do you remember?

62
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,807
When was the last time we went?

63
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,309
Don't worry. I'll buy.
I'm your big brother.

64
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,084
By any chance,
are you Author Ko Mun-yeong?

65
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,463
-Yes.
-See? I told you.

66
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,217
My daughter is a big fan of yours.

67
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,052
I'm sorry to ask this,

68
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,805
but can we please get your autograph?

69
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,857
-Your name?
-Lee Seul-bi.

70
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,486
She's really beautiful in real life,
isn't she?

71
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:52,281
Yes, she's like a princess
from a fairy tale.

72
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,583
-Why do you think so?
-Because you're pretty.

73
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,420
My mom always calls me "princess"

74
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,838
because I'm pretty.

75
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,887
Ma'am, how about a photo?

76
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,556
My goodness, thank you.

77
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,890
Go stand next to her.

78
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,810
Come here.

79
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,609
You're not my fan, are you?

80
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,153
Pardon?

81
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,408
In all my fairy tales,
the witch is always the one that's pretty.

82
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,079
Who told you
all princesses are kind and pretty?

83
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,248
Did your mom tell you that?

84
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,792
Princess, look over here.

85
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:49,088
If you really want to be that pretty,
I want you to say this.

86
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,465
-One.
-"Mom.

87
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,552
-I'm going to be...
-Two.

88
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,306
a pretty witch."

89
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,724
Three.

90
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,440
Princess.

91
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,443
-Oh, goodness.
-Princess!

92
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,030
My gosh.

93
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,618
My gosh. Mun-yeong.

94
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,248
Buongiorno, Mun-yeong.

95
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,127
My gosh, what's with this chain?

96
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,257
What made that little kid
cry her eyes out?

97
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,218
I guess she was touched.
I corrected her misconception.

98
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,721
What in the world...

99
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,224
Good job.

100
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,354
It can be very dangerous
for a kid to be biased towards something.

101
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,105
But you helped her fix that?

102
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,609
You really are amazing, Mun-yeong.

103
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,736
Just a second.

104
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,239
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

105
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,492
I don't need a loan. I'm already rich.

106
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,789
Okay, let's get going.

107
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,415
We have about two hours.

108
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,710
-So you have time to go to a beauty salon.
-Why would I go there?

109
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,464
You can't go looking like that.

110
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,551
You look like Francesca who's on her way

111
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,720
to a funeral for the Addams Family.

112
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,390
You can't go to a children's ward
looking like that.

113
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,394
You're going there to give kids hope,
not to scare them.

114
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,145
You'll be reading your books there.

115
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,981
-But you look--
-You said it's dangerous to be biased.

116
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,484
I think you're more dangerous.

117
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,946
Mun-yeong, please.

118
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,031
You should dress according to the TPO.

119
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,207
I'll tell them to come to you.

120
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,753
Do you know why I like this restaurant?

121
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,133
-Because the steak--
-No.

122
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,386
The knife here

123
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,555
is amazing.

124
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,518
-Look.
-Mun-yeong, you're bleeding.

125
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,730
How pretty.

126
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:13,607
I want it.

127
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,655
Good gracious.

128
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,284
Ma'am.

129
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,495
Just a second.

130
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,529
EMPLOYEE CARD CAREGIVER MOON GANG-TAE

131
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,074
Mr. Moon, come to the lounge quick.

132
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,626
Gosh, that thief ate all my food.

133
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,753
It's as if she starved for days.

134
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,930
Ms. Myoung Ji-suk.

135
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,726
Honey.

136
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,861
I feel so empty.

137
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,198
Even so,
if you eat in such a hurry,

138
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,201
you'll get an upset stomach again.

139
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,745
So don't eat everything all at once.

140
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,624
Instead, it'd be great
if you could take your time

141
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,585
to eat your food.

142
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,921
You told me you liked that I ate well.

143
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,633
You took it the wrong way.

144
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:06,262
It's just that when you like someone,
you even like the way they eat.

145
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,600
Honey.

146
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,729
Then

147
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:22,236
why did you cheat on me
with that skinny model?

148
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,499
It's okay.

149
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,003
Don't smile at me.

150
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,505
It disgusts me.

151
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,471
-Put your arms up like this.
-Let me go!

152
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,598
Then pull them down like this.

153
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,767
-Stay still!
-I don't belong here!

154
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,519
Let me go! Let go of me!

155
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,563
I can't go in here! I can't!

156
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,067
Let go! I don't belong here!

157
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,610
-Is he a new patient?
-Let go!

158
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,321
He overdosed on alprazolam
with his daughter two days ago

159
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,530
and came through the ER.

160
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,075
He used to get treated
for his anxiety disorder.

161
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,327
I think he tried
to commit suicide with her.

162
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,872
I think he wanted to kill his daughter
and then kill himself.

163
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,040
Where's Go-eun?

164
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,377
Where is Go-eun? Where is my daughter?

165
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,213
Fortunately, she threw up
right after she took the drug.

166
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,967
And she's getting counseling for PTSD
at our child psychology department.

167
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,593
Go-eun.

168
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,887
What's on your mind?

169
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,182
Let me go!

170
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,977
He'll receive
a psychiatric assessment this afternoon.

171
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,645
So check his vitals every hour.

172
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,940
And double-check the restraining band
as you give him an IV fluid.

173
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,358
Okay.

174
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,403
After the reading,
you'll answer questions.

175
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,864
Then you'll give out
your autographed storybooks to the kids.

176
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,576
And you'll be done once you take a photo
with the hospital staff for PR.

177
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,417
I'm not sure if I'm a secretary
or the CEO of a publishing company.

178
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,086
I'm seriously starting to wonder.

179
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,672
I got hired as an art director.

180
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:50,426
But I had no idea
that I'd be working as your minion.

181
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,137
You told me you'll do anything
during the interview.

182
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,641
Well, I didn't know
you'd make me do physical labor.

183
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,185
I hired you
not knowing that you're not very smart.

184
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,396
What should I do? Should I just fire you?

185
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,814
No.

186
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,485
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

187
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,405
“OK Psychiatric Hospital”?

188
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,991
Sir, do you get counseling?

189
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,285
You did the right thing.

190
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,413
Answer the phone.

191
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,171
-Hello?
-Put it on speaker.

192
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,384
Hello? Mr. Lee?

193
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,388
I'm Nam Ju-ri,
a nurse at OK Psychiatric Hospital.

194
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,973
Come this way.

195
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,727
It's so hard to reach you.
You never text us back either.

196
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,813
Are you listening?

197
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,317
Oh, yes. I'm a bit busy--

198
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,651
I believe we told you

199
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,446
that we set a date
for Mr. Ko Dae-hwan's surgery.

200
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,242
How long do we need to wait

201
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,287
for the guardian's consent?

202
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,624
You can't keep avoiding
our calls like this.

203
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,086
That's the same thing
as killing the patient.

204
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,046
Ko Dae-hwan.

205
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,216
He's dead to me.

206
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,470
Why do you keep trying
to bring him back to life? Are you Jesus?

207
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,555
-Excuse me.
-Ju-ri.

208
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,476
If you're so desperate,
come and get the signature yourself.

209
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,500
What's wrong? What is it?

210
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,837
-What happened?
-She wants me to come and get it.

211
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,506
Is she out of her mind?

212
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,967
If she's not sane, she should come here.

213
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,176
Ms. Park.

214
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,971
Tell me about his medical history.

215
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,686
-The patient in room 203 with dementia.
-Oh, Mr. Ko Dae-hwan?

216
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,232
He needs to get surgery
due to his glioblastoma relapse.

217
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,775
But his guardian doesn't care?

218
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,279
He has been with us
for the longest period of time.

219
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,782
But his guardian
never once visited or called

220
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,034
which means he's being neglected.

221
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,205
So instead of just calling
his ungrateful guardian,

222
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,418
why don't you actually visit her in person
so that we can save the patient?

223
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,752
What?

224
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,006
Is that really necessary?

225
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,384
You're going to do it, right?
I know you're a professional.

226
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,847
If you let me take the rest of the day
and tomorrow off,

227
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,683
-I'll go see her myself.
-Why two days?

228
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,227
Do you have a boyfriend in Seoul?

229
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,147
I guess you do.

230
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,983
Ju-ri, you have a boyfriend?

231
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,735
No.

232
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,571
Well then, I'll be off soon.

233
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,659
I bet she does have a boyfriend.

234
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,369
She's a traitor.

235
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,692
I don't think
your daughter will be able to come here.

236
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,788
No.

237
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,164
What's the matter?

238
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,417
No!

239
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,130
Die.

240
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,426
If she comes...

241
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,196
FAIRY TALE READING
WITH AUTHOR KO MUN-YEONG

242
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:24,866
Gang-tae.

243
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,952
Yes?

244
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,497
I heard someone puked on you.

245
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,583
-She even slapped me.
-My gosh.

246
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,628
You should make sure
the day doesn't get worse.

247
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,257
Kim Seung-cheol, who's in isolation,
will be sent to the police--

248
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,676
Yes, I heard. I'll take care of him.

249
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,596
We had a team dinner last night,
and we made a bet.

250
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,307
"A bet"?

251
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,891
"Why does Moon Gang-tae

252
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,937
move from hospital to hospital every year
instead of settling down?"

253
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,397
We tried to guess it.

254
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,482
Number one.

255
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,111
You borrowed lots of money
and you're being chased after.

256
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,323
Number two.
You got yourself in big trouble,

257
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,742
and you're working here
to hide your identity.

258
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,659
Number three.

259
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:13,290
You get kicked out of every hospital
for hitting on the nurses and patients.

260
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,419
-Which one did you bet on?
-I bet on

261
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,963
number three. Women.

262
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,174
So what's the answer?

263
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,471
Number four.

264
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,228
Men.

265
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,150
Gang-tae. My gosh.

266
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,526
The coffee tastes nice.

267
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,825
-"I'm still going to love you.
-I'm still going to love you.

268
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,787
-You're as pitiful as I am.
-You're as pitiful as I am.

269
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,622
-I'm not pitiful.
-I'm not pitiful.

270
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,499
-Yes, you are.
-Yes, you are.

271
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,795
-You're even treating me like an orphan?
-You're even treating me like an orphan?

272
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,214
-Even if you're not,
-Even if you're not,

273
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,675
-you think and act like an orphan."
-you think and act like an orphan.

274
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,718
AUTHOR KO MUN-YEONG

275
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,012
-"You're ruthless, insecure,

-Because I decided to do so."
-Because I decided to do so.

281
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,694
I also decided...

282
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,864
"I'm still going to love you."

283
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,536
Did you eat?

284
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,996
I ate jjamppong. Jjamppong.

285
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,290
Again? You need to stop eating noodles.

286
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,544
I bought you some side dishes yesterday.
What are you doing?

287
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,337
I'm drawing.

288
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,840
You're drawing on that woman's book again.

289
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,051
It's not "that woman."
She's writer Ko Mun-yeong.

290
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,263
Yes, Ko Mun-yeong.

291
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,349
She's coming to our hospital today.

292
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,271
She'll be reading her book
to the children here.

293
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,150
Sang-tae?

294
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,112
I'll go. I'll go there.
I'll go there right now.

295
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,738
I'll take blue bus, number 243,

296
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,074
get off at Jayang intersection,
and take 5413,

297
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,909
-the green bus.
-Sang-tae. No, wait.

298
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,704
Get off at Myungsung University
Medical Center and walk--

299
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,830
Moon Sang-tae!

300
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,794
Take three deep breaths.

301
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,852
Listen to me carefully.
Even if you leave now, you'll be late.

302
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,354
Plus, it's only for the children
at our hospital.

303
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,565
But you're not a child, are you?

304
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,693
Moon Sang-tae. 35 years old.
Born in 1984, the year of the rat.

305
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,778
I'm younger than I look,
but I'm not a child.

306
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,155
Exactly. You're an adult.

307
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,783
But instead,
I'll get you an autograph if I can.

308
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,038
Meeting her is a one-time thing,
but autographs last forever.

309
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,750
-Which one do you think is better?
-Her autograph.

310
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,506
Who do you like more, me or her?

311
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,184
Hello? Sang-tae?

312
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,986
I didn't want to ruin her mood
prior to the big event.

313
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,613
That's why I kept it quiet.

314
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,033
I was going to convince her
and take her there

315
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,786
after she successfully finished
today's reading.

316
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,287
Darn it. I totally messed up.

317
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,208
I have a bad feeling.

318
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,628
Why does Ms. Ko hate her father so much?

319
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,005
She hates everyone apart from herself.

320
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,716
Don't even ask why.
That's just how she was born.

321
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,928
If you want to live a long life,
just stay quiet.

322
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,599
Gosh, where in the world is she?
It's almost time.

323
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:16,866
Excuse me.

324
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,128
-Can you please--
-This is my last one.

325
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,797
No, I don't want one. Can you put it out?

326
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,384
-I just lit it up.
-You can't smoke here so put it out.

327
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,642
Do you believe in destiny?

328
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,686
-What?
-You heard me.

329
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,442
Who cares about destiny?

330
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,989
If someone shows up when you need them,

331
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,158
you call that destiny.

332
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,389
THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES

333
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,809
Gosh, that was so loud.

334
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,025
Very realistic, isn't it?
She's good at acting, too.

335
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,415
"The boy woke up
from another awful nightmare.

336
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,921
Bad memories from the past
that he wanted to forget

337
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,924
were replayed in his dreams every night

338
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,844
and haunted him nonstop.

339
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,266
He was terrified of falling asleep.

340
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,686
So one day,
he went to the witch and begged.

341
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,400
'Please get rid of all my bad memories

342
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,237
so that I won't ever have
a nightmare again.

343
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:05,577
Then I will do everything you ask.'"

344
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,622
Go-eun!

345
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,376
-Go-eun!
-My goodness, what's wrong with you?

346
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,378
Where is Go-eun?

347
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,464
Go-eun!

348
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,136
Go-eun. Where is Go-eun?

349
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,514
Seagull 777. I repeat. Seagull 777.

350
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,268
A NON-PROVOCATIVE CODE FOR PATIENTS
WHO ESCAPE FROM THEIR WARDS

351
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,653
-Hello.
-And lie on your stomach.

352
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,073
Let's try again.

353
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,325
-Are you serious?
-Sorry.

354
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,203
-He felt trapped so I untied him.
-You have restraint straps?

355
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,370
Oh, I forgot.

356
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,173
Look to your right and hold onto your arm.

357
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,718
Let's try it one more time.

358
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,182
"Years went by,
and the boy became an adult.

359
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,768
-He no longer had nightmares.
-Go-eun.

360
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:16,064
But for some strange reason,
he wasn't happy at all."

361
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,483
-Go-eun.
-What's your problem?

362
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,110
Go-eun.

363
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,780
Gosh, what are you doing?

364
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,075
"One night,
a blood moon filled the night sky,

365
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,035
and the witch finally showed up again

366
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,455
to take what he had promised
in return for granting his wish.

367
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,292
And he shouted at her
with so much resentment.

368
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,963
'All my bad memories are gone.

369
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,674
But why...

370
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,010
Why can't I become happy?'

371
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:50,014
Then the witch took his soul
as they had promised,

372
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,933
and told him this."

373
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,855
-What's going on?
-Mom!

374
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,065
What the hell is happening?

375
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:04,779
We unfortunately have to end this here
due to unforeseen circumstances.

376
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,115
All staff and guardians,
please take all children

377
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,784
-back to the ward immediately.
-Go-eun.

378
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,913
Go-eun.

379
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,041
-This isn't over yet.
-Go-eun.

380
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,626
Kids, it's not over.

381
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,503
-Come on.
-Go on.

382
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,339
-Damn it.
-Gosh.

383
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,008
-Mom!
-Mom, I'm scared.

384
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,092
Okay, let's go.

385
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:28,678
Hello?

386
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:30,805
Damn it.

387
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,807
Go up.

388
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,517
-Hey!
-Let's go up.

389
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,644
Wait! Wait up.

390
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,188
Go-eun! My gosh, Go-eun...

391
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,107
Come with Daddy.

392
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,859
-Who are you to end this?
-No!

393
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,944
-Right before the climax.
-Let me--

394
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,988
Is it something like "to be continued"?

395
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,865
-It's all right.
-No, I'm scared.

396
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,825
Bring the kids back.

397
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,118
Come on. Let's go.

398
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,495
There are only a few lines left,

399
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,290
so they can leave when it's done.

400
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,208
-You should evacuate--
-Now!

401
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,681
Dad, don't be like this.

402
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,767
I'm scared.

403
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,478
Listen carefully.

404
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,814
If we get caught, I'll be locked away
in a mental institution,

405
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,733
and you'll end up in an orphanage.

406
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,277
Will you be okay
if you can never see me again?

407
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,072
I want to live. I don't want to die.

408
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,240
I told you.

409
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,118
Kids can never live on their own.

410
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,287
If we must be separated,

411
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,289
it'd be better to die together.

412
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,501
What the...

413
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,921
That's such bullshit.

414
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,177
You're a worthless human being
I haven't seen in a while.

415
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,304
Look at that gross face.

416
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,890
Who are you? Do you have a death wish?

417
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,267
Have you ever killed anyone?

418
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,021
You can't carry on with your life,

419
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,607
yet you can't even muster up the courage
to die alone.

420
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,861
So you're trying to lure this kid
into going down that road first.

421
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,321
What?

422
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,782
Don't be such a loser.

423
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,867
Go ahead and take your life alone.

424
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,786
You crazy bitch!

425
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,215
A knife...

426
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,887
Hey!

427
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,309
You piece of...

428
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,872
-Are you all right?
-My dad is...

429
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,758
Who are you to meddle in my affairs?

430
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,217
She's my child.

431
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,512
I can kill her if I want to.
I can do whatever I want with her!

432
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:20,058
Choke me. Choke me harder, you moron.

433
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,392
You lunatic!

434
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,771
Die. Just die!

435
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,572
It'll be quick.

436
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,117
It'll just be a moment.

437
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,453
It'll end even before you know it.

438
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,044
Die. Just die.

439
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,546
-Die!
-Mr. Kim Seung-cheol!

440
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,594
Let go. Get off me!

441
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,971
You piece of...

442
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,890
Come here.

443
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,531
Let go. Let go of me!

444
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,369
Let go, you bastard! I'll kill you all!

445
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,122
-Let go!
-I'm doing this so that you won't be hurt,

446
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,039
so calm down!

447
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,834
I'll kill you all. I'm going to kill...

448
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,283
THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES

449
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,079
So it wasn't destiny after all.

450
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,419
I'd appreciate it
if you could stay out of this.

451
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,379
Let go of the knife.

452
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,341
He's a patient.

453
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,092
No.

454
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,053
He is not a patient.

455
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,765
He's vermin.

456
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,812
She's crazy. She's completely nuts.

457
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,981
She's insane!

458
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,743
That crazy bitch.
I nearly died because of that bitch!

459
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,996
Let go. Let go of me, you idiots.

460
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,958
Get her, not me.
She's the one who needs help!

461
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,668
-Don't lose him.
-Let go!

462
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,170
Get that insane woman in there!

463
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,713
Let go!

464
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,434
Is the knife hurt?
Why are you wrapping the knife?

465
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,898
If he's non compos mentis,
we can say I acted in self-defense.

466
00:37:56,315 --> 00:38:00,236
I just wanted to give him a small cut,
but you overreacted and hurt yourself.

467
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,239
Here.

468
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,452
Your hand, not the knife.

469
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,249
Here's my special service.

470
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,167
You know what?

471
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,046
In this world,
there are people who deserve to die.

472
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,174
But some thoughtful freaks

473
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,760
kill them for us in secret.

474
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,931
That is why the clueless civilians
can sleep peacefully at night,

475
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,350
completely unaware of it.

476
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,064
Which one do you think I am?

477
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,370
You're

478
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,081
a clueless freak.

479
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,722
Oh, boy.

480
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,642
Thanks to you, my suturing skills
are getting better by the day.

481
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,646
Stop hurting yourself already.

482
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,319
Mr. Moon?

483
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,780
Mr. Moon Gang-tae.

484
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,199
Yes?

485
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,493
What were you thinking about?

486
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,289
It's done.

487
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,667
Okay, fine.
The event turned into total chaos

488
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,962
because of that patient,
so let's just consider it buzz marketing.

489
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,799
But what about the knife fight?
How will you explain it?

490
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,884
One of the hospital staff got hurt.

491
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,969
What if they distribute a press release?

492
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,514
"A famous children's book author
brandished a knife.

493
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:55,518
Is she working on a martial arts novel?"
You'll see the headlines everywhere.

494
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,561
Just bribe them.
You've done it many times.

495
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:01,065
-What if that doesn't work?
-We'll use a honey trap. I'll seduce him.

496
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:09,949
Get in.

497
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,287
You go ahead.
I have to take care of something.

498
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,123
What do you need to do?

499
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,917
Hey, Mun-yeong!

500
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,628
Is she going to cause trouble again?

501
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,004
ADMIN MANAGER

502
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,173
A patient who should've been in isolation

503
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,676
barged in there and ruined the event.

504
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:33,055
Guardians are calling to complain,
so the phones are ringing off the hook.

505
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:37,184
We need to quickly find someone
who will take the bullet.

506
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,273
Are you saying I should be that person?

507
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,317
The one who was in charge
of the transfer is new,

508
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,570
so I can't really fire him.

509
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,781
I see here that you've worked

510
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,410
at so many different hospitals
in the past ten years.

511
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,288
My gosh, 15 hospitals in total.

512
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,750
And less than a year at all of them.
You've been here for ten months,

513
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,546
so you'll be quitting soon anyway.

514
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,630
EMPLOYEE CARD

515
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,135
Gang-tae.

516
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,349
I'll say you worked here for a year
and give you the severance pay.

517
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,768
Let's sort it out like that.

518
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,579
Hey, it's me.

519
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,291
Get me the number of the guy
who got hurt because of Mun-yeong.

520
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,793
What do you think?

521
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,339
I need to bribe him to silence him.
Come on. You know the drill.

522
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,708
JAE-SU'S FRIED CHICKEN DELIVERY

523
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,385
I was delivering an order

524
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,555
but saw a guy sitting like a sick chicken
and knew it was you.

525
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,897
Hop on. I'll give you a ride.

526
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,817
You freak.

527
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,654
You're hurt again?

528
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,508
Damn it.

529
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,177
Is he ignoring my calls?

530
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,182
If he bled, I'm sure he'll sue her.

531
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,811
NURSE NAM JU-RI

532
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,233
Hello, Ms. Nam.

533
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,486
Oh, I see. You're already here?

534
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,572
Right.

535
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,491
The room number is...

536
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,120
Just a moment.

537
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,171
Did you order room service?

538
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,095
Where did he go?

539
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,356
Thanks.

540
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,491
Alberto, no. Don't do this to me.

541
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,119
No, Alberto. Don't be like this.
Please, no!

542
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,829
Don't do this to me!

543
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,455
-Shit.
-What's wrong?

544
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,748
-Gosh!
-What's going on?

545
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,042
Hang on, Alberto. Gosh!

546
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,838
Alberto!

547
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,842
Giddy-up!

548
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,219
Alberto! Shit. Alberto, please...

549
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,346
Don't die.

550
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,434
Gang-tae!

551
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,228
I'm really okay.

552
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,732
Sang-tae must be waiting for you,
so just take a cab home!

553
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,776
I won't say that you ditched me!

554
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,695
I totally understand!

555
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,407
Because that is
what a true loyal friend would do!

556
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,576
Shut it and just keep on pulling.

557
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:53,542
ANOTHER LONG DAY, RIGHT? CHEER UP!

558
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,503
YOU WILL MEET YOUR SOUL MATE SOON.

559
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,233
You've changed so much.

560
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,945
I almost couldn't recognize you
because you don't look like a hick.

561
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,284
Has it been almost 20 years
since I moved to a different school?

562
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:29,536
Yes.

563
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,374
We just need your signature here.

564
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,836
The doctor must've already explained
everything over the phone.

565
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,255
You should actually do it in person--

566
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,716
Hey, you traveled for three hours

567
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,969
just to get my signature
on this stupid paperwork?

568
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:49,431
Do you have a strong sense of duty?
Or are you a do-gooder?

569
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,564
Our hospital is a psychiatric clinic,

570
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,193
so we have to work with another hospital
to perform surgery.

571
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,321
-In your father's case--
-I told you that he's dead.

572
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,450
I'm an orphan. You know that.

573
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:14,248
-But your mother is alive--
-I registered her death a long time ago.

574
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,584
Do you know what's interesting?

575
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,676
My dad's soul is dead,

576
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,720
but he's physically alive like a zombie.

577
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,099
As for my mom,

578
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,269
she physically died many years ago.

579
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,272
However,

580
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,696
her soul is still alive.

581
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,623
So between the two of them,
who's really dead?

582
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,252
Tell me, nurse. Who's really dead?

583
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,088
Your father...

584
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,592
I mean, Mr. Ko Dae-hwan.

585
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,678
He'll be in critical condition
without the surgery this time.

586
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,346
His cognitive functions--

587
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,016
Hey, others will think
that you're his daughter.

588
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,519
Oh, why don't we do that?
You can be his daughter.

589
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,021
I'll be your mom's daughter.

590
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,941
I'll sign this consent form
if you agree to that. What do you say?

591
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,849
Your mom is a good cook.

592
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,937
Shall I come over for some food
like the good old days?

593
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,651
I see that you still don't get my jokes.

594
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,196
You're no fun.

595
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,077
She pisses me off.

596
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,038
She's insane.

597
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:21,541
I can't believe she writes
children's book. That's bizarre.

598
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,210
She's not "insane."

599
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,421
She was just born that way.

600
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,548
Gosh. Can you diagnose people at a glance

601
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,259
now that you've worked
at mental hospitals for ten years?

602
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,303
Stop overreacting.

603
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,847
You fool, can you please learn
to overreact a little?

604
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,894
You got fired and got cut
because of those lunatics.

605
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,522
I can't believe you just left
without causing a scene.

606
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,773
Had I done that,

607
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,360
it would've felt nice,

608
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,072
-but I wouldn't get my severance pay.
-Well done.

609
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,118
Your brother got expelled from school,
and you got fired from work.

610
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,953
You guys are two peas in a pod.

611
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,288
It was about time I quit anyway.

612
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,671
It's this time of the year.

613
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,340
When the night breeze feels warm.

614
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,634
I guess

615
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,888
butterflies will appear soon.

616
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,019
Right.

617
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,357
How's Sang-tae? No signs yet?

618
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:29,901
No, not yet.

619
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,612
Then where should we go next?

620
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:38,618
-Should we go to another country?
-Do you even have a passport?

621
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,746
Sang-tae should learn English.

622
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:43,832
Jae-su.

623
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,543
Don't say anything to Sang-tae.

624
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:50,380
Gosh, you only care about your brother.
I'm sick of this.

625
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,507
I'm so jealous.

626
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:54,968
You scared me.

627
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,140
What's wrong?
Did she also hit you in the head?

628
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,395
The autograph.
I forgot to get her autograph.

629
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,565
-I promised him I'd get it.
-She must've hit you hard.

630
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,025
What do I do?

631
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:11,943
Oh, dear.

632
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,822
AUTHOR KO MUN-YEONG'S AUTOGRAPH

633
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,586
Gosh, her autograph
looks like a bunch of heroglyphs.

634
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,256
Hieroglyphs, not "heroglyphs."

635
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,469
Hurry up. Sang-tae is waiting.

636
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,938
Done. Have a look.

637
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,982
Look. It's very similar, isn't it?

638
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,492
Nice job, Jae-su!

639
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,120
Hey, quiet down.

640
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,041
-Happy now?
-Yes.

641
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,168
He'll be happy.

642
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,549
Don't smile like that. It disgusts me.

643
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,095
A patient said the same thing to me today.

644
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,014
Is my smile that annoying?

645
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,142
You don't know?

646
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,894
You really don't know?

647
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,314
-What?
-When you smile,

648
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,402
you look like the Joker.

649
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,530
With those sad eyes
and your lips pointing up like this.

650
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,908
Look in the mirror. You'll see.

651
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:47,998
Let's go.

652
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,091
Sang-tae, I'm home.

653
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:06,808
This...

654
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,897
This is fake. It's fake.

655
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,733
-No, it's real--
-This is fake.

656
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,234
-That's…
-It's fake.

657
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,029
-Sang-tae, wait.
-This is fake.

658
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:22,782
-Goodness...
-This is fake.

659
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,785
This is fake, fake, fake. It's all fake.

660
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,871
You lied to me.

661
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,541
-Sang-tae, I'm sorry.
-You lied to me.

662
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:33,668
You lied to me?

663
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,004
-Lying is bad.
-I was too busy today that...

664
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,797
Lying is bad. You lied to me?

665
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,091
Even little kids know
that it's wrong to lie.

666
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,427
-Shall we go to the bookstore tomorrow?
-You lied?

667
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,013
-Even a kid--
-Shall we get the dinosaur encyclopedia?

668
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,307
-What?
-You always wanted that book.

669
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,062
-Sang-tae?
-You lied?

670
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,065
You lied? Why did you lie to me?

671
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:59,402
-Lying is bad.
-Gosh, you poor thing.

672
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,366
This is all Ko Mun-yeong's fault.

673
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,369
I'm going to burn all these books!
What is this?

674
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,412
-Why would a boy feed on nightmares?
-No!

675
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,874
-No, don't.
-I'll burn all these books.

676
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,542
-No!
-No? Why not?

677
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,087
-It's mine. Don't do this.
-I'll burn them all.

678
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,797
-Hello.
-Let go.

679
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,175
I am Lee Sang-in,
the CEO of SangSangESang Publishers,

680
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,636
a children's book publisher.

681
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:31,476
First of all,
I'd like to sincerely apologize

682
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:35,021
for the unfortunate incident
between you and our author earlier today.

683
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,401
I'd like to speak with you

684
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,945
if you can spare a moment
out of your busy schedule.

685
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,905
It'd be greatly appreciated

686
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,658
if you could stop by our office tomorrow.

687
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,245
Please don't say no.

688
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,707
I'd really like to meet you. Please.

689
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:05,051
-Please!
-Why would you read children's books?

690
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,721
You don't understand art.
Art is a beautiful thing.

691
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,973
What do you mean I don't understand art?

692
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,309
Naughty erotica books are what I call art.

693
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,644
-This is--
-Go away. Just go home.

694
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,855
-Just leave.
-Come on. I like you so much.

695
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,236
Of course. I knew it. Let's see.

696
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,114
Sure.

697
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:29,909
"Sure"?
Gosh, that doesn't sound good.

698
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,454
Around 6 p.m., at a Seoul hospital,
a man arranged

699
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,707
-to be transferred to the police
-I have a bad feeling.

700
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,710
after attempting to take his own life
as well as his daughter's

701
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,796
was found dead in solitary confinement.

702
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,923
The police are investigating his death.

703
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:47,010
He caused a scene
at a book reading event

704
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,346
which was held
for children in the hospital,

705
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:53,016
but the security guards
were able to stop him immediately.

706
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,760
He has such beautiful eyes.

707
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,065
Do you know this?

708
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:46,194
In this world,
there are people who deserve to die.

709
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:50,407
But some thoughtful freaks
kill them for us in secret.

710
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,952
That is why the clueless civilians
can sleep peacefully at night,

711
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,954
completely unaware of it.

712
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,845
What the…
I told you not to look down on me.

713
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,806
Yes, I won't.

714
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,725
-Stop him.
-Okay, go back to sleep.

715
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,538
JAE-SU IS NOT ALLOWED!

716
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,814
THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES

717
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:37,847
"The boy woke up
from another awful nightmare.

718
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,353
Bad memories from the past
that he wanted to forget

719
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,231
were replayed in his dreams every night

720
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,234
and haunted him nonstop.

721
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,741
Years went by,
and the boy became an adult.

722
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,619
He no longer had nightmares.

723
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,830
But for some strange reason,
he wasn't happy at all.

724
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,293
One night,
a blood moon filled the night sky,

725
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,420
and the witch finally showed up again

726
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:13,132
to take what he had promised
in return for granting his wish.

727
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,928
And he shouted at her
with so much resentment.

728
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,395
'All my bad memories are gone. But why…

729
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,356
Why can't I become happy?'

730
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,530
Then the witch took his soul
as they had promised

731
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,156
and told him this.

732
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,453
'Hurtful, painful memories.

733
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,206
Memories of deep regrets.

734
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,335
Memories of hurting others and being hurt.

735
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,589
Memories of being abandoned.

736
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:58,052
Only those with such memories
buried in their hearts

737
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,556
can become stronger, more passionate,

738
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,975
and emotionally flexible.

739
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,937
And only those can attain happiness.'"

740
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,099
Never forget today.

741
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:55,818
You can't fall asleep?

742
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,821
Where's my dad?

743
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,909
Everything will be okay. Don't worry.

744
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,205
Will the police take him?

745
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,085
Will he be locked away
in a mental institution?

746
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:17,882
Are you scared
that he'll show up again and harass you?

747
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,551
That won't happen again.

748
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,763
My dad...

749
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,433
My dad is

750
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,395
not a bad person.

751
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,814
He's just not well.

752
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,483
He's mentally ill.

753
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:38,736
So please...

754
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,031
Don't let the police take him.

755
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,493
Please allow me to live with him.

756
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,080
I want to live with my dad.

757
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,083
I want to live with him.

758
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,920
I miss my dad.

759
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:58,423
-"So don't forget any of it.
-Dad...

760
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,759
Remember it all and overcome it.
If you don't overcome it,

761
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:07,306
you'll always be a kid
whose soul never grows."

762
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,285
What? Butterflies...

763
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,079
No, those butterflies!

764
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:41,776
-What? What's going on?
-Butterflies!

765
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,736
-What's the matter?
-Butterflies...

766
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,530
-Sang-tae.
-Butterflies...

767
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,615
Gosh, those butterflies...

768
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,784
Butterflies! Those butterflies!

769
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,746
-Don't! I'm sorry!
-They're back. Those damn butterflies.

770
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,957
Those butterflies!

771
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,752
They said they'll kill me.
The butterflies will kill me!

772
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,713
They're coming to kill me!

773
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,341
-I have to run away.
-Sang-tae.

774
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:08,010
I have to go. I must run away!

775
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,179
Go away!

776
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,604
Hey, Gang-tae!

777
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,315
It's not even the peak moving season.
Why move out?

778
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,025
Gosh, I can't believe this.

779
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:24,861
Gang-tae!

780
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,948
You still have months left on your lease.
Why do you...

781
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,616
Gosh, you scared me.

782
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,451
Mister, you slept here again?

783
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,787
Then you need to chip in
for the water usage!

784
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,248
Go bring the young man.

785
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:40,251
We're friends. Why is he a young man
when you call me a mister?

786
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,670
Cut it out. Where is he?

787
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:44,463
I wonder too.

788
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:47,341
Where on earth did he go so early?

789
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:08,863
Mr. Moon Gang-tae?

790
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,492
Hello.

791
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,621
My boss is on his way back
from the print shop now.

792
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,706
He said he'll be about ten minutes late.

793
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:48,069
This way.

794
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,114
Please wait here for a moment.

795
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,449
Sure.

796
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:06,504
THE HAND, THE MONKFISH

797
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:16,681
AUTHOR KO MUN-YEONG

798
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:41,038
Guys, she's here!
Clear your desks. Tidy up.

799
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:44,917
Hurry.

800
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,763
Who sits here?

801
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,142
The accounting manager. Why do you ask?

802
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:03,394
This is pretty.

803
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,229
-I want it--
-Then you can have it.

804
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,189
I was going to anyway.

805
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:17,491
-Ms. Ko, what brings you by?
-Zombie Kid is coming out today.

806
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,493
-Where's Mr. Lee?
-Well...

807
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:03,412
What a sight.

808
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,715
You look dashing in regular clothes.

809
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,260
Like an escort who's here to harass me
to pay off my tab.

810
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:24,225
I thought you'd be different,
but I was obviously wrong.

811
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:25,935
How much did he offer?

812
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:29,146
If you can't talk politely,
at least try not to be so cryptic.

813
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,440
And look at you talking to me so casually.

814
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,151
I practically stabbed you.

815
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,782
-What about it?
-How much did Mr. Lee offer you

816
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,201
to compensate you for that

817
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,579
as well as to make sure
you won't tell anyone about it?

818
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,668
I guess this has always worked.

819
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:52,336
Verbal consolation is useless.

820
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:53,504
Money is the best.

821
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:56,382
Not to me.

822
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,218
Then what do you want? Sex?

823
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,971
Is it worth more than money?

824
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,600
Then why are you here?

825
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:09,812
If not for money or sex,
what are you here for?

826
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:15,568
I was hoping

827
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,115
I could see you

828
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:23,409
again.

829
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,205
Your eyes.

830
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:31,876
I wanted to see them again.

831
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:36,589
My eyes?

832
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:38,966
Your eyes

833
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,054
remind me of someone I used to know.

834
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:49,059
Who is that person?

835
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,355
Someone who's messed up

836
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,944
and has no conscience.

837
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:00,988
A woman

838
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:04,200
whose eyes

839
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:07,203
utterly lacked warmth.

840
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:15,544
That woman...

841
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,342
Were you afraid of her?

842
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,097
No, the opposite.

843
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,826
I liked her.

844
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:01,650
Are you that excited?

845
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:04,903
"Dear Sang-tae!
Please come to my book launch party."

846
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,614
It's boring to say
that we're destined for each other.

847
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:09,074
I thought I was on the run…

848
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:10,701
Don't touch my hair!

849
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:12,202
because of my brother.

850
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:14,288
Coward.

851
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:16,582
Where is Ko Mun-yeong?

852
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,585
You won't end up well
if you get involved with her.

853
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,297
-Don't go.
-I want you to be my safety pin.

854
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:27,217
Keep me under control
so that I won't explode.

855
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:40,814
The boy woke up
from another awful nightmare.

856
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,485
Bad memories from the past
that he wanted to forget

857
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:47,863
were replayed in his dreams every night

858
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:50,574
and haunted him nonstop.

859
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,869
The boy was terrified of falling asleep.

860
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:57,039
So one day,
he went to the witch and begged.

861
01:12:57,998 --> 01:13:01,001
"Please get rid of all my bad memories

862
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:04,213
so that I won't ever have
a nightmare again.

863
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:08,008
Then I will do everything you ask."

864
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:12,262
Years went by,
and the boy became an adult.

865
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:14,848
He no longer had nightmares.

866
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:19,228
But for some strange reason,
he wasn't happy at all.

867
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,399
One night,
a blood moon filled the night sky,

868
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,317
and the witch finally showed up again

869
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,821
to take what he had promised
in return for granting his wish.

870
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:32,282
And he shouted at her
with so much resentment.

871
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,911
"All my bad memories are gone. But why...

872
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,705
Why can't I become happy?"

873
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,085
Then the witch took his soul,
as they had promised,

874
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:44,586
and told him this.

875
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,172
"Hurtful, painful memories.

876
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,466
Memories of deep regrets.

877
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:53,137
Memories of hurting others and being hurt.

878
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:55,639
Memories of being abandoned.

879
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:00,185
Only those with such memories
buried in their hearts

880
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,813
can become stronger, more passionate,

881
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:06,066
and emotionally flexible.

882
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,362
And only those can attain happiness.

883
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:14,700
So don't forget any of it.
Remember it all and overcome it.

884
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,535
If you don't overcome it,

885
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:21,373
you'll always be a kid
whose soul never grows."

886
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,961
