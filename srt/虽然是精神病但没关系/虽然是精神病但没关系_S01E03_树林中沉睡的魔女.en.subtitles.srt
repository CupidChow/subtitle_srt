1
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,446
Do you know The Red Shoes
written by Hans Christian Andersen?

2
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,572
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

3
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,287
This happens sometimes when it rains.

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,083
I heard everyone was against this hospital

5
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,168
being built where a cemetery used to be.

6
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,673
Maybe it's because earthbound spirits here
are all very resentful.

7
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,801
Be careful
when you do your rounds at night.

8
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,386
I'll let the maintenance team know.

9
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,769
He's fearless.

10
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,731
Yes, the ones in the rooms are fine.

11
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,484
But the lights in the lobby
and the reception area are out.

12
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,695
Yes, okay.

13
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,240
Once you wear those shoes,

14
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,201
your feet start dancing on their own.

15
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,496
And you can never stop dancing

16
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,125
or take off those shoes.

17
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:11,005
Some things can't be torn apart
no matter how hard you try to do so.

18
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,607
I have

19
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,111
finally found my red shoes.

20
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,583
Why

21
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,294
are you here?

22
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,920
Why do you think?

23
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,423
I came because I missed you.

24
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:24,954
CHAPTER 3 SLEEPING WITCH

25
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,966
I clearly said I didn't want
to cross paths with you ever again.

26
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,220
You did say that,
but I never agreed to it.

27
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,521
What are you doing?

28
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,815
I'm just fascinated.

29
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,318
You grew up to be a great guy.

30
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,614
I'd say you didn't just grow,
you went through an evolution.

31
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,744
Do you know me?

32
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,288
I want to get to know you better.

33
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,748
When do you get off work?

34
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,625
I rushed here on an empty stomach.

35
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,293
I'm freaking starving right now.

36
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,128
Is there a good restaurant
in this tiny town?

37
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,465
What do you want from me?

38
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,677
I know you won't back off
until you get it,

39
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,512
so tell me what you want.
What do you want?

40
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,597
"Just take it and leave"?

41
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,266
Yes, if you don't mind.

42
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,142
You.

43
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,728
I'll take it and leave.

44
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,981
Moon Gang-tae, what I want is you.

45
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,778
-Why me?
-Because I can't stop wanting you.

46
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,406
-But why?
-Because you're so pretty.

47
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,786
Well, you know.
Like shoes, clothes, and cars.

48
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,579
When I see something pretty, I want it.

49
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,081
And I need to have what I want.

50
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,750
Whether I have to pay for it, steal it,

51
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,127
or just take it by force.

52
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,753
What matters is that I make it mine.

53
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,506
You don't need some grand reason
to desire something, right?

54
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,475
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

55
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,981
The director would like to speak
with the patient's guardian.

56
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,069
HOSPITAL MISSION
IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY

57
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,281
We'll have to see how he recovers,

58
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,200
but his cognitive functions
were impaired to begin with,

59
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,412
so he may not recognize you now
even though you're his daughter.

60
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,792
You can have a seat here.

61
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,129
No, thanks.

62
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:42,300
Mental disorders accompanied
by brain tumors like your father's case

63
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,177
are difficult to treat.

64
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,346
But we can help reduce the symptoms.

65
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,556
Are you kidding me?

66
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,017
Even if the legendary doctor,
Hua Tuo, is resurrected,

67
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,769
it wouldn't be possible.

68
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,397
His memory is all messed up,

69
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,816
he keeps hearing and seeing things,

70
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,277
and he gets scared for no reason.

71
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,655
Also, he keeps saying things
that make no sense.

72
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,659
His symptoms are really awful, I must say.

73
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,912
Those symptoms remind me
of people who are possessed.

74
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,914
Should I hire an exorcist
and hold a ritual?

75
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,420
I'll write him a prescription
which will be much more effective

76
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,632
than an exorcism or a talisman.

77
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,151
He looks nothing like her, right?

78
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,904
Professor Ko's daughter is very pretty.

79
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,615
I guess she got her looks
from her late mother.

80
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,117
His daughter is here?

81
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,744
Is she pretty?
Which celebrity does she look like?

82
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,704
Did you drink again?

83
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,874
If you keep that up,
you'll be stuck here forever.

84
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,627
No, I didn't drink.

85
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,172
I'm serious. I didn't drink at all.

86
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,716
Here.

87
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,144
OK GROUP THERAPY PROGRAM

88
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,563
What is this?

89
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,815
It's the prescription I just mentioned.

90
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,736
It's our hospital's group therapy program.

91
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,072
Have a look.

92
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,701
From cooking, art, and music
to meditation and gardening,

93
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,370
the program offers all kinds of classes

94
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,705
designed to help treat patients,

95
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,876
except for a class on literature.

96
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:45,256
In psychiatry, balance is very important.

97
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,091
So what?

98
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,428
Can you help us out for an hour,
twice a week?

99
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,598
It can be about reading or writing.

100
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:57,560
It doesn't matter. Just think of it as
using your skill sets to do a good deed.

101
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,354
Please teach a class, Ms. Ko.

102
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,317
Well, sir.

103
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,280
The most important part,
the terms and conditions of employment.

104
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,366
Every time you come here to teach,

105
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,869
you can take your father out
for a 30-minute walk.

106
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,789
Shouldn't I be suggesting
the terms that I want?

107
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,671
This is what I prescribe
to the patient and you, his guardian.

108
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,185
I must say, she's got quite a temper.

109
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,854
You didn't actually think
she'd agree to it, did you?

110
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,691
Do you not watch the news?
She's been all over the news.

111
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,028
But she came all the way here
despite what's going on,

112
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,408
which tells me that she's after
someone or something that's here.

113
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,668
Hey, you're here.

114
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,131
Did you see her?
I heard Ko Mun-yeong came by.

115
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,133
Gosh, I heard
she's drop-dead gorgeous in person.

116
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,677
I should've come earlier.

117
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,556
-Do you think she left already?
-Who cares? It's none of your business.

118
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,349
What will you do about this?

119
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,434
What about it?

120
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,021
You botched it all up like this.

121
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,606
You told me to cut it up

122
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,900
because the patients
could hang themselves with it.

123
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,070
I told you to just make a few cuts,
not to cut it into pieces.

124
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,740
Okay, I heard you.
This doesn't even cost much.

125
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,785
I'll just buy a box of it.

126
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,328
You're pissing me off.

127
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,082
Where are you going?

128
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,668
The bathroom.

129
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,024
Just leave it if you're scared
of getting an earful from Ms. Park.

130
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,817
I'll return it later.

131
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,986
Yes, save that for later.
Let's go eat something first.

132
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,448
What are you doing here?

133
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,588
You can't come in here. Get out.

134
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,466
The guy who just left said
I'd find you here and let me in.

135
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,052
-Get out.
-Why?

136
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,637
-Just get out.
-Gosh.

137
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,227
Let go of me.

138
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,593
What? You think we should pretend
not to know each other?

139
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,595
That's what your face is telling me.

140
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,348
I'd appreciate that.

141
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,683
Sure, it's nothing difficult.

142
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,022
How do you and Gang-tae know each other?

143
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,195
Why do you ask? That you can't ignore?

144
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,615
That's something I never understood.

145
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:45,121
How can you define a relationship
in just one word?

146
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,049
Every encounter we've had
was awfully dramatic,

147
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,384
being an inch away from death.

148
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,514
And every moment we crossed paths,
we surprised each other.

149
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,195
If such coincidences, one after another,

150
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,322
somehow led us here,

151
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,326
how would you define our relationship?

152
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,875
It'd be such a cliché to say
that we're destined for each other.

153
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,084
Right?

154
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,278
Get in.

155
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,282
I said, get in.

156
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,204
Where are you?

157
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,250
I'll call you again later.

158
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,922
Don't waste your energy. Just get in.

159
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,381
Let's go eat some meat. I'm hungry.

160
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,218
Go by yourself. I have plans for dinner.

161
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,220
Oh, with Sang-tae?

162
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,223
That works out perfectly.

163
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,517
We can have the meet-and-greet today.
Where do you live?

164
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,150
I guess bulldozing your way through
like this usually works,

165
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,568
but it'll never work with me.

166
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,739
You're going to play hard to get?

167
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,407
This will be fun.

168
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,326
Let's find out
whether you'll give in or not.

169
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,996
Okay, fine.

170
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,165
Look at those glaring eyes of yours.

171
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,458
I'll leave you alone today.

172
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,882
But I'll kidnap you if you
play hard to get next time I see you!

173
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,789
Fuck, that scared the crap out of me.

174
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,374
Shut up, you stupid deer!

175
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,501
You won't shut up?

176
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,929
SEONGJIN DEER MILK

177
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,730
-Have a great day.
-Thank you.

178
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,378
I thought you were having dinner with her.

179
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,338
No, we're not close.

180
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,675
And dinner is the only meal
I can have at home,

181
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,510
so I should eat with my brother.

182
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,220
Right.

183
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,100
Hey, Jae-su.

184
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,062
I'm in front of the house.
There's Coke in the fridge.

185
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,022
Yes.

186
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,816
Okay.

187
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,416
BORN IN OJI-GUN, SEONGJIN CITY

188
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,876
This isn't good.

189
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,004
Gosh, she really shouldn't go
to this place.

190
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,590
What place?

191
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,053
The cursed castle.

192
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,075
It's a mansion Mun-yeong's father built

193
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,911
to celebrate her birth.

194
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,290
He built it
in the middle of a remote forest

195
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,294
so that his wife could focus
on her writing.

196
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,423
It used to be a fancy mansion, and it even
won a grand award for its architecture.

197
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,927
But it's turned into ruins.

198
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,554
It's like a haunted house.

199
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,308
But she can sell it.
Why hasn't she sold it all this time?

200
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,394
Hey, how can she sell it
when it's not sellable?

201
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,522
Her mother ended up like that
in that house,

202
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,773
and her father...

203
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,567
Even he ended up like this.

204
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,070
Who'd want to buy a house
where so many bad things happened?

205
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,698
"Like that" and "like this"?

206
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,578
What exactly happened to them?

207
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,331
Don't pry, or you'll get in trouble.

208
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,250
Okay.

209
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,672
By the way,
why did Ms. Ko go there out of the blue?

210
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,925
Right?

211
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,427
I wonder why.

212
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,845
What do you think?

213
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:26,725
It's because some idiot
did a background check on someone

214
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,561
and showed her that
without even telling me!

215
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,566
I did it because I figured it'd be better

216
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,819
than losing my life for not doing the job.

217
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,238
What did you say?

218
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,782
Gosh, you little...

219
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,493
Jeez, seriously. Unbelievable!

220
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,262
Also, he keeps saying things
that make no sense.

221
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,141
His symptoms are really awful, I must say.

222
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,954
I'm hungry.

223
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,843
Grilled pork belly. It looks delicious!

224
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,142
Hey, sweetie.

225
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,310
Open wide.

226
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,648
-Oh, my legs.
-My gosh!

227
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,108
-Take this.
-Here, I got it.

228
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,527
-Gosh, it's hot!
-It's hot. Be careful.

229
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,861
Nice, look at this stew.

230
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,324
This soybean paste stew looks so good!

231
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,956
I was told I'd live a comfortable life
starting at the age of 60.

232
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,541
It was totally right.

233
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:41,628
Three young men moved into this house
in the middle of nowhere,

234
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,172
and I can even collect rent
every month now.

235
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,758
I live with good people
who bring me money.

236
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,885
I got so lucky in my twilight years.

237
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,807
I'm renting a semi-basement room
that doesn't get much natural light.

238
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,686
It's not fair that I'm paying as much
as they're paying for their rooftop room.

239
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,522
You're renting the biggest room
in this house.

240
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,361
Hey, pass me your bowl.

241
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,488
Sure.

242
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,616
All right.

243
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,036
-Here, have some more.
-My gosh.

244
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,790
That's too much.

245
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,293
I have to take a fistful of pills,

246
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,420
so I need to save some room.

247
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,341
Eat up.

248
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,844
You eat like a bird.
That's why you're so skinny.

249
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,472
Don't force him to eat more.
He won't be able to digest the food.

250
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,432
Goodness.

251
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,769
Look at you.
Didn't you say you were on a diet?

252
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,152
Sang-tae.

253
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,155
Gang-tae has been picked.

254
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,032
What? Someone pinched you?
That must've hurt.

255
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,533
-Where? Your foot?
-No.

256
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,785
I'm saying
she wants him to be her son-in-law.

257
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,037
She's got her eyes on him.

258
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,414
What? The eyes? That's very dangerous.

259
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,832
Hey, eat up.

260
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,752
-Eat. Eat up.
-Eat up.

261
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,047
-Hey, don't.
-Don't do that!

262
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,506
No! A bug!

263
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,550
There's a bug!

264
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,603
It's cold.

265
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,825
Once upon a time
in a castle in the middle of a deep forest

266
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,080
lived a princess
who had been asleep for many years.

267
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,273
"A needle on a spinning wheel
will kill her."

268
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,150
That was the curse

269
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:13,530
the evil witch put on the princess
the day she was born.

270
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,909
Frightened, the King burned
every spinning wheel in his kingdom

271
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,953
to avoid the curse,

272
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,874
but the princess ended up getting pricked
by a thorn on the rose

273
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,335
given to her by the witch in disguise
and fell asleep.

274
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,313
This fairy tale tells you that

275
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,900
you can never escape your destiny.

276
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:53,987
Right.

277
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,656
The prince's kiss.

278
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,202
I suppose he could break the curse.

279
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,875
But don't get your hopes up too high.

280
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,464
Because

281
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,136
I will kill that prince.

282
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,937
Save me!

283
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,731
Please...

284
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,776
Save me.

285
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,239
Please...

286
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,366
Save me.

287
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,496
Save me!

288
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,092
When you can't control yourself,

289
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,345
cross your arms like this

290
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,931
and take turns
tapping on each shoulder like this.

291
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,554
Don't cry.

292
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,535
Oh, he's here.

293
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,874
Is he someone high up?

294
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,210
His father is an assemblyman
from this district.

295
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,713
Hey, Min-seok.

296
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,217
-Haeng-ja!
-My gosh.

297
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,221
From afar,
I thought you were Chow Yun Fat.

298
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,557
-How have you been?
-Well, you know. So-so.

299
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,892
Everything's been good
at the hospital, right?

300
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,602
Of course, thanks to you.

301
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,521
-All right, let's go.
-Wait, hang on.

302
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,274
Well, I'm here.

303
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,109
How come the director
is nowhere to be seen?

304
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,986
Oh, is it because of my sunglasses?

305
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,573
Oh, he's in the bathroom?

306
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,450
Yong! Where are you?

307
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,702
Cheo-yong!

308
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,453
Cheo-yong.

309
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,087
I need it to take a nap.
Without it, I'll have sleep paralysis.

310
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,425
All problems can be sorted out.

311
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,635
No, not this.

312
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,013
This one is huge.

313
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,890
There are many witnesses,

314
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,559
and the rumors are spreading so quickly.

315
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,687
Damn it! Why does this country
have to be an IT powerhouse?

316
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,273
Stop whining. You're making my head pound.

317
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,401
Hey, I bet you don't want to cry
as much as I do.

318
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,905
They're even saying you should be
disqualified as a candidate for the award.

319
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,365
And there's an injunction request
against your new book...

320
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,785
Forget it.

321
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,913
Mun-yeong.

322
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,750
Let's just gather some reporters
and cry our eyes out.

323
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,501
I mean, you're a great actress.

324
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,462
I've even written your lines.

325
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,672
"The stress from the creative process,
the new book,

326
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,091
my insomnia, and so on

327
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,636
led me to lose grip over my emotions
and make such a mistake--"

328
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,929
Use Ko Dae-hwan as an excuse.

329
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,349
Who? You mean, your father?

330
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,892
Write this down.

331
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,644
"Ko Mun-yeong disappears.

332
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,231
But turns out, she's been looking after
her father with dementia.

333
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,816
Will she retire from her career?"

334
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,403
End it with a question
so that it sounds like a possibility.

335
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,990
RETIRE

336
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,369
Yes.

337
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,414
The witch disappears
in the middle of a witch hunt.

338
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,750
That's it!

339
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,544
The public will want you back.

340
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,841
Mun-yeong, great minds think alike!

341
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,344
We're such a great team, don't you think?

342
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,097
Hello? Hey, hello?

343
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,476
Goodness, that heartless woman.

344
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,311
You want to use your father as an excuse?

345
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,356
She scares me.

346
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,242
HOW CAN WE HELP?

347
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,640
The show begins now.

348
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:46,941
IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY

349
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,827
There's a camera in this room.

350
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,787
I know.

351
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,833
The thought of someone looking at me
intently gets me so excited.

352
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,795
You can put your stuff here.

353
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,256
Why don't you get changed first?

354
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,966
You look very cold now.

355
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,094
No, I'm not cold at all.
You're totally mistaken.

356
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,514
What? Manic syndrome?

357
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,476
He comes here every spring
due to his acute manic episodes,

358
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,977
so make sure he doesn't escape.

359
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,230
Whenever it rains, he sneaks out
and wanders in the mountains.

360
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,607
He's fast, so he's hard to catch.

361
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,735
Gosh, an assemblyman's son
suffers from manic episodes?

362
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,321
Does the President never catch a cold?

363
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,531
Why does his dad's vocation matter?

364
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,825
It's not like his condition
is something he has to hide.

365
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,537
You should not deal with patients
with such biased--

366
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,332
Okay, I heard you.
I will remember that, ma'am.

367
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,917
What? Ma'am?

368
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,419
Hey, I'm not done. Get back here.

369
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,630
Hey, that brat... My gosh, look at him.

370
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,548
Cha-yong.

371
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,760
Hey, that punk...
He must have lost his mind, right?

372
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:59,889
I'm thinking he might have
oppositional defiant disorder.

373
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,891
Yes.

374
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,935
Well, you're right.

375
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,521
He needs help. I shouldn't be mad at him.

376
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,273
Don't get mad at him, Haeng-ja.

377
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,442
Hey, Cha-yong!

378
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,364
Have you heard of the place called
Morning Sun?

379
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,326
It's a club where you can party
until the sun comes up. Hence the name.

380
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,703
You know, I heard it's the hottest club
at the moment,

381
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,081
so I went there.

382
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,878
The pretty girls and the good music

383
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,799
totally lifted my spirits,
so I did something nice.

384
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,468
All right!

385
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,848
Everything's on me, all night!

386
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,933
-Drink all you want!
-Nice!

387
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,651
I love spending money on others.

388
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,572
I should become a philanthropist
if I have nothing else to do later on.

389
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,659
Anyway, I think the bill came
to about 20 million won that night.

390
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:02,702
But...

391
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,748
This credit card
has been reported missing.

392
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,548
My dad totally blindsided me.

393
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,509
I had no choice

394
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,595
but to run like fuck.

395
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,782
I just ran into the road
because I had to lose them.

396
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,619
Then I got freaking hot
because I had been running for a while.

397
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,997
And that's why I took off all my clothes!

398
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,182
And I ended up here again.

399
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,810
How fast can you run 100m?

400
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,312
Me? I'm so freaking fast.

401
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,107
See that? About seven seconds, I think.
What about you?

402
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,651
Me? Six seconds.

403
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,321
What? Do you have four legs?
Are you a cheetah or something?

404
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,823
We can have a race if you'd like.

405
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,827
I like you.

406
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,538
Shall we go to the counseling room?

407
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,123
Let's go.

408
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,416
COUNSELING ROOM

409
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,253
My gosh. From the back,
I can tell that you work out.

410
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,630
What do you do? I can tell you're ripped.

411
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,048
-Min-seok!
-Welcome.

412
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,425
Gosh, Min-seok.

413
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,885
You know you have to be here by 3 p.m.

414
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,555
Call me when you get here.

415
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,392
What are you up to now?
Are you doodling on your book again?

416
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,730
No, on the dough.

417
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,358
Jae-su is actually very rich. Who knew?

418
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,609
What?

419
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,695
-Hello.
-Come on in.

420
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,531
Hey, customers. We have customers.

421
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,326
Is it Gang-tae? Hang up.

422
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,577
What was that sound just now?

423
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,120
Hang up. Just hang up!

424
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,040
-Hey, where are you?
-He wants me to hang up.

425
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,422
Gang-tae!

426
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,467
We have to move the patients
to the therapy room.

427
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,509
All right.

428
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,181
By the way, is that really true?

429
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,392
We saw on the sign that a free caricature
comes with a full-size pizza.

430
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,186
Of course.

431
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,313
Just for a month,
to celebrate our grand opening.

432
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:21,692
Mr. Picasso over there will draw you one
in just ten minutes.

433
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,779
Just a moment, please.

434
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,366
What do I do?

435
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,700
-Sang-tae, they want one.
-Gosh.

436
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,912
If Gang-tae finds out,
we'll get kicked out.

437
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,081
I didn't even go to school
and lied to him.

438
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,917
Gosh, he'll kick me out. No doubt!

439
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,877
Hey, we've already agreed to this.

440
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,504
I'll pay you 10,000 won per caricature.

441
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,798
-You said you needed money.
-Yes, I do need money.

442
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,549
Yes, you can use your skills
and earn money.

443
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,301
The free caricatures
will attract customers.

444
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,928
What's the problem?

445
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,892
Sang-tae, we're doing a good deed.
Consider it a donation.

446
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,689
You're donating your skills.

447
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,151
That is a good deed.

448
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,195
Hello.

449
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,659
THERAPY ROOM

450
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,926
I'm Ko Mun-yeong. I'll be teaching
this literature class from now on.

451
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,767
She's beautiful.

452
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,023
FAIRY...

453
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,699
What is a fairy tale?

454
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,453
The story of me marrying IU.

455
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,455
Stop drinking, will you?

456
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,040
-He's drunk again.
-He's alcohol-dependent, Ms. Ko.

457
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,293
Jeong-tae, you and your drunk talk.

458
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,670
-I'm not drunk.
-I call that bullshit.

459
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,090
Attention, everyone.

460
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:11,677
A fairy tale is a cruel fantasy
that illustrates

461
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,098
the brutality and violence of this world
in a paradoxical manner.

462
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,059
What?

463
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,479
-A fantasy?
-What did she say?

464
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,980
Shall I give you an example?

465
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,857
What does Heungbu and Nolbu teach us?

466
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,277
If you're a good person,
you'll win the lottery.

467
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,447
-True that.
-Wrong.

468
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,825
Heungbu was poor
because he wasn't the eldest son.

469
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,785
It criticizes the primogeniture customs

470
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,871
that allowed the eldest sons
to inherit everything.

471
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,123
-Is that so?
-Gosh.

472
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,458
What about The Ugly Duckling?

473
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,337
Don't discriminate against ugly kids.

474
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,798
Wrong. The lesson is, "Raising
someone else's child is unrewarding,

475
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,217
so just look after your own."

476
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,719
-Oh, right.
-Excuse me, Ms. Ko?

477
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,137
What about The Little Mermaid?

478
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:59,141
I know. When you're in love,
you must love that person faithfully

479
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,269
even if that means you'll dissolve
into sea foam.

480
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,480
-My gosh!
-Oh, my!

481
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,815
-My goodness.
-She loved her husband so faithfully

482
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,276
that she let him beat her up to a pulp.

483
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,862
-Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

484
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,489
That I didn't know.

485
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:17,952
It wasn't his fault. Alcohol is to blame.

486
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,706
Alcohol is always the problem.

487
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,419
Get out if you want to cry.

488
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,179
All right. The lesson we can take
from The Little Mermaid

489
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,225
is that karma will bite you hard

490
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,977
if you covet an engaged man.

491
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,273
Then what about King Donkey Ears?

492
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,192
Talk behind people's backs
to relieve your stress.

493
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,405
-I see.
-Maybe I should do that.

494
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,156
I guess it kind of makes sense.

495
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,496
So let me sum up today's class for you.

496
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:06,000
A fairy tale isn't a hallucinogen
that gives us hopes and dreams.

497
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,627
It's a stimulant
that makes us face reality.

498
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:12,756
So I hope you all read
a lot of fairy tales

499
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,051
and wake up from your dreams.

500
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,555
Ms. Ko.

501
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,599
Don't look up at the stars
in the beautiful night sky.

502
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,642
Look down at your feet
that are stuck in a filthy sewer.

503
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:27,980
The moment you realize that
and accept your reality...

504
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,117
Let's be happy.

505
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,828
Let's all live happy lives.

506
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:50,711
Who's here?

507
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,131
I guess you didn't know
because you weren't at the weekly meeting.

508
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,759
The director asked Ms. Ko
to teach literature to our patients

509
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,345
in return for letting her dad
go for a walk every time she visits.

510
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,097
What? "A walk"?

511
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,517
I have to say,
the director really is something.

512
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,104
He said Ms. Ko must have something here
that she wants.

513
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,440
I guess he was right.

514
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,872
How was my first class?

515
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,249
How was it?

516
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,504
Do you really believe that?

517
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,172
What?

518
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,093
That we'll be fine once we accept reality.

519
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,010
Yes.

520
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,138
"This is who I am,
and you are who you are."

521
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,390
We just need to accept that.

522
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,976
So what if we're okay with it

523
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,771
when the entire world
doesn't think that way?

524
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,773
They all refuse to accept...

525
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,028
Sorry. It was so boring
that I almost fell asleep.

526
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,198
Get out so I can turn off the lights.

527
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,670
-Just accept it.
-Accept what?

528
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,921
That you're not satisfied.

529
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,514
See? I can see your eyes
burning with desire.

530
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,311
That's why I like you.
You're arrogant but shallow.

531
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,358
I noticed you're always
smiling to the patients.

532
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,236
But why are you so cold to me?
You were really passionate that night.

533
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,950
What are you talking about?

534
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,619
I dreamt of you a few days ago.

535
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,932
You sat me down on my bed
and did this to me.

536
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,029
Yes, I'm horny. I admit that.

537
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,198
Lower your voice.

538
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,747
Do you want to sleep with me?

539
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,752
What?

540
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,338
She's amazing.

541
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,218
Unbelievable.

542
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,011
UNDER RENOVATION
DO NOT ENTER

543
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,600
I told you to stop.

544
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,477
I'm sick of your jokes.

545
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,104
I have no time to play with you.

546
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,525
That means if you had the time,
you'd play along.

547
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,402
Don't jump to conclusions.

548
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,404
Why live a boring life?

549
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,659
You'll get sick
if you suppress yourself like that.

550
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,537
If you want to have fun, then have fun.
I know you want some fun.

551
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,999
What do you know about me?

552
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,085
Who are you to act up like this?

553
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,548
Hypocrite.

554
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,146
Why are you so startled?

555
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,315
It's not like I called you a murderer.

556
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,237
What's that look on your face?

557
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,531
Someone might think it's true.

558
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,286
People are all hypocrites.
We all live with a lot of hatred,

559
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,246
but we act like that's not the case.

560
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,628
After all, who isn't flawless?

561
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,238
Can you be nicer to A-reum?

562
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,573
What did I do?

563
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:34,661
Her depression
has gotten worse these days.

564
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,331
Then give her drugs.
There's nothing I can do.

565
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,095
It'll just be a moment.
It'll end even before you know it.

566
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,445
Mr. Ko!

567
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,572
Mr. Ko, what's wrong?

568
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,619
Ms. Ko?

569
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,246
Hey! Let me go!

570
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:22,209
I'm totally fine! I'm not crazy!

571
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,919
Sang-tae.

572
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:25,962
Sang-tae.

573
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,050
Gang-tae. Gang-tae won't answer his phone.

574
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,428
I... I pressed number three for emergency.
Number three.

575
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,763
Number three. Nam Ju-ri.

576
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,265
-You did great. Wait here for a moment.
-Okay.

577
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,313
Can you check
Mr. Joo Jeong-tae's test results?

578
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,606
Okay.

579
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,237
Sang-tae.

580
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,281
Sang-tae.

581
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,462
It's Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

582
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,674
Where did she go?

583
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,427
Did you see Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

584
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,731
-Sang-tae.
-Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

585
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,899
What are you doing here?
Ju-ri is looking for you.

586
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,236
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong was here.
I saw Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

587
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,655
Where did she go? Did you see her?

588
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,532
I bet you were mistaken.
Why would that woman be here?

589
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,242
Not "that woman." Writer Ko Mun-yeong.

590
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,620
Yes, why would Ms. Ko be here?
I'm sure you were mistaken.

591
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,831
-Let's go. You were mistaken.
-Okay.

592
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:45,667
-You're late.
-I'm sure I saw her here.

593
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:48,253
Sang-tae, once we get there,

594
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,631
-be polite to the director.
-Okay.

595
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,134
Ms. Ko.

596
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,303
Ms. Ko.

597
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,890
You can't leave already.

598
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,641
You need to take
your father out for a walk.

599
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,060
-Why would I do that?
-What?

600
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:07,397
I heard that's why you decided
to teach here.

601
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,858
The director told me you made a promise.

602
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,986
That's not true. I don't make promises.

603
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:18,909
What the...

604
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,377
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

605
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,663
Stegosaurus.

606
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,875
It has a huge body,

607
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,961
but it has a tiny brain.

608
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,088
It's the dumbest dinosaur
among all dinosaurs.

609
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,675
But it's also very innocent.

610
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,720
What's that guy's name?

611
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,140
Ko Gil-dong. His name is Ko Gil-dong.

612
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,863
Mr. Moon.

613
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,827
This is... This is my favorite book.
This one is my favorite, too.

614
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,122
This is my favorite jelly. The green ones
taste like apple. I love them.

615
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,040
My hat. I wear it when I draw.

616
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,376
I'm not an artist,
but I wear that when I draw.

617
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:55,005
He gave this to me as a gift.
He seems to like me.

618
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,009
I love them.

619
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,264
Your brother is really good at drawing.

620
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,225
He's too talented
to just keep it as a hobby.

621
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,727
I can even draw your face.

622
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,605
It's 10,000 won per drawing.
You don't need to order pizza.

623
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,571
By any chance, did he mention
anything about butterflies?

624
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,364
"Butterflies"?

625
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,325
No.

626
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,745
Today's his first day.
I'm sure he'll tell me one day.

627
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,961
-Sang-tae.
-Yes?

628
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,298
Isn't the outside view beautiful?

629
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,508
It's the best thing about our hospital.

630
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:45,472
But you see, I'd like to move that view
to somewhere else.

631
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,724
-Will you help me do that, Sang-tae?
-Yes.

632
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,816
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

633
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,277
Move it to where?

634
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,114
I want to move it here.

635
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,659
Sang-tae,

636
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,536
I bet you're talented enough to draw

637
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,706
the exact picturesque view
from my office window.

638
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,126
Can you do it?

639
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,295
But sir--

640
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:20,215
This is my prescription for him.

641
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,509
How much

642
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,637
are you going to pay?

643
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,014
How much... How much money will you pay?

644
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,684
-How much will I get paid?
-What?

645
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,269
-Sang-tae--
-I'll do it if you pay me a lot.

646
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,021
How much are you going to pay me?

647
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,777
That depends on your drawing.

648
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,615
Sang-tae.

649
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,118
How much will I get paid?

650
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,877
Let's see.

651
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,348
Sang-tae, you're rich.

652
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,810
Let me see. How much did you save up?

653
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:17,939
No, no. I won't...
I won't show this to anyone

654
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,607
until I reach my goal.

655
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,111
But I'm your brother.

656
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,947
To an autistic person,
family members are like close strangers.

657
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,532
A close stranger.

658
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,830
So how much do you plan to save up?

659
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,416
I need 32,890,000 won.

660
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,544
-What are you going to buy with that?
-I will buy a car.

661
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,504
-A car?
-A car.

662
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,673
Why all of a sudden?

663
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,009
A car.

664
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,764
-Is that also a secret?
-A car.

665
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,810
Okay, I won't ask.

666
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:15,080
WALK-THROUGH VAN CAMPING CAR
32,890,000 WON, WE'RE HAVING A HUGE SALE

667
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:18,833
"It will give you good memories
and a romantic lifestyle.

668
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,169
Wherever you go,
it will always feel comfortable like home.

669
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:26,966
It costs 32,890,000 won. We're having
a huge sale." A... A huge sale.

670
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,218
It's really cheap.

671
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,221
Why do you want this?

672
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,682
If we buy that,
we won't have to move every year.

673
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,976
We can run away
even if the butterfly chases us.

674
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:40,063
We don't need to pack up
and move somewhere else.

675
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,983
Then... Then the landlord
won't get angry at my brother.

676
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,944
We can go anywhere.

677
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,783
Sang-tae.

678
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:56,496
I still need 32,270,000 won more.

679
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,707
Sang-tae.

680
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,629
I don't need a house, car, or money.

681
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,590
All I need is you.

682
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,591
Hypocrite.

683
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,928
I mean it.

684
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,847
You're my everything.

685
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,476
It's really hard to make money, you know.

686
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,151
I need 32,890,000 won.

687
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,987
I need three thousand and...

688
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:36,619
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

689
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,538
I will get rid of OK Psychiatric Hospital

690
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,332
-and the juvenile hall that has been
-All the politicians

691
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,252
-making our residents feel unsafe.
-try so hard to get rid of our hospital

692
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:46,254
every time they get ready for an election.

693
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:49,174
But still, his own son gets treated here.

694
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,508
How could he do that as his dad?

695
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,636
He cares more about his job
than his own son.

696
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:05,940
Seagull 777.

697
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,650
-I repeat. Seagull 777.
-Stop!

698
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,360
Get away from me!

699
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:12,030
-Back off! Go away!
-No, stop!

700
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,366
Sorry! Just a moment!

701
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,869
-Mr. Kwon, stop!
-Oh, gosh!

702
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,012
Oh, my goodness.

703
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,559
I can hear your heart beating.

704
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,437
See you.

705
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,441
Mr. Kwon.

706
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,237
Hey!

707
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,244
I told them they're not allowed
to run inside the hospital.

708
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,500
MIGHWAY, ENGLAND,
16,500,000 WON

709
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,545
DETAILED INFORMATION
PRICE: 16,500,000 WON

710
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,300
Are you planning to go camping?

711
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,386
No, I'm just looking.

712
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,765
One of my friends
rents out camping cars for a living.

713
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,685
We should rent one
and go on a trip together.

714
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,902
Let's go when we get the same off day.

715
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,574
Then I'll check next month's schedule
and...

716
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:39,826
Hey.

717
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,452
What? He escaped?

718
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:43,997
When?

719
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,165
Next.

720
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,669
He started free voiding
and wet himself during consultation.

721
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,087
So I went to get a new gown and...

722
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,965
-Where did he go?
-Well...

723
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,050
Hey, wait.

724
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,011
Isn't that Ms. Ko Mun-yeong's car?

725
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,597
-Yes, I think so.
-I think you're right.

726
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:31,794
Is this what people would call
a "teeny-weeny weenie"?

727
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:33,963
Because it's tiny?

728
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:41,512
It's... It's cold. That's why it's...

729
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,100
He must be on his way to work.

730
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,644
Great timing. Get in.

731
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,437
What?

732
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,356
-Get in.
-Okay.

733
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:03,117
I'm not intimidated or anything,
but let me wear my underwear.

734
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,577
You carry around your underwear?

735
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,537
No, don't think of this as my underwear.

736
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,540
It's the only thing
that prevents me from losing my mind.

737
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,919
Ko Mun-yeong kidnapped him.

738
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,015
Drive faster! Go!

739
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:39,445
Ju-ri, stop the car.

740
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,623
Ko Mun-yeong!

741
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,292
-Stop the car!
-Gang-tae, move! It's dangerous!

742
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,503
There he is.

743
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,589
It's that handsome guy!

744
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,217
Is he here for me? My gosh!

745
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,010
-Gang-tae!
-Don't come!

746
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,222
-Stay right there.
-Hey, wait...

747
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:10,435
There's... There's someone there.

748
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,272
Hey, stop.

749
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,781
Wait!

750
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:49,265
Do you still like me?

751
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,443
-Coward.
-"Hope I never see you again."

752
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,237
Please. Let's not meet again.

753
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,740
You're different from patients.

754
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,284
It's just best to avoid people like you.

755
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:26,093
It's a urinating disorder. It's common
among people who suffer from manic--

756
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,220
Shut your mouth.

757
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,016
That crazy bitch.

758
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:33,810
Get out of the car.

759
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,356
You're not running away.

760
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,776
You're not avoiding me either.
I'm impressed.

761
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,279
-Get out of the car.
-He wants you out of the car.

762
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:48,115
No! I don't want to go!
I want to go and have fun!

763
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,493
Just get in the car.
Let's go have fun together.

764
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,495
Get out of the car right now!

765
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,417
Why are you always

766
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,836
so angry at me?

767
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,379
Because...

768
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:04,799
you make me get angry.

769
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,635
Why not just ignore me?

770
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,053
But you know what?

771
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,848
You should always be careful

772
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,350
not to be off guard.

773
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,731
Let me borrow your car!

774
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,489
Be careful!

775
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,220
He keeps following us!

776
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,519
Drive faster! He's getting near us!

777
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,066
Hey! Hey, dude!

778
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,030
Pull over!

779
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:10,781
Pull over right now!

780
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:12,575
I don't want to.

781
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,672
-Vote for number one, Kwon Man-su!
-Vote for number one, Kwon Man-su!

782
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,801
-Vote for Kwon Man-su!
-Vote for Kwon Man-su!

783
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:33,554
Hello!

784
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,514
-Vote for Kwon Man-su!
-Vote for Kwon Man-su!

785
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:40,561
Listen up, residents of Seongjin City!

786
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:43,064
Don't vote for candidate number one,
Kwon Man-su!

787
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,400
He's a complete hypocrite,
and he discriminates people!

788
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,904
I know him best
because I'm his youngest son!

789
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,282
Don't vote for him!

790
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,660
Don't vote for him!
Don't vote for Kwon Man-su!

791
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:59,038
Number 7040. 7040. Stop the car.

792
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,999
Number 7040. Pull over.

793
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:07,463
Stop the car right now! Number 7040!

794
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,928
Stop the car!

795
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:17,848
Number 7040. Pull over.

796
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,068
Get out of the way! Move!

797
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,872
Oh my gosh!

798
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,713
That's a lot of chili peppers.

799
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,220
Oh, my goodness!

800
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,317
-Watch out for the bang!
-Watch out for the bang!

801
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,751
KWON MAN-SU'S ELECTION CAMPAIGN

802
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:27,877
My goodness, thank you.

803
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,421
-Is everyone doing well?
-Yes, it's all thanks to you.

804
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:31,756
My goodness.

805
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,467
His favorite food is mung-bean pancakes.

806
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,760
Here.

807
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:37,344
My goodness, you're so kind.

808
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,190
Hey, Teeny-weeny.

809
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,485
Let's have fun here.

810
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,952
-I'm Kwon Man-su.
-Thank you.

811
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,454
-Here.
-Thank you.

812
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:04,538
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

813
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,416
-Please vote for number one.
-Of course.

814
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,168
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

815
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,586
-Thank you in advance.
-Thank you.

816
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:11,754
-No problem.
-Thank you.

817
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:12,963
-Enjoy.
-Goodbye.

818
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,715
Hello, everyone!

819
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,343
I'm Kwon Man-su's youngest son!

820
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,761
My name is Kwon Gi-do!

821
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,596
What... What the hell is he doing there?

822
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,431
As you can see, I'm mentally ill!

823
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:23,974
What is that punk doing there?

824
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:28,062
Yes, that's right.
I'm the ugly duckling of the family.

825
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,357
-Sir.
-My goodness.

826
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,442
-My goodness.
-I'm the embarrassment of our family!

827
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,862
Hello?

828
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,697
I'm calling from the park
in Seongjin City.

829
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,667
You see, everyone in my family

830
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,671
including my parents, siblings,
and my cousins

831
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:56,841
went to Seoul National University
School of Law.

832
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:00,678
I was the only stupid one in my family.

833
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,016
But that's not my fault.

834
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,103
I was...

835
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,607
I was just born a little dumb.

836
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,781
But he hit me
because I didn't get good grades.

837
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,952
He looked down on me
because I couldn't understand properly.

838
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,037
He locked me up for causing trouble.

839
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,299
I mean, I'm also his child.

840
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,345
But he treated me like I was invisible.

841
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,638
I just...

842
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:53,647
I just wanted his attention, you see.

843
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,361
I just wanted him to look at me.

844
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,073
So I did tons of crazy stuff
to get his attention.

845
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:09,079
I just ended up going crazy!

846
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:32,811
Look at me, look at me

847
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:36,148
Look at me

848
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:39,652
Take a look at number one
Kwon Man-su's son

849
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:42,321
Kwon Gi-do

850
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,041
He's having so much fun.

851
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:41,839
Don't you agree?

852
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,176
Should I just

853
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:49,513
have fun with you?

854
01:11:58,522 --> 01:11:59,565
Should I do that?

855
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:13,203
Look at me

856
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,332
Look at me

857
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:19,752
Take a look at number one
Kwon Man-su's son

858
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:06,673
Have you heard of the place called
Morning Sun?

859
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:10,969
It's a club where you can party
until the sun comes up. Hence the name.

860
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,597
You know, I heard it's the hottest club
at the moment,

861
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,557
so I went there.

862
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,351
DO NOT DISTURB

863
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,233
The pretty girls and the good music

864
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:26,443
totally lifted my spirits,

865
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,570
so I thought I should do something nice.

866
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,531
Everything's on me, all night!

867
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:32,991
-Eat up! Drink all you want!
-Nice!

868
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:37,413
You're the best!

869
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:41,333
I love spending money on others.

870
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,586
Anyway, I think the bill came
to about 20 million won that night.

871
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,509
This credit card
has been reported missing.

872
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:51,927
What?

873
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,263
My dad totally blindsided me.

874
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:57,391
I had no choice but to run like fuck.

875
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,644
You're too kind.

876
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:03,522
Don't take your eyes off him.

877
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,734
I just ran into the road
because I had to lose them.

878
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,404
Then I got freaking hot
because I had been running for a while.

879
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:13,115
And that's why I took off all my clothes!

880
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,093
And I ended up

881
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,266
here again.

882
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,051
Does a child

883
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:17,387
-need to be of any use to a parent?
-Why did you do that?

884
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:18,931
-You little...
-Why did you do that?

885
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,184
I can see that

886
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:24,353
you want to be loved.

887
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,689
Girls like funny guys.

888
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:32,528
I warned you to stay away from my brother.

889
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,279
Are you still mad at me?

890
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:35,781
Don't be delusional.

891
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,492
Until the day you die...

892
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:40,452
Until the day you die...

893
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,538
You won't understand me.

894
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:51,380
