1
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,041
Pretty lucky we ran into each other.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,208
Yeah, but in a weird way.

3
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,541
I'm sorry I was so startled…

4
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,583
but your hoodie is very frightening.

5
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:27,666
It's a regular hoodie.

6
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,916
No, it's like a crime hoodie.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,750
Very scary. Check this out.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Very dangerous man.

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,666
Trust me, it's much better without.

10
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:46,541
Yeah.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,958
So what have you been doing this evening?

12
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,291
I've just had some dinner.

13
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,208
Okay.

14
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:00,541
Yeah…

15
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,083
Maybe we could drink
a cup of coffee before you leave?

16
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,041
Sure.

17
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,583
-I'll check my calendar.
-Great.

18
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,500
I'm leaving next week.

19
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:20,083
-In a week?
-Yeah, the plan is Thursday.

20
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,541
Sure, a cup of coffee with Mathias
and then what?

21
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,083
Apologize for being weird the last time?

22
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,375
"Hey, it was just a joke,
the thing about having kids."

23
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,583
"By the way,
I kind of stole some of your sperm."

24
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,916
"And now I'm pregnant. Surprise!"

25
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,833
Then I'd be fired and the clinic
would lose its good reputation.

26
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,458
And Mathias won't want anything
to do with me.

27
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,500
Terrible plan.

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,625
Fuck!

29
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:17,166
I don't know if I'll have time to enter
all the journals until next week.

30
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,708
I may have broken my windshield wipers

31
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,958
when I drove into three retirees.

32
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:28,208
-The delay will be fine, I'm sure.
-Hello! Are you even listening?

33
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,500
No. I'm sorry.

34
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,583
Tell me about your date with Søren,
you look like you're about to puke.

35
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,125
No, it was fine.

36
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,291
-Okay.
-It was super fine. We ate cherries.

37
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,208
But?

38
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,833
-I met Mathias on my way home.
-Mathias?

39
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,291
-Hi.
-Hi. I thought he left?

40
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,500
Apparently not. He leaves in a week.

41
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,250
I hope I get to talk to him
before he leaves.

42
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,416
Maybe find someone
who isn't moving to Guatemala?

43
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,958
So try looking in this country.

44
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,708
Helle, as you said,

45
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,791
we can never talk enough about safety.

46
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:18,333
I can share with you that the sperm bank
now has a fingerprint scanner.

47
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,208
For the hands. Yes.

48
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:24,166
For the fingers,
but that's basically the same.

49
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,750
I would recommend you use the fingers.

50
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you.

51
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:35,041
-Is now a good time?
-What a perfect timing!

52
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,666
Surprise!

53
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,916
We've been talking about hiring Søren
more permanently,

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,833
and…

55
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,750
after tough negotiations…

56
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,208
No, sorry. He said yes.

57
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:57,875
In case anyone here doesn't know
your work,

58
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,625
please tell us about it, Søren.

59
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:05,625
I live in Valby, and I spend
most of my spare time on

60
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,041
training for the triathlon this spring.

61
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,458
Sure, Søren actually lives in Denmark,
Simone is right about that.

62
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,208
Which would make things much easier.

63
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,875
…and I'm about to become a dad.

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,583
You what?

65
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,666
To a very cute Border Collie.

66
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,875
I'm on the waiting list.

67
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,458
Oh, you scared me.

68
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,958
My mind went straight to paternity leave.

69
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:30,916
Not at all.

70
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,875
But he calls himself Dad to a dog.

71
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,333
Yes?

72
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,416
-Hey. Am I disturbing you?
-No, of course not. Come in.

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,541
-Thank you for last night. It was nice.
-It was nice.

74
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:53,958
And I'm sorry I didn't mention
that I'll be here full-time now.

75
00:04:55,125 --> 00:05:00,333
-I wasn't sure until this morning--
-I think it's nice you'll be around.

76
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,875
I'm glad you think so.

77
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,958
If you're up for it,

78
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,291
I'll be happy to
make you a home-cooked meal.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,083
I'll check my calendar.

80
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,125
We'll figure something out.

81
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,625
Great.

82
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:28,333
Can't we just say I started a new round
of treatments before I turned 44?

83
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,583
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,166
But there is also Scandinavian Fertility
in Aarhus, and their age limit is--

85
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,625
-Forty-six. I already talked to them.
-Yes.

86
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,166
The wait there is almost a year.

87
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:46,916
-Yes.
-So…

88
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,416
Our internal age limit is…

89
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,291
yes, very strict.

90
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,291
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,958
It's okay…

92
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:17,541
It's unfair that it comes so easy
to some, but is so hard for me.

93
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,458
Yeah.

94
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,666
It was so encouraging
to hear about your twins.

95
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,333
Yeah.

96
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,875
We just got lucky.

97
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,583
I wish I was that lucky.

98
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,333
-May I have Anette's file?
-Of course.

99
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,750
How did she react?

100
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,000
I feel so sorry for her.

101
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,083
I doubt I said anything helpful.

102
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:08,250
Back in the day it just happened.

103
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,708
Always totally inconvenient.

104
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,875
A long stare at the stable boy
from the neighboring farm.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,708
At the village dance.

106
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:20,791
Both my grandmothers had to get
married because they were pregnant.

107
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:26,166
When the children were born seven months
later, they said they were preemies.

108
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,625
-Clever, right?
-Yes.

109
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,500
Clever.

110
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,458
Will you make a copy
and leave it on my desk?

111
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,291
Okay.

112
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,333
I inseminated myself…

113
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,500
three weeks ago.

114
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,541
Here.

115
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:03,458
Today is the 14th. Awesome.

116
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,083
So we have to have sex
before he leaves in…

117
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,250
seven days.

118
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:14,416
In eight months
I'll just say the baby was premature.

119
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:20,708
Mathias will think he became a dad in
a normal, non-stealing sperm kind of way.

120
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,666
Hi, this is Mathias.

121
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,083
Hi, it's me. I was thinking about that
cup of coffee. Do you have time today?

122
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,166
I'm in the middle of helping my dad
with a carport.

123
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,166
-A carport?
-Yeah. Long story.

124
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,916
Come on, don't be so boring.

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,708
Okay, thanks. Nice of you to say.

126
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,583
Come on, I have the perfect plan.

127
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,541
It's nice to get
out of the city for a while.

128
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,000
It is tough to live with your parents?

129
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,250
No, but it's nice with some peace.

130
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,250
Look at that one.

131
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,083
It has a human mouth.

132
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,708
What's it saying?

133
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,541
"Help me."

134
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,875
You found that funny, huh?

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,916
It was funny. You've still got it.

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,916
Well…

137
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,916
I felt like I needed to…

138
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,125
apologize for that thing the other day.

139
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:04,208
It's not. Let me start again…

140
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,541
-The thing with kids?
-Right.

141
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,916
I mean, it's not something
I think about. At all, actually.

142
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,833
Okay.

143
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,625
-Only when you're out with your ex.
-Yes.

144
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,875
It was unfortunate.

145
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,333
I have no idea what came over me.

146
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,458
Really, I'm just…

147
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,375
Okay.

148
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,458
-So you don't want kids?
-No. Or yes…

149
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,500
Or, I don't know. Not right now anyway.

150
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,166
I have plenty of time for that.

151
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,416
But I've been thinking.

152
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,875
About us.

153
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,500
Yeah, me too.

154
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,125
About those days.

155
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:56,125
I have a thousand questions that I have
been mulling over for too long.

156
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,625
I understand.

157
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,375
I was very upset.

158
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,083
Very.

159
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,500
-What was that?
-I'm sorry.

160
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,916
I'm sorry, I don't know. I just…

161
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,375
I was stupid.

162
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,000
I was so stupid back then. or…

163
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,666
Let me cook you a meal before you leave.

164
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,500
That's a really bad idea.

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,833
Okay.

166
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,250
You know, you and cooking. Bad idea.

167
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:58,916
When did you start doing that?

168
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:00,750
Hey!

169
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,208
I'm a great cook.

170
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,291
-I've become good.
-Okay, I have to see that.

171
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,208
Just wait and see.

172
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,333
-It'll be epic.
-It'd better be.

173
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,208
IUI - M.DAHL - 3871 - 1

174
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,333
Try to relax.

175
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,291
Good job.

176
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,000
Loosen up your pelvis.

177
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,083
Yeah.

178
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,458
Take a deep breath…

179
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,833
You're doing well, Christina.

180
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,791
And…

181
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,375
the egg is in place.

182
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,333
Now.

183
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,041
Good job.

184
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,041
Gosh.

185
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,500
I'll just get rid of this.

186
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,833
Gosh.

187
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,083
I have to go now. Are you okay?

188
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,625
Didn't you have to leave at 1 p.m.?

189
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,166
The presentation is at 1 p.m.

190
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,166
I see.

191
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,250
Okay. Fine. Go on then.

192
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,375
-Okay, see you later.
-Bye.

193
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,625
Thanks.

194
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,500
-Let's fill this out then.
-Yes.

195
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,583
It's strange.

196
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:15,250
Even though this is my fifth IVF…

197
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,083
I still need--

198
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,666
You need someone to cheer you on.

199
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,958
Yes. Very much.

200
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,625
Maybe we've reached a point

201
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,916
where we take more than we give.

202
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,791
How about you?

203
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,291
Is your balance to the positive side?

204
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,583
Yes.

205
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,333
Or…

206
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,833
I'm working on it.

207
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:00,166
-Nice roll!
-I'm thinking Greek.

208
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,291
Because we once took this trip to Greece.

209
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,583
We never left the room.

210
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,666
-Exciting.
-Want to hear more?

211
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,875
-Not really.
-We had so much sex!

212
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:18,500
It takes more than feta and sex
to make him stay.

213
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,500
-Think so?
-Yep.

214
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,583
If it were up to me, there's no doubt.

215
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:29,500
Søren is sweet and smart
and crazy about you.

216
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,458
I know.

217
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,875
Mathias lives 10,000 km away.

218
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,375
It's not like I'm going to marry him.
It's just dinner.

219
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,291
Very low-key.

220
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,833
Weren't you meeting up with Søren
this week?

221
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,416
But he's not Mathias.

222
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,333
You're not canceling with Søren!

223
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,458
-No.
-Promise me!

224
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,666
No, no. I won't.

225
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,083
-Good.
-Yes. Good.

226
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,666
-Of course, I won't.
-Right.

227
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,083
-No!
-No?

228
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,083
Have a nice day.

229
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,916
Good morning.

230
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,708
-Hey. Good morning.
-And welcome.

231
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:21,875
-Has everyone been welcoming?
-Yes, everyone's really nice.

232
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,208
-You know your way around.
-Exactly.

233
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,416
-It feels like--
-Like being home?

234
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,875
Anyway, I think I'll go get some coffee.

235
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,708
-Or maybe some juice, it looks good.
-Yeah.

236
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah.

237
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:39,958
Come on!

238
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,166
-You'd better go get your coffee.
-I will.

239
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,333
Come on!

240
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,375
-Have a nice day.
-You too!

241
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,500
-Oh, hi. Coffee.
-Hi.

242
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,083
Yeah.

243
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm busy, I have a client.
The juice tastes like pee. Bye.

244
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,625
Okay.

245
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:08,750
So, I know it's been a long road
coming up with a decision like this.

246
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,291
-So, congratulations.
-Thank you.

247
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,000
I see you have it all planned out?

248
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,416
Jason and I always knew
we wanted children.

249
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,708
So meeting Mia…

250
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,708
It was a very special day.

251
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,125
A very special day, yes.

252
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,083
Lovely.

253
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,125
We can't wait to experience it together.
Especially the delivery.

254
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,208
I see.

255
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,708
Delivering the baby…

256
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,625
is something I do alone, right?

257
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,166
What do you mean?

258
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,625
We talked about this.

259
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,708
-You come in when it's all--
-No, we never agreed to that.

260
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:47,041
We agreed it would be the three of us.

261
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,666
Anything else you haven't told us?

262
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,208
-"Anything else"?
-Perhaps you should do this in private.

263
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,250
Yeah, good idea.

264
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,166
Honey?

265
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,416
-I'll check on him.
-No worries.

266
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,750
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

267
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:13,000
I just thought I should've told them.

268
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,500
Or that they would handle it better
once I did.

269
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,708
Sometimes it might be…

270
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,458
less painful just to say it like it is.

271
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:26,791
Yeah.

272
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,333
And sometimes it turns to shit.

273
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,291
Yeah.

274
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:40,250
Søren, now that I have you.
The fruit plan. What do you think?

275
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,208
Pro or con?

276
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,500
I think it's great.

277
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,291
I like it.

278
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,166
-Okay, then I won't bring it up again.
-You don't like it?

279
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,583
I got a melon.

280
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,541
-I see
-It's way too big.

281
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,375
-Yes.
-An apple will do. That's it.

282
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,500
-I was going to raise the issue--
-Do you have a second?

283
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,583
Of course. See you later.

284
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,291
It was just

285
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,875
about that dinner.

286
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:11,166
I have a ridiculous amount of work…

287
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,708
No problem.

288
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,750
-Just let me know when you can.
-Sure.

289
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,791
Definitely. The next couple of weeks
are a bit tight but…

290
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,833
-But after that, we'll find a day.
-Okay.

291
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,208
Great.

292
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,375
Hey.

293
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,750
Excuse me,

294
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,666
but I get it.

295
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,375
I see what this is. It's fine.

296
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:37,500
Just come right out and say it.
You and I won't happen. It's fine.

297
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,500
MY ADDRESS AGAIN:
PEBLINGE DOSSERING 32D, 5TH FLOOR

298
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,375
OR DID YOU GET EATEN BY A SHARK?

299
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,750
The last point

300
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,791
was under miscellaneous,
but we seem to have the time for it.

301
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,458
HI, AGAIN. I HOPE YOU'RE OKAY.
JUST LET ME KNOW. A BIT WORRIED.

302
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:02,041
Nana wrote me a couple of days ago…

303
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,625
Nana?

304
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:10,333
Maybe it's easier if you're the one
who tells us about Anette's situation.

305
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,958
It can wait until next week.

306
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,791
But next week has been moved
to the following week, so…

307
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,833
-So, let's get it expedited.
-Yes.

308
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,083
I saw Anette a couple of days ago.

309
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,208
She's been coming here for three years.

310
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,083
Can I have some coffee?

311
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,250
Anette turned 44 just as we concluded
her first IVF treatment,

312
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,125
which unfortunately bore no result.

313
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,416
I sat there with her…

314
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,000
and she's a healthy, loving person,

315
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,333
and it made me wonder
if we should raise the age limit to 46.

316
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,875
Well, there's a reason
we set the limit at 44.

317
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,458
Sure, but we could reconsider,
couldn't we?

318
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,250
Or?

319
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,666
Helle?

320
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:06,583
We know that the probability of
conceiving after 44 is negligible.

321
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,750
-Three to four percent after three IVFs.
-Thank you.

322
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,125
I want to help as much as anyone.

323
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,041
But the more impossible attempts we make,

324
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,000
the poorer our success rate.

325
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:22,166
Unfortunately, that is
what potential clients consider.

326
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,791
So we won't take risks
because it may affect our bottom line?

327
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:27,958
No, hang on--

328
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:32,375
That's what he's saying! But you've
always said that shouldn't be a factor.

329
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,291
-Yes. I've said that.
-Right.

330
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:40,291
-There must be a chance--
-Of course there should be a chance.

331
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,541
We shouldn't give people false hope, but
if there's a chance, we should take it.

332
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,875
And a three-four percent chance
for Anette is an amazing chance for her!

333
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,458
Yes, but…

334
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,416
Our flyers say we make families,

335
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,958
so that's what we'll damn well do!

336
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:02,708
Well.

337
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:07,666
I'm sorry, but that's just how I feel.

338
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,708
Good.

339
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,791
We will leave it up to
individual assessments

340
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:22,291
for a one-year trial period, then
we'll look at the numbers and evaluate.

341
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,416
-Thank you.
-Good.

342
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,916
-Okay, and Malene?
-Morula.

343
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,541
-So I can invite her in tomorrow.
-Yes.

344
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,500
Have you seen Helle?

345
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,875
Isn't she in her office?

346
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,041
No. And she doesn't pick up.

347
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,333
Shall I give her a message?

348
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,458
No. It's highly confidential.

349
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:00,333
-I'd like to talk to her face to face.
-Okay.

350
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:04,916
But I'm the union representative,
so you can tell me anything.

351
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:11,166
It's about the break-in.

352
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,833
Maybe someone did steal sperm.

353
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,916
Only one straw is missing, but still…

354
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,625
Odd. A straw is missing?

355
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:25,583
Yes, I've counted them four times.
There's no doubt.

356
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:30,291
It's missing from a client
who deposited three straws.

357
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,083
Now there are only two.

358
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:39,083
It's good that they weren't all stolen.
That's at least something--

359
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,541
No, it's not.
That's not "at least something."

360
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:46,875
It's very unfortunate because it's not
a normal donor, it's a depositor.

361
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,208
What do you mean?

362
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,208
Depositor how?

363
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:59,250
It was deposited by a cancer patient
before undergoing chemo treatment.

364
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,666
A cancer patient.

365
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:12,083
