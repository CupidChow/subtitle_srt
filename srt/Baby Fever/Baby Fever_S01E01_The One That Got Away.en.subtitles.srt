1
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:21,291
Damn it.

2
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:30,750
NANA L. JESSEN
FERTILITY DOCTOR

3
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:59,541
So I stole sperm to inseminate myself.
No big deal, I'm just borrowing the sperm.

4
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:05,333
That's fine, right? Or is it totally
fucked? Can I go to jail because of it?

5
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,625
But I could get a baby.

6
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,916
3 DAYS EARLIER

7
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,500
NO PARKING OF BICYCLES

8
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,250
Nana?

9
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,708
-Good morning, miss.
-Good morning, sir.

10
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,750
-In a hurry?
-Yeah, I have a consultation in five.

11
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:51,625
-It was nice when we--
-Yeah, it was nice, thanks.

12
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,666
-I picked some mushrooms this weekend--
-You picked mushrooms?

13
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,000
-Okay.
-Yes.

14
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,833
-Chanterelles, oyster mushrooms.
-Really?

15
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,458
-Really. It makes a really good soup.
-Lovely.

16
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,791
So if you want come over for dinner--

17
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,375
Sounds nice, I'm just so busy
this week. But maybe.

18
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,708
-Okay.
-Have a nice day.

19
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:09,625
You too.

20
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,541
-The new GE scanner?
-Yes.

21
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:18,291
Awesome, I've been
asking for this for ages.

22
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,625
It shows both the endometrium
and follicles in 3D.

23
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,583
The scanner is smaller, of course.

24
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,750
To make the vaginal penetration nicer
for the woman.

25
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,500
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

26
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,125
What's up, Bastian?

27
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,791
-Did you drop out of 1st grade again?
-Can I, Mom?

28
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,708
-No, sweetie.
-Sure you can.

29
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,666
-No.
-You're smart.

30
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,375
I understand English, you know.

31
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,125
-He understands English.
-Yeah.

32
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:08,666
-Did I see you outside with Hot Phys?
-He's nice. And handsome.

33
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,750
A tiny bit boring.

34
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:14,875
After happy hour last Friday,
you made it sound like he'd invented sex.

35
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,958
I haven't got time for dating.
Too much work.

36
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,875
I have a great idea. Let's trade.
You'll be the single mom

37
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:27,333
and I'll be the doctor banging hot
physiotherapists and paying top tax.

38
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,375
Yeah…

39
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,291
Can you feel it?

40
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,000
But I suck at roleplaying.

41
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,083
We'll trade if I win at bowling tonight.

42
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:36,541
Nana!

43
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,291
-Sorry, I forgot.
-Come on!

44
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,583
-You forgot the highlight of the week?
-It's unbelievable.

45
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,500
It sure is!

46
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,916
-I forgot my bowling shoes.
-Do it in your socks.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,583
-Didn't work last time.
-It worked fine.

48
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:55,083
-Get in there, and remember new--
-Wait, I remember. New…

49
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,250
-Andreas.
-Anton.

50
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,166
New Anton.

51
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,666
Well done. New Anton
is going to follow you around all day.

52
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,166
Thanks for the reminder.

53
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,000
Nearly done, Latifa.

54
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,750
I'm draining the last follicle…

55
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,291
now.

56
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,708
-You're doing great, baby.
-Thanks.

57
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,458
Super. I'm removing it now.

58
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,375
Yes.

59
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,291
Well done. Was it bad?

60
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,375
No, it was okay.

61
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,791
It's not the most pleasant thing
in the world.

62
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:39,916
Yes, we have five.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
-What?
-We got five.

64
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:42,916
There are five.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,958
Isn't more better?

66
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,666
Quality is better than quantity,
so it's great.

67
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:54,250
-How can you ascertain the quality?
-At 32, your eggs should be fine.

68
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,833
When I had twins, I only had three eggs,

69
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,000
so it's more than enough.

70
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,083
That's nice to hear.

71
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,166
-Isn't it tough to have twins?
-It's crazy!

72
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,666
Insanely crazy.

73
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:19,208
I never sleep, and they'll only
eat Coco Pops for dinner.

74
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,416
But when they're your kids,
you just think it's cute.

75
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:30,375
I just can't stand the thought
of losing another.

76
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:35,833
I don't know if I can handle it.

77
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,416
I felt the same way.

78
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,708
-You did?
-I was terrified of doing anything.

79
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,958
I gained 25 kg.

80
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,791
I was sprawled on the sofa
eating chocolate and bingeing Friends.

81
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,333
Ten seasons, that's…

82
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,333
That's a lot of hours,
in case you didn't know.

83
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,291
I'm glad to hear that.

84
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,708
Here's my number.

85
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,500
Please call me anytime.

86
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,833
Day and night. I mean it.

87
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,833
I really appreciate that.

88
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,458
-I can show you how.
-That'd be great.

89
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:22,041
-Why are the models always so mad?
-They're hungry.

90
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:23,708
Yeah.

91
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:29,708
Nana, I'm really impressed
by the way you talk to clients.

92
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:35,041
-Thanks. Hi.
-I can tell it means a lot to them,

93
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,583
that you involve yourself and your kids.

94
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,125
-Thanks.
-Which kids did you talk about today?

95
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,208
You have more than the twins?

96
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:47,000
You have Lea, 11, a terrific jazz dancer.

97
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,125
She really is.

98
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,500
-So you have three kids?
-And how's Malthe? Still homesick?

99
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,250
Oh, it was just a phase.

100
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:58,333
He just went on a school camping trip
for three days.

101
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,458
Wow.

102
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,666
-He loves Billie Eilish.
-She is great. Here you go.

103
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,958
Thank you.

104
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,083
-So you have four kids?
-It depends…

105
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,625
on the situation, I guess.

106
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,375
You have shared custody?

107
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,750
Okay, then. Imagine
your dentist had really bad teeth.

108
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,291
That won't do, right?

109
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,166
If it reassures them
to hear that I have kids…

110
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,875
then I have kids.

111
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,666
So you haven't got kids?

112
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,333
Nope.

113
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:47,250
-Want to chip in for a present for Helle?
-Sure. What have you got in mind?

114
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,958
-Niels-Anders suggested a sea kayak.
-A sea kayak?

115
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,708
-A sea kayak.
-Okay.

116
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,583
-She'll never use it, that's for sure.
-Never.

117
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,333
-She will, just wait and see.
-Wait and see?

118
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,000
-A sea kayak.
-She will.

119
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,083
-Hi, everybody.
-Hi.

120
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:05,500
Welcome to yet another
wonderful weekly conference.

121
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,250
Let me begin by saying how much I look
forward every day to working with you.

122
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,875
-Likewise.
-Thank you.

123
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,875
Anyway, I have good news.

124
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,166
The numbers are looking
even better all around…

125
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,000
Maybe I should say yes
to the mushroom soup with Hot Phys.

126
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,333
What kind of person picks mushrooms?

127
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:27,208
But he is really handsome.
And it was nice last time.

128
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,166
And a little awkward. Or… no, it was nice.

129
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,791
But if we do it again,
he may think we're getting serious.

130
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,541
Sex and soup…

131
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,250
Nana, I don't know how you do it,

132
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,583
but your clients get pregnant
by the dozen.

133
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,875
Wonderful.

134
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,708
Oh, and Niels-Anders has an idea.

135
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,125
Well, it's come to my attention

136
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:58,166
that several of our competitors
have launched an all-inclusive deal

137
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,000
that includes all scans and medications

138
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,541
so the bill doesn't come
as a surprise to clients.

139
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:11,000
Isn't that just a smart way
of tapping clients for more money?

140
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,375
No.

141
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,666
Sure it is.

142
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,333
No, it's more transparent for clients.

143
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,750
And it might just be great
for our bottom line.

144
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,625
Bottom line? We're not talking
about a football match.

145
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,041
What?

146
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,625
A football match?

147
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,791
Yeah, with lines.

148
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,000
-Oh, you mean back lines--
-Yeah, bottom lines.

149
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,458
Let me just cut in. If nobody,

150
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,125
for instance, me, because I'm the boss

151
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:49,333
focuses on our turnover,
we can't afford to give the odd discount

152
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,541
or buy a new scanner, for example.

153
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,583
For example.

154
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,250
-And other things, Niels-Anders.
-Right.

155
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,875
-Yes, well--
-Then…

156
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,250
-Fine, it's fine.
-It's not decided. Let's move on.

157
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,708
-One quick thing.
-Yeah?

158
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,708
New fruit plan.

159
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,416
Excuse me.

160
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,916
-Nana, got a second?
-Sure.

161
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,708
-You know, Marie--
-Your new girlfriend.

162
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,833
-We've been together for two years now.
-Oh, okay.

163
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:28,041
-We want to start up treatment.
-Good for you. Congratulations.

164
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,750
And we'd like you

165
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,458
to inseminate Marie.

166
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,416
I get it if you're like,

167
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,208
"Oh, boy, the boss's wife." Pressure!

168
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,375
"What an honor!"

169
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,666
No, I'm kidding!

170
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,083
Hi, Niels-Anders.

171
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:52,458
Don't worry. We're regular clients.
Whenever you can squeeze us in.

172
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,916
I'm pretty booked,

173
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,208
as you know.

174
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,750
But it'd be great to start within

175
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,333
the next 14 days
to fit with Marie's cycle.

176
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,250
Okay.

177
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,208
And Niels-Anders isn't free, or?

178
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,083
We both want you.

179
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,625
-Well--
-Thanks a million.

180
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,583
It's just…

181
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,750
Well, it means a lot. Thanks. I mean it.

182
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,166
Thanks.

183
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,833
You're welcome.

184
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,416
Isn't it beautiful?

185
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,458
We've got a lane at seven, and I have
to file the records and clean the bank.

186
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:36,541
-Two minutes. I'll help you clean.
-Well, you really suck at that.

187
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,333
Jump up and let's try it out.

188
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,125
No way.

189
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:45,458
-Come on. Please!
-I'm busy, and I don't want to.

190
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,250
-Why not?
-Because.

191
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:52,458
-We've done it a million times.
-I said no.

192
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,375
Or yes.

193
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,291
-Or no.
-Or no. Damn.

194
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,333
Fine.

195
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,083
What?

196
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,458
-Then you'll scan me.
-No way!

197
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,666
What do you mean?

198
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,375
Okay.

199
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,250
-Ready?
-Yes.

200
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,333
Move it to the right.

201
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,666
Or up.

202
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,291
Yes. The resolution is great, huh?

203
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,541
Go further in.

204
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,541
There you go.

205
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,875
It's a crazy sharp image, huh?

206
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,833
Was that all you wanted to check?

207
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,875
Stay there.

208
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,625
Can you press the plus button?

209
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,375
Freeze and then plus.

210
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,333
Freeze.

211
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,166
And then zoom.

212
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,083
Perfect.

213
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,458
Press print.

214
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:01,916
Thanks.

215
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,541
Shit.

216
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,208
Three follicles.

217
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,333
What does it mean?

218
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,000
It means that…

219
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,083
Well, I don't know. That I have…

220
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,916
…five-six cycles.

221
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,333
So six months to get pregnant?

222
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,666
That's not good.

223
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:49,750
No.

224
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,208
Not if you want to get pregnant, anyway.

225
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,041
-But do you?
-Hell, I don't know.

226
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,583
It's just that you always say

227
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,625
it perhaps wasn't meant to be.

228
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,416
I know, but I never imagined…

229
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,208
…that my deadline was this close.
You know?

230
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,750
You're only 37. Isn't that early
to run out of eggs?

231
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,666
Yeah.

232
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,000
Some women just have
fewer eggs than others.

233
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,250
-Is it a genetic thing?
-Yeah.

234
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,375
Another great gift from my mom.

235
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,291
Good thing you're surrounded by sperm.

236
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,625
Just take your pick.

237
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,500
I don't know if I'm ready for that.

238
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,708
But why not?

239
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,250
I never imagined I'd be a single mom.

240
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:53,041
-How about the nice guy from Vejle?
-No, he was freakily close to his mom.

241
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,083
-Jacob!
-Jacob who?

242
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,791
-Low hairline, tall.
-I don't even remember him.

243
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,250
-Frederik?
-Right.

244
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,458
He didn't like kids.

245
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,416
I've got it.

246
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,500
HP.

247
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,166
HP?

248
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,416
Hot Phys.

249
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,333
No way.

250
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,500
Simone, you don't have kids
with a guy you banged after happy hour.

251
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,791
Sure you do.

252
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,708
So pick a guy in the sperm bank catalogue.

253
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,625
And fuck having a dad around.

254
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,291
Your turn.

255
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,916
Look at all the great solo moms
we help every day.

256
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,500
-I know.
-They manage.

257
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,166
I know.

258
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,583
I just don't think…

259
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,916
My mom was…

260
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:49,875
She was kind of…

261
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,333
I heard her hit on the radio yesterday.

262
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,708
What a shame you didn't inherit her voice.

263
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,375
I don't really know what I inherited.

264
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,500
All I can do is work.

265
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,666
-Not true.
-Yes.

266
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,041
No.

267
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,666
I still use my phone
to go to the bathroom.

268
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,666
-What for?
-The flashlight.

269
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,791
The flashlight?

270
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,125
The light bulb blew six months ago.

271
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,250
I'm no use to anyone, really.

272
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,500
Come here.

273
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,541
You've called Lise LaCour,
I can't pick up the phone,

274
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:11,666
but if you sing a message,
I might call you back!

275
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,750
Hi Mom, it's me.

276
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:20,750
It feels like we haven't talked in ages.

277
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,916
So I just wanted to say hi.

278
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,875
So hi.

279
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:29,750
And…

280
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,750
Bye.

281
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,375
Nana?

282
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,416
Damn.

283
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,916
-Do you need help?
-No, it's fine. I think…

284
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,041
I think it's gone…

285
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,250
All over my pants.

286
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,916
-Do you want to--
-Sure, thanks.

287
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,750
-It's good to see you.
-You too.

288
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:58,000
-You work here?
-Yeah, I work in a…

289
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,500
A fertility clinic.

290
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,708
In here. Right here.

291
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,666
-Congratulations, that's what you wanted.
-Thanks, yeah.

292
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,250
What about you?
Are you done saving the world?

293
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,541
No, it still needs saving.
I'm in Guatemala.

294
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,583
-Just home for a quick visit.
-Interesting.

295
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,333
What are you doing here?

296
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,208
That's an interesting story.

297
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,708
I have a meeting with the sperm bank.

298
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,625
The sperm bank, right.
That's just around the corner.

299
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,250
Okay, good to know. Otherwise,
I would've been stuck here all day.

300
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,166
Oh, right.

301
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,375
How long are you in town?

302
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:45,833
Can we meet up?

303
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,208
-Sure we can.
-Yeah.

304
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,458
This is…

305
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,958
-Simone.
-Mathias.

306
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,083
Hi, Mathias.

307
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,083
Nice to meet you.

308
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,750
-I work with--
-I'll be up in a minute.

309
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,458
-Bye.
-Bye.

310
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,541
-Well, I have to go.
-Yeah, I should get to work.

311
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,458
We'll figure something out.

312
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,500
-See you soon.
-See you.

313
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,916
-And have a nice day at work.
-You too.

314
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,625
Or…

315
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,250
Bye.

316
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,666
Who was that?

317
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,916
There you are.

318
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,333
-Was it an ex-boyfriend?
-No.

319
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,083
-It is!
-It isn't.

320
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,625
Why haven't you told me about him?

321
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,333
So we dated for six months, and then…

322
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

323
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,833
It was really nice. He was wonderful.

324
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,166
-Almost too wonderful.
-Oh, you don't want that.

325
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,458
That's why I always fall for morons.
They don't let you down.

326
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,583
He got a job with an NGO
in South America and…

327
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,250
then it stopped.

328
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,583
He's totally "the one who got away."

329
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,416
And you haven't seen him in seven years?

330
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,583
No.

331
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:25,041
And now he's donating sperm
so other people can have wonderful kids.

332
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,750
Fate brought him back for you.

333
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,416
He lives in Guatemala.

334
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,541
One date with you
and he's never going back.

335
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,833
He'll be the father of your baby
and you'll live happily ever after.

336
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,416
No.

337
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,291
Not going to happen.

338
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,333
I deleted his number back then.

339
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,708
Who cares if you're not going to call him?

340
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,583
Fucking six months.

341
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,875
-Your next client is here.
-Thanks, send her in.

342
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,250
It's good you called,
you shouldn't be worried.

343
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,958
Let's check if everything's fine.

344
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,708
This is your pulse. It's a bit high.

345
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,166
Is that bad?

346
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,708
Not at all. You're just nervous.

347
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,541
Okay.

348
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,000
Let me have a look here.

349
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,416
I knew it.

350
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:07,833
Great.

351
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,250
Is that the heart?

352
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,833
Yeah, a very nice, little heart.

353
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,166
It's beating so fast.

354
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,833
Well, it's pretty busy in there.

355
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,958
It's a little human.

356
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,416
It's the best sound in the world.

357
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:27,416
Yeah.

358
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,583
What's up?

359
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,208
You can never tell!

360
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,458
Tell what?

361
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,416
I just went into
the computer at the sperm bank.

362
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,500
Did you just get a picture?

363
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:58,791
What's this?

364
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,458
All the info the sperm bank has on him.

365
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:06,083
Address, sperm ID number,
and his phone number are at the bottom.

366
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,041
I see.

367
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,958
You can't tell anyone!

368
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:10,916
Relax, I won't.

369
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,166
I'm not even going to call him.

370
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,541
At first, I kept seeing you everywhere.

371
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,125
At the markets, on the street.

372
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,666
In Chile.

373
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,208
Which is strange. Why would you be there?

374
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,875
I meant to write, but…

375
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:35,625
-It was a bit strange when you left.
-Yeah, it was a mess.

376
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,291
It was a mess.

377
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,291
Strange, isn't it?

378
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,458
To bump into each other there.

379
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:56,208
Yeah. It's not a place you
typically run into people you know.

380
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,666
-Cold?
-A little.

381
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,541
Thanks.

382
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,125
It's really nice to--

383
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,083
Yeah.

384
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,041
To see you again.

385
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:24,958
You too.

386
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,583
When do you, like, want kids?

387
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:49,791
What?

388
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,458
I mean…

389
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,041
do you?

390
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,541
-You're asking if I want kids?
-Not right now, but…

391
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:01,041
Or preferably soon,

392
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,166
within six months' time, perhaps?

393
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,458
I just want to know,
because it's something I…

394
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,208
I…

395
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,000
Don't you usually kiss before you
discuss having kids?

396
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,916
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

397
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,333
I'm too much.

398
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,000
Can we just pretend it never happened?

399
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,958
-Sure, let's try that.
-Great.

400
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:30,708
It's fine.

401
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:32,708
Great.

402
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:45,375
I just went,
"When do you want to be a dad?"

403
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,375
-So--
-Jesus.

404
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:51,416
Let me just get this straight.

405
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,416
-You're just about to kiss?
-Yeah.

406
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,333
And you ask him
if he wants to have kids with you.

407
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,250
Yeah.

408
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,833
And he kind of balked at that.

409
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:04,208
Well, it kind of makes sense,

410
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:07,083
it is a pretty hardcore
first date question.

411
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,000
Is it terrible?

412
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:10,333
-No.
-Look me in the eye.

413
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:11,541
Okay.

414
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,458
Is it terrible?

415
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:14,833
Terrible!

416
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:17,250
-It wasn't the smartest thing to do.
-Huge fuck-up.

417
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:20,833
I'll take a break
and we'll go upstairs to the clinic.

418
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,875
We'll listen to some Poul
and have a tiny shot.

419
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:27,041
Can you feel it?

420
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,625
Let's go up to Poul.

421
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:32,125
Maybe we need two shots.

422
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,916
Max two shots…

423
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,458
Come here and hold me

424
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,458
Hold me and hug me

425
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,666
I feel like making a double.

426
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,541
I'll fill them all at once.

427
00:27:56,625 --> 00:28:00,458
We've been adrift in outer space

428
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:06,958
Like two satellites passing by

429
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,583
Why did you spill it all?

430
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:12,291
But luckily, we have landed

431
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:18,791
And you are right here by my side

432
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:24,250
People like us
Need to find themselves a sweetheart

433
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:30,250
I'd really like that sweetheart to be you

434
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:35,875
So come sit down
We are off to a great start

435
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:41,166
Like a pathfinder who's back en route

436
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:50,916
GREAT TO SEE YOU. YOU'RE NICE,
I'M STUPID. SORRY ABOUT BEING BROODY

437
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,833
HOPE I DIDN'T SCARE YOU OFF

438
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:00,833
Babe…

439
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,625
Can you go downstairs and…

440
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,416
lock up the sperm bank?

441
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,625
-No.
-Yes.

442
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:11,958
No!

443
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,750
If the alarm goes off,
you're paying the fine.

444
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,708
OMNISPERM ENSURES NEW RECORD REVENUE

445
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,375
Fuck.

446
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,458
Damn.

447
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,666
Three follicles.

448
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,000
So six months to get pregnant?

449
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,208
That's not good.

450
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,500
When do you want kids?

451
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,250
You're asking if I want kids?

452
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:22,000
-I have a meeting with the sperm bank.
-Okay.

453
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:25,666
All the info

454
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,250
the sperm bank has on him.
Address, sperm ID number.

455
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:32,041
MATHIAS DAHL

456
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,750
No one ever needs to know.
