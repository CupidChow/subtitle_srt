1
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,416
-It's nice, right?
-Yeah, it is.

2
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,375
Do you want a cup of coffee?

3
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,625
-No, I'll get it.
- No, it's on me. I owe you.

4
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,375
I came home from Guatemala
because I found a lump.

5
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,750
It turned out to be testicular cancer.

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,000
Now they want to operate
to make sure it doesn't spread.

7
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,041
But it's not serious.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,958
-So you'll be fine?
-Yes, I hope so.

9
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,291
I should've told you.

10
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,916
I'm sorry, I just had enough
of talking about illnesses.

11
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,916
People can't deal with the word "cancer."
You'd think it rhymed with "death."

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,916
-You're not going to die.
-Not from this.

13
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,541
I think you're wonderful.

14
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,375
And fierce.

15
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,208
Thank you.

16
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:28,916
But this whole thing with us…

17
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,250
I just can't…

18
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,208
I just can't.

19
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,166
Of course.

20
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,208
Look what I found in Niels-Anders' office.

21
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,125
Nice.

22
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,291
Your mom's got
a double-page spread in Billed Bladet.

23
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,333
Great.

24
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,083
Very nice!

25
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,541
Apparently, it was 25 years ago
when she won the Danish Song Contest.

26
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,166
What is it…

27
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,166
I'm a bit busy, so can we do this later?

28
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,208
Well, I know your appointments by heart.

29
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,916
I know you don't have patients
for the next 30 minutes.

30
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,791
What's up?

31
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,375
I met up with Mathias.

32
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:56,750
Yeah.

33
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,125
Did he tell you
why he didn't show up for dinner, or?

34
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,083
Yeah, he--

35
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,208
Is he married? That's what I think.

36
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,708
-That's my theory.
-He's got cancer.

37
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,333
-What?
-It's not serious.

38
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:11,166
-Look, cancer is usually pretty serious.
-Sure, but it's not…

39
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,541
The prognosis is good
but they thought it might have spread,

40
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,791
so he's getting immediate surgery.

41
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,291
That's also why
he didn't show up for dinner, you know.

42
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,166
Well, I kind of had a hunch…

43
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,666
-That he had cancer?
-No, that he was lying.

44
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,083
-That he was covering up the truth.
-It's not a lie, he just didn't say it.

45
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:36,500
He refrained from telling the truth
which is kind of the same thing.

46
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,916
He had every chance to tell you,
but he didn't.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,083
-It's super weird he didn't tell you that.
-I don't think…

48
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:47,625
I don't know what it is,
but I have a really bad feeling.

49
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:52,500
He lied. But sure, let's say
he refrained from telling the truth.

50
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,166
Nana?

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,625
Please say something.

52
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,333
What's going on?

53
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,625
I'm pregnant.

54
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,083
-Did you hear me?
-You're kidding!

55
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:28,500
No, I'm not kidding. I am. I'm…

56
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,083
-Babe! Stop!
-Yes.

57
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,500
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

58
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:38,458
No! Or yes. No.

59
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,625
-That's wonderful! Or?
-Yeah.

60
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,041
-It is!
-Yeah, I'm just getting…

61
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,500
-Me too, but…
-Yeah.

62
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,250
-Who's the father?
-It's…

63
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,541
Is it Mathias?

64
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,583
No, he's sick and we haven't… at all.

65
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,583
So it's Søren?

66
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,083
-You haven't been with anyone else?
-No.

67
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,958
-So it must be Søren.
-Yeah.

68
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,500
It must be him.

69
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,666
-It has to be.
-Did you tell him?

70
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,375
-No.
-Okay, but…

71
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:23,750
-And no one should know. Especially him.
-He needs to be told at some point.

72
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,458
I will tell him. I just need to…

73
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,666
I just need a bit of time.

74
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,583
Yeah.

75
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,333
What's that face?

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,791
But babe, this is incredible!

77
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,083
I'm so happy!

78
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,166
Why can't I just shut up?

79
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,250
"Søren is the dad." Shit.

80
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:53,458
Okay, but he could become the dad
if I say that he is.

81
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,333
Otherwise, I'll be alone with the kid.

82
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,416
Shit, I can't do that. Poor baby.

83
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,708
Okay, maybe Søren could be the dad.

84
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,958
Is that such a bad idea?

85
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,041
Okay. Good.

86
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,625
Take a deep breath.

87
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,208
Honey, can you hum
inside your head instead?

88
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,625
Sure. I'm just trying to soothe you.

89
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,833
Good. Just take

90
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,166
a deep breath here.

91
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,833
Could we turn it off? Just turn it off.

92
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,750
Sure.

93
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,416
We just talked about how nice
it would be to have a song to remind us--

94
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,708
Yes, but it doesn't have to be
an 80's lesbian pathos hell.

95
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,125
No…

96
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,250
Just relax as much as possible.

97
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,041
-Relax your pelvis.
-Want to listen to something else?

98
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,000
Maybe some Jada.

99
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,000
-How do you spell that?
-It's J-a-d-a.

100
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,666
Okay, never mind.
Can we just be completely quiet?

101
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,583
Yes. Of course, honey.

102
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,958
We'll be completely quiet. That's fine.

103
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,791
Just relax as much as possible
and breathe.

104
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,708
-A duet with Thomas Helmig isn't lesbian…
-Helle!

105
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,916
We're making a child, okay?

106
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,541
I think I might be too old for Marie.

107
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,208
Yes.
One day she'll realize, and then what?

108
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,916
She's crazy about you. She really is.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,583
Well, she doesn't like my taste in music.

110
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,666
And I'm not sure
she likes the way I dress.

111
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,875
She can still be crazy
about the rest of you.

112
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,625
Coffee queue?

113
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,875
It's very slow. I've been trying to make
a cortado for 15 minutes. Just go ahead.

114
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,250
Okay, thanks.

115
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,041
You may be different,
but you'll be great parents.

116
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:10,708
And…

117
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,625
you'll definitely get a kid
who won't like Anne Linnet or Jada.

118
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,250
-I hope so.
-Yeah.

119
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,083
Oh, gosh.

120
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,166
Thanks.

121
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,208
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

122
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,625
-Really. Thank you.
-Yeah.

123
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,541
Yeah.

124
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:06,083
The kid doesn't really
have to know that it's not my…

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,875
…my swimmers. We haven't told anyone.

126
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,208
But that's pretty unethical.

127
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,791
We'd be bad parents
if we kept it a secret from our kid.

128
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:25,375
We usually advise parents
to tell the truth.

129
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:30,041
A lot of research shows
it's best for the child to…

130
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,125
I understand it's difficult.

131
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,750
It's a big decision.

132
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,500
I…

133
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,125
I just feel a little…

134
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,000
It's difficult.

135
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,750
Maybe we should book another consultation,

136
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,458
so you can go home and think it through?

137
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,500
Yeah.

138
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,083
This may sound dumb,
but have you tried making a list?

139
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58,708
A list?

140
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,791
You know, pros and cons.

141
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,000
Just a list.

142
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,583
No.

143
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,541
My husband and I do it often
if we're unsure about something.

144
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,666
And…

145
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,666
he was actually in a situation
a bit similar to yours.

146
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,625
And it helped.

147
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,583
What if there's an equal amount
of pros and cons?

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,791
Can you print a delivery slip for this?
It's for Andrea Larsen.

149
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,875
Should we meet at the bowling alley?

150
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,333
That's what I'm thinking.

151
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,916
Or out front maybe?

152
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:03,041
Helle says I need a new key card,
and she says

153
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,250
-that you're in charge of that.
-Yes, she's right.

154
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,458
Yes.

155
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,958
I'll just…

156
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,375
-I'll help you with that.
-Okay. Thanks.

157
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:29,708
-Do you have my…
-I just started on this now.

158
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,208
It'll just take a minute or so.

159
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,250
-I can also come back later.
-Sure.

160
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,500
You can do that if you'd rather do that.

161
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,708
If you'd rather do that.

162
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,916
-Sure. I'll just leave it on your shelf.
-Perfect.

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,208
-See you.
-Sure thing.

164
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,875
That's good.

165
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,750
If you'd rather do that?

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,958
What's up, honey?

167
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,291
Yeah.

168
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,708
I can do that.

169
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,458
He wants to talk to you.

170
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,000
Are you okay?

171
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,458
Sure. I just…

172
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,833
Don't stress. Just take your time.

173
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,208
It's never been a problem.
If I feel the urge to…

174
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:45,166
-If I have to. Not that I do it a lot…
-Right.

175
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,208
But you can if you want. I understand.

176
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,833
But what if…

177
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,958
it's not possible.

178
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,208
-What if it doesn't…
-Happen?

179
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,083
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

180
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,750
-Honey, tell me if you need help.
-I don't need help.

181
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,041
-I don't need help here.
-Okay.

182
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,666
Okay. Good.

183
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,916
We've got a thermal bag you can take home.
You can borrow that and then

184
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,250
we'll rebook you for
insemination tomorrow afternoon.

185
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,666
Can you tell her?
That you think it's better tomorrow?

186
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,041
That it's your professional opinion…

187
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,291
-That it's better tomorrow?
-Yes, today is…

188
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,458
-A stupid day?
-Yes, a stupid day. Tomorrow's good.

189
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:38,875
Thank you.

190
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,083
"Hi, it's Nana. I went and got pregnant."

191
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,291
"And you're the father."
That took ten seconds.

192
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,250
The amount of seconds doesn't determine
how easy something is to say, does it?

193
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,708
Seriously, you have to tell him.

194
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:04,416
If you're unsure whether he should be
a part of the child's life, just say it.

195
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
-And then take it from there.
-I just think…

196
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,583
I really wish I was in love with him.

197
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,708
Now you sound like the losers
on Married at First Sight.

198
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,583
-The losers?
-Yeah.

199
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:20,416
The people who think they'll
experience love at first sight

200
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,583
and then they get disappointed
when it doesn't happen.

201
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,625
Love can sneak up on you.

202
00:14:56,291 --> 00:15:02,166
HI M. I HOPE THE SURGERY WENT WELL?

203
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,666
DEAR MATHIAS. JUST HI.

204
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,416
Hi, Mom.

205
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,625
Hi, honey.

206
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,833
Listen, I have fantastic news.

207
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,166
Did you see that I called you?

208
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,208
What?

209
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,416
Did you see that I called you?

210
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,625
No, you didn't.
You must have my old number.

211
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,000
No, you've had the same number
for three years.

212
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,041
Are you stressed, honey?
You sound stressed.

213
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:42,958
No.

214
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,458
Are you sure, you're not stressed?

215
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,375
No, I'm not…

216
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,875
It's important to relax once in a while.

217
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,041
I'm not stressed.

218
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,708
Oh, well.
I'm just calling with some good news.

219
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,000
-Okay.
-Yeah.

220
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:57,291
And what's the good news?

221
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,666
I don't think I want to tell you now.

222
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,000
Stop it, Mom.

223
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,791
Do you think that's a nice tone?

224
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,416
I don't have any kind of tone.

225
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,458
Are you stressed?

226
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,458
No, I'm not stressed!

227
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,083
I think it's better if I call you later.

228
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,166
You can't be… Fine.

229
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,791
Then you can calm down.

230
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,125
Fine then. Bye.

231
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,041
Unbelievable.

232
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,666
I'm alone with everything.

233
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,083
What if I have this child
and never meet anyone?

234
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,083
What if I'm going to be a terrible mom?
What if it doesn't like me?

235
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,750
Of course, it will like you.

236
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,166
And there's no such thing
as terrible moms.

237
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,958
-Maybe there are…
-A few.

238
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,666
…some terrible mothers. Most definitely.

239
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,875
But I'm sure you'll be a great mom.

240
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,958
But what if things don't work out?

241
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,458
It's a big responsibility.
What if I don't know how to do it?

242
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:28,833
ONE OF DENMARKS
BIGGEST STARS IS COMING HOME

243
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,708
And for how long have you been trying?

244
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,166
-Two years.
-Three years.

245
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,791
-Three, yes.
-And how long have you been together?

246
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,750
-For three…
-For five years.

247
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,666
We've tried everything…

248
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,000
intercourse-wise.

249
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,875
-Everything.
-Every position. Every hour.

250
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:00,791
Different places.

251
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,458
Okay.

252
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:07,916
Inside, outside, in a forest, in a car.
It was a rental.

253
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,875
We don't have a car, so we rented one.

254
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,208
Okay, listen to me.

255
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:18,708
I'm just going to say this
because I'm pretty good at lying or…

256
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,583
I'm good at telling when people are lying.

257
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:28,958
You do know you can get help
even if you're not a couple?

258
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:34,041
If you're not a couple, then the donor has
to go through some tests. We check for

259
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,875
hereditary diseases, STDs…

260
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,875
I don't have any STDs.

261
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,333
Okay, so…

262
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:49,250
you have lied to start treatment faster?

263
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,541
My mom is sick.

264
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,750
She has a year.
One and a half if she's lucky.

265
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,375
She dreams of being a grandmother,
and I always wanted children, so…

266
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,958
We're best friends.

267
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:21,000
We've known each other since grade school.

268
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,583
Ida's mom is like a bonus mom to me.

269
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,750
I'm completely sure.

270
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:32,958
Okay.

271
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,333
Can you come to
your first examination next week?

272
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,708
-Yes.
-Yes.

273
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,500
-Thank you.
-No problem.

274
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,916
-Bastian, no playing inside.
-Hi.

275
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,791
-I'm cheating now.
-No cheating. Put it down.

276
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,416
-See you soon.
-See you in 30 minutes.

277
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,541
I'll take good care of him, maybe.

278
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,625
No, watch it.

279
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,333
Ready? As hard as you can.

280
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,833
One, two, three.
As hard as you can. Shoot!

281
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,166
Shit.

282
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,625
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

283
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:37,000
-I'm fine. I didn't see there was a match.
-Then you have to be careful.

284
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,041
-You made me hit him.
-Did she really?

285
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,833
It's okay, I'm fine.

286
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:43,875
Do you want to play?

287
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:49,875
-I think Søren is busy.
-I think I can play.

288
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,875
For five minutes.

289
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,166
-But I'm pretty good.
-Then I'm on your team.

290
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,916
-Okay.
-He's on my team.

291
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,625
-No, mine. It'll be fine
-Ready, Nana?

292
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,541
-To be annihilated?
-You're probably not as good as me.

293
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,250
I'm good, right?

294
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,083
Will you pass it?

295
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,958
Over there to Bastian!
Yes, perfect, Bastian!

296
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,375
Let's play defense. Good defense!

297
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,333
I hit the post and went in!

298
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,916
What a goal!

299
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,083
Can you shoot from far away?

300
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,458
Great, Bastian.

301
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,000
They called me Søren Messi at school.

302
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:38,875
Did I score?

303
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,833
-No.
-Was it outside the post?

304
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,375
-Yeah.
-Okay.

305
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:48,041
-I'll get it. Bastian, are you ready?
-Yeah.

306
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,083
Are those mushrooms still good?

307
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,083
Are you asking if I'll make dinner?

308
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:19,250
-Your parents look happy on the photos.
-They got divorced when I was ten.

309
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,583
I think they made a big effort
to make sure we didn't feel anything.

310
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:27,916
We still spent Christmas together
and stuff like that.

311
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,083
And do you want kids?

312
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,416
-Speaking of divorce?
-Yeah, speaking of divorce.

313
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,125
Yeah, I do.

314
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:46,541
I'd like two or three.

315
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,625
And then move to the countryside
so they can grow up in the nature.

316
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,125
-Of course.
-What?

317
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,541
You're just…

318
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:01,375
a very healthy person.

319
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,750
-Okay.
-It's a good thing.

320
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,375
Okay.

321
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,666
I'm sure you'll have healthy kids.

322
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:16,333
Your kids will be scouts
who save animals from traps.

323
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,708
And they won't take the biggest piece of
cake in case a disabled person wants it.

324
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,875
Thanks, I've never thought
about it that way before.

325
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:35,125
But I hope so.
That I'll have healthy kids one day.

326
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:39,166
Of course, you will.
You'll be the greatest dad ever.

327
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,541
For any child. Maybe mine.

328
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:46,083
And you won't have to know
that it technically isn't yours.

329
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,541
Then it won't matter that you don't
really have your own sense of style.

330
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:53,958
Maybe I should just try again.

331
00:23:56,208 --> 00:24:01,250
Because love can sneak up on you. Right?

332
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,250
Let's give it a try.

333
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:56,250
The flowers should say,
"Get well soon. Thinking of you."

334
00:24:57,541 --> 00:25:01,125
It's for someone with cancer,
but it should still be fun.

335
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,958
Yeah, or like…

336
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,916
"I think you're great.
Too bad about the cancer."

337
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,958
Does that make sense?

338
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,041
Let's go with the tulips.

339
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,083
NO PARKING OF BICYCLES

340
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:28,750
-Morning.
-Good morning.

341
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,583
-What's up?
-What's up?

342
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,916
I won't let you off the hook.

343
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:44,666
Bastian said Søren joined football.
Anything else you'd like to tell me?

344
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,500
What can I tell you?

345
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,458
We had dinner at his place and…

346
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:52,500
Yeah?

347
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:54,500
We had dhal.

348
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,083
-Did you tell him?
-Tell him what?

349
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:58,750
That you're pregnant.

350
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:05,000
No, I didn't. But I stayed the night.

351
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:07,166
Kind of a strange evening.

352
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,833
Strange in a good way or?

353
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,916
They need to get their shit together!

354
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,125
Calm down.

355
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:17,666
It's their responsibility, right?
I'm on the line here. This is a disaster!

356
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:23,000
-We'll solve it, Niels-Anders.
-It's your ass, my ass, and Nana's!

357
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:27,083
-What's going on?
-We're fucked. Jannick's sperm is a mess!

358
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,375
Anton, what's going on?

359
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,250
Niels-Anders accidentally inseminated
a client with the wrong donor sperm.

360
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:36,166
And I was supposed to double-check
the slip from the bank, but I forgot.

361
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:40,458
I don't understand how this could happen.
The sperm straws must have got mixed up.

362
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:45,375
-How could this happen? We checked it all.
-Not good enough, apparently.

363
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:56,666
Someone is going to lose their
medical license, and it won't be me!

364
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:58,291
