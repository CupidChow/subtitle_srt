1
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:18,166
You need to fast beforehand, and we'll
carry out the procedure at 8:30 a.m.

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,166
May I ask if you've tried this before?

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,458
Had an abortion, you mean?

4
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,750
No, this is my first.

5
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:33,041
A NETFLIX SERIES

6
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:52,416
No. Then you just
send them directly there.

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,125
-Hi, do you have a minute?
-Say hi to Mille first,

8
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,708
who starts as a temp until we find

9
00:00:58,791 --> 00:00:59,833
a more permanent solution.

10
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,958
Mille-Emilie. It's hyphenated.

11
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,708
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

12
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:06,250
-Hi, I'm Nana.
-Hi, Nana. Nice to meet you.

13
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,666
People always get it wrong,
don't worry about it.

14
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,291
It's just that

15
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,541
I need to take tomorrow off.
The whole day actually.

16
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,458
Why?

17
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,958
My mom is…

18
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,416
-…sick.
-No.

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,750
-Yes.
-Is it serious?

20
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:29,250
No, but she started feeling unwell
last night after her concert, so…

21
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,166
-Your mom's a singer?
-Yes.

22
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,500
-How exciting.
-Yes. Thank you.

23
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,750
-I just want to be there for her.
-That makes sense.

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,083
Yes. That does make sense.
No. I wanted to ask you.

25
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,416
Have you spoken to Simone?

26
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,333
-No.
-No.

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,625
You see, Simone is stopping by today
to get the rest of her stuff.

28
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,708
And she's getting
a great severance package.

29
00:01:55,791 --> 00:02:00,208
And it's just because we cannot
keep her after that journalist called.

30
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:04,583
It's really exciting.
I heard it in the kitchen this morning.

31
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,541
I have a client waiting,
so I'm going to go.

32
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:13,458
Let me just point out that it's so
exciting that we keep it under wraps.

33
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,541
Hi. Is it okay if Christina comes in now?

34
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,333
-I can also wait outside?
-No. Come in. Have a seat.

35
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,250
I saw you were free,
so I thought she could come in.

36
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,416
Just close the door.

37
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,958
-What?
-Close the door.

38
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:39,916
Oh, yes.

39
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,666
-Have a seat.
-Thanks.

40
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,250
How is everything?

41
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,166
Everything's fine, I think.

42
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,833
I had decided on the abortion.

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
But…

44
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,458
-Hi, again.
-Hi, Tobias. Come in.

45
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,041
Thank you.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,791
-Have a seat.
-Hi.

47
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,416
-I hope it's okay I join you.
-Of course.

48
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,041
I have… Or…

49
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:20,458
we have decided that
even though we've split up…

50
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,041
we still want the baby.

51
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,500
Even though we're not together,
we want the baby together.

52
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,083
Congratulations.

53
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you.

54
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:31,541
Thank you.

55
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:43,791
There it is.

56
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,750
That's funny.

57
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,166
-Would you like a picture?
-Yes.

58
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,416
Look.

59
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,208
A little cutie.

60
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:14,750
I think it's because the system is new.
I'm new, so I just need to learn it.

61
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,833
-Hey, Nana?
-Yes?

62
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:22,041
Do you know how long it will take?
Malene is your next appointment.

63
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,875
-Oh, right.
-My name is Marianne.

64
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,416
-Oh, sorry.
-Hi!

65
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,458
We'll talk about
initiating a treatment, so I'll…

66
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,083
I think we'll need about half an hour.

67
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,416
Is there a parking spot where
you can park for more than 15 minutes?

68
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,000
-I'll find out.
-I have EasyPark, but I…

69
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,125
-Do you have EasyPark?
-Yeah.

70
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,500
-It's wonderful that you could come.
-Yes, of course.

71
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,291
-I have loads of time now.
-Yes.

72
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:52,583
We're busy here as usual.
Nana has a client.

73
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:03,208
-Yes. Would you like some coffee?
-Yes, I'd love some.

74
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:07,166
Let's see if the machine can
brew one of those lovely flat whites.

75
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,750
I'll take it black. Like my conscience.

76
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,625
I love your sense of humor. Come.

77
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,583
Nana?

78
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,500
-Nana?
-Yes?

79
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,333
-Are you ready?
-For what?

80
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:26,958
For Marianne.

81
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,041
Yes, of course.

82
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:36,250
I think I always knew I'd be on my own.

83
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,958
Yes.

84
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,541
-If that makes any sense…
-Sure, my husband feels the same way.

85
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,875
Your husband?

86
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,333
Didn't you just say you're a solo mom?

87
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,458
Yes.

88
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,083
-I am, but not in the classic sense.
-I don't understand.

89
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,333
Let's look at the treatment plan.

90
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:08,208
-Have you heard a word I've said?
-Yes, of course.

91
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,958
I'm sorry, but this makes me nervous.

92
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,250
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

93
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,083
-Sorry, I got confused.
-Confused if you're a solo mom?

94
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,750
-Yes, or no. I'm not.
-You're not confused?

95
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,375
Yes. I mean no. Yes. No.

96
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,833
I really don't appreciate
you paying lip service to your patients.

97
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,291
We call them clients, not patients.

98
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,875
That hardly makes a difference if you
don't listen and just say some bullshit.

99
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:37,333
I'm sorry about this.
Let's start over and look

100
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,625
-at the treatment plan.
-No.

101
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:40,541
Listen.

102
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,750
That's just not good enough.

103
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,666
No.

104
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,833
It just isn't.

105
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,000
This is highly reprehensible.

106
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:59,958
It's our policy
because we really can't guarantee that.

107
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,416
No. Maybe they're just disappointed.

108
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,791
Yes, maybe. Good point.

109
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,500
Is it done, Nana?

110
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,958
Come on.

111
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,583
Wow, right in the smacker.

112
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,208
It probably isn't good to…

113
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,833
I'll just grab a cup later.
I don't need it.

114
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,375
It's fine.

115
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:31,875
Hey, Helle?

116
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,833
It's fine, I don't need anything.

117
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,875
I need to talk--

118
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,666
Helle?

119
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,375
Helle?

120
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,916
Do you have a minute?

121
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,458
Yes.

122
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,000
Of course.

123
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,708
She excels at her work, and I've never
known her to make mistakes.

124
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,625
No, and I actually don't disagree, Nana.

125
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,916
But technically speaking,
she made a mistake and it's not okay

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,708
-when we deal with human lives.
-But it was me.

127
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,750
I didn't set the alarm.

128
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,041
We were both here, and we got drunk,

129
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,958
and then Simone asked me
to set the alarm, because she was tired…

130
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,458
-No, she was drunk. Right?
-Yes, but…

131
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:39,291
-Anyway, I forgot because…
-Because it doesn't matter.

132
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:44,583
Because a doctor doesn't
set the alarm in a sperm bank.

133
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,791
And certainly not if said doctor
doesn't even work in that sperm bank.

134
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,458
-But…
-No buts!

135
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,250
Simone shouldn't have gotten drunk.
Then we wouldn't have a problem.

136
00:08:56,125 --> 00:09:00,000
And what now? Should I fire you?

137
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:05,041
Over a minor alarm issue? Leaving your
clients with no doctor starting tomorrow?

138
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,708
-Twelve to fifteen couples
-Yeah.

139
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,541
would have to change to doctors
they don't even know.

140
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,125
-I see your point,
-Can you?

141
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,416
but you have to understand…

142
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,541
-I do understand.
-I don't think you do! What?

143
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,750
Excuse me.

144
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,958
-Is it okay if I interrupt?
-Sure. Or?

145
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:21,916
Yeah, sure.

146
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:27,416
-What are you doing here, honey?
-I ran all the way here because…

147
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,416
Yes.

148
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,291
-No, honey?
-Yes.

149
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,500
Honey…

150
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,583
-No.
-Yes.

151
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,416
May I ask what's going on?

152
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,166
Yes, you may. We have a positive test.

153
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,208
-Congratulations. Well done!
-Yes, congratulations.

154
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,583
Are congratulations in order?

155
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:55,958
-Yes. Hell yes. It's all thanks to Nana.
-Yes.

156
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,625
-I don't know about that.
-We shouldn't forget about that.

157
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,166
She's very talented.

158
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,250
She sure is.

159
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,666
Thank you, Nana.

160
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:08,083
Would you please tell the new receptionist
I'm taking the rest of the day off?

161
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,208
Yes.

162
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Thanks.

163
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,750
I love you, honey. Come.

164
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:26,458
A lot has happened since the last time.
My little company is growing rapidly.

165
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:31,916
-Last week I hired three new people.
-And you…

166
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,583
design clothes for animals?

167
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,041
-For dogs.
-Clothes for dogs?

168
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,666
-Yes, rainwear. Hundertwasser.
-Oh.

169
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,208
-Or wetdog.
-Yeah.

170
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,458
And I've just been thinking a lot about
what I spend my time on,

171
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,125
what I want to do
and my company, and I just think…

172
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:54,375
I think I've come to the conclusion
that it's not the right time to have kids.

173
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,916
-I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
-No. You haven't.

174
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,666
Don't think about it.
It's your decision, there is no…

175
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,125
I do need…

176
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,208
…to point out that the longer you wait,

177
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,750
the harder it'll be.

178
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,708
Yes, I know. I'm actually okay with that.

179
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,125
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

180
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:28,375
I'm just thinking that
if it happens, it happens.

181
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:32,250
Like how you just met your husband
in the jungle, and you had a kid quickly.

182
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,333
And you have two kids now, right?

183
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,875
I actually don't have any.

184
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,416
-I'm pretty sure you said two kids.
-I don't have any kids.

185
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,083
-But we have talked about your kids?
-Any at all actually.

186
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,041
A boy and a girl, right?

187
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,750
You'll have to excuse me for a moment.

188
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,083
What's happening?

189
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,583
Nana?

190
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,833
Nana, come here. Nana!

191
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:28,625
Come here. We need to call an ambulance!

192
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,958
Ambulance!

193
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,458
-We'll check for extrauterine first.
-Yes, understood.

194
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,958
Check for extrauterine first.

195
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,041
Good morning.

196
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:18,791
Is it morning?

197
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:23,083
No. That's just what you say
when someone wakes up.

198
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,000
-You were only out for an hour.
-And the baby?

199
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,416
Everything's fine.

200
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:34,583
Yes. A doctor will be here shortly,
but everything's fine.

201
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:36,625
Yes.

202
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,958
-That was a bit of a scare.
-Yes.

203
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,166
And congratulations, dammit.

204
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,708
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

205
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,291
It's still a bit new.

206
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:57,791
But you know what?

207
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,250
I think you're going to be a great mother.

208
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,416
-May I ask who the lucky father is?
-He doesn't know.

209
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,916
It's a bit… So maybe you shouldn't.

210
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,083
-Just…
-Sure. Of course.

211
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:23,166
-What are you reading?
-Oh, it's not mine.

212
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,958
It is… It was…
I found it in the waiting room.

213
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,458
But it's actually pretty funny.

214
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:36,250
It's about a woman on an estate
who, after many years, realizes

215
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,583
that she's been in love
with the gardener all along

216
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:43,125
and when she tells him,
he's drafted to fight in the war.

217
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:50,125
It's just such a horrible
and sad situation, you know?

218
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,708
-Hi. Nana?
-Hi. Yes.

219
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,250
Glad to see you're awake.

220
00:14:56,125 --> 00:15:00,416
My name is Lars, I'm a doctor.
I'm the one who saw you when you came.

221
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,000
-Have you had something to drink?
-I'm fine.

222
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,833
I suspect it was
a small vessel that ruptured

223
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,666
and if you're already stressed
or exhausted…

224
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,666
-And no blood in my abdominal cavity?
-No.

225
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,125
The fetus looks healthy.

226
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,916
It's a little fireball.

227
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,708
-Any questions?
-No.

228
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,666
-Then I'll get on with my rounds.
-Thank you.

229
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,041
-You're welcome. Bye.
-Thank you.

230
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:40,583
-My daughter, Nana, what room is she in?
-Nana is right down there to the right.

231
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,666
The nurse asked about next of kin,

232
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,458
so I took the liberty of
calling your mother.

233
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,791
-Sweetie. Hi.
-Hi, Mom.

234
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,583
Hi, my little sweetie.

235
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,958
-And hi to you, Jens-Anders.
-Hi.

236
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:00,791
-Thank you for calling.
-Sure, of course.

237
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,291
-I'll leave you to it.
-You don't have to. You can stay.

238
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:10,000
It's okay, I should probably
get back to the clinic.

239
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,583
-Yes. Thank you.
-See you.

240
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,250
-Bye.
-Bye.

241
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,208
-Good-looking guy.
-Jesus, Mom.

242
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,250
He's a true fan.

243
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,625
Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?

244
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,958
-Everything is a mess.
-What?

245
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,083
Everything is a mess.

246
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,166
Are you hungry?

247
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,416
A little.

248
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,958
-You can have the rest of mine. I'm done.
-Thank you.

249
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,250
I just love this sauce. You really forget.

250
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,500
Don't they have it in Sweden?

251
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,541
No. They give you ketchup for some reason.

252
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,791
I stopped by your concert yesterday.

253
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,958
Oh? I didn't see you.

254
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,291
I didn't go in. I stayed outside but

255
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,333
I heard the whole thing

256
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,583
and it was really good.

257
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,958
Thank you.

258
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:31,541
The way you sang was beautiful.
Without all the added stuff.

259
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:36,208
Well, they couldn't afford
bass or drums or backup singers.

260
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,125
-One will have to make do.
-Right.

261
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:45,208
I hadn't really listened
to the lyrics that way before

262
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,750
if that makes sense.

263
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:47,916
Thanks.

264
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,791
-I actually wrote it for you.
-Oh.

265
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,625
I thought you wrote it for that guy
you moved in with. That guy…

266
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:02,958
Was his name Fritz?

267
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,291
No, it wasn't for him at all.

268
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,333
That didn't last long, you know that.
No, it wasn't him.

269
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,291
I didn't know that.
I thought it lasted a while.

270
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,083
You'd just been born.

271
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:21,083
Those days where you just lie in bed.
You cried and cried

272
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,916
and the doctors thought you had colic.

273
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,125
It was so damn hard.

274
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,791
All my girlfriends helped me.

275
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,958
It was insane.

276
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,041
And when they left because…

277
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,083
Well,
they couldn't stand the noise either.

278
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,000
Then it was just the two of us.

279
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,833
And for the first time in three
or four days, you didn't cry.

280
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,875
And those lyrics came to me.

281
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,666
It is you who makes the sky turn blue

282
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,083
And I always think of you

283
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:04,125
Without you the day is sad and grey

284
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:09,083
It is you who brings me smiles of joy

285
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,291
I’ve been struck by cupid's arrow

286
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,625
You're my greatest love…

287
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,833
Would you also like some tea?

288
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:26,750
What's wrong?

289
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,625
What's wrong, sweetie?

290
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,083
-I just got tired, I think.
-You are? Come here.

291
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,541
Sweetie. It's also tough.

292
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,458
Yeah.

293
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,625
-There…
-I don't even know why I'm so tired.

294
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:51,000
That's how it is, sweetie.
That's just how it is.

295
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:56,291
-Your little body is working so hard.
-Yeah

296
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,416
Regarding the second point, I think…

297
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,666
I don't know what to call it. If it's…

298
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,541
Nana. Welcome.

299
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,583
Are you okay?

300
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:37,625
Yes. I'm okay.
May I have a quick word with you?

301
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,958
Let me get this straight. So you…

302
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:50,750
Yes, I took the sperm straw
with his number on, and then…

303
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,333
the others must've fallen out.

304
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,958
I then picked them up

305
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,166
and I must've put them back
in the wrong place.

306
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,041
-And then you inseminated yourself?
-Yeah.

307
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,166
-Jesus Christ.
-Yes.

308
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,500
Do you need some water?

309
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,458
I think so.

310
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,541
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

311
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,583
Fine.

312
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:35,125
I think we should keep this
to ourselves for a while.

313
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,833
We shouldn't involve
the police at this point.

314
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,541
And besides that,
no one was seriously harmed by it.

315
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,791
Well, Simone kind of was.

316
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,583
Yes. That's true. Yes, I'll call her.

317
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:56,666
I'd like to be the one
to tell her everything.

318
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,208
But I'd really appreciate it
if you'd rehire her.

319
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:08,291
Yes. Of course.
I'll need to talk to Jannick, but, yes.

320
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:09,791
I will.

321
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,208
And what do we do with you?

322
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,583
Hey, Søren?

323
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,500
I've been fired. It's a long story, but…

324
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,250
I don't need any more of those.

325
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:44,250
Is it just Simone who thinks
I'm the father, or did you tell everyone?

326
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,083
-It would be nice to know.
-No, I didn't tell anyone.

327
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,291
I promise.

328
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,541
Everything is just a big mess.

329
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,166
Yes.

330
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,333
But it's your mess.

331
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:02,833
Yes.

332
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,583
I actually don't know what to say.

333
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,250
Go away, Nana.

334
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,708
-I talked to Helle.
-I don't care. Get lost.

335
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,250
I told her everything.
I told her it was me.

336
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,041
It doesn't matter now. It's too late.

337
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,583
Please open the door.

338
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,458
Open the door.

339
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,541
I've never been so humiliated.
And you knew all along.

340
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,333
-Yes.
-Yes.

341
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,291
I'm sorry!

342
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,041
I don't care.

343
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,458
I don't know what to say. It was really…

344
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:16,750
stupid and bad and insane and wrong and…

345
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,083
And what?

346
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,458
Just really horrible. I…

347
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,500
I understand if you can't forgive me,
but can't you…

348
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,458
Can't you just try?

349
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:40,333
I don't know
what to do without you, actually.

350
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:56,625
-You're so fucked up.
-Yes, I am.

351
00:24:56,708 --> 00:25:00,583
-And a huge liar.
-I know, but no more. Never again.

352
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:07,000
Helle apologizes, too,
and you're rehired, of course.

353
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,375
-And you've been fired?
-Yes, very fired.

354
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:12,708
-Nice.
-Thank you.

355
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,791
-Do you want a cup of coffee?
-Yes, please.

356
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,541
I don't have any milk.

357
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,291
I'll just take it black.
Like my conscience.

358
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,458
Too soon.

359
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,208
-Do you have the keys?
-Yes.

360
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:32,375
-Are we like burglars now?
-No.

361
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:36,541
-Then why are we whispering?
-It's just cozier like this.

362
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:41,125
-Like this?
-That's fine.

363
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:42,708
Now I just need to…

364
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:48,208
-Yuck. It looks like slime.
-It kind of is. It helps the scanner.

365
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:51,916
-Can you press the green button?
-The one on the right?

366
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:04,916
-Wow, it's beating fast.
-Yes. Isn't it crazy?

367
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:09,208
Bastian, I think you can
give Nana the present now.

368
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:14,750
What do we have here?

369
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,416
-Is this for me?
-No, for the baby.

370
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,750
Is it for the baby?

371
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,958
That's just…

372
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,291
…mega cool.

373
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:32,375
-With glitter and everything.
-And glitter claws.

374
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,416
It was his own idea.

375
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,458
You did a good job with him, huh?

376
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,416
So will you.

377
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,250
But you have to tell him about it.

378
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:03,125
-He's going to hate me.
-If he hates you, he hates you.

379
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,458
And then you'll go from there.

380
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,083
What should I say?

381
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,833
I think I would start with the truth.

382
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:21,541
Everybody has a secret

383
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:25,916
Something we don’t share

384
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,833
But keep to ourselves

385
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:33,291
But, darling, if I have to tell the truth

386
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:38,583
You’re the most beautiful thing I know

387
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:44,458
I think that’s what you call love

388
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,958
It is you who makes the sky turn blue

389
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:53,625
And I always think of you

390
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:57,208
Without you the day is sad and grey

391
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:02,125
It is you who brings me smiles of joy

392
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:05,000
I’ve been struck by cupid's arrow

393
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,541
You're my greatest love

394
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:11,958
In forever

395
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:25,416
Life can bring rain and sun

396
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,541
But everything I need

397
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,083
Is a little sign

398
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:36,708
To feel that you are right by my side

399
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:42,166
You are the best thing I know

400
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:47,916
I think that’s what you call love

401
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:54,416
It is you who makes the sky turn blue

402
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,125
And I always think of you

403
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:01,625
Without you the day is sad and grey

404
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:05,416
It is you who brings me smiles of joy

405
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,416
I’ve been struck by cupid's arrow

406
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,125
You're my greatest love

407
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,916
In forever

408
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,750
