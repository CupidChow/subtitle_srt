1
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,208
Of course, we must address this.

2
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,250
I hope you'll all help…

3
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,458
get to the bottom of this.

4
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,583
Sorry. I thought you were
in the conference room.

5
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,833
Just have a seat, Nana.

6
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,375
So have we narrowed down

7
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,875
what went wrong with the woman
who got the wrong sperm?

8
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:53,833
To be straight, it was New Anton

9
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,708
who didn't cross-check
the social security number on the straw

10
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:01,083
before I inseminated her.

11
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,375
You should know that I don't blame you.

12
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:08,875
We should shelf the question
of blame, altogether, actually.

13
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,458
Yes, and it's not Anton's fault

14
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,500
that the wrong sperm was delivered.

15
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:19,250
If you're implying that this is
our fault, I should remind you

16
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,125
that if Simone hadn't messed up

17
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,000
and forgotten to activate the alarm

18
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,541
we'd never be in this situation.

19
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,916
I'll have to agree. That's right.

20
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,375
Okay, so let's talk about the facts.

21
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,750
The status now is

22
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,083
that we have persuaded the client
not to pursue the matter

23
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:40,916
and she's taken a morning-after pill.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,875
-Yes.
-Yes.

25
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,375
That's a good idea.

26
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, Carsten.

27
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:50,083
And yes, I'm hoping to land an agreement
on financial compensation.

28
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,458
We're not paying a penny.

29
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,666
Pure and simple.

30
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,125
I don't know this New Anton,
but I think it's fair that Simone pays.

31
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,791
We don't know what happened,
the arrow doesn't just point to Simone.

32
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:07,625
That's the nature of arrows.
They only point in one direction.

33
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,041
Otherwise, it's just a line.

34
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:16,208
I seriously can't handle it if
she gets pregnant because I fucked up.

35
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:22,541
The clinic will lose all its clients
and go broke because I forgot the alarm.

36
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:26,625
They could've done their job!
It's not your fault.

37
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,750
-I'll get fired.
-No, you won't.

38
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,375
You won't be fired, I promise.

39
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,000
If anyone gets fired, it's that…

40
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,208
New Anton.

41
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:47,458
Sometimes I forget you're both my
best friend and my union representative.

42
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,375
It's a pretty nice combo.

43
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,208
Check this out.

44
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:08,750
I fixed the steamer. So you can make…

45
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:14,791
-Thank you.
-It is a heart.

46
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:23,250
-It's good.
-Thanks. It's for you.

47
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,666
Do you want to hang out tonight?

48
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,666
I'd love that.

49
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:30,666
It's a date.

50
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:42,375
I think that's what they call love
You make the sky turn blue

51
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,958
-Can you hold this for a second?
-Sure.

52
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,041
You've got to be kidding me.

53
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,291
Without you the day is dull and grey

54
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes, you bring me smiles of joy

55
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,666
I've been struck by Cupid's arrow

56
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,625
You are my greatest love

57
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,000
-Damn it, Mom.
-Forever.

58
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Well done!

59
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,583
May I ask, do you have a pen?

60
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,791
-Of course.
-May I get your autograph?

61
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,125
-Here you are.
-Nana.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,750
-Your mother is Lise Lacour?
-Hi, Mom.

63
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,125
-Will you take a picture?
-Sure.

64
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,833
-Your mom? Get in the picture!
-No, it's fine.

65
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:41,916
There.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,958
Thank you.

67
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:43,916
Will you…

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,583
A pleasure to meet you, Jens Emil.

69
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,416
-It's Niels Anders, but--
-Come on, Mom.

70
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,083
Likewise, Miss Lacour.

71
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,958
-Oh, call me Lise.
-Come.

72
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,833
-Oh, my, what's going on?
-I'm sorry…

73
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,166
-Okay, look--
-No let me.

74
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,416
-It breaks so easily.
-Nana, get some scissors.

75
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,500
What nice colleagues you have.

76
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,666
Your colleagues couldn't believe
their eyes. They insisted I sang.

77
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,125
-Oh, such a lovely office!
-Yes.

78
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,333
-Is it all yours?
-Yes, all mine.

79
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,708
Please don't! It's heavy.

80
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,166
-Watch out for the glass table.
-It's out of balance.

81
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,583
It's fine.

82
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,250
I didn't know you were in Copenhagen.

83
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,291
-I left you a voicemail!
-No, you didn't.

84
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:44,500
-Yes, I did. This morning.
-This morning? That's like an hour ago.

85
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,333
-Come on.
-I'm working.

86
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,750
Why do you always look for errors?

87
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,625
-I'm singing for Jørgen de Mylius.
-Right.

88
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,708
He's releasing his great Eurovision book.

89
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,875
So of course they wanted me to sing.

90
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,041
It's at Café Liva tomorrow at 8 p.m.

91
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:09,250
I already told Jørgen you're coming,
and he can't wait to see you.

92
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,208
-I can't--
-It's the 25th anniversary.

93
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,708
-I'm sure you wouldn't want to miss it.
-I can't--

94
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,708
But I don't know if…

95
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:23,750
I should ask them to get a pianist.
What do you think?

96
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,875
-If you don't want to answer, don't.
-One second.

97
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,750
Nana? Have you been bingeing again?

98
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:43,791
Mom.

99
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,958
Can I sleepover tonight, by the way?
It would be so nice.

100
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,708
-Tonight is not so good.
-Nana.

101
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
-So, at it again.
-Yes.

102
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,541
It takes forever.

103
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,625
Yes, it does.
Nana taught me how to use it.

104
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,833
With patience, the coffee turns out great.

105
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:06,916
Are you a doctor?

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,208
Physiotherapist.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,625
I help pregnant women
with pain management.

108
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:17,833
In my day, we sucked it up.
I had chronic pelvic pain with you.

109
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:21,166
-It was hell!
-That sounds tough.

110
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,333
Pelvic pain--

111
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,833
Søren, did you want coffee?

112
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:30,291
No, go ahead. It's fine.
I'll just get some water.

113
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:32,875
And…

114
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,125
-See you later.
-Yes.

115
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,416
See you.

116
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,791
Are you dating him?

117
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,166
Sometimes.

118
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,416
Oh, I see.

119
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,541
What does that mean?

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,833
Nothing.

121
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:57,583
-Just tell me what you mean?
-Nothing.

122
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,666
He seems sweet, but a little boring.

123
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,166
-You do see that, don't you?
-No, I…

124
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,083
-I wasn't in love with your dad but--
-Mom, stop.

125
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,125
She can't just waltz in sequins.
It's just odd.

126
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:19,708
It's also funny as hell.
It is. It's funny.

127
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,375
She's not like everybody else.

128
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,166
Being a mom doesn't come naturally to her.

129
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,208
I do sense that she's not always,

130
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,375
you know,

131
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,875
there for you in the classical sense.

132
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,666
She once said that she wished
she'd had an abortion, but--

133
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:42,125
-What?
-That she almost had an abortion.

134
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,500
You can't just say that.
She thought you should know that, or?

135
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,166
-My odd mom.
-It's good you're seeing Søren tonight.

136
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,958
-Well, now I'm not.
-Why not?

137
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,041
She asked to stay over.

138
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:00,083
You can still go out with him.
Yes, you can.

139
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,333
It'll be great.

140
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:16,333
-Nana, do you have a screwdriver?
-What?

141
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,875
We need to loosen this so it
can go around and onto the right side.

142
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,416
It shouldn't go on that side.

143
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
So you can put it down.

144
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,166
-But it's the leg of it.
-Yes, of course, it is.

145
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,333
-It has to go around.
-No. it doesn't.

146
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,208
You'll have to show me what you mean.

147
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:38,041
-Why are you taking it out?
-So you can sleep on it.

148
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,625
The mattress needs to go here. Look.

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,916
Oh, dear…

150
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,166
Mom… Jesus.

151
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,291
Did you think you had
to sleep under the bed?

152
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,666
You should get some color up on the walls.

153
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,833
-I'll get you a duvet.
-Some bookshelves would be nice.

154
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,541
Damn it, it's way too soft.

155
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,000
-Maybe we can sleep in your bed?
-No.

156
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,500
That wouldn't be nice.

157
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:22,666
-I don't take up much space.
-It wouldn't be nice for anyone.

158
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,083
I just don't sleep well with my feet out.

159
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,833
How about you move up?

160
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,541
If I move up here…
No, I can't do that, it's--

161
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:37,791
-Mom, it's a bed--
-I feel like I'm going to tip over--

162
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,791
-Your head is supposed to be there--
-If my head is up there--

163
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,083
Fine. Take my bed, I'll sleep there.

164
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,625
-No, honey. That's not--
-Take my bed, I'll sleep there.

165
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,166
-It's fine, I'll sleep there.
-Okay, if you say so.

166
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,000
-Good. Now go to your room.
-Come.

167
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,666
Let's sit here for a moment. Come.

168
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,250
We can sit for a moment. Right?

169
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,250
-And what?
-Say goodbye to the day and stuff.

170
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,583
Sure.

171
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,541
Is this blood test 100% accurate?

172
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,916
Yes. It's sensitive to pregnancy hormones.

173
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,583
Much more so than the home tests.

174
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,791
There's no doubt.

175
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,250
You're pregnant. Congratulations,

176
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,333
I don't want it.

177
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,833
It…

178
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,500
It can be overwhelming
when it finally happens

179
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,208
after trying for such a long time.

180
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,375
Tobias left me.

181
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:43,291
He met someone at work.

182
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm really sorry.

183
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,083
Yes.

184
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,166
Do you perform abortions?

185
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,208
No, we don't.

186
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,125
But

187
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,916
I encourage you…

188
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,541
to take some time and think it through.

189
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,666
This is no small thing.

190
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,666
In a couple of years…

191
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,625
…Tobias won't mean anything anymore.

192
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,958
You'll have a very different
kind of love in your arms.

193
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,333
-Do you want a glass of water?
-Yes, please.

194
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:38,916
I'm not keeping it.

195
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,500
I can't.

196
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,666
Fucking asshole.

197
00:13:56,166 --> 00:14:00,416
-Helle Svane speaking.
-Mads Knudsen, reporter from BT.

198
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,791
I have a few questions.
Are you the one to talk to?

199
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:10,166
That depends on the topic.

200
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:16,250
We have a source who says
she was wrongfully inseminated.

201
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:20,291
You allegedly used the wrong sperm.
Do you wish to comment?

202
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,208
Who are you again?

203
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,500
-The one in the upper right corner?
-Yes, that's a good one.

204
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,291
-Nana?
-Yes?

205
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:40,583
There's a gentleman at the reception
who'd like to talk to you.

206
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:54,791
Hi.

207
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,458
How did it go?

208
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,875
-It went well. It's fine.
-Good.

209
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,625
-You're fine. That's great.
-I'm fine.

210
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,791
Yes. Thanks for the flowers,
the text messages and--

211
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,041
-You're welcome. And the candy.
-And the candy.

212
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,041
What are you doing here?

213
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:19,958
I…

214
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,833
had a meeting with the sperm bank.

215
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:27,583
They've lost some of my deposit.
Which is pretty crazy.

216
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,958
That's really crazy.

217
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,791
-Yeah.
-And they haven't found it?

218
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,416
No, or I don't think so.

219
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,000
-They offered me money, but--
-Yeah, that's not…

220
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,083
But I do have some swimmers left
in storage, as they say.

221
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,458
-Okay.
-Yeah, it's…

222
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,791
Do you have a minute?

223
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,458
-Shall we go out in the yard?
-Yes.

224
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,583
-Okay.
-Okay.

225
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,708
We obviously take what happened
extremely seriously.

226
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:09,333
We've addressed the situation
with our client and…

227
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,500
What happened was due to human error and…

228
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:22,375
the employee in question
doesn't work here anymore.

229
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,250
Yes.

230
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,625
I'm really sorry.

231
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,750
We'll figure something out, okay?

232
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah.

233
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,833
So when are you leaving?

234
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:03,583
I haven't decided yet.
Or I had, but then I changed my mind.

235
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,208
Why?

236
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,750
I thought about us a little bit.
Or a lot. I thought about us a lot.

237
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,000
Okay.

238
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,875
After all this health stuff
I've just been thinking a lot.

239
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:27,958
There must be a reason
we've randomly run into each other twice.

240
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,708
You've always believed in coincidence.

241
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,041
The world must be telling us something.

242
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,458
And what's it saying?

243
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,250
-I don't want you to disappear again.
-I won't.

244
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,375
I don't want to feel like that again.

245
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,000
You won't.

246
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,458
I'm not going anywhere.

247
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,875
-I waited in the airport for ten hours.
-I know.

248
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:12,625
I know.

249
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,375
I was on my way,
I'd packed all my stuff and I…

250
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,250
Then I just couldn't…

251
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,750
It really wasn't because…

252
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,500
I wasn't in love with you.
Because I really was.

253
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,250
I still am.

254
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,875
A lot actually.

255
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,541
I'm really happy you're saying "again".

256
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,916
Really? That's amazing.

257
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,875
I'll come right over. Yes, I will.

258
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,083
Okay.

259
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,250
See you shortly. Great.

260
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,166
Okay. Bye.

261
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,000
Hey, Simone.

262
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,541
I just got the best news.

263
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:42,333
I'm going to be a dad.
Yeah, or whatever you call it.

264
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:49,041
I wasn't aware you knew. Nana told me.

265
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,250
Congratulations. That's just fantastic.

266
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,208
Did you just talk to her?

267
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,000
No…

268
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,958
I just got the Border Collie pup…

269
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,541
…that I was on a waiting list for.

270
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,750
A Border Collie, yes.

271
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,958
What's up with Nana?

272
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,958
When do you want kids?

273
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,583
You're so stupid.

274
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:31,958
-But really, when do you want kids?
-What kind of question is that?

275
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,208
Do you want children?

276
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,416
Yes.

277
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,458
Yes, I do.

278
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,583
Do you?

279
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,708
Maybe it isn't such a bad idea

280
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,166
with family and house and children.

281
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,250
With you.

282
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,500
Excuse me, with whom?

283
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,125
-With you.
-I can't hear you.

284
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,833
-Who do you want all that with?
-You. With you.

285
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,083
I just talked to Simone,
and she said that…

286
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,291
Is it true that you're…

287
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,583
Are we going to be parents?

288
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,666
Excuse me? Are we what?

289
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,125
So you're not pregnant?

290
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,291
-You're pregnant?
-No.

291
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,416
Yes.

292
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,166
But…

293
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,291
But what?

294
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:45,666
You can't exactly say it like that.
It's not as simple as all that.

295
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,583
-So Simone lied?
-Can we talk later?

296
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:53,625
-No, is it mine or what?
-I'll call you later, Søren.

297
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,708
Can I call you later, please?

298
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,583
No. I don't think so.
Not even close, Nana.

299
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:06,291
Wait. Let me explain!
I know it's super weird!

300
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,416
-Yes, it's fucking weird.
-It's not--

301
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,583
-So, you're not having a child with--
-Søren. No.

302
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,208
There's nothing between me and Søren.

303
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,541
We hooked up a few times,
it meant nothing, okay?

304
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,500
Okay, interesting.

305
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:22,333
-You're the one I want.
-So you're not having his child.

306
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,166
-No!
-But you are pregnant.

307
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,083
It's…

308
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,166
It's not that simple.

309
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,000
-It's fucking simple, are you pregnant?
-Yes.

310
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,875
We don't see each other for seven years,
and then you ask me if I want a child.

311
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,000
But you're already pregnant?

312
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,041
-That's not how it is.
-So how is it?

313
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:48,875
So how is it?

314
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,166
CALL ME! SIMONE

315
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,041
IUI - M.DAHL - 3871 - 1

316
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,000
Let me just get this straight.

317
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,791
…and you ask him
if he wants to have kids with you.

318
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,375
Can you go downstairs and…

319
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,291
…lock up.

320
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,333
If I set off the alarm,
you're paying the fine.

321
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:12,375
What the hell did you tell Søren?
I told you not to tell--

322
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:15,333
Nana, I got fired.

323
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,041
You what?

324
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,416
Did you go into the sperm bank that night?

325
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,666
Did you steal the sperm?

326
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,458
Was it you?

327
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,125
Just be honest.

328
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:43,166
-I…
-Please just be honest for once.

329
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,708
-Please.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

330
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:55,750
Right.

331
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,291
Here you go.

332
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:19,416
It's time for some music. Lise, go ahead.

333
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,750
I can't imagine anywhere I'd rather be,

334
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,166
or anyone I'd rather sing to.

335
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,083
So here it is.

336
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:38,333
Every person has a secret friend

337
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:45,541
Something we don't share
But keep to ourselves

338
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:50,000
But dear, if the truth must come out

339
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:54,791
You are the most beautiful to me

340
00:26:56,666 --> 00:27:00,291
I think that's what they call love

341
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:10,458
You make the sky turn blue
I always think of you

342
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:14,291
Without you the day is dull and grey

343
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:18,708
Yes, you bring me smiles of joy

344
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:21,375
I've been struck by Cupid's arrow

345
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:24,208
You are my greatest love

346
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:27,500
Forever

347
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:33,625
Even when you're far away from me

348
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:40,833
We are connected
The heart finds its way

349
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:45,208
I have a thousand kisses for you

350
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:52,333
Because we will never be apart

351
00:27:54,125 --> 00:28:00,166
You make the sky turn blue
I always think of you

352
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,875
Without you the day is dull and grey

353
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:08,916
Yes, you bring smiles of joy

354
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,583
I've been struck by Cupid's arrow
