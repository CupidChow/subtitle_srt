1
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:54,541
Fuck.

2
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,583
IUI - M.DAHL - 3871 - 1

3
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,666
No, I hear you…

4
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,166
-But…
-Can you look at this?

5
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,916
Wait a second. That's great.

6
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:50,125
-I hear you.
-You don't have to keep saying that.

7
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,666
-I'm just saying we have a problem.
-Yeah, it's… Yeah.

8
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,166
-Do we agree that we both have a problem?
-Yeah, we do.

9
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,666
-Hi.
-Hi.

10
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,708
What is the owner
of the sperm bank doing here?

11
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:04,333
Well, he's saying I forgot to set
the alarm, and someone broke in.

12
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,166
-I slept on the sofa. The cleaner woke me.
-Fuck, I'm sorry!

13
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,000
Sorry about what?

14
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,666
-What?
-What?

15
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:14,833
Why are you sorry?

16
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,166
Can you go downstairs and lock up?

17
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,375
No.

18
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,208
Fuck. This is fucked.

19
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,625
I don't remember anything after we danced.

20
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,375
-Nana, I tried to get a hold of you.
-Yeah?

21
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,083
Jannick is pretty wound up,
and you can handle him.

22
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,083
No…

23
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,000
Jannick?

24
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,208
Jannick.

25
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,958
Number 31 in line.
Stupid insurance company.

26
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,333
-Hi, Nana.
-Hi, Jannick.

27
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:47,250
-Could you explain to Nana…
-What's that smell? Is that booze?

28
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,916
-It's just--
-Hand sanitizer.

29
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,208
Jannick, could you explain to Nana
what the situation is.

30
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,166
She's our union representative, too.

31
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,708
So if there's a problem with Simone,
Nana needs to be told.

32
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:04,416
When I came this morning, the alarm
wasn't on, and somebody had broken in.

33
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,750
That's awful.

34
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, and Simone was on cleaning duty.
She's supposed to turn it on or off.

35
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:14,000
But I'm absolutely sure that I did.

36
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,125
So you say. Are you going to pay
if anything's stolen?

37
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,208
Jannick, let me just ask you…
Is anything missing?

38
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,416
Computers, furniture?

39
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,166
Who cares?
There's sperm worth millions here!

40
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,083
Do you think someone would steal sperm?

41
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,291
I mean…

42
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,833
Of course nobody steals sperm.

43
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,708
That would be a pretty weird thing to do.

44
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,208
That would be…

45
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,458
Carsten?

46
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,125
-Carsten?
-Yeah?

47
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,333
Carsten, tell them
what you found this morning.

48
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,916
Well, the place clearly
didn't look the same.

49
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,958
It didn't take long to conclude
that we'd had an intruder.

50
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,458
How?

51
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,666
What do you base that on?

52
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,708
That for example.

53
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,083
-This isn't usually like this, right?
-It's never been loose like that.

54
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,375
No, it's usually down.
Don't pull it up again.

55
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,375
And that's a bad thing?

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,375
-There's also the picture…
-No need to talk about that.

57
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,541
No.

58
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,791
And it can't be a technical glitch?

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,958
If only that was it. Come, I'll show you.

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,625
-Come along.
-They heard me, Carsten.

61
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,500
It's okay.

62
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,291
This lid and two other lids…

63
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,416
They are a little loose
when I came in this morning.

64
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:51,041
Don't you open and close
the lids all the time?

65
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,416
Sure, but we screw them on tight.

66
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,583
Always.

67
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,958
So you're afraid someone tampered
with the containers or…

68
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,500
We need to involve the police,
and right now.

69
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,208
If that's what you think,
then I think you should call them.

70
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,125
What is the number?

71
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,916
Hold on a second,
I just can't help thinking about

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,416
that sperm bank in Vejle.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,791
Their inventory was a mess.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,750
-Central Jutland Sperm Technique?
-Precisely.

75
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,750
A huge story.

76
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,833
It was all over the news.

77
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:29,250
-But everything was in order, right?
-Yes.

78
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,291
But the story had broken, so…

79
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,958
They lost all their clients
even though the case was solved.

80
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,791
Bankrupt.

81
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,041
A thought just hit me.

82
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,833
Let's just keep this under the radar.

83
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,708
How long will it take to do
an inventory count?

84
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,750
If we count all straws in every freezer,

85
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,583
-Yeah.
-double-check them with the register…

86
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:01,250
-How long, Carsten?
-and cross-check with the paper backup.

87
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,500
Oh, dear…

88
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,625
It could take months.

89
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,958
-You've got four weeks max.
-Four weeks max is fine.

90
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,375
-Helle, I want to talk to you.
-Great.

91
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:12,916
Right.

92
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,125
Here you go.

93
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,791
MATHIAS, SORRY IT ENDED SO ABRUPTLY.
HOPE WE CAN MEET FOR A DRINK,

94
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:43,916
OR FOR COFFEE BEFORE YOU LEAVE. LOVE, N.

95
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,833
I'm happy you were there.

96
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,833
Jannick can be a bit scary.

97
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:51,750
Yeah.

98
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,166
He can be a bit much.

99
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,916
So this is where you're hiding.

100
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,166
How are you?

101
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,208
It was a tough way to start the day.

102
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,125
Yeah.

103
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,958
That's understandable.

104
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,833
And a really bad situation for me as boss.

105
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,125
I'm sure Jannick will come around.

106
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,125
-Nothing happened.
-We don't know that.

107
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,083
No.

108
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:23,500
The sperm bank is our main partner.
If their business suffers, ours suffers.

109
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,625
It's like a body.

110
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:29,375
Right? If you cut the right arm off,
the left one isn't indifferent.

111
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,750
-No.
-Right.

112
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:36,250
-What are you thinking?
-I really don't know what happened.

113
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,541
Fuck. Say it now.

114
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,875
You'll say it now. Now you'll say it.

115
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:45,208
Say it now. You can't just keep
it to yourself, it's completely fucked.

116
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,708
I take full responsibility,
but I don't know…

117
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,625
We all make mistakes and it's okay.

118
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,291
But only this once, okay?

119
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,541
See you up there.

120
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:05,500
I just can't get fired. I can't afford to…

121
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,583
You won't get fired.

122
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,833
Just let Carsten do the inventory count.

123
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,791
Everything's going to be fine.

124
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,208
Didn't I lock the door?

125
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,625
Apparently not.

126
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,250
PHARMACY

127
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,250
Number 57.

128
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,000
One Levodonna, please.

129
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,000
Sorry?

130
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,041
A Levodonna.

131
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,333
A morning after pill.

132
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,916
Thanks, I know what it is.

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,833
Right.

134
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,833
-It's best to be certain.
-Sure.

135
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,291
Don't worry about the name, it's the same…

136
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,208
It's fine.

137
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,208
It's the same product.

138
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,583
And you know, you have to take it
as soon after intercourse as possible.

139
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,250
Yes.

140
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,958
And the further from ovulation the better.

141
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,041
Great. Can I pay?

142
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:15,333
But if you're close to ovulation,
they don't work as well.

143
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,416
I'd like to pay.

144
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,041
I just want to inform you.

145
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,375
We don't recommend this as contraception.

146
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,791
-It's 117.5 kroner.
-Yes.

147
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,666
-It's called Frivelle, remember that.
-Thank you.

148
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,291
-Bye.
-Bye.

149
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:37,958
Nana?

150
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,708
Hi.

151
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,666
Also sneaking out during lunch?

152
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,708
Oh, yes, I just needed…

153
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,666
-A treatment? Hair?
-Yes. Hair.

154
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,833
-Shampoo. For the hair.
-Okay.

155
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,458
Number 59.

156
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,333
-That's me.
-See you up there.

157
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,625
I'm so happy I can help.

158
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,708
It means a lot that I can do this for you.

159
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,708
Yeah.

160
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,833
I think Mom will be proud.

161
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,000
She thinks we never agree on anything.

162
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,291
Well, there's a difference
between donating an egg

163
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,666
and sharing a toy train.

164
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,916
-It's going to be great.
-Yes.

165
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,916
Is there a bathroom I can use?

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,416
Down the hall on your left… Right.

167
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Thanks.

168
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,000
I have a stupid question.

169
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,416
Now that it's my sister's egg

170
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,000
and I'm only contributing with my uterus…

171
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,833
Technically speaking,
will she be the mother or…

172
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,583
The uterus does about 1/3 of the job.

173
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,416
So without your uterus

174
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,166
no baby would be born, and your uterus
also decides what genes to activate.

175
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,541
So you could call it
great teamwork between you two.

176
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,750
Right.

177
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,625
You both have to feel okay about it, okay?

178
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,541
It's a big decision.

179
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:53,833
NO, WE PROBABLY WON'T HAVE TIME TO MEET.
BUT NICE SEEING YOU. LOVE, MATHIAS

180
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,458
Should we start?

181
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,541
Yeah.

182
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,125
Great. You just need to relax.

183
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,250
So, you still haven't heard
from Mr. Lara Croft?

184
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,166
Mathias?

185
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,416
Great joke, right?

186
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,250
Funny. Very funny.

187
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,041
No, I think he's back in the jungle.

188
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:18,125
Don't forget there are
plenty of fish in the sea.

189
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,833
Right?

190
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:24,708
-There's this great app called Tinder.
-We've had this conversation before.

191
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,833
Sure, but Mathias is in the past.

192
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,916
You've got to get back on the horse.

193
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,666
Who knows how many wonderful men
are out there on the savannah.

194
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,833
You're full of
animal metaphors today, huh?

195
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,500
I just think you need to be open.

196
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,333
-Got it?
-Keep going…

197
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,375
This far back?

198
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,500
Right here. Like that.

199
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,458
-It should…
-It's just lying there like a sausage.

200
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,750
That's not a sausage.

201
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,875
-Good morning.
-Nana, come here.

202
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,833
Can't you…

203
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,791
-Where should we put this?
-Yeah.

204
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,750
It's not a surprise if you put it there.

205
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:24,666
No, that…

206
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,708
-Hi Nana.
-Hi Carsten.

207
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,791
I won't make it to the birthday party.

208
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,375
I'm still busy counting sperm straws.

209
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,750
-Smart.
-But where do we put our present?

210
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,583
-On the gift table.
-It's a surveillance camera.

211
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,208
Okay. Great.

212
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,666
I got three for the sperm bank.

213
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,291
Then we got this one for free,
or as a bonus.

214
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,333
There's no such thing as free,
so probably a bonus.

215
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,916
Terrific.

216
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,833
-Think I can have some cake?
-I'm sure you can.

217
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,875
Relax. He'll never know.

218
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,958
It's one sperm straw.
Just one, that's nothing.

219
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,916
He'll never find out. He'll never find…

220
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,375
Fuck. What the hell did I eat?

221
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,666
Hi. Sorry about the delay.

222
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,291
We're arranging a party for our boss
who's turning 50.

223
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,833
I had to help decorate.

224
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,833
No worries. We've only just sat down.

225
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:32,083
I'm really sorry your first
IVF treatment didn't work out.

226
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,625
I suggest we change to another
egg-stimulating hormone.

227
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,041
-What does that mean, exactly?
-It's something we do

228
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,083
if we suspect the first hormones aren't

229
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,500
activating Christina's ovaries
to mature the eggs fast enough.

230
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,833
I just think
we should try something new. Already.

231
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,625
That sounds wonderful.

232
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,333
Well, if you have faith in it.

233
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,708
We really need a bit of luck soon or…

234
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,666
We just need things to go our way.

235
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,416
Well, we're not giving up.

236
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,041
Or I'm not giving up.

237
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,041
Right now I really just want
to feel nauseous again.

238
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,333
Last time, we made it to
week eight or nine before we lost it.

239
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:29,083
So I did experience
the nausea for a few weeks.

240
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:33,166
But because it's a sign,

241
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,791
I was just overjoyed
whenever I had to throw up.

242
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:42,666
Nausea.

243
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,125
Fuck.

244
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,291
PREGNANCY TEST

245
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:03,166
Well, you could help.
But if you don't like my idea…

246
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,041
Nana?

247
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:47,958
Fuck.

248
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,833
May Helle live a long life

249
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,125
And get her wishes fulfilled

250
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,833
With delicious chocolate

251
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:04,000
And cake as well

252
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,291
Thank you.

253
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:10,625
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you so much.

254
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,958
Did you remember a gift?

255
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,833
Shit. I didn't see you.

256
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,958
I didn't mean to scare you.

257
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,166
It's fine, I've just…

258
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,291
had a bit of a…

259
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,625
-Can I hold you?
-…crazy day.

260
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,958
-I knew it would go haywire!
-Easy, I'll hold you.

261
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,625
Was the kayak your idea?

262
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,416
-Here we go! We're turning the kayak!
-No, stop! Stop!

263
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:41,333
It was definitely not my idea.
She's never going to use it.

264
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,541
-Oh my.
-Thank you so much.

265
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,291
I really don't think so either.

266
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,375
-Well done, honey.
-Thanks.

267
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,416
Okay.

268
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,750
I'll make it short.

269
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,583
I want to thank you all.
From the bottom of my heart.

270
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,333
You're welcome.

271
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,041
Turning 50 is easy when you have
the best staff in the world.

272
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:09,458
And associates, Jannick.
We're good, right?

273
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:14,916
But today actually isn't
the most important day to me.

274
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,916
I can't see a thing.

275
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,458
No.

276
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,416
What really matters to me,
is any kind of day.

277
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:28,708
When you stop by during a break
or at a meeting

278
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,083
and ever so quietly say,

279
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,166
"Helle, thanks for your support."

280
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,208
"Thanks for having my back."

281
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,666
"Thanks for being my boss."

282
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,666
I wake up every morning thinking

283
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,458
that what you give me,
I give you ten-thousandfold back.

284
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,583
Can I get you anything?

285
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,291
I need to go the bathroom, one second.

286
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,708
Because you are what matters. You matter…

287
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:01,333
I really mean that. You are what matters.

288
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:06,083
Knowing that I'm there
for every single one of you

289
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:10,875
and you know who you are,
and I know who I am, thanks to you.

290
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,458
Sorry, I'm tearing up.

291
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,958
Before this leads to water damage,
let's just say cheers.

292
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,958
Let's do it.

293
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,375
-Cheers. And thank you.
-Cheers.

294
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,875
Congratulations Helle!

295
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:32,958
Congrats.

296
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,791
Congrats to me for being pregnant

297
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,750
with Mathias' stolen sperm. Dammit.

298
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,625
I wonder if I can bring the kid to prison?

299
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Hi, Mom.

300
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,708
Hi honey. You called?

301
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:59,875
That was two or three weeks ago.

302
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,500
I have been so busy.
Audiences never get tired of me!

303
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,125
Was it something important?

304
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,500
No. It…

305
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:16,666
It really wasn't anything special.

306
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,041
-Oh, well. Remember you can always call.
-Yes.

307
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,291
Got to go. Bye.

308
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,875
Now we just have to find the little heart.

309
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:04,541
Is that good or?

310
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:10,166
It's good, really good. Sorry.

311
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,333
-It's exactly how it's supposed to be.
-Wow.

312
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,208
A tiny heart.

313
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,541
-Do you want to talk to it? The belly?
-Not now.

314
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,625
Hello in there.

315
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:29,916
I'll remove this.

316
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,291
Give me your hand, honey.

317
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,208
Just say something.

318
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,625
I don't know what to say.

319
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,083
Welcome.

320
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,208
-It should get to know your voice.
-I know.

321
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:49,041
-Say a bit more. Anything.
-I don't want to right now.

322
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,083
-Why not?
-I just don't.

323
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,500
-Come on, honey, say something.
-Not right now!

324
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,166
Maja…

325
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:01,708
Seriously?

326
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,333
I just think that…

327
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:16,708
This is such a big thing, and it's like
I'm just watching from the sideline.

328
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,291
Well, you kind of are.

329
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,416
But the sideline is for all those
who are rooting for her.

330
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:28,666
And they are very important.

331
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:33,666
I just feel a bit more
on the sideline, because…

332
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,125
in theory it's not even my child.

333
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,666
Because you don't share the same genes,
you mean?

334
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,166
Lots of people feel like that…

335
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,375
until they have kids.

336
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,625
At my house, I'm the one on the sideline.

337
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,250
My wife is…

338
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,625
the most awesome mom to our boys.

339
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,458
She's the favorite mom
even though I carried them.

340
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:15,750
Really?

341
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:22,958
And the way they laugh,
walk and everything…

342
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:26,958
they take after her.

343
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,708
A family can be a lot of things.

344
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,041
Dad, mom, second mom and all that…

345
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:39,000
When that child is born,
it'll 1000% be yours.

346
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:43,291
And you'll be its mother 1000%.

347
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,791
-It's a cool title.
-Very cool title.

348
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:52,041
-I'd better get back to Tiff.
-Good idea.

349
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,375
Sure, a family can be a lot of things…

350
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,583
but poor child that only
gets me as its family.

351
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,666
Just me.

352
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,458
A fuck up of a mom.

353
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:20,125
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Søren.

354
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,083
-Anja.
-Hej.

355
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:25,083
-Welcome.
-Thanks, I have an appointment at 1 p.m.

356
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,041
-Yeah, you're right.
-Yes.

357
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,541
Of course I could find a dad.

358
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:33,416
A nice, handsome dad. Hot Phys dad.

359
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,166
…follow her to the room?

360
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,125
-Sure.
-I'll be right there.

361
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,708
Thanks a lot.

362
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,208
-Hi.
-Hi.

363
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,541
-This is for you.
-Okay. Thanks.

364
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:48,958
No problem.

365
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:57,958
I just wanted to say sorry for not
replying to your mushroom soup invitation.

366
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:05,000
The restaurant has all these
homegrown greens.

367
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,791
Ready for dessert?

368
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:12,041
Here you have a white brownie
with chocolate crunch, sea buckthorn puree

369
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:13,750
with hand-picked, candied cherries.

370
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:15,750
-Thanks.
-Enjoy.

371
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,250
-Thanks.
-Sounds great. Thanks a lot.

372
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:20,958
So hand-picked cherries?

373
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,708
I think so?

374
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:23,958
How else would you pick them?

375
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:29,416
With your feet of course. Or teeth.

376
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:35,458
Whoever ties a knot first
on this hand-picked cherry stalk

377
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,750
with their tongue is treated…

378
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,166
-But you can't.
-Will be treated to dinner.

379
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,208
One, two, three…

380
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,041
Damn!

381
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,833
-I can't believe you can do that.
-Unbelievable, right?

382
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:21,541
It is pretty unbelievable.

383
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,666
How did you learn that?

384
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,666
Do you want it?

385
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,583
Can I have it?

386
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,083
Gee, thanks.

387
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,625
Pretty embarrassing,
you're such a bad loser.

388
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,583
I hate losing.

389
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:38,416
And it's super embarrassing to admit.
But what about you?

390
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,166
What's your big secret?

391
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:17,083
Sorry, I'm sorry!

392
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:21,291
-What are you doing?
-I'm so sorry!

393
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:27,000
-I didn't see you, I'm sorry.
-Right then. Come on.

394
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,291
Let's get out of here.

395
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,833
Fuck! Mathias!

396
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,208
-Nana.
-Shit!

397
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:37,333
Sorry.

398
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,541
Seriously, I just broke a dog.

399
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,416
It looks fine to me.

400
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,375
Hi… Whoops, sorry.

401
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,416
-Hi.
-Hi.

402
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:54,833
Sorry, did I walk to Guatemala
instead of going home?

403
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,250
No, I just didn't leave anyway.
Long story.

404
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:01,625
Okay.

405
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,541
-Yeah.
-Then…

406
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,416
Welcome to Copenhagen.
