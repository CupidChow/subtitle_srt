If it weren't for your dad,

11
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:05,084
I wouldn't waste my time.

12
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:07,324
Then just ignore me.

13
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,885
I taught all three
of your older brothers.

14
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:11,565
If you actually listen to me,

15
00:01:11,884 --> 00:01:12,685
you'll definitely

16
00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:14,084
achieve top rank in a month,

17
00:01:14,244 --> 00:01:15,364
and be a martial artist.

18
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:18,644
You do want people
to stop calling you loser, right?

19
00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:19,804
Whatever.

20
00:01:19,884 --> 00:01:20,605
I'm bored.

21
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:21,845
I'm heading out.

22
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:28,325
If you can take three moves,

23
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:29,724
I'll let you go.

24
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:35,644
Bring it on.

25
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:38,444
No, Young Master, you can't!

26
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:39,244
Master Xiao is the

27
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:40,724
top swordsman in Tianxuan City.

28
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:44,405
Alright, let's play around today.

29
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,524
Watch the sword.

30
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:03,925
First move.

31
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:05,284
An adult man can't even

32
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:06,685
hold a sword properly?

33
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:07,845
Pathetic.

34
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:08,524
(Her moves)

35
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:10,045
(have piqued my interest.)

36
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:11,444
Again.

37
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:18,765
Second move.

38
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:19,964
One last move.

39
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:33,885
Brilliant!

40
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:35,084
Four moves.

41
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:36,165
I give you one freebie.

42
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:38,165
Can I go now, Master Xiao?

43
00:02:38,684 --> 00:02:39,265
Nope.

44
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:40,124
Stay here.

45
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:41,325
One more time.

46
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:00,005
Thank you.

47
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:01,404
You, stop.

48
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:03,205
What now?

49
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:05,205
You're not gonna break your promise,

50
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:06,005
are you?

51
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:06,925
We said three moves.

52
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:08,244
I took four.

53
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:09,605
What else do you want?

54
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:11,364
Okay, fine.

55
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:13,804
You won that bet

56
00:03:13,964 --> 00:03:14,964
about the three moves.

57
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:17,045
Didn't think

58
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:18,885
you were that good with the sword.

59
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:20,964
Guess the heavens are smiling on you.

60
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:22,524
If you became my student,

61
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:24,285
and trained hard,

62
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,885
you could totally crush anyone

63
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,404
your level

64
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:28,684
with that sword of yours.

65
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:31,564
So,

66
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:32,844
what's your deal?

67
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:35,925
Do you want to be my student?

68
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:37,249
Huh?

69
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,285
If you want,

70
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:41,605
I'll take you on as my last disciple

71
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:44,364
and teach you everything I know,

72
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:45,605
no holding back.

73
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:46,885
But the prerequisite is,

74
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:48,244
you got to do what I say.

75
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:49,244
No questions.

76
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:50,404
Just take the training.

77
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:51,644
In three years,

78
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:53,885
you'll be a whole new person,
guaranteed.

79
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:57,524
You want me as your student?

80
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,404
Awesome, Young Master!

81
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:02,124
If Master Xiao takes you,

82
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:04,564
you'll be super powerful!

83
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:05,564
Then you go.

84
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:06,925
I...

85
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:09,485
Young Master, stop joking.

86
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:11,524
You think a Fifth-rank Grandmaster

87
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:13,124
isn't good enough for you?

88
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:14,325
That's not it.

89
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:15,605
It's just...

90
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:16,605
Look, I know

91
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:18,885
I only took your three brothers
as students

92
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,404
and left you out.

93
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:22,364
My bad. Didn't see how good you were.

94
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:24,405
I apologize.

95
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:25,405
Today I see

96
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:26,804
a new side of you.

97
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,684
You aren't a lost cause.

98
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:29,965
Here's your chance.

99
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:31,925
Yes or no?

100
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:33,045
No.

101
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:34,764
You!

102
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:36,045
I'm apologizing here!

103
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:37,244
Still holding a grudge?

104
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,764
Come on, Master Xiao.

105
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:40,405
You...

106
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,444
I'm way too weak.

107
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:42,845
If I become your student,

108
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:44,124
I'd just embarrass you.

109
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:45,764
So,

110
00:04:45,965 --> 00:04:47,725
I'm gonna pass on the student thing.

111
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,324
Young Master.

112
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:53,965
Wait for me.

113
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,485
I'll conquer you one day.

114
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:01,684
I wanna get some candied hawthorns.

115
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:02,845
Agreed.

116
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:08,045
What's that?

117
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:09,804
The Holy Land's lotus has bloomed.

118
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:10,965
Let's go see it.

119
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:11,965
Is that the Holy Fruit

120
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:13,405
that blooms once every 81 years?

121
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,485
What's special about that thing?

122
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:17,725
The Lotus Seeds in that lotus

123
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:19,324
are elixirs nurtured for 100 years.

124
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:20,804
It might help

125
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:21,845
reshape your Dantian,

126
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:23,004
making you super powerful.

127
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:24,725
That's all just a lie.

128
00:05:24,884 --> 00:05:25,444
No interest.

129
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,364
Come on, let's go.

130
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:27,725
Young Master, let's go.

131
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:29,324
This Holy Bodhi Tree

132
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:31,324
blooms only once every 81 years.

133
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:32,764
That's so rare.

134
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:34,925
I wonder who will be lucky enough

135
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:35,805
to get the Holy Fruit.

136
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,045
Exactly.

137
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:38,244
Strange signs in the sky.

138
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:40,764
Looks like the Holy Tree is ripe.

139
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:42,244
Just waiting to bloom.

140
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:43,845
I never thought that

141
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:44,525
our generation

142
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,405
would actually witness it in full bloom.

143
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:48,204
How lucky are we!

144
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:54,605
Young Master.

145
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:55,804
Those three ladies.

146
00:05:57,884 --> 00:05:58,884
Zhao Feiyang?

147
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:03,604
Are you really as awful

148
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:04,605
as they say?

149
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:15,004
Look at you.

150
00:06:15,285 --> 00:06:17,204
Why care about those who don't care?

151
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:18,605
Let's get out of here.

152
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,925
Young Master, just a little longer.

153
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:22,004
Until the flower blooms.

154
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:23,725
Please!

155
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:25,764
Alright.

156
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:32,045
Today, the Bodhi Tree
shows signs of blooming.

157
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:33,764
(Elder Zhichan, Holy Land's Guardian)
Listen up.

158
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:35,444
Do not try to steal it.

159
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:37,525
The Holy Fruit's growing for 81 years,

160
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:39,124
and blooming now.

161
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:40,965
It's got a mind of its own.

162
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:42,444
It'll pick its master.

163
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:44,244
You may step forward.

164
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:47,285
Channel your strength
to merge with the Holy Tree.

165
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:48,684
If you're the chosen one,

166
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:50,605
it'll bloom for you.

167
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:53,364
If not, then it's just not meant to be.

168
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:54,124
Now,

169
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:55,804
try your luck!

170
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:57,564
But heads up,

171
00:06:57,764 --> 00:07:00,324
the Holy Tree is abundant of
pure Yang energy.

172
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:02,085
Anyone over twenty-nine

173
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:03,364
shouldn't try it.

174
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:04,845
By this age,

175
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,845
your yang energy starts fading.

176
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:08,444
Even if you're strong,

177
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:09,764
it'll be a waste of time.

178
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:10,884
I'm gonna try it.

179
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:19,941
(Zhang Long,
the Zhangs of Tianxuan City)

180
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:21,244
Even worse than you.

181
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:31,444
I'll try it too.

182
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,935
(Tang San, the Tangs of Tianxuan City)

183
00:07:46,444 --> 00:07:48,085
Really that hard for this tree to bloom?

184
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:50,444
What do you think?

185
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:52,925
It's not just about
connecting to the Holy Bodhi Tree

186
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:54,045
and activating its power.

187
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:56,645
You also need a solid foundation.

188
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:58,004
If your skills are weak,

189
00:07:58,405 --> 00:07:59,845
trying to make the Holy Tree bloom

190
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:02,285
is like wishing on a star.

191
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:03,764
How about

192
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:05,525
we three try our luck?

193
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:06,804
Sounds good.

194
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:07,405
Who's up first?

195
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:09,925
I'll go.

196
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:17,645
If I can get a Holy Fruit
and level up my cultivation,

197
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:19,645
maybe I can bring the Bai family back.

198
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:21,085
Come on.

199
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,605
Give me one chance.

200
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:37,525
Is that Holy Fruit about to bloom?

201
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,724
Looks like
Bai Zhi is getting some divine help.

202
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:45,925
Guess I was thinking too much.

203
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:48,245
What a pity.

204
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:50,964
This girl's gorgeous!

205
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,285
How have I never seen her before?

206
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:53,564
You're kidding.

207
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:55,484
That's Bai Zhi,
heiress of the Bai family,

208
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:57,245
one of the former Four Families
in Tianxuan.

209
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,804
I let you two down.

210
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:00,165
Don't worry about it, Bai Zhi.

211
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:02,564
Whether I or Qiushui manages to

212
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:03,925
get the Holy Tree to bloom,

213
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,564
you're getting a share of the fruit.

214
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:10,165
Thank you.
