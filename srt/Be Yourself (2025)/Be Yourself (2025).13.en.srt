=Episode 13=

10
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:07,043
Is it true

11
00:01:08,363 --> 00:01:10,003
that I'm going to die here?

12
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:12,883
No.

13
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:14,842
Darn it!

14
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:18,163
I've trained for years.

15
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:21,282
I didn't even get to slay demons,

16
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:23,922
yet I am about to die here.

17
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,002
I won't accept this.

18
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:28,562
I won't accept this!

19
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:48,202
Get lost.

20
00:01:58,282 --> 00:01:59,282
With your cultivation,

21
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:00,883
you really dared come to the 25th?

22
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:02,523
You've got quite some guts.

23
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:05,323
Are you here to find me?

24
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:10,202
Where is Wang Hui?

25
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:12,803
Did he leave you and run?

26
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:14,323
You, woman,

27
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:16,083
although you're mean,

28
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:17,483
you're not evil.

29
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:19,442
Forget it.

30
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,403
I won't blame you.

31
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,032
Ma'am,

32
00:02:28,123 --> 00:02:29,123
it's Zhao Feiyang.

33
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:30,643
(Chen Qiushui's mother)
He had to tag along

34
00:02:30,803 --> 00:02:32,083
and caused Qiushui's death.

35
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:33,322
I'm sorry

36
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:34,643
for not stopping him,

37
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:36,123
which led to this.

38
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:37,882
If anything happens,

39
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:39,363
if she suffers any harm,

40
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:41,282
even Zhao Feiyang's life
won't be enough.

41
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:42,963
I'll make the entire Zhao family pay!

42
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:44,243
You mustn't, ma'am.

43
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:46,602
The Zhaos have some standing
in Tianxuan City.

44
00:02:46,803 --> 00:02:48,683
We need to consider this carefully.

45
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:50,282
The Zhao family has standing,

46
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:51,363
so what?

47
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:53,203
Should we endure this grievance?

48
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,203
If he didn't bother us

49
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:56,923
repeatedly with the engagement,

50
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:58,643
our Qiushui

51
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:00,442
wouldn't be in this situation!

52
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:01,442
Ma'am, I...

53
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:02,683
- Ma'am...
- What do I do?

54
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:03,424
Ma'am,

55
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:04,803
stay calm.

56
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,602
Are you two dancing?

57
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:07,523
(What's going on?)

58
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:08,683
(How is he still alive?)

59
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:09,923
(He even saved Qiushui!)

60
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:11,042
Let go of her!

61
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:14,842
Qiushui!

62
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,203
Go away!

63
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:18,083
Don't worry, she's fine.

64
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:20,923
Qiushui.

65
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:24,203
Qiushui!

66
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:25,483
- Qiushui.
- Qiushui!

67
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:27,363
Qiushui,

68
00:03:28,363 --> 00:03:29,643
glad to see you're okay.

69
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:30,762
After I got out,

70
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:32,123
I've been trying to save you.

71
00:03:32,363 --> 00:03:33,643
If something truly happened,

72
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,403
I would never forgive myself.

73
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:36,442
I...

74
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:38,282
How did I get out?

75
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:41,282
Wasn't I trapped on the 25th floor?

76
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:51,002
(Could it be him?)

77
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:06,683
Godfather,

78
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,403
your chess skills are superb.

79
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:10,722
I really can't keep up with you.

80
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:14,282
You're still a bit inexperienced, boy.

81
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:15,602
You need more practice.

82
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:18,442
Where's Feiyang?

83
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:21,203
I managed to invite Master Xiao over

84
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:22,402
to teach him martial arts.

85
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:24,402
I don't know how
he offended Master Xiao.

86
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:26,202
Now she won't come back.

87
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,043
I'm really upset about this.

88
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:30,723
Godfather, don't be angry.

89
00:04:31,402 --> 00:04:33,923
I think Feiyang didn't mean it.

90
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:35,243
How about this,

91
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,043
if there's a chance,

92
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:39,002
I'll train with Feiyang.

93
00:04:39,123 --> 00:04:40,123
You?

94
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:43,043
I think that works.

95
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:44,483
When he returns,

96
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:45,803
I'll let him know.

97
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:47,723
What are you talking about?

98
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:51,562
Why does it sound like
you're talking about me?

99
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:53,603
Are you badmouthing me?

100
00:04:53,803 --> 00:04:54,803
Feiyang,

101
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:56,402
how could we

102
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:59,163
badmouth you behind your back?

103
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:00,843
We were indeed badmouthing you!

104
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:02,603
Tell us,

105
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,483
how did you offend Master Xiao?

106
00:05:04,683 --> 00:05:06,202
These days, she didn't come here,

107
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:07,363
nor leave any messages.

108
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,123
Master Xiao?

109
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:16,043
Most likely,

110
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:17,642
Master Xiao

111
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:19,522
will not visit us again.

112
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:20,283
You!

113
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:22,562
If I were stricter to you,

114
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:23,882
you wouldn't end up like this!

115
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:25,082
I...

116
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:26,163
I will kick you!

117
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:27,483
Stand still!

118
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:28,562
You!

119
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:29,603
Godfather!

120
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:30,322
I won't!

121
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:31,136
Fine.

122
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:32,082
I

123
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:33,522
now get it.

124
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:36,322
He is not going to achieve
anything great.

125
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:37,642
The coming Martial Assembly,

126
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:38,843
you don't need to attend.

127
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,082
So you don't humiliate us.

128
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:41,923
I will find someone for you.

129
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,483
Just marry some girl

130
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:45,163
and have children.

131
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:46,562
Your only purpose now

132
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:49,363
is to carry on the lineage
for the Zhao family.

133
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,762
Do I need you to find me a wife?

134
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:53,202
I have three fiancées.

135
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:54,603
Each of them is so beautiful.

136
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:57,483
Your three fiancées?

137
00:05:58,243 --> 00:05:59,962
They are way too outstanding.

138
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:01,562
After the Martial Assembly,

139
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,202
they will all

140
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,762
come to break off the engagement.

141
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,043
Don't be so sure.

142
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:07,882
What if they all fancy me?

143
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:09,123
All fancy you?

144
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:11,562
Don't mention three,

145
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:13,363
if even one of them fancies you

146
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:15,082
or takes you seriously,

147
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:16,562
I'll use your surname!

148
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:17,402
We share surname.

149
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:18,562
I mean,

150
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:20,442
I'll call you "Father"!

151
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,442
Master.

152
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:24,562
Master,

153
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,483
Miss Li Yanran is here.

154
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:27,642
What is she here for?

155
00:06:27,723 --> 00:06:30,483
She said she's here
to deliver something to Feiyang.

156
00:06:32,803 --> 00:06:34,483
Could it be a breakup letter?

157
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,962
You useless thing.

158
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:39,803
You have disgraced me!

159
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:48,402
Please.

160
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,283
Young Master Zhao,

161
00:06:57,803 --> 00:06:58,803
I hope you've been well.

162
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,123
Miss Li, good to see you.

163
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:07,522
What brings you

164
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:08,843
here today?

165
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,562
This is...?

166
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:18,923
This is a Scarlet Fruit.

167
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:20,923
A material for Revolution Pill.

168
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:22,363
I heard that

169
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:24,483
it can help martial artists
restore Dantian.

170
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:26,762
Although it is only one
of the nine materials,

171
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:28,002
I still hope

172
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:30,483
I can be of help to you.

173
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:34,363
Scarlet Fruit?

174
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:35,882
A ninth-rank herb.

175
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:38,243
This is the Li family's heirloom!

176
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:39,522
Miss Li,

177
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:40,683
to cancel the engagement,

178
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,762
this price is too high.

179
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:45,243
Miss Li,

180
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:46,603
my father is being funny.

181
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,522
Please don't mind.

182
00:07:49,322 --> 00:07:50,322
Master Zhao,

183
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:51,962
I...

184
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:53,562
I just came to deliver this thing.

185
00:07:54,442 --> 00:07:55,642
No other meanings.

186
00:07:58,522 --> 00:07:59,522
This...

187
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,522
This is really too precious.

188
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:03,123
It's not really that valuable.

189
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,723
Anyway,

190
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:08,123
we'll all be family in the future.

191
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:14,402
Family?

192
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:15,522
This...

193
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:18,762
Master!

194
00:08:18,762 --> 00:08:19,363
Deng Zhong,

195
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:21,002
am I dreaming?

196
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:22,283
Pinch me!

197
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:24,642
Master, how dare I pinch you?

198
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:26,882
I also feel like I'm dreaming.

199
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:28,082
Really?

200
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:30,082
Master,

201
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:33,322
you seemed to have made a bet
with the young master.

202
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:34,642
Me?

203
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:36,843
Son...

204
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:38,123
Forget it.

205
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:39,522
How would I dare?

206
00:08:40,843 --> 00:08:41,843
You,

207
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:43,762
what trick did you use

208
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,682
to make Miss Li be so good to you?

209
00:08:46,522 --> 00:08:47,642
I remember some time ago,

210
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:49,563
when the three of them visited together,

211
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:51,682
they were on a united front.

212
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:53,243
It's been less than a month.

213
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:55,323
How come she's changed her mind?

214
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:56,642
How would I know?

215
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,682
Maybe it's because of

216
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:02,522
my charisma.

217
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,443
Isn't that right, Chun?

218
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,603
You?

219
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:10,363
Charisma?

220
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,323
Are you kidding me?

221
00:09:13,123 --> 00:09:15,563
Anyone from Tianxuan City

222
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:17,323
would call you a loser.

223
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:20,723
And charisma?

224
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:22,363
Aren't you ashamed?

225
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:23,522
I even feel ashamed.

226
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:25,002
But the facts are right here.

227
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,443
Why don't you believe it?

228
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:27,963
You...

229
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:29,843
Wait,

230
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:33,123
are you two making a show

231
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,402
to make me happy?

232
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:36,162
No.

233
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:38,083
I have to talk to Miss Li.

234
00:09:38,682 --> 00:09:39,682
Master,

235
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,603
it's too embarrassing. You can't go.

236
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,682
Yes.

237
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,963
Son,

238
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,083
today,

239
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:54,282
you've made me look at you
in a new light.

240
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,162
But the matter with Master Xiao

241
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:57,922
is not over.

242
00:09:58,042 --> 00:09:59,682
You need to get her back.

243
00:10:00,402 --> 00:10:01,402
Got it.

244
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:02,802
I'll figure it out.
