Everyone, please disperse.

11
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:00,795
Wait.

12
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:02,316
Our young master hasn't tried yet.

13
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:03,515
- I...
- All of us,

14
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:04,876
including myself, have tried.

15
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:06,036
It didn't work.

16
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:07,916
Is it necessary

17
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,395
for him to try?

18
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:11,915
What?

19
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:13,236
You all have finished trying.

20
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:15,115
So I can't try anymore?

21
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:17,436
Everyone present today can try
except for you,

22
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:18,555
Young Master Zhao.

23
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:21,275
I've heard something.

24
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:23,115
Why not just give up?

25
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,516
So you won't be disappointed.

26
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:25,835
He's asking for trouble.

27
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:27,956
Even Elder Zhichan advised him,

28
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:29,635
but he wouldn't listen.

29
00:01:29,876 --> 00:01:30,915
Maybe

30
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:32,355
he was provoked by you, Qiushui.

31
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:34,036
But he's right.

32
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:36,876
There's no harm in trying.

33
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:39,835
Alright.

34
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:40,876
Then I'd like to see

35
00:01:41,316 --> 00:01:42,596
what tricks he can come up with.

36
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:45,355
Elder Zhichan, you've always been
a highly respected person

37
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:46,475
admired by all.

38
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:48,956
Why do your words reek of clichés?

39
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:51,115
Have you forgotten the equality for all?

40
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:52,555
Did I hear that right?

41
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:53,355
This brat...

42
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:54,876
He insulted Elder Zhichan.

43
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:56,195
Do you think

44
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,676
you're a hero because you returned

45
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:59,115
from the North Border Front?

46
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:00,796
What a boastful tone you have!

47
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:02,236
He's helpless.

48
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:04,115
First, he offended the Fourth Prince,

49
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,716
and now even Elder Zhichan.

50
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:08,596
He truly is sharp-tongued.

51
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:11,355
He bites at anyone
whenever there's a chance.

52
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:12,796
(I actually think)

53
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:15,235
(his rebellious personality)

54
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:16,556
(is quite adorable.)

55
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:18,675
(But if I say it out loud,)

56
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,795
(people might think I'm crazy.)

57
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:24,475
Well said.

58
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:26,556
That was abrupt of me.

59
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:27,996
Sorry, Young Master Zhao.

60
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:29,195
Please.

61
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:34,235
(I can test how much of my strength)

62
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,436
(has been restored.)

63
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:38,195
Young Master, go.

64
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:40,596
(It'd be a joke)

65
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,195
(if I also can't activate it.)

66
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:44,955
(I'd be embarrassed badly.)

67
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:46,355
Don't waste our time.

68
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:47,556
Try if you want to.

69
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:48,512
Exactly.

70
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,596
Right. Don't waste our time.

71
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:51,955
Hurry up.

72
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:53,996
Don't waste our time.

73
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:07,235
- It worked.
- Amazing!

74
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:08,235
- It worked.
- Amazing!

75
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,116
- It has bloomed.
- It has bloomed.

76
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,156
It really has bloomed.

77
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:21,984
How...

78
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:23,436
How could this be?

79
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:25,316
He didn't use spiritual power.

80
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:26,716
Why has it bloomed?

81
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:29,396
Young Master, you're great!

82
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:31,996
What's happening?

83
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:33,675
Many tried, and it didn't work.

84
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:34,955
Then he waved his hand,

85
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:36,235
and it just bloomed?

86
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,715
Maybe Tianxuan City's

87
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:38,716
young heroes

88
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:40,156
and the Fourth Prince

89
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:41,436
had made the Holy Fruits

90
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:42,515
almost ripe,

91
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:44,116
letting this brat benefit.

92
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,635
Congrats, Young Master Zhao.

93
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:47,755
Holy Bodhi Tree blooms for you.

94
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:50,635
Your future is surely bright

95
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:51,876
with limitless prospects!

96
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,915
Elder Zhichan, I'm flattered.

97
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:55,156
It's just luck.

98
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:56,475
There's no such thing as luck.

99
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:58,396
The tree chooses its master.
It means a lot.

100
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:00,436
Even if you aren't strong right now,

101
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:02,955
it's just a matter of time
before you rise.

102
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:05,596
Elder Zhichan, this is unfair.

103
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:07,396
He hasn't used any spiritual power.

104
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,276
Most likely, he took advantage of us.

105
00:04:09,436 --> 00:04:11,635
Is that what Your Highness thinks?

106
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:12,915
I think so too.

107
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:14,355
I am not convinced.

108
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:15,276
Me neither.

109
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:16,515
We aren't, either.

110
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:18,276
- Not convinced.
- Not convinced.

111
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:21,635
Everyone, the choice of Holy Bodhi Tree
is likely unrelated to spiritual power.

112
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:24,716
You all are talented young people
of Tianxuan City,

113
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:26,196
yet you are so jealous.

114
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,716
Don't you feel ashamed?

115
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:38,475
How annoying!

116
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:39,636
Forget it, Qiushui.

117
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:41,795
The Zhao family just suffered.

118
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:45,396
Perhaps this is Heaven
showing him mercy.

119
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:46,756
Right.

120
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:48,435
For him,

121
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,596
this can be considered a good thing.

122
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:53,196
Young Master Zhao,
please take the Lotus Seeds.

123
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:15,555
Well?

124
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:17,636
You've guarded the Bodhi tree
for many years,

125
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,235
day and night.

126
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:20,475
This is rightfully yours.

127
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,115
In that case, thank you,
Young Master Zhao.

128
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:30,636
Chun, take this.

129
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,596
If not for you insisting I try today,

130
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,115
we wouldn't have gotten these.

131
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:36,995
He gave it away?

132
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:39,596
He gave such a valuable thing
to a mere maid?

133
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,036
He's quite generous.

134
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:42,756
This Holy Fruit is so beautiful.

135
00:05:43,196 --> 00:05:44,196
I dare not take it.

136
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:45,475
It's too valuable.

137
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,596
Why not give it
to the three young madams?

138
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,355
I don't want his thing.

139
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:56,036
I do want it.

140
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:57,716
But I'm afraid

141
00:05:58,315 --> 00:05:59,435
he wouldn't give it to me.

142
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:00,516
Okay.

143
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:02,115
However,

144
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:03,355
they have three people,

145
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:04,956
and I only gave you one.

146
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:06,675
How should it be divided?

147
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:09,076
I like Bai Zhi.

148
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:10,435
I'll give it to Bai Zhi.

149
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:12,276
Alright, let's do as you say.

150
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,475
You're giving such a valuable thing

151
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:26,875
to me?

152
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:28,435
Chun insists on you having it.

153
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:29,516
You should accept it.

154
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:30,675
Thank you.

155
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:32,675
Thank you, Chun.

156
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:33,836
You're welcome.

157
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:35,076
We're family from now on.

158
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:45,596
This is for you.

159
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:47,475
It's not your place

160
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:48,716
to gift the young madams.

161
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:49,756
But...

162
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:50,875
This is an order.

163
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:56,435
Bai Zhi,

164
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,795
congrats on obtaining a Holy Lotus Seed.

165
00:06:58,956 --> 00:06:59,636
Indeed.

166
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,156
We truly envy you.

167
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:02,475
Two ladies,

168
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:04,956
I am willing to share the Holy Fruit

169
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:07,396
with both of you.

170
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:08,516
Forget it.

171
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:09,956
Since it's given to you,

172
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:10,956
just keep it well.

173
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:15,475
Chun, don't fall.

174
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,636
Young Master,

175
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,435
now that you have the Holy Fruits,

176
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:20,795
will you become extremely powerful?

177
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:22,235
I don't know.

178
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:24,235
But my father will definitely be

179
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:25,716
extremely jealous.

180
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:27,555
I'm so happy, Young Master.

181
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:29,196
Chun,

182
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:30,956
you go home first.

183
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:32,196
I'll be back soon.

184
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:33,396
Why?

185
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:36,875
Why so many questions, you brat?

186
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,036
I want to pee, all right?

187
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:39,156
Just go.

188
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:40,396
Then hurry up.

189
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,196
Come out.

190
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:00,875
Not very high in cultivation,

191
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,396
but you're good in perception.

192
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:03,956
And you're also very kind.

193
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:07,435
You let your maid escape first.

194
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:10,516
You are really a good person.

195
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:11,915
I am a good person?

196
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:13,915
Then you must be a bad person.

197
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:15,716
If you say so,

198
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:17,555
I won't object.

199
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:23,555
I am a bit reluctant to kill you.

200
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:25,115
How about this?

201
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:26,435
Don't struggle.

202
00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:30,475
I'll make your death a bit easier.

203
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:32,956
If you want to kill me,

204
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:35,115
you have to give me a reason, right?

205
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:36,435
Alright.

206
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:38,036
Let me enlighten you before you die.

207
00:08:38,516 --> 00:08:39,795
As long as you're dead,

208
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:41,876
your outsider fifth brother

209
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:43,396
can take over.

210
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:44,835
Zhao Heng.

211
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:47,195
You already know the reason.

212
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:48,996
Now

213
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,276
you can die in peace, right?

214
00:09:02,036 --> 00:09:03,435
Done.

215
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:05,075
What a pity

216
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,276
