=Episode 2=

10
00:00:58,031 --> 00:00:59,552
Greetings, foster father!

11
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:01,031
Get up now.

12
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:05,151
I heard what happened to

13
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:06,711
big brother, second brother,

14
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,232
and third brother.

15
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:10,632
(Zhao Heng, Zhao Qin's foster son)
My fault!

16
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:14,711
I should've been with them
to North Border, not Beast Valley.

17
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:16,511
Don't blame yourself, Heng.

18
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:19,832
It was just their fate.

19
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:23,151
Heng.

20
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:24,672
You just got back

21
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
and don't even recognize me?

22
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:27,832
No greetings to me?

23
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:29,392
You don't deserve it.

24
00:01:29,392 --> 00:01:30,392
What's it?

25
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,552
Even though you're foster father's
real son,

26
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:33,871
you are unworthy of it,

27
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:35,552
and you never try to improve.

28
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:38,951
You got three of our brothers
being killed in the North Border.

29
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:40,871
All you did was to save yourself.

30
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:41,632
If I were you,

31
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,272
I'd find some place to cultivate

32
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:44,431
to get strong enough

33
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:46,272
to avenge them

34
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:48,552
in the North Border.

35
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:50,752
Not like how you are now,

36
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:51,992
acting like

37
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:53,992
nothing ever happened.

38
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:55,752
You brat.

39
00:01:56,192 --> 00:01:58,192
if you had part of the guts of Heng,

40
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:00,912
I wouldn't be so worried.

41
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:04,552
If you think he's so great,

42
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:07,032
why don't you let him be your real son?

43
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:08,992
You ungrateful son!

44
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:10,231
Ungrateful son!

45
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:11,511
Look.

46
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:13,351
What's he even talking about?

47
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:15,231
Deng Zhong.

48
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:16,512
Get Xiao Ran back quickly.

49
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:19,431
Keep an eye on
his martial arts training.

50
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:20,751
Yes.

51
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:27,151
Heng.

52
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:28,471
Your fourth brother

53
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:30,072
just returned from the battlefield.

54
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:32,031
He had been in a coma for three months.

55
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,471
He's been through too much.

56
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:37,672
So he's not as easygoing
as he used to be.

57
00:02:38,072 --> 00:02:39,352
Hope you don't mind.

58
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:42,552
(Blood is thicker than water.)

59
00:02:43,352 --> 00:02:44,832
Foster father, no worry.

60
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:47,591
I wouldn't be that petty.

61
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:49,311
By the way,

62
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,911
I met a guy while I was

63
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:52,392
cultivating in the Beast Valley.

64
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:53,871
I'd like you to meet him.

65
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,431
Sure.

66
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:00,031
It's just that

67
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:03,072
he has a high cultivation level.

68
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,031
We'd have to release
the protection array

69
00:03:05,512 --> 00:03:06,591
to let him in.

70
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:12,151
Wait.

71
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:36,992
Fifth-rank Grandmaster.

72
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:40,031
You must be Zhao Heng's foster father.

73
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,031
Greetings, my senior, Master Zhao.
I am Zhuang Li.

74
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:44,272
Don't say that.

75
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,392
In front of a grandmaster,

76
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:48,552
I wouldn't even claim to be a senior.

77
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,512
Zhao Heng and I are friends.

78
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,112
You're his foster father.

79
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:53,552
So you're naturally my senior.

80
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:56,552
Mr. Zhuang, which school or sect
are you from?

81
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:59,591
You've got such a high cultivation level
when being so young.

82
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,511
(Zhuang Li, Fifth-rank Grandmaster)

83
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:06,191
You flattered me.

84
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:08,552
I met Zhao Heng while I was cultivating

85
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,631
in the Beast Valley.

86
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:11,911
We've been cultivating

87
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,471
together for more than a year.

88
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
I see.

89
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:16,631
Heng.

90
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:18,911
You're so lucky

91
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:21,151
to have such an awesome friend!

92
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:24,712
You flattered me, Master Zhao.

93
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:26,792
Foster father,

94
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:28,912
can you let my friend stay at our place

95
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:30,592
for a few days

96
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,672
before the Martial Assembly begins?

97
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:35,511
Well...

98
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:38,592
Master Zhao, if there is a problem...

99
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:40,152
No, not at all.

100
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,232
Plenty of rooms available.
Pick any one you like!

101
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,511
No problem at all.

102
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:45,071
Please, let me show you the way.

103
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,271
Bai Zhi.

104
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:50,871
What's wrong?

105
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:53,191
Just now at the Zhao family,
you seemed inclined

106
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:54,472
to honor the marriage pact.

107
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:55,912
You wanna marry Zhao Feiyang?

108
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:57,311
Everyone knows he's a loser.

109
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:00,712
My Bai family isn't as strong
as your families.

110
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:03,472
Your families are doing great.

111
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:05,831
But my family is on the decline.

112
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:06,992
My parents are gone.

113
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:08,191
This marriage would

114
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:10,792
at least give me some security,

115
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:13,511
better than being completely alone

116
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:15,111
and helpless.

117
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,071
But you...

118
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,191
Bai Zhi,

119
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:19,071
have you thought about me and Qiushui?

120
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,032
If you go ahead with this,

121
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:22,191
the Tianxuan City

122
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:24,391
will think our Chen
and Li families are unfaithful.

123
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:25,871
We need to

124
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:27,032
stick together.

125
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:28,712
Only then can we silence the gossip.

126
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:30,431
I promise you

127
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:31,391
if you're willing,

128
00:05:31,552 --> 00:05:33,112
we can become sworn sisters,

129
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:35,352
and the Chen family will be your home.

130
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:36,831
No worries anymore.

131
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,472
What exactly is it?

132
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:41,592
The Zhao family is a family of loyalty.

133
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:43,712
They lost three sons
when fighting the demon clan.

134
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:45,472
Zhao Feiyang, as the fourth son,

135
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:46,672
even if not well cultivated,

136
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:47,871
went to the front lines

137
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:50,112
with his brothers
when North Border was in trouble.

138
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,271
Doesn't that prove

139
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,391
he's not completely useless?

140
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:56,472
Okay, he's got courage.

141
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:57,831
But you deserve better.

142
00:05:57,912 --> 00:05:58,912
Better?

143
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:01,311
I'm not as pretty as you, Yanran,

144
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:02,992
or as skilled as you, Qiushui.

145
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:04,592
I know my place.

146
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:06,552
I honestly don't see

147
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:09,152
anything wrong with marrying

148
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:10,712
into the Zhao family.

149
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:12,232
Besides,

150
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:14,391
in this marriage,

151
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:16,792
at least I'd be the house lady.

152
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:18,792
In the Chen family,

153
00:06:19,992 --> 00:06:21,112
I'm just an outsider.

154
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:22,792
You really are

155
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:25,472
hopeless.

156
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:27,951
Maybe I am.

157
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,472
Have you considered it?

158
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:32,271
Considered what?

159
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:34,311
The Zhao family

160
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,831
only has that useless fourth son,
Zhao Feiyang.

161
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:39,032
Master Zhao Qin is getting old.

162
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:40,552
If you marry Zhao Feiyang,

163
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,352
will he be able to
keep the family going?

164
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,311
How long will you really be
the lady of the house?

165
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:46,912
What will you do

166
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:48,311
when you're wandering around

167
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:49,712
with your kid in a few years?

168
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,672
How'll you handle that kind of hardship?

169
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:56,672
Though sharp, Yanran gets the point.

170
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:02,431
So,

171
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,672
we all hope you can

172
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:05,271
think more clearly.

173
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:19,712
It's from the Holy Land.

174
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:21,871
The Holy Fruit has blossomed.

175
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:23,391
Let's go take a look.

176
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:24,871
If we get its Lotus Seed,

177
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:26,792
our skills will make big progress.

178
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:12,472
Master,

179
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:13,712
how's the investigation?

180
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:14,951
Pretty good.

181
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,592
The Zhao family has
a century-old legacy.

182
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:20,511
The spiritual vein
this manor is sitting on

183
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:21,831
is huge.

184
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:23,431
It's a treasure land.

185
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,391
You're being honest with me.

186
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:27,552
So,

187
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:29,552
you are satisfied now?

188
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:33,472
Yes.

189
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:37,232
But this protection array
is tied directly to the spiritual vein,

190
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:41,631
making it ridiculously strong.

191
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:42,592
Seriously?

192
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,472
Even you can't break it?

193
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:52,352
Don't underestimate your foster father

194
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:55,232
just as he's merely a Third-rank
and Ninth-grade Martial Master.

195
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,072
With that array backing him up,

196
00:08:58,391 --> 00:08:59,391
especially in this manor

197
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:04,112
or within a hundred miles of this manor,

198
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:05,832
I might not

199
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:09,112
be able to defeat him.

200
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:11,192
Relax, you just got here.

201
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,832
Take your time.

202
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:14,911
Besides,

203
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:17,271
I've got a backup plan.

204
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,791
A backup plan?

205
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:23,592
Right. My foster father

206
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:25,592
has lost three sons.

207
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:27,791
He only has Zhao Feiyang,
the useless one.

208
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:30,072
Once he's dead,

209
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:31,911
I'll then

210
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:33,791
earn his trust,

211
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,871
and become the young master
of this manor.

212
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:40,592
Then I can get the array schematics

213
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:42,472
and the location of its core.

214
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:43,631
Then,

215
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:47,832
getting you that spiritual vein
will be a piece of cake.

216
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:50,151
That is our deal.

217
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:52,312
Don't worry.

218
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:54,911
Killing a loser like him

219
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:58,472
is just a matter of lifting a finger.

220
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,031
The second he steps off the manor,

221
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:05,791
I can make him disappear
without a trace.

222
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:17,352
(Spiritual vein)

223
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:19,072
Quite ambitious, aren't you?

224
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:23,551
Since you're coming after me,

225
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:25,592
I'll play along.
