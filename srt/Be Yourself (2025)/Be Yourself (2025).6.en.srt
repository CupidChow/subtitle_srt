with his poor cultivation,

19
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,120
could it be dangerous?

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,480
That's his own business.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
How does it affect us?

22
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,439

00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,640
if we stoop to his level,

26
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,920
wouldn't it make us look petty?

27
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,879
Let him count his luck.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,879

29
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,280
Are you kidding me?

30
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,599

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120

Three great Martial Masters
and one Grandmaster.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,159
Interesting.

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,319
Do you think having more people

37
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,439
makes it very safe?

38
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,120

39
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,039
Now you're scared?

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,560
I wanted a chance to face a Grandmaster.

48
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,360
