so that you'll trust his character?

is because

18
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:12,887
he gave you each

19
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,247
a Holy Lotus Seed of his

20
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:16,406
and healed you up,
lifting your cultivation.

21
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:18,967
He's doing all this good stuff.

22
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:20,486

The one who saved us

25
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,607
was Zhao Feiyang?

26
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:29,327
Wasn't it Wang Hui?

27
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:31,486
That hypocrite.

28
00:01:31,887 --> 00:01:32,887

29
00:01:33,286 --> 00:01:34,566
I saw it with my own eyes.

It's true.

31
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:38,766
I see.

32
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:42,247
I must have taken two lotus seeds.

33
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:44,807
He wasn't stingy

34
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:47,447
with something that precious.

35
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:49,047
Then why did you say

36
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:53,366

I was being selfish

How dare you!

48
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:33,526
The entire Haotian Empire
belongs to my father.

49
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:36,246
Why aren't you bowing to him?

50
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,847
I intend to appoint you
as The Southern Domain Lord.

51
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:40,806
What do you think?

52
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:43,366
The Holy Lord wants to appoint Feiyang
as Domain Lord?

Feiyang,

54
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,086
hurry up and thank the Holy Lord!

55
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:47,447
You'll be a Domain Lord.

56
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,167
My son's going to be a Domain Lord!

57
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:53,287
Our Zhao family's finally
hitting the big time!

What's the catch

59
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:58,086
to being this Domain Lord?

60
00:02:58,447 --> 00:02:59,447
Well.

61
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:02,086
Just hand over that thunder power

62
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:03,407
you got.

63
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:04,486
Can't do that.

64
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:05,887
This power

65
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:07,766
exists within my consciousness.

66
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:09,206
Stuck in my head.

67
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:11,526
So, I'm going to have to pass on

68
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:12,806
being the Domain Lord.

69
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:14,007
Zhao Feiyang.

70
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,966
This is a chance my dad is giving you!

71
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:17,366
Don't blow it!

72
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,607
What if I do blow it?

73
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:21,127
As a Holy Lord of the Haotian Empire,

74
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:23,206
you're sure quick to ask for my power.

75
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:24,486
What is this?

76
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:26,007
Robbery?

77
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:29,766
Feiyang, that's the Holy Lord.

78
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:30,966
Watch your mouth!

79
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:32,327

80
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:34,246
Please excuse my son's

81
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:35,447
lack of manners.

82
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:37,407
Jie said you'd no respect
for the royalty.

83
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:39,127
I didn't believe him at first.

84
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:41,646
But seeing it now, it's true.

85
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:43,966
You're a pretty arrogant dude,

86
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:46,007
showing no respect to me.

87
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:47,607
I treat guests with respect,

88
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:49,567
but wolves get weapons.

89
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,086
My attitude depends on

90
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:54,567
who I'm talking to.

91
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:56,567
That's outrageous!

92
00:03:57,047 --> 00:03:59,366

93
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:00,167
In the universe,

94
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:02,246
only the Demon Lord

95
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:04,206
can even compete.

96
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:05,926
You're totally ungrateful!

97
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:07,887
Father, don't waste more words on him.

98
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,327
Just take away his thunder power.

99
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:10,567
Remove this trouble.

100
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:11,686
Zhao Feiyang.

101
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,167
One last chance.

102
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:15,607
If you don't cooperate,

103
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:17,766
I will have to suppress you.

104
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:20,086
Honestly, considering your merit,

105
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:22,486
I don't want it to be like this.

106
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:31,727
Feiyang, he's the Holy Lord.

107
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:32,886
Whatever he wants,

108
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:34,326
just give it to him.

109
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:36,407
Even if it's my life,

110
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:38,366
should I give it?

111
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:39,647
Well...

112
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,006
Is that your final answer?

113
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:45,087
Yes.

114
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:46,607
It is.

115
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:48,006
But,

116
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,407
I'll give you a chance too.

117
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,087
If you leave now,

118
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:52,926
I can pretend

119
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,880
this never happened.

120
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,326
Sounds like

121
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:59,566
you want to test your strength
against me?

122
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:00,847
No.

123
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:02,527
You're just

124
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:05,847
not a match for me.

125
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:07,806
Are you out of your mind?

126
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:09,246
Zhao Feiyang.

127
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:11,287
My dad's a ninth-rank
Great Martial Saint!

128
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:12,847
He might break to the tenth rank

129
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:14,006
and become a god.

130
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,926
You're saying he's no match?

131
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:19,886
I know your thunder power

132
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:21,047
is strong,

133
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:23,287
but you don't have a Dantian.

134
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:24,607
Just practicing Qi.

135
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:25,847
How could you possibly

136
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:27,727
develop this insane power

137
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:29,527
with that kind of body?

138
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,047
Who says I don't have a Dantian?

139
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,847
And who says I'm just practicing Qi?

140
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:36,847
Awesome!

141
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:37,926
The Revolution Pill's done.

142
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:40,607
Feiyang, you can restore your Dantian.

143
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:42,047
Take it quick!

144
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:46,047
But once I take it,

145
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:48,607
my cultivation might skyrocket.

146
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:50,566
I may even ascend right away.

147
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:54,647
Isn't that the ultimate goal
for a practitioner?

148
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:56,686
Is it okay if we can never

149
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,566
see each other again?

150
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:02,047
Hold the pill in your throat.

151
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:04,486
Only take it
when you absolutely need to.

152
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:06,566
When you ascend to godhood,

153
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:09,207

If you kill him,

190
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,047
the Demon Lord will show up.

191
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,686
It'll cause a catastrophe.

192
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:35,407
Alright.

193
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:36,926
Cultivation isn't easy.

194
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:38,167
I'll spare your life.

195
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:40,207
After I ascend,

196
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,848
if you think about
coming after my Zhao family,

197
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:44,806
or messing with my friends,

198
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:49,366
I'll tear a hole in reality and wipe
your entire imperial family off the map.

199
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:50,967
Got it?

200
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,767
We understand, fully!

201
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:55,087
Absolutely not.

202
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:56,407
Never!

203
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:58,287
Get lost!

206

You've actually become an immortal?

208
00:08:18,727 --> 00:08:19,727
Right.

209
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:20,886
I'm going to ascend.

210
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,126
The Heaven's calling.

211
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:24,806
Zhao Feiyang.

212
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,366
What's going on?

213
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:30,806
How are you standing in mid-air?

214
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:32,566
You...

215
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,087
you're at the tenth rank?

216
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:35,647
Are you leaving?

217
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:37,886
Are you over me?

218
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:40,127
We haven't even...

219
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:42,407
Sorry, guys.

220
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:45,007
No much time to catch up.

221
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:46,407
It's been great

222
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:48,206
being with you all for so long.

223
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:49,806
Guys,

224
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,007
take care!

225
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:53,247
I didn't want to make a scene,
considering

226
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,407
our families' history.

227
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:55,647
If you put it like that,

228
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:57,167
then I, Chen Qiushui,

229
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:59,086
am here to call off the engagement.

230
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:01,566
(I just don't get it.)

231
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,247
Why you have such a problem with me?

232
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,086
Your actions disgust me.

233
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:08,326
Bite me then!

234
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:09,086
Zhao Feiyang,

235
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:10,487
I swear I'll beat you up.

236
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,487
Wait.

237
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:12,887
Don't cry.

238
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:14,767
I'm sorry.

239
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:19,806
(This is a Scarlet Fruit.)

240
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:21,367
(A material for Revolution Pill.)

241
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:22,566
(This...)

242
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,407
(This is really too precious.)

243
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:26,086
We're going to be a family.

244
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:28,446
(Zhao Feiyang,)

245
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:29,846
(will you)

246
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:31,726
marry me?

247
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,247
Our families have been friends
for generations.

248
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,086
That's why we're engaged.

249
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:38,287
We're engaged already.

250
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:40,446
She's practically my fiancée.

251
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:42,007
You think I'm out of line, or what?

252
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:43,326
(I can't let your enemy)

253
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:44,446
(walk away today.)

254
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,446
(So I'll help you kill him)

255
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:49,007
(as a betrothal gift.)

256
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:50,966
(Are you serious?)

257
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:52,606
Go for revenge.

258
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,007
Kill him.

259
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:56,767
You've been working for him
since little.

260
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:58,527
Don't you know

261
00:09:58,686 --> 00:09:59,367
about him?

262
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:00,367
But

263
00:10:00,527 --> 00:10:02,367
in my eyes, he is invincible.

264
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,127
I want to get some candied hawthorns.

00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:05,127
