=Episode 20=

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
After the assembly,

11
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,439
before heading north,

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
annul our engagement.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,280
You and I are incompatible.

14
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,079
What?

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Annul our engagement.

16
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,719
You want nothing to do with me.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,679
And we should never be connected.

18
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,520
In that case,

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,439
I'll satisfy you.

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,159
I don't have any additional conditions.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
My father will agree.

22
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:13,959
(This man)

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,599
(saw me naked.)

24
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,120
(And now he's saying this?)

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,920
(He's simply a shameless scoundrel.)

26
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,040
At least you have self-awareness.

27
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,840
I hope you can come back alive

28
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,480
to sign the annulment papers
after the assembly.

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Besides the one with me,

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,319
annul the engagements

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,799
with them as well.

32
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,040
You're overstepping the bounds.

33
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,120
I'll only annul our engagement.

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,680
I won't annul the ones with them.

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,680
The three of us all agreed

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,920
to annul the engagements.

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,239
Do you really think
everyone wants to marry you?

38
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,519
Well,

39
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,040
that's debatable.

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,040
You're so narcissistic and arrogant.

41
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,519
Bai Zhi,

42
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,319
didn't you also want to annul it?

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
I...

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
What are you waiting for?

45
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,959
You've now reestablished the Bai family.

46
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,480
Also, with your cultivation,

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,040
in Tianxuan City
or even on the entire Tianwu Continent,

48
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,159
countless talented young men
are for you to choose.

49
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,680
Do you

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,439
still have hopes for this loser?

51
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,919
But I think

52
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,560
our marriage matters

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,360
should be decided by ourselves.

54
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,960
I have already stated my position
on this matter.

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,240
I hope you won't be angry, Qiushui.

56
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,919
I don't want you

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
to impose your thoughts on me.

58
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
Bai Zhi,

59
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,360
do you really want to marry him?

60
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,599
I'm just saying

61
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,680
I want to decide on my own marriage.

62
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,039
It doesn't mean that I must marry him.

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
I just don't want

64
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,719
to be influenced anymore.

65
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Alright.

66
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,159
Since you have your own thoughts,

67
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,759
I won't say anything.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,680
Yanran,

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,039
didn't you want
to distance yourself from him?

70
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,360
After the assembly,
we'll annul the engagements.

71
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,960
We had agreed on this before.

72
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,680
Did you agree on this?

73
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
How...

74
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,759
How come I didn't know about this,

75
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,960
Qiushui?

76
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
What do you mean?

77
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,560
(My feeling was right. Yanran's)

78
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,560
(attitude towards Zhao Feiyang
is suspicious.)

79
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,599
(But what exactly happened)

80
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,639
(to make her change so much?)

81
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,080
(I can't continue like this.)

82
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,120
(I should say it out loud)

83
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,319
(to express my attitude)

84
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,560
(to both Bai Zhi and Qiushui.)

85
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,560
My father has already discussed it
with Feiyang.

86
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,360
Once the demon hunt is over,

87
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
I will marry him.

88
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,360
What?

89
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
What?

90
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:52,439
I...

91
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,439
Yanran,

92
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,800
I didn't hear you clearly.

93
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,919
Say it again.

94
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,240
Once the demon hunt ends,

95
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
I will marry him.

96
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,360
If we both return alive,

97
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,000
I will certainly marry him.

98
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,599
I will never regret

99
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,039
this statement.

100
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Zhao Feiyang.

101
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,439
Will...

102
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,919
Will you

103
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:17,879
marry me?

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,879
We have an engagement.

105
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:20,800
Of course, I...

106
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,792
Give me a direct answer.

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,079
I...

108
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,959
I...

109
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
I...

110
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,519
I...

111
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:33,720
A b-b-big...

112
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,399
Big spider!

113
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
King Spider of Thorns?

114
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,519
Its venom can kill Martial Sovereign.

115
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,319
Run!

116
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,319
Hurry.

117
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:53,759
Zhao Feiyang!

118
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,600
I-I...

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,519
I have things to do.

120
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
I'm leaving.

121
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,439
Zhao Feiyang!

122
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Yanran,

123
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,920
why do you have this attitude
toward Zhao Feiyang?

124
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,040
I've always wondered in my heart.

125
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,879
I discovered it a long time ago.

126
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,600
If you still see us as besties,

127
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
you should tell us.

128
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,519
What can I say?

129
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,480
I can only speak the truth.

130
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
I like him.

131
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
I want to marry him.

132
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,279
How is that possible?

133
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,879
Why would you like him?

134
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Yanran,

135
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,959
do you have some unspoken burdens?

136
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,199
Or is it that

137
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,639
he did something to you

138
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,839
to make you say this?

139
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,639
Don't be afraid.

140
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,839
Tell me everything.

141
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,120
I will do justice for you.

142
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,160
Enough!

143
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,319
No matter what I say,

144
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,680
you will not believe me.

145
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,439
Zhao Feiyang is not a loser.

146
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,319
He is a good person.

147
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,079
You can annul

148
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,079
the engagement.

149
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
I don't care.

150
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,680
I'd even be grateful to you.

151
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,959
Because in this way,

152
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,839
there won't be a rift between us

153
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,879
because of a man.

154
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,120
Let this so-called loser

155
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,240
and shameless scoundrel

156
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,439
be mine alone.

157
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,439
Zhao Feiyang must have done something

158
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,879
to enchant Yanran so much.

159
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
That scoundrel.

160
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,480
I must tear off his last fig leaf

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,160
to wake Yanran up.

162
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,839
Qiushui,

163
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
let's go.

164
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,639
Master Xiao.

165
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,800
Where have you been?

166
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Busy collecting herbs again?

167
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,720
You have the Scarlet Fruit
and Holy Lotus Seeds, huh?

168
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Yes.

169
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,399
Then we now

170
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,680
have gathered seven ingredients.

171
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,199
And I have found the eighth one.

172
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,680
But I need your help this time.

173
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,360
No.

174
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,079
Don't say that.

175
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,959
You are doing all this for me.

176
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
You ask me to help?

177
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,199
I can't bear it.

178
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,560
So, are you going or not?

179
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,319
I'm surely going.

180
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,519
Even if it's to go
through thick and thin,

181
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,399
I'll do whatever you tell me.

182
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,839
Alright, cut the nonsense.

183
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,920
Before you help me,

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,800
I have a question.

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,879
I'll be completely honest.

186
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,519
Chun, give us a moment.

187
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,319
Yes, Master Xiao.

188
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,079
Is it something private?

189
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,560
Why must Chun leave?

190
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,920
She's young. She can't hear this topic.

191
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,639
That exciting, huh?

192
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,519
Then go ahead and ask.

193
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,160
Are you still a virgin?

194
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
- Huh?
- What?

195
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,600
Are you still a virgin?

196
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,439
Just answer.

197
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,639
D-Do you mean

198
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,879
that kind of virgin?

199
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,639
Of course.

200
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,199
I...

201
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,160
I-I...

202
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,959
I should be.

203
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,160
What's 'should be'?

204
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,680
Give me a definite answer.

205
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:44,360
Okay.

206
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,040
My current body

207
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,600
is one hundred percent a virgin.

208
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Satisfied now?

209
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,439
That's good. Come with me.

210
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,040
A Love Flower?

211
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,959
This is unexpected.

212
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,399
As long as we get Love Dew

213
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,800
and find the last ingredient,

214
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,639
I can make you the Revolution Pill.

215
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,319
But to obtain Love Dew,

216
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,199
it requires...

217
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,000
The vital essence
of a virgin boy and girl

218
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,560
for the Love Flower to produce dew.

219
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
That's right.

220
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,519
I am a virgin boy.

221
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
And you, a virgin girl?

222
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,480
Master Xiao, really?

223
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,480
What's with that look?

224
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Watch your eyes.

225
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,759
Alright.

226
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,720
But having a virgin boy and girl

227
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
is still not enough.

228
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,959
Why is that?

229
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,759
Are there other prerequisites?

230
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
(Of course there are.)

231
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,759
(Both sides need)

232
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,079
(to truly like each other)

233
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:36,439
(for the dew to be produced.)

234
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,600
(But how could you and I
possibly like each other?)

235
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,759
(Besides,)

236
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,360
(there's a terrifying consequence.)

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What are you thinking?

238
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Why aren't you speaking?

239
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,039
In short,

240
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,039
the two of us

241
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,080
can't get the Love Dew.

242
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,320
How about finding two others

243
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,120
to try it?

244
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,559
Love Flower's thorns are toxic.

245
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,919
Normal people can't resist them.

246
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,081
And those who can

247
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:56,480
are usually not virgins.

248
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,279
If there are,

249
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,480
they can't be found quickly.

250
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,879
If the Love Flower withers,

251
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,159
my work will be in vain.

252
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,279
We need to try.

253
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,320
No need to try.

254
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,600
Trust me. It won't work.

255
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,919
This trip can't be in vain.

256
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Let's try it.

257
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,759
Are you silly?

258
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,639
It's poisonous. It'll be a lot of pain.

259
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,440
Cut the nonsense. Let's try again.

260
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,799
It won't...

261
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,799
Come on.

262
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,879
Since you want to try,

263
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
go ahead and try.

264
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,440
See?

265
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,000
I told you it wouldn't work.

266
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:57,919
You didn't listen.

267
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,279
We got pricked for nothing.

268
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,919
Darn it.

269
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,399
Did you lie to me?

270
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,600
You're not a virgin, right?

271
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,519
You don't believe me?

272
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,720
Do you know

273
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,240
that for a man of age,

274
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,240
being a virgin

275
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,840
is a very shameful thing?

276
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,600
Why would I joke about that?

277
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,759
You must be joking.

278
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
Then why didn't

279
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,759
the Love Flower react at all?

280
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,519
H-How would I know?

281
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,639
Or you're not a virgin.

282
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,320
How dare you say that?

283
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,919
I'm your master. Show me respect.

284
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,039
Never mind.

285
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,919
It won't work.

286
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,039
Let's go home.

287
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,799
What are you waiting for?

288
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,240
Look, Feiyang.

289
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Love Flower has reacted.

290
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,879
