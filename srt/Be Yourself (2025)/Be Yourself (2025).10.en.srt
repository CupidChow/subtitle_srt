=Episode 10=

10
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:02,563
Why'd you bring me here?

11
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:04,243
To heal you.

12
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:06,563
Wait.

13
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:07,523
Heal what?

14
00:01:07,883 --> 00:01:09,684
The water in Bibo Pond is freezing now!

15
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:12,204
But the cold water can
ease your muscle soreness.

16
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:13,844
Plus, with my special formula,

17
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:15,043
you'll absorb it faster.

18
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:16,403
Special formula?

19
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:25,564
(It's top-grade dragon bone powder.)

20
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:27,803
(Dragon bone powder is, like,)

21
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:28,963
(a super rare treasure)

22
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:30,764
(for skills these days.)

23
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:33,163
(She's using it on me?)

24
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,924
(I'm kinda touched.)

25
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:37,204
What are you sniffing at?

26
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:41,284
The thing you just threw in the water

27
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:42,484
must be valuable, right?

28
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,204
Why waste it on a loser like me?

29
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:46,803
Just external stuff,

30
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:47,963
nothing that valuable.

31
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:49,084
Besides,

32
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:50,443
I'll be your master.

33
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,364
It's only right I do something for you.

34
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:53,644
Just focus on training.

35
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:54,403
There'll be...

36
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:55,564
(More surprises.)

37
00:01:56,403 --> 00:01:57,803
Progress later.

38
00:01:58,883 --> 00:01:59,883
Alright.

39
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:01,484
Thanks.

40
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:02,644
No need to thank me.

41
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:04,364
Just train hard and become

42
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:05,523
a martial artist soon.

43
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:06,924
That's the best thanks to me.

44
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:08,724
I'm already past my prime.

45
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:09,603
No Dantian.

46
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:11,523
Even missed the best time
to train properly.

47
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:13,084
Can I still become

48
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:14,604
a martial artist if I start now?

49
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:17,123
You definitely can
before the Martial Assembly.

50
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,843
(Touched again).

51
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:23,044
Alright, get into the water.

52
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:24,204
You'll feel better.

53
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:28,484
Take off your clothes.

54
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:30,644
Wearing them will affect the absorption.

55
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,283
I don't have the strength
to take them off. 300 jin!

56
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:34,604
Let me help you.

57
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:35,444
No, no, no.

58
00:02:35,604 --> 00:02:37,283
Master Xiao. Social distance, please.

59
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:38,044
I'm still...

60
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:38,723
What distance!

61
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:39,963
I'm over eight years older.

62
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:41,484
You're just a kid in my eyes.

63
00:02:41,604 --> 00:02:42,764
No, I'm not a kid.

64
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:43,924
I'm already very old.

65
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:45,523
Stop wasting time.

66
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:46,644
I...

67
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:03,003
(God.)

68
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,484
(That was too embarrassing.)

69
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:05,723
(I'll get revenge!)

70
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:06,764
Alright.

71
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:08,164
Why are you being so shy?

72
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,164
Now try to use your spiritual power.

73
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,364
Follow the cold currents.

74
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:14,604
Absorb the medicine
into your muscles and bones.

75
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:31,484
(Oh my.)

76
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:33,484
(He did it right after I said that.)

77
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:35,044
(So formidable.)

78
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:37,683
(He's like an old monster
who's been training for ages.)

79
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:40,123
(If I had a Revolution Pill,)

80
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:41,884
(I could rebuild his Dantian.)

81
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:44,884
(Then he could truly gain a foothold)

82
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:46,403
(in the Martial Realm.)

83
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:48,683
(It's just that the ingredients)

84
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:50,123
(for this pill are fairly rare.)

85
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:58,444
My body actually

86
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:00,523
seems to have gotten stronger.

87
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:01,764
Not bad.

88
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:02,924
From today, you've taken

89
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:05,204
the first step
in changing your physique.

90
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,364
Becoming a martial artist
is within reach.

91
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:10,563
Master Xiao,

92
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:15,403
I've got something to tell you.

93
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:16,576
What?

94
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:17,843
I'd like to invite you

95
00:04:19,484 --> 00:04:20,563
to take a bath.

96
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,324
Master Xiao, just kidding.

97
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:26,644
It's pretty comfy in here.

98
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:27,764
You should join me.

99
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:44,324
Young Master, what did you do yesterday?

100
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:46,244
What happened to your eye?

101
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:48,603
Not your business.
Keep your nose out of it.

102
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:52,204
Son, I must tell you something.

103
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:55,444
Hey, where you going?

104
00:04:57,884 --> 00:04:58,923
Chun,

105
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,124
Master Xiao said

106
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:01,684
the training continues today.

107
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:03,684
Why isn't she here yet?

108
00:05:03,963 --> 00:05:05,084
I don't think Master Xiao

109
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:06,723
would break her promise.

110
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:08,804
Something bad might've happened?

111
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:12,124
What exactly went down

112
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:16,043
last night after Master Xiao

113
00:05:17,644 --> 00:05:18,764
took him out to heal him?

114
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:36,684
Father.

115
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:39,204
Greetings.

116
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:41,607
(Zhou Zheng, Haotian Lord)

117
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:45,884
Father.

118
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,843
I went to Tianxuan City

119
00:05:48,204 --> 00:05:50,204
to set up a demon-slaying team.

120
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:52,324
But those commoners were totally
out of line.

121
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:53,603
They even injured me.

122
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:56,124
Seriously, zero respect
for our royal family!

123
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:57,403
Unbelievable!

124
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:00,483
Tianxuan City's just
a small southern city.

125
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:03,124
But since way back,
whenever Haotian Empire was in trouble,

126
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:04,843
they were always the first

127
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:07,283
to raise troops and rush to defend.

128
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:08,843
No special invites needed.

129
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:09,963
A few months ago,

130
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,204
they were a big help

131
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:13,324
during the demon-slaying
in the North Border.

132
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:14,764
I also heard

133
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:17,084
they're already gearing up
for the Martial Assembly

134
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,804
to pick the leader
of the demon-slaying team.

135
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:23,564
And you're causing trouble there!

136
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:24,324
Father.

137
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:25,484
- I...
- Did you

138
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:26,764
use my name

139
00:06:27,244 --> 00:06:29,523
and brag about making a splash
in Tianxuan City?

140
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:32,884
You really lived up to your name.

141
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:35,723
A complete loser.

142
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:38,124
Why?

143
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:39,804
Others call me a loser

144
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:40,684
behind my back.

145
00:06:40,923 --> 00:06:41,923
But hearing it from you?

146
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:43,523
I'm your son!

147
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:49,843
You know you're my son!

148
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:53,163
Your two older brothers and sister

149
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:56,923
are all powerful figures
ruling their own territories.

150
00:06:57,644 --> 00:06:58,644
What about you?

151
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:00,884
You're such a disappointment.

152
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,004
F-Father.

153
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:03,163
If you despise me so much,

154
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:05,283
just off me!

155
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:11,004
Are you
pulling the same old "pity me" trick?

156
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:12,963
N-No.

157
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:14,283
I mean it this time.

158
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:16,444
Whatever.

159
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,843
Even if Tianxuan City
is loyal and patriotic,

160
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:23,523
it's still just a small place.

161
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:25,723
They're not going to

162
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:27,963
churn out any decent fighters
for decades.

163
00:07:28,644 --> 00:07:31,483
But you're a prince!

164
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,444
Got beaten so badly.

165
00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:35,084
It's just embarrassing.

166
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:38,523
I've indeed brought shame
to the royal family.

167
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:39,923
But Father,

168
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,283
you gotta help me out here!

169
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:43,603
Go find Ge Hong,
Domain Lord of the southern front.

170
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,204
Get him to help you save face.

171
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:47,444
I'm putting you in charge of
picking the leader of

172
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:49,363
the Tianxuan demon-slaying team.

173
00:07:49,483 --> 00:07:51,403
That way, you'll be legit

174
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:52,843
and have generals to command.

175
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:54,923
You should be able to manage

176
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:57,324
a small town like Tianxuan City, right?

177
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,004
I can! Definitely!

178
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:02,483
Father, don't worry.

179
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:03,804
This time, I promise

180
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:06,004
I'll actually pull something off.

181
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:07,163
Alright.

182
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:09,084
Get lost.

183
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:11,483
I take my leave.

184
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:14,283
(Zhao Feiyang, huh?)

185
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:16,723
(You kept embarrassing me
over and over.)

186
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:19,444
(I'll make you pay this time.)

187
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:22,684
Sorry about that, Miss Bai.

188
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:24,043
This old house

189
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,523
hasn't been fixed up for years.

190
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:27,163
So it's a bit rundown.

191
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:30,004
Mr. Liu, here are 500 spirit stones.

192
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,804
Please return the property deed.

193
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:37,084
(Liu Yong, Shop Owner)
500 was the old price.

194
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:37,888
Now,

195
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,243
I reckon it's gotta be at least 1,000.

196
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:42,363
What?!

197
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:43,723
1,000?

198
00:08:45,363 --> 00:08:47,284
Look, Miss Bai, you must understand.

199
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,123
With the war up north,

200
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:52,164
many young men from Tianxuan City
went off to fight.

201
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,444
That caused housing and shops

202
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:56,483
to lose some value, for sure.

203
00:08:56,763 --> 00:08:58,284
But now, a few months later,

204
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:00,324
the market's starting to pick up.

205
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:02,404
The price you were asking about

206
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:04,204
was months ago.

207
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:05,363
It's bound

208
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:07,483
to go up a little.

209
00:09:07,684 --> 00:09:08,924
But double?

210
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:10,564
Isn't that too much?

211
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:13,444
It took me years to scrape together
these 500 stones.

212
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:14,684
Where am I gonna find

213
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:17,444
another 500?

214
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:18,603
Well,

215
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:19,883
Miss Bai,

216
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:23,084
why don't you think it over?

217
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:24,924
Or you know,

218
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:27,284
maybe you've got something else
worth something.

219
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:29,204
I heard

220
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,324
you've got a Holy Lotus Seed.

221
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:32,123
This thing is

222
00:09:32,284 --> 00:09:34,564
a real boost for practitioners,

223
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:37,483
worth at least 500 spirit stones, easy.

224
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:40,003
If you're willing to part with it,

225
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:43,084
I'll hand over the deed right now.

226
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:44,363
Miss Bai,

227
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,164
the market's changing fast.

228
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:48,723
Prices are going up every day.

229
00:09:48,883 --> 00:09:50,084
Today's the price,

230
00:09:50,204 --> 00:09:52,324
and tomorrow it might be higher.

231
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:54,564
In that case,

232
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:57,643
you might miss out.

233
00:09:58,483 --> 00:09:59,483
But...

234
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:02,444
Miss Bai,

235
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:03,924
to be honest with you,

236
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:05,843
there's been quite a bit of interest

237
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:09,963
in your old house lately.

238
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:12,963
If someone else buys it first,

239
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:14,204
you're going to

240
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,684
regret it.

241
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:21,763
Alright then.

242
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:24,003
I agree.

243
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:31,444
So what if someone buys it?

244
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:34,123
It's just some old house,
nothing to regret.

245
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:35,284
You are...

246
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:36,883
