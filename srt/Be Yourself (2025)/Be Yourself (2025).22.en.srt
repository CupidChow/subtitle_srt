Chun.

13
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:11,878
Here.

14
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:13,158
Young Master, catch it!

wipe out those demons as you'd

the guts to draw sword.

00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,518
Get him, Young Master!

20
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,559
Cheers for you!

21
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:27,598
Go for it, son!

22
00:01:29,158 --> 00:01:30,518
(Looks like she didn't show up.)

23
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:53,798
(His swordsmanship is this good.)

24
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,158
(Didn't plan to use all power.)

25
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:56,318
(Seems like I have to.)

26
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,399
(You're giving it all.)

27
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,798
(I got to go full strength.)

28
00:01:58,958 --> 00:01:59,958
(He's getting serious.)

29
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,198
(Feiyang. What's going on?)

30
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:29,198
Your Highness.

31
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,959
You sure he almost took you out

32
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:32,918
in one hit back then?

33
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:34,438
Sure.

34
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,559
But today...

35
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,399
He clearly is different today.

36
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,158
I can't put my finger on it.

37
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:41,758
That special power of his

38
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,079
hasn't even shown up.

39
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:45,119
Let's keep watching.

40
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:46,959
Looks like

41
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,758
no miracle's coming.

42
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:52,198
But Feiyang's actually holding his own
pretty well,

43
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:53,718
given how long he's lasted.

44
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:55,478
(Zhao Feiyang.)

45
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,559
(How strong are you actually?)

46
00:02:58,359 --> 00:02:59,519
(I can't figure you out.)

47
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:02,158
He's actually been
putting in the training,

48
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:03,638
not a complete loser.

49
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:05,856
Just at the third stage of cultivation,

50
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,638
he's lasted so long with a Grandmaster.

51
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:09,638
He's got bragging rights.

52
00:03:09,918 --> 00:03:12,158
Not shameful at all to admit defeat now.

53
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:15,519
That's why he is so arrogant.

54
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,638
He's learned the real deal
from Master Xiao.

55
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:19,318
Too bad

56
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,799
your cultivation are too low.

57
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:21,799
You can't take my sword.

58
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,839
Now you've even lost your weapon.

59
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,119
Don't throw in the towel?

60
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:27,438
Yanran,

61
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,239
you're overestimating him.

62
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:31,638
Even with Master Xiao training him,

63
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:32,799
and great sword moves,

64
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,239
there's no way he's beating someone

65
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:35,839
four ranks above him.

66
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:36,999
Don't worry.

67
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:38,478
He's going to win.

68
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,718
Why make things awkward for yourself?

69
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,799
(The gap in cultivation
is just too much.)

70
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,279
(Skills and experience can't bridge it.)

71
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,638
(Does it mean I can only admit defeat?)

72
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:49,079
He's going to give up.

73
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:50,679
Guess I'm not getting my revenge

74
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,519
at the Martial Assembly after all.

75
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,959
I'll have to
figure something else out later.

76
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:58,438
What's going on with Zhao Feiyang?

77
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,198

152
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:13,878

What are you

190
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:07,638
still waiting for?

191
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,239
Or

192
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:11,518
are you just all talk?

193
00:09:15,798 --> 00:09:16,439
Ge Hong.

194
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:17,678
That's going too far!

195
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,959
Good eyes.

196
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,798
But your level isn't high enough.

197
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:24,999
Room for improvement.

198
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,518
I don't want to waste you

199
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,839
this early.

200
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:29,918
Go back and get more training.

201
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,079
Li Hongbin.

202
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,038
Announce it.

203
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:38,518
Bai Zhi forfeited.

204
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,158
Ge Hong wins.

205
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:41,158
Wait.

206
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:42,638
Young Master Zhao.

207
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:44,079
You...

208
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:46,439
Who said Bai Zhi forfeited?

209
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:48,038
Uh...

210
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:50,798
Zhao Feiyang.

211
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:51,878
This isn't your fight.

212
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:52,864
