=Episode 8=

10
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:02,132
Young Master,

11
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:03,531
the weather is slightly cool.

12
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:04,613
Don't catch a cold.

13
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:06,892
This little chill

14
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:10,336
is nothing compared to the North Border.

15
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:11,972
Young Master,

16
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,293
will you go back to North Border?

17
00:01:14,252 --> 00:01:15,252
Probably.

18
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:16,452
Young Master!

19
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:17,653
Young master,

20
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:18,933
something happened.

21
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:22,013
So many visitors.

22
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:25,853
Brother,

23
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:27,213
what are you doing?

24
00:01:27,293 --> 00:01:28,293
You shouldn't be here!

25
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:31,252
Zhao Feiyang is here!

26
00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:32,573
Capture him!

27
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:36,013
Hold on.

28
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:38,573
Zhao Qin,

29
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:40,013
what do you intend to do?

30
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:44,052
My Lord,

31
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:46,812
this matter remains unclear.

32
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:48,892
You must not capture people so easily.

33
00:01:50,252 --> 00:01:53,373
Your fourth son, Zhao Feiyang,
is a deserter from North Border.

34
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:55,452
He is now colluding with the demon clan

35
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:56,493
to harm compatriots.

36
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:58,172
It's only right to capture him.

37
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:00,692
It will be clarified
through interrogation

38
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:02,013
before a decision is made.

39
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:04,733
My son would never collude
with the demon clan

40
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:06,573
or betray his people.

41
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:07,968
Zhao Qin,

42
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:10,452
you can't decide this
with only your side.

43
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:12,692
Although Feiyang's cultivation
is somewhat low,

44
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:16,412
he is still a person
with a righteous and kind heart.

45
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,493
He would never have
such disgraceful acts.

46
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,852
I am willing
to vouch for this with my life.

47
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:24,132
Zhao Qin,

48
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:25,933
stop your false belief.

49
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,213
Today, it is only Zhao Feiyang
being captured.

50
00:02:29,812 --> 00:02:30,852
If you obstruct further,

51
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:33,333
your entire family will not be spared.

52
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:34,572
You...

53
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,893
Don't push it too hard.

54
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:37,812
I...

55
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:38,972
What?

56
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:40,736
Foster father!

57
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:41,453
Zhao Qin,

58
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:42,653
do you want to rebel?

59
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:44,613
Please calm down.

60
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:46,053
Focus on the big picture.

61
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:50,333
(It seems that even Heaven
is helping me this time.)

62
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:51,852
(Zhao Feiyang,)

63
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:53,292
(you're finished.)

64
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:56,173
Father,

65
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,773
the city lord just wants me
for investigation.

66
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:00,478
Don't be so emotional.

67
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:01,632
It's fine.

68
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:02,839
But...

69
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,119
But what?

70
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:09,039
I believe the city lord
will not confuse right and wrong.

71
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,319
Right?

72
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,159
Son...

73
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:13,518
Young Master...

74
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,488
Rest assured.

75
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,198
I will return unharmed.

76
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:19,918
Lead the way.

77
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,159
Feiyang!

78
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:24,999
Feiyang!

79
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,319
Why does Heaven

80
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:36,399
treat my family this way?

81
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:37,879
Why?

82
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:39,328
Foster father!

83
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,409
Father,

84
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,689
don't worry.

85
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,608
He will return safely.

86
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:49,689
No.

87
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,208
I...

88
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:52,888
I can't just sit and wait.

89
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:53,792
Chun,

90
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:55,529
go invite Master Xiao.

91
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:56,288
Okay.

92
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:02,304
Miss,

93
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:03,768
Zhao Feiyang

94
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:05,809
was captured for the crime of treason.

95
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:07,089
- What?
- What?

96
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:08,888
That scoundrel

97
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,448
caused such a trouble.

98
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,648
He deserves to die.

99
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:15,048
If it is confirmed,

100
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:16,608
he won't survive.

101
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,768
Can we still help him with anything?

102
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,488
I'm afraid we can't do much.

103
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,088
After all, this kind of matter

104
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,569
involves topics that are too sensitive.

105
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,648
(Zhao Feiyang is not ordinary.)

106
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,968
(If he can't even save himself,)

107
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:33,648
(our assistance won't help.)

108
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:36,528
Although we can't do much to help,

109
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,009
the Zhaos are loyal,

110
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,609
yet they are treated so unfairly.

111
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:40,888
To oppose injustice,

112
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:42,768
we, the youth of Tianxuan City,

113
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,129
should not stand by.

114
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:45,729
Poor Lord Zhao.

115
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:47,369
He lost three sons,

116
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:48,648
and even the fourth is...

117
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:49,648
Let's go.

118
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:05,448
Stand down.

119
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:06,368
Yes.

120
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,328
Zhao Feiyang,

121
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:10,569
you barely managed to survive.

122
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:11,768
Why couldn't you just

123
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:13,609
keep a low profile?

124
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,569
City Lord, from your words,

125
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:18,408
did I offend someone
I shouldn't have offended?

126
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,249
Truly, you're amazingly clever,

127
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:24,569
Zhao Feiyang.

128
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:32,848
The Fourth Prince?

129
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:35,208
Then all of this makes sense.

130
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,648
I am not a narrow-minded person.

131
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:41,968
It's just that

132
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,249
you are indeed too annoying.

133
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:48,249
Moreover, I need to establish my power
in Tianxuan City,

134
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:53,848
so I can only start with you.

135
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:58,288
(City Lord's Mansion)
Zhao Qin, I order you to leave now,

136
00:05:58,288 --> 00:05:59,809
or else I will take you down!

137
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:02,129
We're only concerned about Zhao Feiyang.

138
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,768
How can you arrest us?

139
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:05,328
It's City Lord's Mansion.

140
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:06,929
By gathering here,

141
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:08,489
you mean to cause trouble.

142
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:09,648
Zhang Heling,

143
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,249
we've known each other for years.

144
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:14,049
Can you tell me

145
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,249
what exactly is going on with my son?

146
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:17,369
I don't know.

147
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,848
(Zhang Heling, Head of Guards)
An interrogation?

148
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,088
Interrogation?

149
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:22,929
Feiyang is weak.

150
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:24,768
How can he survive the interrogation?

151
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:27,648
But, foster father,

152
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:28,809
we are helpless.

153
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,088
Please calm down.

154
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:31,448
If he really

155
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,208
hasn't done anything wrong,

156
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:36,088
I believe the city lord
will give him an explanation.

157
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:45,888
Master Xiao.

158
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:48,129
Move.

159
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:49,328
Master Xiao,

160
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:50,569
what is your intention?

161
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,169
Breaking into the City Lord Mansion?

162
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:54,729
I don't want to repeat what I just said.

163
00:06:57,528 --> 00:06:59,328
Will you let us pass or not?

164
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:00,968
Zhang Heling,

165
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:02,249
hurry and make way.

166
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,049
Otherwise, Master Xiao and I

167
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,408
will have to force our way in.

168
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:07,448
Master Xiao, Zhao Qin,

169
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:09,689
I urge you to abandon your stubbornness.

170
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,369
With a grand defense formation

171
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:12,689
and us city guards,

172
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:14,169
even if you want to intrude,

173
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:15,569
it won't be that easy.

174
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:24,648
And there's us!

175
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:37,009
Ladies,

176
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,169
you...

177
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,408
Don't misunderstand.

178
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:41,929
We are just standing up for justice.

179
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:45,689
From what you say,

180
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:47,408
do you intend to kill me?

181
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:48,609
No.

182
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:49,888
Not just you.

183
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:52,768
I want your entire family
to be buried with you.

184
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,288
I need to confirm something.

185
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:57,009
Is this your idea,

186
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:59,369
or an order from your royal family?

187
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:00,569
What a joke.

188
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,249
Isn't my idea

189
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,768
the idea of Haotian Royal Family?

190
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:06,648
Well, that's alright.

191
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:07,408
It's alright.

192
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,528
What's alright?

193
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:10,328
Are you aware of your current situation?

194
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:13,528
If it's the royal family's intention
to move against the Zhao family,

195
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:16,448
I'm afraid I'll have to
eliminate the royal family.

196
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,208
What did you say?

197
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:20,528
Zhao Feiyang,

198
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:22,088
how could you say that?

199
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:26,528
And now,

200
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,288
it's enough to just end you.

201
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,808
He managed to run away.

202
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,168
You...

203
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:08,969
The lightning you just summoned,

204
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:10,648
why was it so strong?

205
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:13,329
My fourth stage cultivation...

206
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,089
My fourth stage cultivation

207
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:16,849
couldn't even withstand it!

208
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:18,009
Well,

209
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:20,688
a prince without power or influence
in the royal family,

210
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:22,969
actually dared to come to Tianxuan City

211
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,808
to stir up trouble.

212
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:26,808
How can you, the city lord,

213
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:28,768
boss of Tianxuan City,

214
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:30,568
be so subservient?

215
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:31,688
Aren't you ashamed?

216
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:32,969
I had no choice!

217
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:36,408
I... I'm just a city lord.

218
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:37,688
Young Master Zhao,

219
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:38,729
you won't kill me, right?

220
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:40,369
Young Master Zhao!

221
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:42,129
Young Master Zhao!

222
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:42,969
I was wrong.

223
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:43,849
I was wrong.

224
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:45,129
I'm sorry!

225
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,329
Since you're alive,

226
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:48,729
I won't kill you.

227
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:50,009
Thank you.

228
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,089
But after this prince goes back,

229
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:53,568
he'll surely incite the royals

230
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:55,129
to cause trouble for Tianxuan City.

231
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:56,888
The misfortune of our Tianxuan City

232
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:58,568
will begin soon.

233
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:00,969
Young Master Zhao,

234
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:02,048
earlier,

235
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:04,089
you shouldn't have
upset such a petty person!

236
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:09,168
So you knew he's petty?

237
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:10,168
Yes, petty!

238
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:12,849
Even if I didn't offend him,

239
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:16,729
someone else would have.

240
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:19,489
I understand.

241
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:20,688
From now on,

242
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:23,129
Tianxuan City and I
will share the common enemy,

243
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:24,249
uniting against threats!

244
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:31,688
Your hairstyle is cool.

245
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:37,449
Young Master Zhao, please!

246
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:38,609
