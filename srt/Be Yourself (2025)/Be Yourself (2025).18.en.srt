=Episode 18=

10
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:04,166
Those commoners in the Tianxuan City

11
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:06,606
challenged me twice.

12
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:09,206
I thought you could

13
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:11,765
support me in defending my honor.

14
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:14,086
But...

15
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:16,925
I've underestimated
those rebellious people.

16
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:19,606
But I have a plan.

17
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:23,006
What is it?

18
00:01:23,446 --> 00:01:25,205
I will go through the preliminary match

19
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,765
to enter the Martial Assembly.

20
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:29,526
Those people of Tianxuan City will see

21
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:31,205
what I'm capable of.

22
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,205
The Martial Assembly

23
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:37,485
is meant only for young people

24
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:38,886
under 28.

25
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,205
Lord Ge, you...

26
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,845
Even so,

27
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:44,485
there is no explicit rule

28
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:47,405
stating that older people
can't participate.

29
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:50,006
Very well.

30
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:52,806
Since you would condescend
to join that contest,

31
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:54,685
teach them a good lesson

32
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,925
in the arena.

33
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,485
It's no condescension.

34
00:01:58,726 --> 00:01:59,925
Now that I'm here,

35
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:02,526
I might as well have some fun with them.

36
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:05,966
Where have you been?

37
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:08,405
Do you still mind...?

38
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:10,405
Do you think I am someone

39
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:12,006
who gets hung up on trivial matters?

40
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:13,325
Not really.

41
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:16,246
What's wrong?

42
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:17,966
Just a minor injury.

43
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:19,646
Minor injury?

44
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:20,766
I highly doubt it.

45
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:22,285
Let me see.

46
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:28,766
Damaged meridians.

47
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:29,766
"Minor injury"?

48
00:02:30,246 --> 00:02:31,246
How did you get hurt?

49
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:34,685
Never mind.

50
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:37,165
This Holy Lotus Seed

51
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:38,605
can help you recover.

52
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:39,766
Take it.

53
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,086
The Holy Lotus Seed
helps improve cultivation.

54
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:42,926
Keep it.

55
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:43,806
Cut the yapping.

56
00:02:43,926 --> 00:02:45,165
Just take it.

57
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,646
(This guy cares for other people?)

58
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:51,605
Listen.

59
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,646
Start cultivating.

60
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:53,966
Let me try to heal you.

61
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:56,526
You're capable of that?

62
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:57,845
Just do as I say.

63
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:16,685
How do you feel?

64
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:18,725
It feels just fine.

65
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,885
And I think my cultivation has improved.

66
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:23,206
I felt my meridians

67
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:25,285
getting cleared by a powerful force

68
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:27,285
that wasn't spiritual power.

69
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:28,845
How did you do that?

70
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:32,125
(It would be shocking to tell her)

71
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,005
(about the thunder tribulation.)

72
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:37,845
This is a little trick I learned

73
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,926
during the war on the North Border.

74
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:45,486
The Martial Assembly is in three days.

75
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:47,445
I haven't made it.

76
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:49,405
What do you mean?

77
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:57,326
Golden Plum Blossom.

78
00:03:58,646 --> 00:03:59,725
Immortality Vine.

79
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:01,926
Myriad Herb.

80
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:03,806
And...

81
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:07,966
Beast Core.

82
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:10,685
(The day, at Level 33
of the Heaven-reaching Tower.)

83
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:12,526
(It was her?)

84
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,445
I wanted to make

85
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:15,845
the Revolution Pill for you.

86
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:17,926
But with my limited ability,

87
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:19,565
I only found four herbs.

88
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:21,926
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:28,245
Aren't you silly?

90
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:30,365
You've done so much for me.

91
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:32,006
Why are you apologizing?

92
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:33,165
I'm obligated

93
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:35,966
to help my disciple protect himself.

94
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:38,405
Who is your disciple?

95
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:39,485
Besides,

96
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:40,805
even if I were,

97
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:42,886
you shouldn't do this.

98
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,045
You don't owe me anything.

99
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:47,006
(I don't care about many people)

100
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:48,245
(in this world.)

101
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:49,925
(You're one of them.)

102
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:52,365
Your three elder brothers

103
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:53,725
all learned from me.

104
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:55,566
I think it's a pity

105
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:57,566
that they died.

106
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,845
I'm just trying
to feel better by helping you.

107
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,966
So don't feel burdened.

108
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:03,966
How can I not feel burdened?

109
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:05,365
You don't have to.

110
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:06,725
You just healed me

111
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:07,966
with the Holy Lotus Seed.

112
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:09,526
We're even now.

113
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:10,526
Nonsense.

114
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,326
You were injured because of me.

115
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:13,485
How could we be even?

116
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,686
I don't like to owe people favors.

117
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:17,245
How about this?

118
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:18,886
What is your dream?

119
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:20,045
I'll make you a promise.

120
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:23,206
You will make me a promise?

121
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,365
Yeah.

122
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:26,365
I will make you a promise.

123
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:28,365
You can ask me to do something

124
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:29,526
within my capabilities.

125
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:32,966
Be serious, okay?

126
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,165
It's my first time

127
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:35,526
making such a serious promise.

128
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,686
You are serious?

129
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:39,805
Stop it.

130
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,605
No wonder you wouldn't
acknowledge me as your master.

131
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,845
Are you trying to make a move on me?

132
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,526
Do you like someone older than you?

133
00:05:48,686 --> 00:05:49,280
I...

134
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,045
W-What?

135
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:52,886
What are you saying?

136
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,686
Look at you.

137
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,245
So young and so simple.

138
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:58,405
You shouldn't

139
00:05:58,605 --> 00:05:59,925
make a promise so easily.

140
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:01,566
I'll pretend I didn't

141
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:02,605
hear what you said.

142
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,045
Forget about it.

143
00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:06,405
How can I, Zhao Feiyang,

144
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,766
go back on my words?

145
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:10,805
Fine.

146
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:13,526
I'll note down your promise.

147
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:14,925
Okay?

148
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:15,904
But...

149
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:16,566
Enough.

150
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:17,725
Cut the nonsense.

151
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:19,485
Just take my advice when needed.

152
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:23,605
Alright.

153
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:31,245
His physical strength
has reached its peak.

154
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:33,006
But without a Dantian,

155
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:34,886
he can't improve his cultivation.

156
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:37,646
Now that I've recovered,

157
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:39,126
I must try hard

158
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:40,646
to gather the herbs.

159
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,805
Mother.

160
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:48,365
Where are we going?

161
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:50,646
Mother.

162
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:52,245
Why won't you let me train?

163
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:54,446
You should balance training and rest.

164
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:55,766
Your speed and strength

165
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:56,605
have decreased.

166
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:58,845
It's pointless to keep training.

167
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,086
I see.

168
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:02,446
I didn't realize that.

169
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:03,446
Let's go home then.

170
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:10,805
What's wrong?

171
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:12,206
Nothing.

172
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,845
Maybe the intensified training

173
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:15,526
damaged my muscles and bones.

174
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:16,766
Look at you.

175
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:17,886
I told you.

176
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:19,405
Why are you pushing yourself

177
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:20,845
so hard, young lady?

178
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:22,045
Look what happened.

179
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:23,446
You exhausted yourself.

180
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:24,605
How will you cope with

181
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:25,646
the match in three days?

182
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:28,446
I was too reckless.

183
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:31,925
Bibo Pond is right ahead.

184
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:34,045
Take a bath in it,

185
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,566
and it will work wonders

186
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:36,725
for you.

187
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,245
It's that amazing?

188
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:39,405
Of course.

189
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,526
Back in the day,

190
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,326
your father and I

191
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:43,526
would always

192
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:45,766
have a bath there after the training.

193
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:49,446
What's so funny, young lady?

194
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:52,045
We were simply healing in the water.

195
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:54,485
But

196
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,045
I didn't say anything, Mother.

197
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:56,686
Enough.

198
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:57,405
Give me that.

199
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:58,526
Go ahead.

200
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,925
Mother, aren't you coming?

201
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:01,925
I'm not injured.

202
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:03,206
Why should I suffer?

203
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:04,086
Listen to me.

204
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:05,206
Take off

205
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:06,485
all your clothes

206
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:07,526
and let the coldness

207
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:08,646
get into your bones.

208
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,365
Only then will it work miracles.

209
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:13,045
I must get undressed?

210
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:15,686
Then

211
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:18,086
you and my father...

212
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,285
Again?

213
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:21,365
I've heard enough from you.

214
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:22,526
Alright, go ahead.

215
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:23,805
- Alright, Mother.
- Hurry.

216
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:36,485
Mother, wait for me here.

217
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:38,365
I...

218
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,046
What's wrong, Qiushui?

219
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:23,046
Nothing, Mother.

220
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:24,406
It's just that

221
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:25,725
the water is freezing.

222
00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:26,966
So I let out a cry.

223
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:29,765
Why can't you resist the cold?

224
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:30,686
You know what?

225
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:31,605
Hang in there.

226
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:32,525
Get used to it.

227
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:33,686
Okay.

228
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:34,885
Mother, you can go home.

229
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:36,046
I'll stay for a while.

230
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:36,605
Okay.

231
00:09:36,686 --> 00:09:38,806
Come home as soon as you're done.

232
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:40,485
Okay.

233
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:47,725
Zhao Feiyang, you...

234
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,605
- When did you get here?
- Calm down.

235
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:50,485
Let me explain.

236
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:53,245
I came first. Then you came.

237
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:54,166
You came first?

238
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:55,485
T-Then why didn't you

239
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:56,365
make a sound?

240
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:57,885
I was too scared

241
00:09:58,566 --> 00:09:59,566
to make a sound.

242
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,765
How were you scared?

243
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:02,806
Did you

244
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,845
s-see everything?

245
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:05,806
I...

246
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:06,446
Answer me.

247
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:07,566
I saw...

248
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:10,086
Nothing.

249
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:12,645
Just a little bit.

250
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:14,725
- I'll kill you.
- Wait.

251
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:18,125
Only killing you can ease my anger.

252
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:19,046
If you move,

253
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:20,365
I'll stand up.

254
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:21,605
How dare you!

255
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:22,885
Try me.

256
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:24,046
Don't move.

257
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:26,365
That's right, calm down.

258
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:27,845
It's not my fault.

259
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:29,566
Oh really?

260
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:30,845
If you had made a sound,

261
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:31,966
would this

262
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,005
have happened?

263
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:35,005
You walked straight towards me.

264
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:35,926
It would have been

265
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:37,086
more embarrassing

266
00:10:37,686 --> 00:10:38,806
if I had made a sound.

267
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:40,365
I thought

268
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,446
you were just a sharp-tongued petty man.

269
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:44,605
Now it seems

270
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:46,406
you are also extremely nasty.

271
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:47,566
Before I kill you,

272
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:48,166
get lost.

273
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:49,286
Nasty?

274
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:50,086
I didn't come

275
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:51,286
to watch you bathe.

276
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:52,645
Will you stop putting

277
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:53,966
random charges on me?

278
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:54,765
Get lost.

279
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:55,926
Fine, I'll go.

280
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:57,605
What are you doing? Stay put.

281
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:58,966
How am I going to leave?

282
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:00,725
You... Just don't move.

283
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:02,525
Fine, cover your eyes.

284
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:03,645
I'll go.

285
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:04,885
No.

286
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,566
What if you do something strange to me

287
00:11:06,686 --> 00:11:08,046
when I close my eyes?

288
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,206
What would I do?

289
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,046
Don't think of me

290
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:10,926
as a nasty creep.

291
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,046
How about this?

292
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,406
I'll cover my eyes. You'll leave.

293
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:15,725
No way.

294
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:17,525
Then

295
00:11:18,326 --> 00:11:19,326
let's bathe together.

296
00:11:50,365 --> 00:11:51,125
I'm almost done.

297
00:11:51,286 --> 00:11:52,446
I-I'm going home.

298
00:11:52,765 --> 00:11:53,326
Don't leave.

299
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:55,645
Could you please leave, then?

300
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,166
I've pretty much seen...

301
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:58,686
You...

302
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:04,125
I...

303
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:04,765
Wait...

304
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,046
D-Don't cry.

305
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:07,806
I'm sorry.

306
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:09,206
You're such a tough girl.

307
00:12:09,406 --> 00:12:10,446
It's so weird

308
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:11,605
to see you cry.

309
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,365
I hate you.

310
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:16,686
How could I

311
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:19,926
be engaged to someone

312
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:21,245
as shameless as you?

313
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:24,645
Why are you calling me "shameless" now?

314
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:26,286
There is not a word

315
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:28,806
that shows how creepy you are.

316
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:30,725
I'm creepy?

317
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:31,365
I...

318
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:32,806
Hui.

319
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,245
Why did we come to

320
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:35,485
such a distant place?

321
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:36,645
Bibo Pond

322
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:37,845
with clear water is ahead.

323
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:40,326
- We can bathe together.
- Someone is here.

324
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:43,566
What do you think?

325
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:45,166
But I'm really scared.

326
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,806
We're in the middle of nowhere.

327
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,406
What if there's a wild beast?

328
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:49,566
Why are you scared?

329
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:51,406
I'm almost a Supreme Grandmaster.

330
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:52,885
In Tianxuan City,

331
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,365
I'm basically unbeatable.

332
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,286
But I'm still worried.

333
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,725
It will be embarrassing
if someone sees us.

334
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:00,485
No one is here.

335
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:02,086
I'm going to war.

336
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:03,926
Can't you satisfy me just this once?

337
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:06,365
Wouldn't it be a shame

338
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:08,046
if I die on the North Border?

339
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:09,566
What will I do if you die?

340
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:10,725
Don't...

341
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,005
So annoying.

342
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,485
Okay, I won't jinx it.

343
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,686
Let's go to the pond now.

344
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:19,566
Why are you so shy?

345
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,446
- But I...
- You are mine, anyway.

346
00:13:21,605 --> 00:13:22,605
What are you doing?

347
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,966
You should keep an eye on your brother?

348
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,686
They came to bathe in the pond for fun.

349
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:31,406
How romantic.

350
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:34,125
It's a pity that Bibo Pond

351
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:35,286
will get dirty.

352
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:36,645
I won't come again.

353
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,046
He's not married.

354
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:40,806
Why do I care about his private life?

355
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,166
Should I help you get undressed?

356
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:44,725
Fine. It's none of your business.

357
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:45,845
It's my business.

358
00:13:48,086 --> 00:13:49,086
I'm warning you.

359
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:49,926
Don't tell anyone

360
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:51,206
what happened today.

361
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:52,605
Otherwise, I won't

362
00:13:53,686 --> 00:13:54,286
spare you.

363
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:57,046
Hui, what are you doing? So annoying.

364
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:07,566
You're hurting me.

365
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:08,725
So annoying.
