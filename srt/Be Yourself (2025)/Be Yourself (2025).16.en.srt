=Episode 16=

10
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:01,870
Zhao Feiyang, you...

11
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:05,711
What...

12
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,910
My Lord, please wait.

13
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,671
There might be a problem here.

14
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,231
I told you something is up.

15
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,470
You know the deal.

16
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:25,270
Is there anything wrong

17
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:26,550
with Zhao Feiyang's record?

18
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:28,990
Why is the Elder so surprised?

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,910
He came with us to Level 18.

20
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:32,350
The record is too good

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,630
for his poor cultivation.

22
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,231
Of course, the Elder is shocked.

23
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,190
I see.

24
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,990
With this record,

25
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:40,591
he could rank high on the list.

26
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,070
It won't be so embarrassing.

27
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,910
Tian, what are you doing?

28
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,391
They're all waiting.

29
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,391
Di.

30
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:50,630
Why don't you

31
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:54,190
take a look at this young man's
Heaven-reaching Tower level?

32
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:55,511
His record?

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,190
Should I?

34
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,990
Fine.

35
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,190
I'll take a look.

36
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,110
Zhao Feiyang.

37
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,630
Aged 21.

38
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:14,630
Heaven-reaching Tower level...

39
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:15,991
How much?

40
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,910
Thirty-three?

41
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,510
What? Did I hear wrong?

42
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:23,751
Thirty-three?

43
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:24,510
How...

44
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:25,831
How is that possible?

45
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,790
Oh my, he reached Level 33?

46
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:30,190
Level 33?

47
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,470
Level 33?

48
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,390
He reached Level 33?

49
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,070
- No way.
- No way.

50
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:37,664
How...

51
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:39,111
How is that possible?

52
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,230
How could this loser reach Level 33?

53
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,790
Loser?

54
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:44,031
That's Young Master Zhao.

55
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:45,350
Watch your language.

56
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,510
Yeah.

57
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:48,431
Lord Ge.

58
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,190
W-What do you think?

59
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,390
Even I might not

60
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,031
get through that level

61
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,510
so easily.

62
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,031
It seems this young man
is indeed extraordinary.

63
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,311
The measurement tablet

64
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,151
will show us his real cultivation.

65
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:02,111
Both of us can make mistakes,

66
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:04,271
but the measurement tablet won't.

67
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,510
Let's see.

68
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,111
(Feiyang. Level 33?)

69
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,831
(Who are you really?)

70
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,431
(Are you that powerful?)

71
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:15,111
(The measurement tablet can detect)

72
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,431
(your true cultivation, anyway.)

73
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:19,271
(The day has finally come.)

74
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:20,711
(From now on,)

75
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,190
(everyone will know
how excellent Zhao Feiyang is.)

76
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,271
(My competitors will be)

77
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,670
(the two most outstanding ladies
in Tianxuan City.)

78
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,591
(My only advantage)

79
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,551
(lies in my appearance.)

80
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,910
(But Bai Zhi and Qiushui)

81
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,670
(are not any inferior to me.)

82
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,591
Did we all misunderstand him?

83
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:42,630
Has he been hiding his strength?

84
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:44,992
Actually, I've suspected that

85
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:45,592
he wasn't

86
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,070
as incapable as we imagined.

87
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:48,711
But what happened later

88
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:50,670
convinced me
that he was nothing special.

89
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,711
How did he reach Level 33
of the Heaven-reaching Tower

90
00:03:53,991 --> 00:03:55,311
without the power of

91
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:56,950
a sixth-rank Martial Sovereign?

92
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,390
(Was I really)

93
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,751
(saved by Zhao Feiyang that day?)

94
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,390
Everyone.

95
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,630
Don't be surprised.

96
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,111
He's just lucky. That's all.

97
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:17,271
Lucky?

98
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:18,711
Qiushui.

99
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,311
Do you remember that the formation

100
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:21,431
pulled him away

101
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:22,991
and we couldn't find him?

102
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,510
That's true.

103
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:27,190
I bet Heaven-reaching Tower

104
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,190
malfunctioned

105
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,111
and that's why he has such a record.

106
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,270
Level 33?

107
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,111
Even late stage of Supreme Grandmaster

108
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:34,389
may not come out unscathed.

109
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:35,431
Let alone this loser.

110
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,150
I see.

111
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:40,911
I thought he...

112
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:41,911
No way.

113
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,991
Just think about it.

114
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,471
This is impossible.

115
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,190
I don't think so.

116
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:49,791
There's an assessment

117
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,150
for cultivation.

118
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:53,590
We will learn his level of cultivation

119
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:55,231
very soon.

120
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,950
(Oh no.)

121
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:59,351
(He can't hide it anymore.)

122
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:01,510
(But I'm also curious how powerful)

123
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:02,991
(he is now.)

124
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:06,791
I believe his cultivation level

125
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,030
should be alright.

126
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,830
He had three great elder brothers.

127
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,991
It wouldn't make sense

128
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,351
If he were too useless.

129
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,150
Maybe he has reached
above the third rank?

130
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,030
That's the son of the Zhao family

131
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,791
who's been on the battlefield.

132
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:20,911
Level 33?

133
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,190
We truly admire you.

134
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,950
Young Master Zhao, please!

135
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,030
Step forward for the assessment.

136
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,974
(Zhao Feiyang,
third grade without the rank)

137
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:07,751
It doesn't make sense.

138
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:09,510
How is this possible?

139
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,190
No way.

140
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,030
He

141
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,351
isn't even a martial artist.

142
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,791
He barely has third-grade Martial Realm.

143
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,950
Strange.

144
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,991
This is weird.

145
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:23,751
(So he's a loser, after all.)

146
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,030
(But why does he have such aura?)

147
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,590
Not even in the first rank?

148
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,431
He barely has third-grade Martial Realm.

149
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:34,830
I've overestimated him.

150
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,510
(Turns out, he's just)

151
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,311
(a pretentious loser.)

152
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,510
No wonder he dared to come today.

153
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,950
He must have heard about his record.

154
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:46,630
What a show-off.

155
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,231
I really can't see through him.

156
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,390
(Someone with just)

157
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,551
(third grade killed a Grandmaster?)

158
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,351
(So his real power
doesn't lie in his cultivation.)

159
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,390
(No more competitors for me.)

160
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:01,871
What's going on?

161
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:03,150
I don't understand.

162
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,630
Level 33?

163
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:06,311
Third grade without the rank.

164
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,871
So, is he powerful or not?

165
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:15,751
He actually ranks first.

166
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:17,471
Unbelievable.

167
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,950
He has little cultivation,

168
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:20,791
but his record is very high.

169
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:23,070
Overall, he surpasses us.

170
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:24,791
But this isn't fair.

171
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,590
Qiushui.

172
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,630
The world is not fair, anyway.

173
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,911
This is just a ranking.

174
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:31,390
The real match hasn't started.

175
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,270
His true ability

176
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,871
will be exposed during the match.

177
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,150
I can't let him

178
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:37,190
get away with it.

179
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,950
So,

180
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,270
the registration ends here.

181
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,351
The official contest begins

182
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:45,270
at dawn three days later.

183
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,190
Dismiss.

184
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,830
My Lord.

185
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,030
Elder.

186
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,270
Wait.

187
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:51,791
Chen Qiushui, what's wrong?

188
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,510
I disagree with the ranking.

189
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:57,911
You disagree?

190
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,751
Bite me then!

191
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:01,510
Zhao Feiyang.

192
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,231
I swear I'll beat you up.

193
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,390
Then stop the nonsense.

194
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:10,111
Let's see how it goes.

195
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:11,830
I don't want to marry someone

196
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:14,070
who doesn't respect me.

197
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,311
That loser is so arrogant.

198
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,871
He thinks his cultivation ranks first.

199
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,111
Is it appropriate?

200
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:22,311
Doesn't he feel ashamed?

201
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,950
Feiyang.

202
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,431
Please show some respect.

203
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:29,949
Our family may have

204
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,590
a good reputation in Tianxuan City,

205
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:33,431
but you're a bit

206
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:34,991
too high-profile.

207
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:37,671
Heng.

208
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,670
Since when do you get to scold me?

209
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,991
I...

210
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,471
Why don't you show some respect?

211
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:49,191
You got me wrong.

212
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,351
I do respect you.

213
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:51,831
No, you don't.

214
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,231
I've given you a chance.

215
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,270
You'd better appreciate it.

216
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,510
Remember.

217
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:00,111
You bear our surname.

218
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:02,790
We named you Zhao Heng.

219
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,871
You are my father's foster son

220
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:06,191
and my foster brother.

221
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:08,191
You've lived with us for ten years.

222
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,510
If you insist on favoring outsiders

223
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,390
and acting against me,

224
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:16,191
I won't mind cleaning up the household.

225
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:18,630
Just like what I did with Jingyu.

226
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:19,751
Fei...

227
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:21,670
Feiyang, I'm sorry.

228
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:24,071
I apologize.

229
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,670
You're bossing around

230
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:31,670
your foster brother in public

231
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,711
and threatening
to clean up the household.

232
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:36,831
Zhao Feiyang, you sound

233
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:38,430
quite domineering.

234
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,191
Yeah, he's so bossy.

235
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,751
Zhao Heng was adopted, after all.

236
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:45,150
He must have been bullied a lot.

237
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:47,831
But he's more cultivated
than Zhao Feiyang.

238
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:49,071
So what?

239
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,111
Zhao Feiyang is the Young Master.

240
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,790
He's giving his outstanding

241
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,231
foster brother a hard time

242
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,591
to drive him away,

243
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:58,591
lest he becomes a threat.

244
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,150
Fourth Prince.

245
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,951
What?

246
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:03,510
Do you want to interfere

247
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:04,711
in my family affairs?

248
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:07,711
I'm not interfering
in your family affairs.

249
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:10,191
I'm simply standing up for justice.

250
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:11,072
Doesn't that mean

251
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:12,790
you're interfering in my family affairs?

252
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:14,390
If you put it that way,

253
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:16,390
then what about it?

254
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:19,111
Fourth Prince, tell you what.

255
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,351
It's none of your business.
