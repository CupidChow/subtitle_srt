Brat,

11
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,685
you're still too green.

12
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,085
My dragon's shape is complete.

13
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:06,606
You are out of options.

14
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:08,485
Out of options?

15
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:09,685
Father,

16
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:11,646
have you heard

17
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:15,445
of the divine move?

18
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:17,165
What divine move?

19
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:19,286
It can be called

20
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:23,126
a move of fate.

21
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:28,126
I-It's...

22
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:31,365
I can't believe I lost.

23
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:34,486
When did you set this up?

24
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:36,646
I didn't notice it at all.

25
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,245
Are you this good now?

26
00:01:38,805 --> 00:01:40,445
(The years in my past life)

27
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:42,126
(were not lived in vain.)

28
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:47,245
Practice more.

29
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:48,406
Get lost.

30
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:50,445
Young Master,

31
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:52,126
Miss Li Yanran

32
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:53,286
invites you over.

33
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:55,245
Li Yanran wants to see me?

34
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:56,766
What for?

35
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,605
Cut the yapping.

36
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:03,525
If Miss Li wants you to go,

37
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:05,245
just go.

38
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:05,965
Hurry.

39
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:06,805
- I...
- What?

40
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,286
- Hurry up and go.
- Okay.

41
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:15,645
Thank you, heavens.

42
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:18,526
Finally, a girl likes Feiyang.

43
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:19,765
Thank you.

44
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:20,925
Thank you, heavens.

45
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:23,445
Thank you, heavens.

46
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:26,045
Alright.

47
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:27,246
We'll know once he's here.

48
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:28,925
Be more proactive.

49
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:30,086
Got it?

50
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:32,246
(Li Yanran's father,
Li family of Tianxuan City)

51
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:34,286
This is...

52
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:37,006
You...

53
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:38,526
You are here.

54
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:41,006
Greetings, Sir.

55
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:42,445
Greetings, Ma'am.

56
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:44,725
Feiyang, you're here.
Please have a seat.

57
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:46,205
- Come on.
- Please come inside.

58
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:47,686
Hurry up.

59
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:48,765
Please.

60
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:56,533
(Li Yanran's mother,
Li family of Tianxuan City)

61
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,966
Feiyang, come on.

62
00:02:58,286 --> 00:02:59,286
I'll fill it up for you.

63
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,925
I wish you success
in the upcoming competition

64
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:07,086
and bring glory

65
00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:09,566
to Tianxuan City
in the northern demon hunt.

66
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:10,966
Come on.

67
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:12,086
Okay.

68
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,605
We've invited you over

69
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:22,485
to discuss with you

70
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:23,966
and see when

71
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:26,205
we can set your wedding date
with Yanran.

72
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,006
W-Wedding date?

73
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:29,165
Yes.

74
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,086
Your father and I

75
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,006
had already made a marriage contract.

76
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:34,925
You're now the Zhao family's sole heir.

77
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:36,925
So it naturally falls on your shoulders.

78
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:38,246
(Although I always thought)

79
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:40,205
(getting married is a good thing.)

80
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:42,526
(But now that it really falls to me,)

81
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,526
(I somehow feel a bit nervous.)

82
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:48,846
Sir,

83
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:52,205
why don't you discuss this
with my father?

84
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,366
It's because

85
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:57,445
you have three marriage contracts.

86
00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:01,806
I have my own selfish desires.

87
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:04,566
I hope Yanran
can be your principal wife.

88
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:07,526
You won't laugh at me, will you?

89
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:09,126
Of course not.

90
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:10,325
Father,

91
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:11,366
didn't we agree

92
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:14,406
to only have a simple meal
with Feiyang today?

93
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:15,925
I'm doing this for your own good.

94
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:19,605
Feiyang, don't listen to my father.

95
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,246
We asked you here today

96
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,006
just to have a simple meal.

97
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:24,806
There is nothing more.

98
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:27,525
Alright.

99
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:28,765
Come on.

100
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:29,645
Let's drink.

101
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:30,765
Come on.

102
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,126
Cheers.

103
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:33,126
Yanran,

104
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:35,126
I found a good place for cultivation.

105
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:36,686
Let's go together...

106
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:38,046
Bai Zhi.

107
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:40,606
Zhao Feiyang?

108
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:41,566
Why are you here?

109
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:43,566
I came to visit and grab a meal.

110
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:46,006
You came to the Li family for a meal?

111
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,166
Yes.

112
00:04:47,325 --> 00:04:48,806
They invited me here.

113
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:51,125
They invited you here?

114
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:51,765
What?

115
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,126
Is there a problem?

116
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,285
(What's going on?)

117
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:57,085
(Given Zhao Feiyang's reputation
in Tianxuan City now,)

118
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:59,246
(why would the Li family
invite him for dinner?)

119
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:01,205
(And they seem
to be having a great time.)

120
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:03,606
Yanran, what are you waiting for?

121
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:04,726
Your friend is here.

122
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,126
Won't you invite her to sit down?

123
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,445
Sorry, Bai Zhi.

124
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,046
I was absent-minded.

125
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:13,926
Since you're here,

126
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:15,445
let's eat together.

127
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:17,325
Have the kitchen make more dishes.

128
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,046
Yes.

129
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,166
I'd like to toast to you.

130
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,285
Okay.

131
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:25,246
Honey,

132
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:27,205
aren't you a bit drunk?

133
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:28,926
I can hold my liquor well.

134
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,085
Come on, pour it up.

135
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:35,325
I am drunk.

136
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:36,845
I am drunk.

137
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:37,965
I am drunk.

138
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:38,726
Already?

139
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:40,806
I can't hold the liquor.

140
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:42,366
Are you leaving now?

141
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:43,686
Please stay.

142
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:44,366
I'm fine.

143
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,366
Please eat more.

144
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,885
Mrs. Li's cooking is still great.

145
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,205
It tastes as good as ever.

146
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:04,845
Why are you looking at me?

147
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,166
Eat your meal.

148
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:24,885
Alright.

149
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,486
It's just a chicken drumstick.

150
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:29,285
Here.

151
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:31,246
Eat.

152
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:35,806
Are you

153
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,166
hiding something from me?

154
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:42,965
What could we possibly hide from you?

155
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:46,926
Bai Zhi,

156
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,046
didn't you say

157
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,845
there's a great place for cultivation?

158
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,325
Let's go together.

159
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:52,965
Are you changing the subject,

160
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,205
Yanran?

161
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:55,926
No.

162
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,285
Martial Assembly is coming.

163
00:06:57,686 --> 00:06:58,686
If we want to cultivate,

164
00:06:58,806 --> 00:07:00,445
we should both lose no time.

165
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:03,726
I planned to call you first

166
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:05,686
before calling Qiushui.

167
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,366
Her?

168
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:09,205
Then I'm not going.

169
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:10,126
I dislike her.

170
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:10,765
Then...

171
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:11,525
Then

172
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,806
we won't call her.

173
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:15,645
Anyway, Qiushui dislikes Zhao Feiyang.

174
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:17,405
Forget it.

175
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:19,606
Then let's go together.

176
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:21,486
Okay.

177
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,166
Eat the food.

178
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:34,405
Someone actually dared to break in here.

179
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,525
What kind of great place is this?

180
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:38,285
There are even bats.

181
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:51,686
You...

182
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,166
(What's going on?)

183
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:55,765
(Why is Zhao Feiyang
with Yanran and Bai Zhi?)

184
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,285
(And their relationship...)

185
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,405
D-Don't overthink it.

186
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:00,965
The thing...

187
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,246
is exactly what you think.

188
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:09,085
What do I think?

189
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:11,566
Qiushui,

190
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:13,486
just now outside,

191
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:14,606
we encountered bats.

192
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:15,726
So,

193
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:17,845
w-we just came in together.

194
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:21,046
Then how did the three of you

195
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:23,285
come in together?

196
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,366
Anyway,

197
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:27,166
it was a coincidence.

198
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:28,686
It really was a huge coincidence.

199
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:31,686
You two are indeed my good friends.

200
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,085
You went behind me

201
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:34,285
and brought this riffraff

202
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:35,885
to this deserted place.

203
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:37,285
Riffraff?

204
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:38,246
Chen Qiushui,

205
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:39,765
is it your new nickname for me?

206
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:40,885
Don't talk to me.

207
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:43,206
I feel disgusted just hearing you talk.

208
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:45,206
You...

209
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:48,925
scoundrel.

210
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,446
At a loss for words?

211
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:52,726
Can't think of anything?

212
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,285
You'd better hope not to meet me

213
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,405
at the Martial Assembly.

214
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:56,405
Otherwise,

215
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:58,126
I will make you

216
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:00,446
regret being born.

217
00:09:00,565 --> 00:09:01,366
I regret it already.

218
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:02,525
After the assembly,

219
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:03,726
before heading north,

220
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:04,885
annul our engagement.

221
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:06,645
You and I are incompatible.

222
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:07,405
What?

223
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:08,525
Annul our engagement.
