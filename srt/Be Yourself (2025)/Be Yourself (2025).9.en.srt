=Episode 9=

10
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,039
This sudden thunder.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,920
What happened, exactly?

12
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,639
Is Feiyang in some trouble?

13
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:05,319
Young Master.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,039
I'm really sorry.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,560
We didn't host you well this time.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
No problem.

17
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:11,720
Next time.

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,440
Next time.

19
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:14,000
We'll host you well.

20
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:18,919
All here!

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
Why stare at me?

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,199
I'm going home.

23
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:31,872
You!

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,240
You!

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,919
Take care, Young Master Zhao.

26
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:36,199
You brat.

27
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,399
This...

28
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,279
Feiyang.

29
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:51,960
So,

30
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,520
what happened between you

31
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:54,960
and City Lord Li Hongbin?

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Nothing much.

33
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,759
He just politely

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,279
invited me over for tea

35
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,520
and then politely sent me back.

36
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:06,240
You guys saw it.

37
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,559
He invited you for tea?

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,880
With the city guards

39
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,440
to our home?

40
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,439
I guess it's because

41
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,839
the Zhao family's known
for being so loyal.

42
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:18,800
He wanted to keep it formal.

43
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,559
Makes sense.

44
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,360
It was just a cup of tea with Feiyang.

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,999
I was worried something else was up.

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,719
Today, I must thank you ladies

47
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,480
and Master Xiao.

48
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,480
Glad everything's okay.

49
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,439
Happy to help.

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Master Zhao, no need to say thanks.

51
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,800
Zhao Feiyang.

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,520
I hope you can grow up.

53
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,240
Stop stressing your father out.

54
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,640
My wife's got a point.

55
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,960
What did you call me?

56
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,119
Wife!

57
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,719
You don't think

58
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,119
we came to help you today

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
because we care about you

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
and want to tie the knot?

61
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,279
Stop dreaming.

62
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,960
I just don't get it.

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,599
Why do you have such a problem with me?

64
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,599
Your actions disgust me.

65
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
Disgust?

66
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:08,800
What did I do?

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,279
What did you do?

68
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
You know it well.

69
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,640
I...

70
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,879
I...

71
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
What did I do?

72
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,432
I...

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I...

74
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,399
What did I do?

75
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,559
What did I do?

76
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,520
Luckily I got out of there.

77
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,350
This close to punching him

78
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,679
(Zhao Mansion)
right in front of his dad.

79
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,480
He's got one of those faces.

80
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,760
This is his home.

81
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,800
Just calm down.

82
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,679
He bailed on us

83
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:45,279
and ran away back then.

84
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,399
Now he's acting all innocent?

85
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,679
Seriously pisses me off.

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Plus, today

87
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,839
we had to save his skin again.

88
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:52,999
But this guy

89
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,559
can't even manage a 'thanks'.

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,240
Seriously messed up.

91
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Whatever.

92
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,159
Let's forget about him.

93
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:02,119
How about

94
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,640
I treat you to the lakeside boiled pork?

95
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Zhou's Boiled Pork?

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,159
Yup.

97
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,399
- Awesome, let's go.
- Okay.

98
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:09,439
Wait.

99
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:12,879
I've really enjoyed hanging out
with you both lately.

100
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,439
But with the Martial Assembly coming up,

101
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,240
I need to focus on prepping.

102
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,960
So I'm not going.

103
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,359
Are you competing
in the Martial Assembly too?

104
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,479
Sure.

105
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,799
I'm at the late stage
of the Martial Master training.

106
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,520
And I've got a Holy Lotus Seed.

107
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,399
With a little luck,

108
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,719
I might even break through
to Grandmaster!

109
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,239
I thought

110
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,159
I was getting a sister.

111
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
But it turns out

112
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:42,599
I'm getting a serious rival.

113
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:46,760
Thanks for looking out for me recently.

114
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,560
This Martial Assembly

115
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,239
could be it for me,

116
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
my chance to restore the Bai family.

117
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,680
So, I'm going to
give it everything I've got.

118
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,760
(Zhao Mansion)
If Bai Zhi's this motivated,

119
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,919
we can't slack off.

120
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:11,599
Yanran,

121
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,960
see you at the Assembly.

122
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,880
(These women are so career-driven.)

123
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,440
(But I'm just thinking about...)

124
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,120
Hey Miss Li.

125
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,200
Hold up a sec!

126
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:29,960
Oh, hey, it's you.

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,080
What's up?

128
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:37,719
Check this out.

129
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,760
What...

130
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,640
I got the beast core

131
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,839
when I killed a magic beast
in Beast Valley.

132
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,159
It's not top-tier,

133
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,799
but it's got some

134
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,039
decent spiritual power.

135
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,440
And it looks pretty cool.

136
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,599
Here, it's for you.

137
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Um,

138
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,080
I don't know if I should take it.

139
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,599
What's the harm?

140
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,560
It's just a little gift. Go on, take it.

141
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
I don't think so.

142
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,359
I'm engaged to your...

143
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,960
My brother?

144
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
You know

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,399
what Feiyang's like.

146
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,320
There's still time.

147
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:09,760
Who knows what'll happen

148
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
in the future, right?

149
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
Actually, I think Feiyang

150
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,039
is alright.

151
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,000
Miss Li, are you serious?

152
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,919
Everyone knows

153
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,680
he's a loser.

154
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,839
- Young Master.
- He...

155
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,279
As you see yourself
as part of the Zhaos,

156
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,640
why bad-mouthing your brother like that?

157
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,719
What does that make you?

158
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,520
(7 Days Until the Martial Assembly)
In case you get bored,

159
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,599
I brought Heng as your sparring partner.

160
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,624
Not bad.

161
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,359
Just a third-rank Martial Master.

162
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
He's got a ton of strength.

163
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,479
Looks like he's been working hard

164
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,719
hitting the weights.

165
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,919
Strength is the foundation
for practitioners.

166
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,880
Without it,

167
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,839
all those sword moves and martial arts

168
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,120
are just for show.

169
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:07,599
Feiyang,

170
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
your turn.

171
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,680
The weight is down to 300 jin now.

172
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:18,159
Give it a shot.

173
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
(I can't believe
I'm back to square one,)

174
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:21,920
(building up)

175
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,880
(basic strength
after a century of cultivation.)

176
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:25,800
(Guess it's time)

177
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,880
(for me to find
my long-lost original intention.)

178
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:10,640
300 is too much.

179
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,200
150 is more like it.

180
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,479
Wanna take more off?

181
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,000
You can't even move 300 jin.

182
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,479
It's gonna be a tough time.

183
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,359
Right, very tough.

184
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,159
Compared to you,

185
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,919
I'm just too weak.

186
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,320
Strength...

187
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,920
it all starts with 'qi',
so breathing is key.

188
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,479
You got to store as much air

189
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,160
as possible in your chest.

190
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,040
Spiritual energy is everywhere.

191
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,201
Even the air you breathe

192
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:47,560
has a little bit of it.

193
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
So, you need to channel that air

194
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,776
from your chest to every muscle.

195
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:52,320
Remember,

196
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
proper breathing

197
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,040
will make your qi stronger.

198
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,200
Your strength will naturally increase.

199
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,359
(I see.)

200
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,839
(Guess someone who's been flying)

201
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,719
(for too long forgot how to walk.)

202
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,440
Alright.

203
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
I'll give it another try.

204
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,519
You got this!

205
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,879
Still can't do it.

206
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
I tried my best.

207
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:24,864
Feiyang,

208
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,680
you're really letting Master Xiao down.

209
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,519
Not at all.

210
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,759
You did very well.

211
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,359
Rest a bit. Then keep training.

212
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,839
Sure.

213
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,400
(Is this loser some kind of treasure?)

214
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:49,239
(Today's training)

215
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,960
(felt like going back a hundred years.)

216
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,999
(That's how it feels
to find original intention.)

217
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,479
Congrats!

218
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,800
Today's training is complete.

219
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:58,239
Your strength is 300 jin.

220
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,440
We'll continue tomorrow.

221
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Continue tomorrow?

222
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,920
My bones are about to fall apart!

223
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,359
I'm done!

224
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
It's okay.

225
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:05,999
I'll heal you.

226
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,800
Why'd you bring me here?
