=Episode 1=

10
00:01:15,183 --> 00:01:16,463
The day has finally come.

11
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:23,743
It's the ascension trial

12
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,183
of the Supreme Elder.

13
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:28,422
Supreme Elder,

14
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,023
you must succeed.

15
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:38,903
Other cultivators

16
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:40,383
only take 12 thunder strikes.

17
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:42,103
I have taken 99 strikes.

18
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:47,823
There's more?

19
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:11,903
I'm doomed.

20
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:18,582
Supreme Elder.

21
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:20,983
We respectfully bid farewell to you.

22
00:02:23,182 --> 00:02:24,543
Pay respect.

23
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:26,943
Heaven has doomed the Zhao family

24
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,622
(Zhao Qin, Head of the Zhao family)
and left me with no descendants.

25
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:31,702
Have you heard?

26
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:32,783
The three elder sons

27
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,942
died at the North Border,

28
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:35,223
protecting their brother.

29
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:36,503
Exactly.

30
00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:38,022
I heard that he was still alive

31
00:02:38,182 --> 00:02:39,182
when they found him.

32
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:40,263
But he's beyond saving

33
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:41,543
without a Dantian.

34
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,422
Pay respect again.

35
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,422
I-I think he moved.

36
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:52,182
You must be mistaken.

37
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:55,182
Pay respect again.

38
00:02:58,702 --> 00:02:59,942
He moved again. I saw it.

39
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:01,022
See for yourself.

40
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:02,432
(Commemoration)

41
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,383
- The corpse reanimated!
- Run!

42
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:08,702
- The dead came back!
- Run!

43
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,022
(Zhao Feiyang, Zhao family's fourth son)
Young Master.

44
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:11,823
(Didn't I die from)

45
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:12,943
(the thunder trial?)

46
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:14,742
(Where am I?)

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,782
(Three months ago, North Border)

48
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:17,422
Feiyang.

49
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,182
Go home alive

50
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:20,422
(Zhao family's eldest son)
to preserve

51
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,823
our lineage.

52
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:24,022
No.

53
00:03:24,462 --> 00:03:25,462
Go.

54
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,223
Stay alive.

55
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,712
(Zhao family's second son)

56
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,344
(Zhao family's third son)

57
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:41,182
(I got transported)

58
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:42,343
(to another world)

59
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:44,022
(as Young Master Zhao.)

60
00:03:44,902 --> 00:03:45,462
(Heavens.)

61
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,022
(Why do you let me)

62
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:48,462
(live another life?)

63
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,422
Master, he has a shadow.

64
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:51,943
Young Master is not a ghost.

65
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:53,343
Young Master didn't die.

66
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,543
You brat.

67
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:06,142
You didn't die?

68
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:08,582
Master.

69
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:11,776
(Deng Zhong, steward of the Zhao family)

70
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:13,343
Deng Zhong, what's wrong?

71
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,462
Master.

72
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:16,022
Miss Chen, Miss Li, and Miss Bai

73
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:18,223
have been waiting for you

74
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:20,302
for a long time.

75
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:23,302
My three sons just died in battle.

76
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:24,422
I assume they came

77
00:04:24,502 --> 00:04:26,463
to call off the engagements.

78
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,302
They're not here
to call off the engagements,

79
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:32,102
but to fulfill them.

80
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:34,622
They're going to marry into our family.

81
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:37,502
Aren't they rubbing salt on my wound?

82
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,583
(Chun, Zhao Feiyang's maid)
My sons just died.

83
00:04:39,703 --> 00:04:41,622
Who are they going to marry?

84
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,062
Master.

85
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:56,543
Greetings, Master Zhao.

86
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:01,182
No need for formalities, ladies.

87
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:02,622
Please sit.

88
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:07,622
I heard

89
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:10,463
that you came to discuss
the engagements.

90
00:05:12,023 --> 00:05:13,663
My youngest son

91
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:15,862
narrowly escaped death.

92
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,542
But that good-for-nothing...

93
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:19,622
I...

94
00:05:20,543 --> 00:05:21,543
(Chen Qiushui, Prestigious lady)
Master Zhao.

95
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,463
Your sons died at the North Border
fighting the demon clan.

96
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:25,944
If we call off

97
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:27,062
the engagements now,

98
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:29,742
the people of Tianxuan City would think

99
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,742
that we're stabbing you in the back.

100
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:35,302
(Li Yanran, Top Beauty of Tianxuan City)
I agree with Qiushui.

101
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:36,302
(Bai Zhi of Bai Family)

102
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:37,382
Me...

103
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:39,302
Me too.

104
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,543
You don't despise my useless son?

105
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:43,942
D-Does he really deserve you?

106
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:45,382
Of course not.

107
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:48,382
Your late sons are known to be

108
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:49,502
great cultivators.

109
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:51,382
But your fourth son Zhao Feiyang

110
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:53,182
was born without a Dantian.

111
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:55,102
He couldn't even cultivate.

112
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:56,023
In comparison,

113
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:57,143
he is nothing like

114
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:58,463
his three brothers.

115
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:00,062
Since you look down on me,

116
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:01,862
why do you want to marry me?

117
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,463
Is there any prerequisite?

118
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:08,703
Shut up.

119
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,583
You don't get to speak here.

120
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:15,143
Qiushui, please go on.

121
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:19,942
There is still a month

122
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:21,822
until the wedding.

123
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:23,343
If he manages to enter

124
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:24,622
the Martial Realm

125
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:26,742
and surpass the three of us,

126
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:29,622
then we will agree to marry him.

127
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:31,343
Otherwise,

128
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:32,663
he proves to be hopeless.

129
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:35,023
And we have to call off the engagements.

130
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:35,742
See?

131
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,262
I knew it.

132
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:40,382
Qiushui.

133
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:42,543
Isn't this a bit too far-fetched?

134
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,463
He hasn't reached
the Martial Realm in 18 years.

135
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,062
How is he going to surpass you

136
00:06:48,262 --> 00:06:49,463
in one month?

137
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:52,143
Let's take you for example.

138
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:54,543
You're in the third stage
of the Martial Realm.

139
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:56,103
Even my eldest son

140
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,262
couldn't necessarily surpass you.

141
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:00,783
L-Let alone him.

142
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,262
I was a Martial Master three months ago.

143
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:08,023
Now I am a Grandmaster.

144
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:17,223
(Fourth stage of the Martial Realm)
You've reached the fourth stage?

145
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:18,783
I'm still in the third stage.

146
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,583
I'm sorry, Master Zhao.

147
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:26,983
Qiushui is doing this for all of us.

148
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:28,983
It hurts our reputation

149
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,862
to call off the engagements.

150
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:32,463
It will be hard for us

151
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,742
to live here in Tianxuan.

152
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,822
For the sake
of our long-standing friendship,

153
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,302
please understand us.

154
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:43,703
Actually, I...

155
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:47,143
It's okay.

156
00:07:47,463 --> 00:07:49,622
I understand.

157
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,223
My father understands you.

158
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:54,663
But have you shown him any respect?

159
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,942
None of your parents

160
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:02,102
showed up for this serious discussion.

161
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,822
They let you handle this

162
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:06,182
because they feel embarrassed, huh?

163
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:07,422
Come again?

164
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:09,343
You pretend to be nice

165
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:10,342
and ask me

166
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:12,143
to do something impossible.

167
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:15,783
Does it make you feel less shameless?

168
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:17,143
You...

169
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:19,262
(He usually acts timid)

170
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:21,583
(but today he stood his ground.)

171
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:24,663
I didn't want to make things look ugly

172
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:25,822
for old times' sake.

173
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,422
But you're so rude.

174
00:08:27,822 --> 00:08:28,903
Well then.

175
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:30,703
I'm here to call off the engagement.

176
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:33,262
I have great ambitions.

177
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,982
I won't waste my time on a loser

178
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:36,062
like you.

179
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:38,983
The Chen family calls off

180
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:40,823
the engagement.

181
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,583
The Li family calls off

182
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:44,303
the engagement.

183
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:47,782
- The...
- Wait.

184
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:51,183
Didn't we agree on this?

185
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:52,622
On what?

186
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,142
If I can enter the Martial Realm

187
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:55,262
and surpass you,

188
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:56,902
you have to marry me.

189
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:59,943
How come you've changed your mind

190
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:01,262
so fast?

191
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:03,862
Fine.

192
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:05,262
In that case,

193
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:06,742
we have a deal.

194
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,182
There will be

195
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:10,103
a Martial Assembly in a month.

196
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:11,262
The winner

197
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:13,423
will become the Demon-Slaying Marshal.

198
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,382
We will participate

199
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,662
although we are girls.

200
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:18,703
I dare you to join us.

201
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:26,823
Do you

202
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:28,983
really think you can surpass them

203
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,022
in a month?

204
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:33,943
Nothing is impossible.

205
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:37,502
Who knows?

206
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:41,823
Master, the Fifth Lord is back.
