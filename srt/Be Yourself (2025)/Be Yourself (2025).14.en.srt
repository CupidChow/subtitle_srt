10
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:01,005
Congratulations, Feiyang.

11
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:02,724
Feiyang,

12
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:05,685
it seems I'll soon have a sister-in-law.

13
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:07,804
Heng,

14
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:11,364
when will you find me
a sister-in-law too?

15
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:13,165
Bring her back,

16
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:14,484
let's all have some fun.

17
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:16,484
Well, not now.

18
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:18,245
I haven't met the right one yet.

19
00:01:18,404 --> 00:01:19,404
By the way, Godfather,

20
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:21,445
didn't we say earlier

21
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:23,085
that before Master Xiao returns,

22
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,165
I would train with Feiyang?

23
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:26,525
We're all here today,

24
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:27,725
so why don't we...

25
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:29,364
Forget it.

26
00:01:29,564 --> 00:01:30,885
The registration is tomorrow.

27
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:33,525
What's the use of cramming
at the last minute?

28
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:34,284
Besides,

29
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:36,204
I want him to stay off the battlefield.

30
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:37,965
The purpose of the Martial Assembly

31
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:40,965
is to select leaders
for the demon-slaying team.

32
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:44,764
Our family has already sacrificed
too much

33
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:46,045
for Haotian Empire.

34
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:49,404
Feiyang's task now

35
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:51,085
is to marry and have children.

36
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:54,525
That's the result I most want to see.

37
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,844
Although a good man should
have ambitions beyond his home,

38
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:00,404
this time,

39
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:02,284
it's not necessary, is it?

40
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:04,045
What do you say, Feiyang?

41
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:06,004
Father,

42
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,204
I'll go to the North Border.

43
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:08,764
You!

44
00:02:09,284 --> 00:02:10,764
What if something happens to you?

45
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,325
Have you thought about me?

46
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:14,644
I'm sorry, Father,

47
00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:16,244
I understand you,

48
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:18,924
but if I don't go,

49
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,405
the whole Tianxuan City

50
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:22,125
will mock me for being a coward.

51
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:24,045
How is that a real man?

52
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:25,364
But...

53
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:27,244
(You sure can talk nicely.)

54
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:29,804
Father, don't worry,

55
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:31,244
I'm not being irrational.

56
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:33,125
I won't die on the battlefield,

57
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:36,364
forcing you
to send off your child again.

58
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:40,885
Well,

59
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,244
never mind.

60
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,405
If you had such an idea earlier,

61
00:02:47,964 --> 00:02:49,364
how good it would be.

62
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:51,165
(Since I have come to this world,)

63
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,285
(then I am Zhao Feiyang of this world.)

64
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:55,845
(My brothers gave their lives for me.)

65
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:57,565
(This debt must be repaid.)

66
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:00,165
(To ensure foolproof results,)

67
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:02,644
(it is still necessary to restore
the inner core.)

68
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,005
Since you have such great ambition,

69
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:09,405
why don't we start training now?

70
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:12,964
Heng, you as my sparring partner?

71
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:14,684
Is it necessary?

72
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:16,005
It is necessary.

73
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:18,125
Very necessary.

74
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:18,924
Think about it,

75
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:20,764
if you learn a bit more now,

76
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:22,005
then on the battlefield,

77
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:23,725
you'll be better able
to protect yourself.

78
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:24,484
Right?

79
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,565
Practice starts tomorrow.

80
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:29,764
Since Father said so,

81
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:30,565
let's train.

82
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:31,285
Good.

83
00:03:31,405 --> 00:03:33,964
(Just watch how I'll beat you,
you useless thing.)

84
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,565
Time is tight.

85
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:38,325
I can't start from scratch
like Master Xiao did.

86
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:39,364
Feiyang,

87
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:41,845
I'm going to train you in real combat.

88
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:42,725
Master,

89
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:45,125
isn't the real combat too dangerous?

90
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:47,964
Heng,

91
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,405
just make sure you don't hurt Feiyang.

92
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,165
Other than that, do what you need.

93
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:54,804
Is it necessary to do this?

94
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:56,204
Of course, it's necessary.

95
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:58,644
Real combat is the best way to train.

96
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:01,484
Feiyang, don't be afraid,

97
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:03,165
I won't hurt you.

98
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:04,325
I'm not afraid,

99
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,045
I'm just...

100
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:07,165
What?

101
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:08,524
You brat,

102
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:10,084
yesterday, you were talking big.

103
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:11,405
What now?

104
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,684
Scared?

105
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:14,565
I'm not.

106
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:16,684
I'm just afraid
of hurting Heng's feelings.

107
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:19,204
Hurt my feelings?

108
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:20,405
Don't worry, Feiyang.

109
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:23,205
I won't despise you for being dumb
like Master Xiao does.

110
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:24,605
After all, we are brothers.

111
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,364
I will be very patient.

112
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:30,525
This sword is called Jingyu.

113
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:34,085
It is forged with cold iron
from Tianshan.

114
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:37,124
When drawn,
the sword is like ice and frost.

115
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:38,605
When swung,

116
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:41,645
the sword energy carries
a bone-chilling coldness.

117
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:43,405
Feiyang,

118
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:45,804
if you can't withstand it later,

119
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:47,004
just shout "stop".

120
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:49,564
I will stop immediately.

121
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:51,364
Is that so?

122
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:53,004
(If not for Father's)

123
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:54,605
(decade of father-son ties with you,)

124
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:56,965
(I wouldn't spare you ingrate.)

125
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:59,205
(But it's appropriate
to give you a lesson.)

126
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:01,845
(Letting you wake up a bit
is a good thing.)

127
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:03,165
Then...

128
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:11,645
This sword,

129
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:13,484
is a large iron sword.

130
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:15,765
When drawn, it hums and buzzes.

131
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:16,924
It could break anytime.

132
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:20,965
When swung, it sheds
a lot of iron filings and rust.

133
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:24,045
If you can't handle it later,

134
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:25,725
just shout "Feiyang, have mercy",

135
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:28,804
and I will stop immediately.

136
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:30,804

Why do I feel like

143
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:55,205
Heng is at a disadvantage?

144
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:56,364
Master,

145
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:59,165
I think Heng's holding back.

146
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:02,405
That's why it feels like he's losing.

147
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:04,884
Surely you know

148
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:06,845
what level Feiyang is, right?

149
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:08,165
Fair point.

150
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:10,884
Heng is nice,

151
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:12,444
making it easy for Feiyang.

152
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:13,924
Master, that's not right.

153
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:15,324
Young Master is very skilled.

154
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:16,845
He will definitely win.

155
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:19,444
Him, win?

156
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:22,004
Girl, stop speaking nonsense.

157
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:24,484
You've been working for him
since little.

158
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:26,405
Don't you know

159
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:27,045

160
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:27,765
But

161
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:29,804
in my eyes, he is invincible.

162
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:33,645

- Heng,

173
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:10,684
- (How is he so good?)
- don't go easy on him.

174
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:12,845
Otherwise, how would Feiyang improve?

175
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:17,205
You can be a little more aggressive.

00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,205
is this all you've got?

188
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:50,765
♪He gracefully started a new life♪

189
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:51,765
Feiyang!

190
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:57,045
Stop!

191
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,045
Why?

192
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,285
Heng, you've gone too far.

193
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:03,405
Too far!

194
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:05,364
(I went too far?)

195
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:07,684
(What? It's he who went too far!)

196
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:11,645
Sorry.

197
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,285
Just now, I felt that

198
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,244
you used a tremendous amount
of spiritual power.

199
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,205
Feiyang isn't even a martial artist.

200
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,205
This is not right.

201
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,124
(If I didn't use spiritual power,)

202
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:22,484
(I would be dead now!)

203
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,045
(Zhao Feiyang,)

204
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:24,884
(what exactly)

205
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:26,085
(is going on with you?)

206
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:28,285
(Was it an illusion?)

207
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:29,696
(Yes.)

208
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,725
(He isn't even a martial artist!)

209
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:34,605
I...

210
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:38,285
I didn't mean it.

211
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:41,564
Fortunately,
I didn't cause too much trouble.

212
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:42,844
Forget it.

213
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:43,844
It's okay.

214
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,084
Feiyang, are you okay?

215
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:48,724
I'm fine.

216
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,125
Heng,

217
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,564
shall we continue?

218
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,405
No.

219
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:53,525
Why not?

220
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:56,485
Weren't you just insisting
on helping me practice?

221
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:58,645
I...

222
00:08:58,964 --> 00:08:59,964
I suddenly

223
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:01,564
feel a bit unwell.

224
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:04,165
I want to rest for a bit.

225
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:05,285
You're not feeling well?

226
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:06,365
How?

227
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:07,765
Do you need a doctor?

228
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:09,285
No, no.

229
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:11,365
Godfather, Feiyang,

230
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:12,885
I'll take my leave.

231
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:14,765
Rest well.

232
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:16,684
Have a good rest.

233
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:20,045
Feiyang,

234
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,125
have you really decided

235
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:22,405
to register tonight?

236
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:23,525
Father,

237
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:25,765
I've already made my mind. No changing.

238
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,285
No room for reconsideration?

239
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:31,084
No.

240
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,005
Alright.

241
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:34,964
I know you're upset.

242
00:09:35,564 --> 00:09:38,125
Everyone belittles you
and looks down on you,

243
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,604
Even I sometimes dislike you.

244
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:42,765
But

245
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:44,964
that's not my true intention.

246
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:47,084
Alright,

247
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:49,245
why suddenly say such mushy words?

248
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:51,005
It's not like you at all.

249
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:53,045
As a father,

250
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:55,485
can't I express my heartfelt thoughts
to my son,

251
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:56,964
and say what's on my mind?

252
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,564
Yes,

253
00:09:58,645 --> 00:09:59,645
you can.

254
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:00,564
Actually,

255
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:01,924
honors

256
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,084
and achievements

257
00:10:03,444 --> 00:10:04,564
are not important.

258
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,005
What matters is

259
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:09,525
that you are safe and well.

260
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:13,204
I understand, Father.
