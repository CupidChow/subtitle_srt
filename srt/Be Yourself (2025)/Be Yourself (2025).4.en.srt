=Episode 4=

10
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,811
Yanran can't do it either.

11
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,490
That's so difficult.

12
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:34,210
It seems I'm not qualified.

13
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,850
Now our only hope lies with Qiushui.

14
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:39,051
Don't belittle yourself.

15
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,731
I'm not sure whether
I can make it bloom.

16
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,171
Let me try.

17
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,891
Qiushui might succeed.

18
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,210
Succeed?

19
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:28,690
You're not up to it.

20
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,530
What a pity.

21
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,370
She couldn't make it bloom.

22
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,690
It seems the fated one isn't here today.

23
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,051
Anyone else want to try?

24
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,370
If not,

25
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,611
I will seal the Holy Land

26
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,530
and let it bloom naturally.

27
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,090
Master, when will it

28
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,051
bloom naturally?

29
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,331
Maybe tomorrow.

30
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,970
Maybe in three to five years.

31
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,611
Maybe never.

32
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,210
Never?

33
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,370
So long!

34
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,571
Young Master, why not try?

35
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,770
Why bother? It's pointless.

36
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,891
The Holy Tree won't bloom today.

37
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:58,530
Let's go.

38
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,530
Just try.

39
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:00,171
Try it.

40
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:00,891
No.

41
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:02,611
At least you have some self-awareness.

42
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,490
Are you mocking me?

43
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,650
You're my fiancée.

44
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,731
Resent your husband so much?

45
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:19,370
Shut up! I'm not your...

46
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,611
Qiushui means

47
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:24,210
you'd waste your effort.

48
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,131
Everyone knows your cultivation level.

49
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,851
Don't embarrass yourself.

50
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:29,970
If you insist...

51
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:32,210
I must try it

52
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,810
anyway.

53
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,370
Play the fool if you wish.

54
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:36,291
Go ahead.

55
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:37,451
Fool?

56
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,051
None of you

57
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,490
made it bloom either.

58
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,731
If I am a fool,

59
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:44,571
then everyone here

60
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:46,331
is a fool!

61
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,291
You!

62
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,770
You!

63
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,051
Forget it, Qiushui.

64
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,690
At the Zhao Mansion,

65
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:53,851
we already saw

66
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,210
how sharp-tongued he is.

67
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,411
Arguing with him

68
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,011
makes no sense.

69
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,611
Anyway, the bet is made.

70
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:02,331
After a month,

71
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:05,011
we'll sever ties with you.

72
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:08,011
You just...

73
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,770
Who is this young man?

74
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:24,611
(Zhou Jie, the Fourth Prince of Haotian Royal Family)
Radiant and peerless,

75
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,010
clearly extraordinary.

76
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,330
His aura...

77
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,810
I can't discern his cultivation level.

78
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,411
If even you can't see through him,

79
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,930
he...

80
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:35,651
He is very likely

81
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,531
a Fifth-rank Grandmaster.

82
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:40,971
Fifth-rank?

83
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,411
But he looks so young,

84
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,450
about the same age as us.

85
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:47,171
There is always someone stronger.

86
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:49,411
I still

87
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,130
have much to learn.

88
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,091
(To find such beauty)

89
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,211
(in this backwater.)

90
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,450
(It's worth the trip.)

91
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,450
Young Master.

92
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,171
He is so handsome.

93
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,330
Pretty boy.

94
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,091
I'm Zhou Jie,
the Fourth Prince of Haotian.

95
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,291
I just arrived at Tianxuan City.

96
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,890
Sorry

97
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,771
for the disturbance.

98
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,291
A prince?

99
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,010
No wonder he's so powerful

100
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:22,531
in such a young age.

101
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:26,171
Both fourth-born,

102
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:29,010
yet the two are worlds apart.

103
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:31,051
Your Highness!

104
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:33,171
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

105
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:34,731
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

106
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:41,051
Who are you?

107
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:43,490
Any grievance to me?

108
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,250
Me?

109
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,250
What did I do

110
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:54,130
to earn your ire?

111
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,930
All others bowed

112
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:57,490
upon learning my status.

113
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,651
Why didn't you?

114
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:01,570
What is this fool doing?

115
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,930
Why provoke him?

116
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:06,611
Should we help him?

117
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,851
Wait and see.

118
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,450
My name is

119
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,370
Zhao Feiyang.

120
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:19,450
Zhao Feiyang?

121
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:23,171
Kneel now,

122
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,531
and I will

123
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:26,930
pardon your insolence.

124
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,851
The Fourth Prince

125
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,890
seems magnanimous.

126
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,051
I don't think so.

127
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,450
Arrogant, more like.

128
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,810
After all, he's noble.

129
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,570
Having some arrogance

130
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:40,051
is quite normal.

131
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:41,211
Kneel?

132
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:44,051
To you?

133
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:45,411
What do you mean?

134
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:47,051
Say that again.

135
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,291
Everyone knows that
the Zhao family is full of loyal

136
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:50,450
and brave heroes.

137
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,010
As Haotian Lord decreed,

138
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:54,051
we bear exemption
from bowing to royalty.

139
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,570
Your Highness,

140
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,731
don't you know that?

141
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,411
Or you are so powerful

142
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:03,370
that you can defy the Lord's will?

143
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:04,531
Nonsense!

144
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,091
I never meant that.

145
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:08,010
He wields

146
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:10,091
his few advantages masterfully.

147
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,810
He is not only sharp-tongued,

148
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,450
but also cunning.

149
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,330
If he gets more cultivation,

150
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,690
we will

151
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,010
fall into his hands.

152
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:21,930
I remembered who you are.

153
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,810
That useless fourth son,

154
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,051
the only one of the Zhao family
who returned alive

155
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,890
from the North Border.

156
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,690
I am the fourth son.

157
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,291
Why added the word "useless"?

158
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,570
Your Highness,

159
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,250
you should reorganize your words.

160
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,130
Lest people think

161
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:40,690
royalty lacks manners.

162
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,330
I won't waste breath on trash.

163
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,411
Everyone, I came here

164
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,171
to see the Holy Bodhi Tree.

165
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,291
And also preparing

166
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,611
for the Martial Assembly next month.

167
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,570
At that time,

168
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,890
I'll contend for the
Demon-Slaying Marshal post

169
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,211
to purge the North Border.

170
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,010
Even prince marches to war.

171
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,130
The Lord is truly serious this time.

172
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:19,570
Today, with my presence,

173
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:23,490
the Holy Tree will surely bloom for me.

174
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:44,371
It really is about to bloom.

175
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:45,771
How annoying!

176
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,850
The Holy Tree of Tianxuan City

177
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,210
is blooming for an outsider?

178
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,810
Don't say that, Qiushui.

179
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,291
He is of the royal family,
not really an outsider.

180
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,570
Do you fancy him?

181
00:08:58,651 --> 00:08:59,651
Nonsense.

182
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:02,131
I'm engaged.

183
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,970
How could this happen?

184
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:12,411
Your Highness, impressive!

185
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:15,531
It seems

186
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,651
the Fourth Prince can't do it.

187
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:19,051
In that case,

188
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:20,690
Tian Xuan's honor

189
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:22,491
isn't totally lost.

190
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,850
Elder Zhichan,

191
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:25,051
let me try again.

192
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:27,450
One failure, a hundred won't change it.

193
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,531
