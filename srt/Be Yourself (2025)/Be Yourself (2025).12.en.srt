=Episode 12=

10
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,253
Right! Let's team up.

11
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,092
Go to the 21st floor.

12
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:03,772
I'm a fast runner since childhood.

13
00:01:04,092 --> 00:01:06,253
With you two here, I won't die.

14
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:08,452
I just want to broaden my horizons.

15
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:10,212
Pretty please.

16
00:01:15,932 --> 00:01:16,932
Ask Qiushui.

17
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,533
Fine.

18
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:22,012
You're lucky today.

19
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:24,093
We'll start from the 18th floor.

20
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:25,572
That ensures your safety.

21
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:27,652
Once you get some resources,
leave immediately.

22
00:01:27,852 --> 00:01:28,652
Got it?

23
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:29,333
I...

24
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:31,453
I can go to the 21st!

25
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,492
You...

26
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:35,412
Greed will be your downfall.

27
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:37,772
She's willing to help
despite past grievances.

28
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:38,932
You better shut up.

29
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:47,053
Honorable Elders,

30
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,173
Chen Qiushui requests
to challenge the tower.

31
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:53,533
(Heaven-reaching Tower, Elder Tian and Di)
Young ones, here to challenge?

32
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:55,852
Which floor have you reached?

33
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:56,652
Eighteen.

34
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:58,012
- Eighteen?
- Eighteen?

35
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,012
Di, look.

36
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:02,053
Are girls nowadays

37
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,813
all dressed so maturely?

38
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:06,453
Tian, what are you thinking?

39
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:10,093
They mean the 18th floor!

40
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:11,973
It's a misunderstanding.

41
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,693
I thought you were eighteen.

42
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:16,853
Well, don't be greedy.

43
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,492
Know your limits.

44
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:20,013
Before entering,

45
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,372
we have one more thing to give you.

46
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:26,532
Di, let's take it out.

47
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:31,413
This jade slip, you must keep it.

48
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:35,013
To exit, you touch each other

49
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:37,573
and crush it. Then

50
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:39,853
- you'll retreat safely together.
- Safely together.

51
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:44,733
Understood.

52
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:48,173
Open!

53
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:49,173
Open!

54
00:02:58,092 --> 00:02:59,092
Open.

55
00:03:30,613 --> 00:03:33,092
Those guarding the 18th floor
are Soul Armors.

56
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:34,652
Killing them

57
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:36,492
might yield refined iron.

58
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,293
If lucky, you might

59
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:41,613
take it out

60
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:43,212
to forge a good weapon.

61
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:44,812
After all, you don't even

62
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:46,252
have a proper one to use.

63
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:55,293
You actually considered me?

64
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:57,613
You're quite nice.

65
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,972
Keep it up.

66
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:26,293
This place...

67
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:28,332
Must be built by some mighty cultivator.

68
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:31,812
The formations connect
to spiritual veins.

69
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:38,653
These spirit monsters will

70
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:40,452
regenerate after death.

71
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:43,892
Infinitely reusable.

72
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:51,492
Bold and avant-garde.

73
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,132
He thinks he's shopping?

74
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:57,173
Utterly useless!
What do you expect him to do?

75
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:07,773
This place

76
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:10,173
requires clearing
to unlock the next floor's teleport.

77
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:15,053
Clever formations.

78
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:19,613
Luckily, I've seen much in my past life.

79
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,533
I can solve it.

80
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:32,853
Done.

81
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:37,892
What are you doing?

82
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:42,012
I'm off now. Bye!

83
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:55,213
What's going on?

84
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:56,372
Where is he?

85
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,613
Might be pulled to the next floor.

86
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:01,812
How could it be?

87
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:03,452
The teleport shouldn't activate

88
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:04,932
without killing the spirits!

89
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:05,932
I don't know.

90
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:07,452
Must be a malfunction.

91
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:11,932
He's not even a warrior.

92
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:13,332
Teleported alone to the 19th

93
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:14,533
without the jade slip?

94
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:15,932
He'll die!

95
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:18,132
(Ten Nine)
We need to speed up.

96
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:19,372
With his cultivation,

97
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:20,492
he won't last so long!

98
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:21,653
We can't help him.

99
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:22,332
No.

100
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:23,332
He can't die here.

101
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:24,572
I brought him in.

102
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,372
If he dies in the tower,

103
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:27,542
(Five Four Three Two One)
people may think that

104
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:28,733
I killed him deliberately

105
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:30,053
to break off the engagement!

106
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:31,053
Troublesome.

107
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:42,733
Oh, where's the Beast Core?

108
00:06:46,093 --> 00:06:47,853
Looks like it was just taken away.

109
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,132
Who did this?

110
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:52,213
Reaching the 33rd floor...

111
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:53,973
Their cultivation must be immense.

112
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:55,492
Even faster than me?

113
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:58,572
The core reforms only every seven years.

114
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:00,733
In seven years,

115
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:02,572
this body will be beyond help.

116
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:13,932
Retreat, Qiushui.

117
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:15,773
The 25th is beyond us.

118
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:16,572
But...

119
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:17,332
No buts.

120
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:18,533
He might be dead already.

121
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,932
It's not worth
risking our lives for him.

122
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:23,132
Zhao Feiyang.

123
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:24,973
You brought this on yourself.

124
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,173
What's going on?

125
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:46,372
Why's this King Cobra
suddenly so strong?

126
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,132
It mutated.

127
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,293
Qiushui, quick!

128
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:49,452
Crush the jade slip!

129
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:53,733
Watch out!

130
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,733
Qiushui!

131
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:04,932
Qiushui!

132
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:06,173
I'll go get help.

133
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:17,053
This is...

134
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:22,413
Got the Beast Core.

135
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,413
Master Xiao, impressive.

136
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,293
Broke through the 33rd

137
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:29,452
all by yourself.

138
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:31,012
- Right.
- Right.

139
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:33,053
With fifth-rank cultivation,

140
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:35,332
she reached the 33rd.

141
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:37,692
The only one in a century!

142
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:39,452
Thanks for the praise, seniors.

143
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:41,212
You flattered us.

144
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:42,452
Strength reigns.

145
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:43,133
Yes.

146
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:43,893
You are

147
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:45,893
- our senior.
- Our senior.

148
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:51,572
See?

149
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:52,812
Master Xiao has left.

150
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:54,533
You scared her away.

151
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:56,812
You looked creepy!

152
00:08:56,932 --> 00:08:58,653
- Creepy?
- You're creepy.

153
00:08:58,773 --> 00:08:59,852
You're the creepy one.

154
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:00,812
I'm creepy?

155
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:01,932
Of course!

156
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:03,013
You!

157
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:05,893
Young man,

158
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,452
why did you come out alone?

159
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:09,692
Where are the other two?

160
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,253
There was a mutation on the 25th.

161
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:15,013
I'm afraid...

162
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:16,852
Well... Qiushui...

163
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:18,692
Poor Chen Qiushui.

164
00:09:19,053 --> 00:09:20,253
A genius

165
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:23,413
fallen in the Heaven-reaching Tower.

166
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:26,253
So, you know,

167
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:29,533
Heaven-reaching Tower
is great for cultivation,

168
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:33,653
but it devoured too many lives.

169
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:34,932
Exactly.

170
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:36,293
Can you go save them?

171
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:37,812
There might still be time!

172
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:38,612
Well...

173
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:40,773
You don't know, man.

174
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,133
We guard the tower,

175
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,293
but cannot interfere.

176
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:45,852
Right.

177
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,253
That's why

178
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:48,972
we've never challenged it.

179
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:51,332
And we can't enter any floor

180
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:53,852
at will.

181
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:55,293
About your request,

182
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:57,452
we can't help.

183
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:58,572
We can't help.

184
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:00,293
What about Zhao Feiyang?

185
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:04,493
(Useless fools.)

186
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,253
Wait.

187
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:07,852
Are you off?

188
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:11,452
When challengers die,

189
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:13,493
they will be teleported out.

190
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:14,373
You'll need

191
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:16,133
to collect the bodies then.

192
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:17,773
Collect their bodies.

193
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:19,533
(I'll shift the blame to Zhao Feiyang.)

194
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:21,212
(Otherwise, the Chen family)

195
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:22,332
(will target me.)

196
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,533
Let his family handle this.

197
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,692
- You...
- What?

198
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:28,173
He just left?

199
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:29,332
No loyalty!

200
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:30,653
No honor!

201
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:40,173
Is it true

202
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,013
that I'm going to die here?

203
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,133
No.

204
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:48,053
Darn it!

205
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:51,413
I've trained for years.

206
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,612
I didn't even get to slay demons,

207
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,253
yet I am about to die here.

208
00:10:58,293 --> 00:10:59,293
I won't accept this.

209
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:01,972
I won't accept this!
