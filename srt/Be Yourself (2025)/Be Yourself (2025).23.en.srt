Get down.

Shoo!

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,260
Dad.

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,820
Get down.

27
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,019
Bai Zhi, don't get ahead of yourself.

28
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,299
You just hit fourth rank.

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,780
No way you can match a sixth rank.

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,579
I'm feeling

31
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,859
totally unstoppable right now!

32
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,180
(I can't tap into
my locked thunder tribulation now.)

33
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,540
(But I can lend it to Bai Zhi
for a moment.)

34
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,019
(Do her a solid.)

35
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Good.

36
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,139
Impressive courage.

37
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,219
Alright then,

38
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:11,980
I'll play along.

39
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:13,379
Check out this!

40
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,379
Zhao Feiyang.

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,659
What did you just do?

42
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:46,659
How'd Bai Zhi suddenly get so strong?

43
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,780
I

44
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,259
am not going to tell you.

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,460
You!

46
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,140
Fine.

47
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:03,140
Even so,

48
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,180
Bai Zhi is still at a disadvantage.

49
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:06,752
A sixth-rank Martial Sovereign

50
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,180
is in a different league.

51
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:12,620
Are you seriously
the top prodigy of Tianxuan City?

52
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,219
Can't even see

53
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,300
who's winning.

54
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,419
What a joke of a title.

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,900
You!

56
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
She's actually this good.

57
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,659
This young girl's got something.

58
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,740
Lord Ge, what's gotten into you?

59
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,900
(I actually got hit!)

60
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,819
(What is this terrifying thunder power?)

61
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,900
(I can win. I can!)

62
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,699
(With this power Zhao Feiyang gave me,)

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
(I can win!)

64
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:08,979
(How'd that power)

65
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,060
(wind up in her?)

66
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:17,900
Ge Hong.

67
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,499
Today's the day I get my revenge.

68
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,180
I, a sixth-rank Martial Sovereign,

69
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,219
survived various
life-or-death situations.

70
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:24,419
Want to kill me?

71
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,580
No way.

72
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,619
Meet your maker!

73
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:13,739
Bai Zhi, are you okay?

74
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,099
How are you?

75
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,500
All your fault, Zhao Feiyang!

76
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:19,859
If not for you,

77
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,940
this would never happen!

78
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:22,299
If not for you,

79
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,820
how else would she's gotten
her revenge, huh?

80
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:27,619
Gotten

81
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:30,659
her revenge?

82
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:46,979
Think you can kill me?

83
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,340
Dream on!

84
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,780
I've been all over the map for 30 years.

85
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,580
Never going to lose to some nobody
like you.

86
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,340
Well...

87
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,700
Ge Hong's fine.

88
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,700
Still.

89
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,900
Really?

90
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:01,219
Take another look.

91
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:03,500
Today, I'm going to end you.

92
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:24,768
What?

93
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:26,179
How'd you pull that off?

94
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,900
Zhao Feiyang.

95
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:31,219
What did you do?

96
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:32,299
I

97
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,059
am not going to tell you.

98
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
You!

99
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:42,739
(Oh no.)

100
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,299
(I underestimated that power.)

101
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,020
(Even a sixth-rank Martial Sovereign
is no match.)

102
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,020
(Looks like)

103
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,940
(Zhao Feiyang might be capable of
shaking up the royal family.)

104
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:52,859
(I need to)

105
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,500
(report it to my father.)

106
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:02,940
Domain Lord Ge Hong is gone.

107
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,299
Bai Zhi wins.

108
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:07,179
Dad.

109
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,099
Mom.

110
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:10,859
Grandpa.

111
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:12,659
Grandma.

112
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,900
Did you see it?

113
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:18,260
I finally avenged you.

114
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,859
(Bai Zhi is the youngest of the three.)

115
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:23,299
(Much tougher inside.)

116
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,020
(Carrying that deep-seated hatred.)

117
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,659
(Now avenged, finally.)

118
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,340
(She must have had)

119
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,140
(a difficult time these years.)

120
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,619
Father.

121
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,059
That Zhao Feiyang showed disrespect
for the royal family.

122
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,659
His real power

123
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:38,900
is even unfathomable.

124
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:39,940
This guy is

125
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,500
a dangerous wildcard.

126
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,900
Dad, please go and take him yourself.

127
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:46,859
Ge Hong, The Southern Domain Lord,

128
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:50,219
actually died because of
his special power.

129
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,099
Luckily, he doesn't have a Dantian.

130
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,859
If that power ever gets into Dantian,

131
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,820
I'm afraid no one on Tianwu Continent

132
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,299
could stand a chance.

133
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Guess I have to go

134
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:05,059
handle this myself, then.

135
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,020
Bai Zhi.

136
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,659
His tactics were cheap.

137
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,820
It was dishonorable!

138
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,340
Nonsense!

139
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
Nonsense!

140
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Bai Zhi.

141
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:22,859
How can you even...

142
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,299
Zhao Feiyang helped me get revenge.

143
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
He's done me a favor.

144
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:29,859
Qiushui.

145
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,219
Please don't talk bad about him
around me.

146
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,900
But...

147
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Qiushui.

148
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,739
How many times do I have to tell you

149
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,819
so that you'll trust his character?

150
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
In the bamboo forest,

151
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:40,459
it wasn't Wang Hui

152
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:41,939
who saved us.

153
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,020
It was Feiyang.

154
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,299
The reason you're leveling up so fast

155
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,380
is because

156
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:49,780
he gave you each

157
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,179
a Holy Lotus Seed of his

158
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,539
and healed you up,

159
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,539
lifting your cultivation.

160
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,900
He's doing all this good stuff.

161
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,419
Why talk smack about him?

162
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
What did you say?

163
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,059
The one who saved us

164
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:03,459
was Zhao Feiyang?
