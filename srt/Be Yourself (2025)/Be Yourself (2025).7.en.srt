=Episode 7=

10
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:58,441
Why is this hard to say?

11
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:04,483
That man defeated the Grandmaster

12
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:07,980
and also transferred
his spiritual power to you

13
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:09,603
to heal your wounds.

14
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:12,683
Perhaps it was during the healing,

15
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,276
some spiritual power remains
in your bodies.

16
00:01:16,116 --> 00:01:18,075
So now your cultivation

17
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:19,756
has greatly improved.

18
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:22,435
So,

19
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:24,476
it makes sense now.

20
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:27,595
Yanran,

21
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,795
did you ask for his name

22
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:31,036
or where he lives?

23
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:33,196
Well,

24
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:34,996
I...

25
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:37,396
I was too excited at the time

26
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:38,916
that I forgot.

27
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:41,235
Forgot?

28
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:44,396
Then do you remember his appearance?

29
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,355
He...

30
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,595
He was wearing a mask.

31
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:53,875
Then

32
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,595
we have no clues.

33
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:02,795
(Why do I feel like
Yanran is hiding something?)

34
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:07,996
What are you doing?

35
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:09,476
Sorry, ladies.

36
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,315
I insisted you coming here.

37
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:13,875
That's why...

38
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:16,595
Don't blame yourself.

39
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:17,996
If it weren't for this,

40
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:20,356
we wouldn't have had this opportunity.

41
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:23,356
Blame Zhao Feiyang.

42
00:02:23,755 --> 00:02:24,755
He's awful!

43
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:26,715
We risked our lives to save him.

44
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:27,996
And he actually ran away!

45
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:29,635
How annoying!

46
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:30,755
Next time we meet,

47
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:32,315
I will teach him a lesson!

48
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:36,516
But,

49
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:38,556
in the beginning,

50
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,475
we intended to let him escape.

51
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:44,755
Forget it.

52
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:47,076
Anyway, we are all fine now.

53
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:49,155
It's a blessing in disguise.

54
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,236
Even so,

55
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:51,836
he doesn't deserve to be a man.

56
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:53,556
This kind of person is...

57
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:54,556
Bai Zhi,

58
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:55,875
haven't you seen through him?

59
00:02:58,715 --> 00:02:59,715
I admit,

60
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:02,076
in the beginning,

61
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,875
I overestimated him.

62
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,116
But what happened today

63
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:08,915
left me completely disappointed in him.

64
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:10,076
Starting today,

65
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,875
for the Zhao family or Zhao Feiyang,

66
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:14,755
I have no expectations.

67
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,116
Yeah.

68
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:22,155
How could Zhao Feiyang act like this?

69
00:03:22,796 --> 00:03:23,796
I hate him so much.

70
00:03:24,315 --> 00:03:25,315
Enough.

71
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,116
Stop mentioning that useless man.

72
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:28,435
About the engagement,

73
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:29,755
we saved his life today.

74
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:31,236
We owe nothing to the Zhao family.

75
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:33,836
From now on,

76
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:35,676
we will be united,

77
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:36,956
working together,

78
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:40,195
and will reach the top of Martial Realm
on Tianwu Continent.

79
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:41,116
In the future,

80
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:43,315
we will meet the man who saved us.

81
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,155
You're here.

82
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:04,076
You...

83
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:05,035
Why are you...

84
00:04:05,236 --> 00:04:06,635
Of course, I'm not dead.

85
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:08,836
What do you mean?

86
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,956
What's going on?

87
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:16,276
Greetings, brother.

88
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:19,676
Your attitude today

89
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:22,036
is much better compared to before.

90
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:24,195
You even called me "brother".

91
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:26,275
I was immature before.

92
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:30,116
Please don't blame me.

93
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:33,796
Feiyang,

94
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,036
as the elder brother,

95
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:36,515
be more tolerant.

96
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,435
Have dinner with your fifth brother,

97
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:40,556
drink some wine

98
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:41,755
and catch up.

99
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:42,796
Sure.

100
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,315
It's been over a year since we talked.

101
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:45,635
It's time to reminisce.

102
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:47,236
By the way,

103
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:48,395
I've heard that

104
00:04:48,716 --> 00:04:51,116
you brought a Grandmaster to our family.

105
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:52,515
Bring him over later.

106
00:04:54,116 --> 00:04:55,116
I'll pay my respects.

107
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:56,236
Yes,

108
00:04:56,236 --> 00:04:58,236
bring Master Zhuang along as well.

109
00:04:58,875 --> 00:04:59,875
I...

110
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:01,796
Okay.

111
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:04,156
I'll go call him right now.

112
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,075
Look at Heng,

113
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:10,955
venturing the mainland alone
at seventeen.

114
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:12,236
So young,

115
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:13,676
yet he has Grandmaster friends.

116
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:15,676
His future is boundless.

117
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:17,755
And you?

118
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:19,395
You should learn from him.

119
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,916
I learn from him?

120
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:23,916
Are you kidding me?

121
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:25,036
I'm capable, okay?

122
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:26,195
Why learn from him?

123
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:28,916
You're capable?

124
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:30,195
If you're capable,

125
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:31,916
why would the three girls

126
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:32,716
take turns

127
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,195
to break off the engagement with us?

128
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:37,116
They just don't understand me.

129
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:38,556
If they knew me well enough,

130
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,236
they'd all fight to marry me.

131
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:44,036
Fight for you?

132
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:45,875
Not to mention it's three girls,

133
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:47,435
even if there's just one

134
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:49,755
who takes you seriously,

135
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:52,156
I'd wake up laughing from a dream.

136
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:56,676
Then you just wait to wake up
from a dream laughing.

137
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,315
You...

138
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:04,315
You brat!

139
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:07,381
(City Lord's Mansion)

140
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:19,315
(Li Hongbin, City Lord)
Your Highness, why are you so angry?

141
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:22,236
Is there something I didn't do well?

142
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:24,875
That's not it.

143
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:26,236
It's just that

144
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:30,036
I encountered someone
who really displeases me.

145
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:31,755
Please, Your Highness.

146
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:34,676
Who in Tianxuan City
would dare to upset you?

147
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:36,515
Unless they're tired of living, right?

148
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:37,996
Zhao Feiyang.

149
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:39,435
Zhao Feiyang?

150
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:42,916
Who doesn't know Zhao Feiyang?

151
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:45,315
He is the number one good-for-nothing
in Tianxuan City.

152
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,315
Your just arrived in Tianxuan City.

153
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:50,236
How could you be angered by
such a good-for-nothing?

154
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:53,195
He is indeed a good-for-nothing.

155
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:55,395
But he still displeases me greatly.

156
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,556
Is there any way to deal with him?

157
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:00,476
This...

158
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:03,395
For this abnormal movement
of the North Border demon clan,

159
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:06,635
three sons of the Zhaos died
fighting on the North Border.

160
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:08,996
Only this one coward lived to return.

161
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:09,716
Don't you think

162
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,476
I have

163
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,556
every reason to suspect him

164
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:15,116
of colluding with the demon clan,

165
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:17,156
or perhaps betraying his compatriots

166
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:18,635
and saving his own life?

167
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,435
Otherwise, how could he

168
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:22,875
have managed to return alive?

169
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:24,195
Your Highness,

170
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:27,596
isn't this accusation a bit too severe?

171
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:28,676
Too severe?

172
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,955
(Why didn't Zhao Qin
control his son properly?)

173
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:33,916
(Now he provoked such a powerful man!)

174
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:36,996
Very severe.

175
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,875
In our Haotian Empire,

176
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,556
there has always been zero tolerance
for such things.

177
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,116
At the least,
Zhao Feiyang will be executed.

178
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:46,515
At worst, the entire Zhao family
will have to suffer.

179
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:50,875
Your Highness, surely you wouldn't...

180
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:52,075
How dare you!

181
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:56,315
A mere city lord of Tianxuan,

182
00:07:57,635 --> 00:07:59,075
you're questioning me?

183
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:00,356
I wouldn't dare.

184
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,955
By the decree of my father,

185
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,796
I was ordered to come to Tianxuan City
to form a demon-quelling army.

186
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:08,116
Before the people of Tianxuan City,

187
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,315
this good-for-nothing disgraced me.

188
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:12,435
I need to earn respect.

189
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:14,875
Or how can you expect me

190
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:18,395
to command this demon-quelling force
in the future?

191
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:21,156
You're right.

192
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:22,275
You're right.

193
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:25,916
So,

194
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:28,075
I shall make an example
of the Zhao family.

195
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:29,996
Lord Li,

196
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:34,356
you just need to cooperate.

197
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:35,635
Your Highness,

198
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:37,075
please listen to me.

199
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:40,196
Although Zhao Feiyang is
despised by everyone,

200
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:41,996
the Zhao family is loyally steadfast.

201
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:43,716
If we take action,

202
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:44,275
I'm afraid...

203
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:45,356
No need to fear.

204
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,635
It is justified.

205
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:50,395
Are you afraid he might rebel?

206
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:52,635
You're right.

207
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:53,795
Lord Li,

208
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:55,836
just cooperate.

209
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:58,236
Once I have assembled the team

210
00:08:58,395 --> 00:08:59,836
and pacified the North Border,

211
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:01,675
you will be the primary merit official.

212
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:02,996
At that time,

213
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:04,875
I'll ask my father for a decree,

214
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:08,316
appointing you as the lord of

215
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:09,716
the sixteen southern cities!

216
00:09:10,596 --> 00:09:11,596
The Domain Lord?

217
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:14,515
Is it true?

218
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:15,675
Of course.

219
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,915
It depends on your performance.

220
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:21,116
Thank you, Your Highness.

221
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,476
Thank you, Your Highness.

222
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:33,824
Where on earth did this guy go?

223
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,616
I sent you to kill him.

224
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:37,116
Now he has come back.

225
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:38,116
And where are you?

226
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:40,675
Can someone tell me

227
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:42,515
