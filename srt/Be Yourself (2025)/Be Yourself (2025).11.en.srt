=Episode 11=

10
00:00:57,364 --> 00:00:59,044
We are doing business. What's it to you?

11
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,925
I gave the Lotus Seed to her.

12
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:02,364
You think it's not my business?

13
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:04,164
But you already gave it to her.

14
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:05,925
So you regret it

15
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:07,724
and want it back?

16
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:09,444
(I thought)

17
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:11,405
(you were a man of ambition.)

18
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:13,724
(But you ran away alone last time.)

19
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:14,804
(So disappointing.)

20
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:15,685
Once it's given,

21
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:17,005
there's no taking back.

22
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:19,364
I just don't want you to

23
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:21,205
waste something good
on this shabby house.

24
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:22,724
What shabby house?

25
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:24,005
Do you even get it?

26
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:26,125
This old family home

27
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:28,285
means everything to Miss Bai.

28
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:29,152
Right.

29
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:31,485
My grandparents, parents,

30
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:33,244
and me as a kid

31
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:35,205
all lived here.

32
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:36,685
This place really

33
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:38,164
means a lot to me.

34
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:39,964
So, I have to get it back,

35
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,285
no matter what.

36
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:44,244
Even if you're ripped off?

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,248
Hold on.

38
00:01:45,248 --> 00:01:45,884
I...

39
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:46,604
Young Master.

40
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:48,364
Watch your words.

41
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:49,724
I'm trading with Miss Bai.

42
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:50,565
Not your business.

43
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:51,565
Why you bother?

44
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:53,364
You're way out of line.

45
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:58,005
We're engaged already.

46
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,164
She's practically my fiancée.

47
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:01,804
You think I'm out of line, or what?

48
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:04,604
Fine.

49
00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:05,884
But

50
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:07,765
I'm dealing with Miss Bai here.

51
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:10,285
Miss Bai, you buying or not?

52
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:12,364
If not, I'm outta here.

53
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:14,804
I'm buying.

54
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:17,044
Then give me the spirit stones

55
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:18,164
and Lotus Seed.

56
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:19,484
I'll give you the deed now.

57
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:21,285
Well...

58
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:23,805
Miss Bai,

59
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:25,764
you said your grandparents

60
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:26,484
and parents

61
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:27,805
all lived here.

62
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,924
So this place means a lot to you.

63
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:32,724
But they're all gone now.

64
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:34,164
Why still live here?

65
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,405
At least

66
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:38,405
I can find memories here.

67
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:42,324
Memories are all in your head.

68
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:43,764
Home is where your family is.

69
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:45,285
Without your family,

70
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:47,085
it's just a regular house.

71
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:49,764
You really think it's worth it

72
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:51,965
to spend way more than
what this place is worth,

73
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:53,365
just for a run-down memory?

74
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:57,285
You're right.

75
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:00,764
But I still want to buy it.

76
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,324
(He's ripping you off.)

77
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,604
(Watch this.)

78
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,565
Alright, we'll buy it.

79
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:15,005
But 300 spirit stones, max.

80
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:17,724
That's the most this place is worth.

81
00:03:17,924 --> 00:03:19,044
We aren't paying any extra.

82
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:21,685
300 the most?

83
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:23,285
Let me tell you.

84
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,484
The house is in my hands.

85
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,285
I'll sell it for whatever price I want!

86
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:27,444
Suit yourself.

87
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:30,044
But you think anyone but Miss Bai'll

88
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:31,204
buy this haunted house

89
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:34,085
where a family of thirteen died?

90
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:36,444
Right.

91
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:38,484
Who else would buy this place

92
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:41,484
but me?

93
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:43,324
Fine.

94
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:45,125
I don't want this place
of sorrow either.

95
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:46,444
Smart move.

96
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:47,845
Take your 500 spirit stones.

97
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:50,285
Pick any other spot in Tianxuan City.

98
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:51,845
All move-in ready.

99
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,005
This broken house needs renovation.

100
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:55,044
That's costly.

101
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:56,164
Let's go.

102
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,444
Wait, wait.

103
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:00,724
Wait!

104
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,365
Miss Bai,

105
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:06,685
didn't we agree on this already?

106
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:09,924
I brought the deed today
because you were coming to buy it.

107
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:12,204
But it was 500 before.

108
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:13,565
You broke your words.

109
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:14,724
So I don't want it.

110
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:16,005
You can keep it.

111
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:17,884
Okay, okay.

112
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:20,565
I'll sell it to you for 500.

113
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:21,685
Okay?

114
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:24,524
250.

115
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:27,404
250?

116
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:29,644
You just said it was worth 300.

117
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:30,764
250's too much, huh?

118
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:31,925
Then 200.

119
00:04:32,284 --> 00:04:33,365
No, no, no.

120
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,084
250 then.

121
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:41,884
Young Master Zhao.

122
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:45,204
There's really no lower I can go.

123
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:46,844
I've held it for years.

124
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:49,685
I'm losing 50 spirit stones already!

125
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:51,245
Please

126
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:53,565
don't haggle anymore.

127
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:56,685
My heart can't take it.

128
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,005
Well,

129
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:00,805
that depends on Miss Bai.

130
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:04,284
Deal.

131
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:05,826
(Bai Mansion)

132
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:11,125
Thank you for your help today.

133
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,884
Otherwise, I would've gotten
totally ripped off.

134
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:15,605
Don't mention it.

135
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,084
Young Master Zhao.

136
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:21,685
Don't take it wrong.

137
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:24,045
My thoughts are the same as Qiushui's.

138
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:25,725
Our marriage

139
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,444
won't be agreed upon so easily.

140
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:30,524
I'm really grateful to you today.

141
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:31,805
But

142
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:33,524
that doesn't mean...

143
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:35,045
You got it wrong.

144
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:37,084
I helped because it's right.

145
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:38,404
Nothing else.

146
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:39,884
As that's what you think,

147
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:41,524
I'll be going now.

148
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,685
Did I misunderstand him?

149
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:52,045
I'm judging him

150
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:53,884
unfairly.

151
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,565
Zhao Feiyang,

152
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,964
what kind of person are you really?

153
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:08,805
Father,

154
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:10,485
Mother,

155
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:12,324
Grandfather,

156
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:13,964
Grandmother,

157
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:17,605
me getting the family home back
is the first step.

158
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,125
Next,

159
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:20,685
I'll kill

160
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:23,045
Ge Hong with my own hands

161
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:25,365
and avenge

162
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:27,605
my family

163
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:29,605
of thirteen.

164
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:34,313
(5 days until the Martial Assembly)

165
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:39,365
(With no Dantian,)

166
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:41,125
(training is a real pain.)

167
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:43,005
(If I can whip up the Revolution Pill,)

168
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,204
(I can rebuild my Dantian.)

169
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:45,524
(The Beast Core's above)

170
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:47,324
(Heaven-reaching Tower's 33rd floor.)

171
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:50,045
(That's the key
to making the Revolution Pill.)

172
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:52,165
(Gotta figure out how to get that.)

173
00:06:52,524 --> 00:06:53,524
(Then see what's next.)

174
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:56,764
You're the one

175
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,764
who saved me in the bamboo forest.

176
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:01,084
I'm super grateful.

177
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,404
My pleasure.

178
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:04,005
We're both from Tianxuan City.

179
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:06,204
Gotta help you out when in need.

180
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:08,084
By the way,

181
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:09,284
why did you leave

182
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:11,725
right after saving me?

183
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:12,964
(Wang Hui, former North Border General)
I've been looking everywhere,

184
00:07:13,524 --> 00:07:15,644
trying to thank my savior.

185
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,125
I had something urgent that day.

186
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:19,284
Seeing you were okay,

187
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:20,524
I bounced.

188
00:07:20,884 --> 00:07:22,245
Been in seclusion since then,

189
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:24,324
only just came to find you
now that I'm out.

190
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:25,524
I see.

191
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:29,844
All Zhao Feiyang's fault,
messing with ones he shouldn't.

192
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,125
We risked it to save him.

193
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:32,324
He tucked tail and ran.

194
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:33,964
If you hadn't stepped in,

195
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:36,644
things would have been way worse.

196
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:38,204
Zhao Feiyang's a total loser.

197
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:40,284
A man only thinking about
running in battles,

198
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:41,925
what do you expect from him?

199
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:43,444
True.

200
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:45,284
Loser.

201
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:47,644
I've a marriage engagement
to a man like that.

202
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:49,844
That engagement was never on the level.

203
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:51,365
Just find a reason to cancel it.

204
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:52,324
If he doesn't agree,

205
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,084
I'll go to the Zhaos to sort things out.

206
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,725
Qiushui,

207
00:07:57,204 --> 00:07:59,204
you're the pride of Tianxuan City.

208
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,284
You shouldn't be tied to such a guy.

209
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:04,165
Never mind.

210
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:05,404
It's my personal matter.

211
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,324
No need to trouble you with it.

212
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:13,204
Zhao Feiyang?

213
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:14,884
Chen Qiushui?

214
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:17,524
And this is?

215
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:19,764
Young Master Zhao.

216
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:21,964
Your memory's shot, huh?

217
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:24,365
Commander of your three brothers
in North Border.

218
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:25,524
Wang Hui.

219
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:26,764
Speaking of this,

220
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:28,125
you're one of my soldiers.

221
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:31,045
Ah, General Wang.

222
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:32,485
My respects.

223
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,005
Your three brothers

224
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,844
were heroes, through and through.

225
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:36,925
Their deaths

226
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,125
bought our army a huge advantage.

227
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,085
Too bad.

228
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:42,245
They were too reckless,

229
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:44,884
insisting on
defending that impossible pass.

230
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,445
They could have survived.

231
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:48,164
Didn't you order them
to hold it to death?

232
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:50,205
Battlefield's a wild card.

233
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:50,845
Nobody could've

234
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,284
predicted enemies' moves.

235
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:53,445
You blaming me?

236
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:57,404
I'm just a minion.

237
00:08:57,524 --> 00:08:59,485
I wouldn't dare.

238
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:00,725
Zhao Feiyang.

239
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:02,644
Battlefield changes in a heartbeat.

240
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:03,804
As a general, he has to

241
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,164
think about the big picture.

242
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:06,524
Don't let it get to you.

243
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:09,044
How understanding, Qiushui.

244
00:09:09,564 --> 00:09:10,644
At this Martial Assembly,

245
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,684
I'll surely be appointed
commander again.

246
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:15,085
I'll avenge us against the demon clan.

247
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:16,804
Show them what the men

248
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:19,245
of Tianxuan City are made of.

249
00:09:19,884 --> 00:09:20,884
I will also try my best

250
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:21,924
to become a commander.

251
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:24,245
Fight alongside you.

252
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:25,445
Good.

253
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:27,005
With your talent,

254
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:29,125
you'll definitely be a general
or higher.

255
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,365
I hope so.

256
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:31,845
You two got anything else?

257
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,404
I'm heading into the Tower.

258
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,485
You're going into the Tower alone?

259
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:36,644
Trying to get killed?

260
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:38,485
The demons on the first three floors

261
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,044
would mop the floor with you.

262
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:42,325
The Tower is a holy place
for training, sure.

263
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,005
But with your skills?

264
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:47,605
Save your worries.

265
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:49,845
I was here first.

266
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:51,564
You two, get in line.

267
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:52,485
Hold up.

268
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:53,605
What now?

269
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:56,044
If you weren't the only son
of the Zhao family,

270
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,125
I wouldn't even bother with your life.

271
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:00,085
If you want to keep training,

272
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:01,684
team up with me and Mr. Wang.

273
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:03,884
We'll split the resources obtained.

274
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:06,884
Qiushui,

275
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:08,644
which floor have you reached?

276
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:09,564
19.

277
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:10,564
Me, 21.

278
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:12,965
I can take you straight in from there.

279
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,965
But the 21st floor
is seriously dangerous.

280
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:16,564
If you're bringing him...

281
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:19,245
Zhao Feiyang,

282
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:21,044
you might just hang out
on the 1st floor.

283
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:22,684
There's nothing good there,

284
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,284
but you won't bite the dust.

285
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,325
This...

286
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:27,284
(Right.)

287
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:28,325
(I forgot.)

288
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:29,845
(I've no record in the Tower.)

289
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:30,804
(If I go now,)

290
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,164
(I have to go floor by floor.)

291
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:34,365
(Who knows when I'll get to
the 33rd floor?)

292
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:36,644
(Teaming up with them is very smart.)

293
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:38,965
Right! Let's team up.

294
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:40,764
Go to the 21st floor.
