Fourth Prince, tell you what.

11
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:01,924
None of your business.

12
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:05,084
Zhao Feiyang.

13
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:07,004
How dare you disrespect me!

14
00:01:07,243 --> 00:01:08,803
I disrespect you. So what?

15
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:10,763
Don't you know that

16
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:13,243
you shouldn't interfere
in others' family affairs?

17
00:01:13,403 --> 00:01:14,924
Or do you insist on doing so

18
00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:16,124
just because

19
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,603
you are the Fourth Prince?

20
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:20,523
I kind of admire this loser now.

21
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:21,364
Yeah.

22
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:22,523
He's arrogant enough

23
00:01:22,603 --> 00:01:23,963
to offend the Fourth Prince.

24
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:25,883
Haotian Lord sent the Fourth Prince here

25
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:26,883
to maintain order.

26
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:28,644
Outrageous!

27
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:31,084
Lord Ge.

28
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:33,084
This man has repeatedly disrespected me

29
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:35,004
and the royal family.

30
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,443
Seize him.

31
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:39,644
Dead or alive.

32
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:42,484
The show begins.

33
00:01:43,284 --> 00:01:44,284
(Am I going to witness)

34
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,204
(the power
of Sixth-rank Martial Sovereign?)

35
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:50,764
(Feiyang doesn't talk big.)

36
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:52,284
(I bet he's arrogant)

37
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:54,204
(because he has confidence.)

38
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:56,364
(But the fifth rank)

39
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:57,523
(is a milestone.)

40
00:01:57,963 --> 00:01:59,084
(Those who surpass it)

41
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:01,163
(cultivate to achieve immortality.)

42
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:02,803
(Feiyang.)

43
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,084
(Can you deal with him?)

44
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,243
Since you have issued the order,

45
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:08,443
I have no choice but to obey.

46
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:13,924
Is this the astonishing power

47
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:15,043
of a Martial Sovereign?

48
00:02:15,204 --> 00:02:16,003
Even the pressure

49
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,604
makes me out of breath.

50
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,924
Zhao Feiyang is in trouble.

51
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:20,644
(So powerful.)

52
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:21,683
(At the age of 26,)

53
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:23,283
(I have no more potential.)

54
00:02:23,403 --> 00:02:25,044
(I don't know if I'll ever reach)

55
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:26,283
(this stage.)

56
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:28,364
(The Fourth Prince must be)

57
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,164
(counting on him to regain power.)

58
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:32,164
(Sixth rank. Not bad.)

59
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:33,444
(People have been)

60
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:35,324
(calling me a loser for years.)

61
00:02:35,924 --> 00:02:37,644
(Although I don't mind it,)

62
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:39,084
(it's a bit annoying.)

63
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:41,764
(Today, I might as well
establish my authority)

64
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:43,523
(by taking down this Martial Sovereign.)

65
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:45,963
(That will make people shut up.)

66
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:49,364
Bai Zhi.

67
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:50,324
What are you doing?

68
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:51,364
Twelve years ago,

69
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:54,044
my father obtained a dragon crystal.

70
00:02:54,563 --> 00:02:55,963
This "Southern Domain Lord"

71
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:57,683
was just a hooligan.

72
00:02:58,164 --> 00:02:59,324
He broke into my house

73
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:01,123
and killed thirteen people

74
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:03,003
to get the dragon crystal
for cultivation

75
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:04,484
and became the Domain Lord.

76
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:05,644
I saw him just now

77
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:07,324
and tried to suppress my hatred.

78
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,243
But

79
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,924
how can I suppress

80
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:11,403
this overwhelming hatred?

81
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:14,683
Bai Zhi and I...

82
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,403
(and Feiyang)

83
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:18,123
are in this together.

84
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,403
It's not for you,

85
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:27,123
but for Bai Zhi.

86
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:29,523
I really hate

87
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,403
Zhao Feiyang.

88
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,003
But

89
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:35,723
I'm also a member of Tianxuan City.

90
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:38,563
Enough.

91
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:39,884
How about this?

92
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:42,803
All of you stand down.

93
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:45,164
I can handle him alone.

94
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:46,604
You'll handle him alone?

95
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:48,164
Are you crazy?

96
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:52,523
Where are the Tianxuan City Guards?

97
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,884
Zhang Heling is here, reporting to duty.

98
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:57,523
All participants of the Martial Assembly

99
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,403
are under my protection.

100
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:03,164
No one is allowed to act rashly.

101
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:04,576
Understood.

102
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:05,963
Are you trying to rebel?

103
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:07,723
(These fools.)

104
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:08,723
(I was trying)

105
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:10,604
(to turn you against Zhao Feiyang.)

106
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:13,803
(How come you're so united?)

107
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:15,044
Fourth Prince.

108
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:18,283
This is too much of an accusation.

109
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:20,403
Can't the prince of the Haotian Empire

110
00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:22,644
distinguish between right and wrong?

111
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:23,764
Do you want to

112
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:25,684
disappoint the people?

113
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,084
Well said.

114
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:28,244
My Lord is right.

115
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:29,843
Zhao Feiyang is one of us.

116
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:31,283
He may be arrogant,

117
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,603
but we won't let you call us rebels

118
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,483
just because of that.

119
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,124
You...

120
00:04:37,684 --> 00:04:39,004
A bunch of worms.

121
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:40,483
No matter how much you cry,

122
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:41,884
you are still worms.

123
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:44,564
Your Highness,

124
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:47,444
I can kill them all if you want.

125
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:49,684
(If I kill everyone here,)

126
00:04:49,843 --> 00:04:51,444
(the news will reach the North Border)

127
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:52,963
(and cause public outrage.)

128
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:55,124
(But if I do nothing,)

129
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:57,283
(how am I going to vent my anger?)

130
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,444
Ge Hong, show some respect.

131
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:03,124
What?

132
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:05,843
You think you're invincible

133
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:07,603
as the Southern Domain Lord?

134
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:08,764
Exactly.

135
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:11,244
You think you can bully us?

136
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:12,483
Old man.

137
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:15,723
Taking the lead comes with a price.

138
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:17,603
Think carefully.

139
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:20,483
Haotian Lord commissioned me here

140
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:22,244
to assist the Fourth Prince.

141
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:25,403
Step aside right now
and I'll only arrest

142
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:28,084
Zhao Feiyang
and that girl from the Bai family.

143
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,004
But if you refuse to cooperate,

144
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:31,923
don't blame me for being ruthless.

145
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,124
You...

146
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:42,163
How can you exclude me

147
00:05:42,363 --> 00:05:43,764
from a fight?

148
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:47,043
Where have you been, Master Xiao?

149
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:49,084
I traveled around for you.

150
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:50,283
What?

151
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:51,723
Xiao Ran.

152
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:55,963
You are Xiao Ran,
the top swordswoman of Tianxuan City?

153
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:58,644
Ge Hong, do you dare to duel with me?

154
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:01,804
You are merely in the fifth rank.

155
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:03,124
Want to challenge me?

156
00:06:03,523 --> 00:06:04,523
Do you know

157
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:07,444
the fundamental difference
between the fifth and sixth ranks?

158
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:08,723
I said I'd fight you.

159
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:11,324
Do you think I was just bluffing?

160
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:17,043
(Xiao Ran might be
only a Fifth-rank Grandmaster,)

161
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:20,084
(but she masters
the ultimate swordsplay.)

162
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:21,764
(I might not)

163
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:23,764
(be able to easily suppress her.)

164
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:25,564
(Your Highness.)

165
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,644
(How do we wrap it up?)

166
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:30,564
(These commoners are truly willful.)

167
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:32,204
(Forget it.)

168
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:33,923
(After the Martial Assembly,)

169
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:35,403
(I can teach them a lesson)

170
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,603
(at the North Border.)

171
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:39,963
Alright.

172
00:06:40,244 --> 00:06:41,444
Don't get me wrong.

173
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:43,363
This is purely personal

174
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:44,804
between me and Zhao Feiyang.

175
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,843
Let's not escalate it.

176
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,723
It's the same for me and the Bai family.

177
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:54,244
If you're suicidal,

178
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:57,124
I will grant your wish.

179
00:06:57,632 --> 00:06:58,205
You...

180
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:00,043
Bai Zhi, courage alone can't help you

181
00:07:00,324 --> 00:07:01,843
defeat such a mighty enemy.

182
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:03,204
You'll get your chance.

183
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,124
Stay calm.

184
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:08,884
(Why?)

185
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,163
(Why don't I dare to make a move?)

186
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:12,963
(Am I...)

187
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:14,483
(Am I really so powerless?)

188
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,403
Wait.

189
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:21,324
Did I say you could leave?

190
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,043
Zhao Feiyang.

191
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:28,163
Don't go too far.

192
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:32,444
I can do you a favor.

193
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:34,603
What is it?

194
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:37,603
I can kill him.

195
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,004
What did you say?

196
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,603
Our families are longtime acquaintances.

197
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:47,483
That's why we're engaged.

198
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:49,283
Since you are my fiancée,

199
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:51,564
I can't let your enemy

200
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:52,723
walk away today.

201
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:55,843
So I'll help you kill him

202
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,283
as a betrothal gift.

203
00:07:58,043 --> 00:07:59,283
Miss Bai, what do you think?

204
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:01,163
Are you serious?

205
00:08:01,444 --> 00:08:02,523
Of course.

206
00:08:02,963 --> 00:08:03,963
Give me a second.

207
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:11,487
♪When fate is turned, a legend is made♪

208
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:19,207
♪With blood burning, he's unrivaled♪

209
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:20,723
That's the move.

210
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:22,723
Lord Ge, be careful.

211
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:24,483
This is the move.

212
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:25,523
Relax, Your Highness.

213
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:26,843
♪Sword in hand♪

214
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:28,004
Stop showing off.

215
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:29,684
Train for the Martial Assembly

216
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,843
that's coming up.

217
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:32,843
Master Xiao, why did you hit me?

218
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:34,723
People are watching.
It hurts my dignity.

219
00:08:35,004 --> 00:08:36,004
I'm still injured

220
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:37,684
and can't kill Ge Hong for you.

221
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,483
Wait for me to recover.

222
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:41,524
(I didn't ask you to kill him for me.)

223
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:43,643
(Xiao Ran.)

224
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:46,883
(You make me
both speechless and touched.)

225
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:48,404
Yeah.

226
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:50,284
The assembly matters the most.

227
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:52,284
You shouldn't fight now.

228
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,324
Yeah.

229
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:55,524
Let me take this opportunity

230
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:57,003
to wish the Martial Assembly

231
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:58,123
a complete success

232
00:08:58,564 --> 00:09:00,003
so that my demon-slaying team

233
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,924
can have some outstanding leaders.

234
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:07,603
No one made a move after all this fuss.

235
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:09,404
So lame.

236
00:09:09,763 --> 00:09:11,883
Zhao Feiyang,
you're such a troublemaker.

237
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:13,684
If you start fighting,

238
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:14,804
how do we end this

239
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:16,164
even if you win?

240
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:17,883
What if His Majesty decides

241
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:19,483
to wipe us all out?

242
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,044
You provoke the Fourth Prince for fun.

243
00:09:22,204 --> 00:09:23,763
But that may get us into trouble.

244
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:25,643
You still see him as a prince?

245
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:28,044
Look at you people.

246
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:29,324
You want to go to war

247
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:32,763
and fight for the Haotian Empire.

248
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,564
You're even willing to die for it.

249
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:35,924
But the royal family members

250
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:37,564
have never taken you seriously.

251
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:40,324
You're willing to sacrifice yourselves

252
00:09:40,924 --> 00:09:42,603
but still butter up the people in power?

253
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:46,204
In my opinion,

254
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:48,003
living without dignity

255
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:50,843
is no different from being dead.

256
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:53,643
Zhao Feiyang.

257
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:55,603
What's the point of lecturing us?

258
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:57,243
Dignity comes from strength.

259
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:58,324
Without true strength,

260
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:00,363
it's all illusional.

261
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:02,924
So,

262
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:04,643
you don't get to say that.

263
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,003
Whether I get to say that

264
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:08,843
is not up to you.

265
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:11,044
Or you.

266
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:12,924
Or you.

267
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:16,284
Or you people.

268
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:19,003
I don't need your affirmation.

269
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:21,204
I have died once

270
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:23,044
on the battlefield.

271
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:24,963
In this second life, I realized that

272
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,684
living with dignity
is more important than anything.

273
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:28,883
So I will not

274
00:10:29,243 --> 00:10:30,603
cater to anyone's moods.

275
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,564
Nor will I tolerate you

276
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:34,404
just because you are my fiancée.

277
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:36,243
I certainly won't be told what to do.

278
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:37,963
In this vast world,

279
00:10:38,164 --> 00:10:39,603
there are all kinds of flowers

280
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:41,963
and different people.

281
00:10:42,564 --> 00:10:44,643
I am who I am.

282
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,284
I'm a flower of a different color.

283
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:51,243
Chun.

284
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:52,603
Young Master.

285
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:53,123
Let's go.

00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:54,605
