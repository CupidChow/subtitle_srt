♫ How can I leave you behind? ♫

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,620
♫ Leave you here alone ♫

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,790
♫ It's you who was here as I was desperate ♫

♫ and crying; I finally realized myself  ♫

5
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,690
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

6
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,500
♫ You always don't like to say anything ♫

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,390
♫ It gave me a dream with you ♫

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,730
♫ It gave me a dream with you ♫

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,110
♫ How many times I wanted to confess from the bottom of my heart ♫

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,260
♫ How I lost to sadness and loneliness ♫

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,050
♫ As you are waiting ♫

12

♫ Never wanting to let go ♫

♫ How can I leave you behind? ♫

00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,440
♫ Leave you here alone ♫

00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,520

♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

19
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,683
Don't always scrunch your eyebrows.

20
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:44,120
I really didn't think it would be him.

21
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:47,988
It's okay. Just relax.

22
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:53,563
Relax.

23
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,532
Relax.

24
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:01,770
Meng Shaofei!

25
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:04,838
Let's get rid of our mutual enemy first, then work out our issues.

26
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,855
Didn't we just agree on getting rid of the enemy in front of us first?

27
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:34,005
What are you doing?

28
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:37,240
- Get up!
- Get up! What kind of position is that?

29
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,242
A-yi, this person's so scary,

30
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,477
I'm so scared.

31
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,944
I'm his bodyguard right now. I think you're a very dangerous person.

32
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:45,514
Please step away.

33
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:46,883
Why are you doing my job?

34
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:48,450
He's the enemy in front of us.

35
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,918
Hey, what do the two of you mean by that?

36
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,353
Do you think I'm bacteria?

37
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:54,190
We are currently someone's target so, even if you are a virus,

38
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,010
please step away!

39
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,033
Do you smell that?

40
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:11,440
What is that smell?

41
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,643
A strong sour vinegar smell?
 (T/N: the smell of jealousy)

42
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:22,584
It's not sour vinegar!

43
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:24,654
it's like a gamey offensive smell.

44
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,655
An offensive unpleasant smell of a tramp!

45
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:28,023
Who are you cursing?

46
00:03:28,024 --> 00:03:31,724
I didn't say who but whoever answers must be the guilty one.

47
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:35,129
This guy has a really evil mouth. No class at all!

48
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,099
Class depends on who I'm speaking to.

49
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,034
- Take your hands off! Don't touch him!
- Okay.

50
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:41,370
A-yi, look at him.

51
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:43,272
- You...
- A-yi.

52
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:44,907
Take your hands off!

53
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:46,908
Let go, you tramp!

54
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,744
Meng Shaofei, don't butt in. He's my boss, I'll protect him.

55
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:49,945
You're the one who shouldn't butt in!

56
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:51,580
- What are you doing, you tramp?
- Don't!

57
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,681
Don't touch. Go kneel again!

58
00:03:52,682 --> 00:03:54,416
- Go kneel!
- Get up!

59
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,084
What are you trying to do?

60
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,740
Boss, eat first.

61
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,643
I'm going to wait outside.

62
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,097
You should stay away from that Andy.

63
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:43,898
The way he looks at you, I just see it as weird.

64
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:45,234
He's my friend.

65
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:46,501
Friend?

66
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,470
Yes, there are many types of friends.

67
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:50,705
Friends that you go to Karaoke with, friends that you do sports with,

68
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:54,307
and friends that you do intense exercises with.

69
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:56,979
Tell me what kind of friends are you?

70
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:58,146
Why are you asking?

71
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:01,150
No reason. Can't I just want to understand?

72
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,784
Doesn't he have a boyfriend?

73
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:04,486
You don't want to be mistaken to be his lover, right?

74
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:07,088
You're just regular friends, so you should keep your distance from him.

75
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:11,090
Especially since you're so charismatic. It's very easy for people to spread gossip.

76
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,127
Also, you are a mob boss.

77
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:13,929
Do you really want to know or are you jealous?

78
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,464
Both.

79
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,239
I'm not jealous. Why would I be jealous?

80
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,107
I don't have anything to be jealous of.

81
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,608
You're the one that said I'm half a friend.

82
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,443
Half a friend is just looking out for you.

83
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,379
You might get assassinated walking on the streets.

84
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,780
I don't want to see you get killed for money or revenge,

85
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,915
and now a crime of passion.

86
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,484
You're overthinking.

87
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,219
Overthinking?

88
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,054
That's because you don't watch the news.

89
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:42,522
A lot of people will kill for little meaningless excuses over love.

90
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:44,526
It makes us, the police, very busy.

91
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:45,827
Especially that Andy

92
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:46,562
has a pub,

93
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,463
and the look of a tramp.

94
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,800
I bet his personal life is total chaos. Just keep your distance from him.

95
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:52,234
Don't think just because you're a gang that nothing will happen to you.

96
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:54,069
The Boss is no exception.

97
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,145
You're starting to drink Coke?

98
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,848
Coke and spicy food are a perfect match, right?

99
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,721
My saliva is on it.

100
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:49,659
Officer, where should we install it?

101
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,793
Just install it here. Leave the ladder here.

102
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,467
What are you doing?

103
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:02,402
No, I just want to see how you train.

104
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:03,973
Six pack.

105
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,907
What are you doing?

106
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:07,576
Zhao Zi!

107
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,078
Hi, Jack. You're here.

108
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,748
Yes, I'm here to install the surveillance cameras.

109
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:17,852
Letting the police touch our security system, is that such a good idea?

110
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,954
I'll check it again later. Don't worry.

111
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:22,791
I hate these cops.

112
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,926
I have an antenna on the top of my head.

113
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,364
When they are close, my whole body starts to itch.

114
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,365
Then, how come you didn't itch just now when he touched you?

115
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:33,201
My fist was really itchy.

116
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,204
I can't stand it.

117
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,748
The guys over here are so stingy.

118
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:49,480
They won't even let me check out their muscles.

119
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,353
You didn't just look,

120
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:52,788
your hands were all over him.

121
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:55,823
We're all guys. What's wrong with a little bit of touching?

122
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:58,125
You... You have a thing for muscles?

123
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,061
Not that serious!

124
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,263
It's just that no matter how much I work out,

125
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,231
they're still pretty soft; just can't get them hard.

126
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:06,168
Everyone laughs and calls me a boiled chicken.

127
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,937
Give me your hand.

128
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:11,406
Is it hard?

129
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,108
You have them, too!

130
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,745
I didn't even notice.

131
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,214
Are you one of those guys that look thinner when clothed

132
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:20,515
and muscular when naked?

133
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:23,317
If we get a chance, you can see for yourself.

134
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:24,253
Really?

135
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,788
When the time comes, don't be embarrassed and come up with excuses to evade it.

136
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:28,957
I'm afraid you'll be embarrassed!

137
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,859
It's not like I haven't seen guys undressing before.

138
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,227
What's there to be embarrassed about?

139
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:36,762
During police academy, I even saw completely naked butts.

140
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:42,804
Being a part of the Criminal Investigation Unit is very dangerous.

141
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:45,040
Why did you choose this line of work?

142
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,943
That's because going to the police academy was tuition-free.

143
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,545
And I also got a living expense bonus.

144
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:52,414
It was quite tough for my grandmother to take care of me.

145
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:54,049
She invested so much in me.

146
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,118
I figured the sooner she can get her money's worth the better.

147
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,121
It was just unfortunate that in my second year of college,

148
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,623
she passed away.

149
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,126
She didn't get the return on her investment in time.

150
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,262
Your grandmother must think she lost big time.

151
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,565
I feel the same way.

152
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,535
You're not the first one to say this either.

153
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:14,536
Who was the first?

154
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:16,305
A-fei.

155
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,272
When my grandmother passed away, I cried really hard.

156
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:21,376
A-fei all of a sudden said this to me,

157
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:23,645
and I didn't know why, but I just laughed.

158
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:29,151
All right.

159
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:47,202
I'm still alive?

160
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:49,838
You can't die falling from this height, okay?

161
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,074
What?

162
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:54,843
You're not really thinking about checking them out right now, are you?

163
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:57,346
How do you train?

164
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,148
What are you guys doing?

165
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:02,983
- Director Zuo.
- Zuo Hongye?

166
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:05,086
Who are you? How come I've never seen you before?

167
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:07,423
My name is Zhao Lian. Everyone calls me Zhao Zi.

168
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,024
I'm a member of Unit 3.

169
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,525
Another cop?

170
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,193
Mr. Zhao is Officer Meng's friend.

171
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,496
He was specially asked to come and reinforce our security system.

172
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:15,997
The Boss agreed.

173
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:19,066
Did the Boss also agree to let the two of you hug each other in the swimming pool?

174
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:25,206
Zuo Hongye already looks good on TV,

175
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,975
she's even prettier in person!

176
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:28,143
You like her type?

177
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:30,346
She looks a lot like my grandmother.

178
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:33,614
So your standard for a girlfriend is your grandmother?

179
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:37,283
When she was young, my grandmother was a beautiful woman. A stunning woman!

180
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:39,120
So you have a grandmother complex.

181
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,657
No, I don't.

182
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,460
Mean Jack.

183
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,568
See what I mean?

184
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,037
One cop is not enough.

185
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:59,206
He might as well convert this place to a police station.

186
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,617
Damn A-yi, bad A-yi, Idiot Tang Yi!

187
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:10,717
I believe the Boss knows what he's doing.

188
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,655
He has his boundaries.

189
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:17,824
This is not a place that lets in any stray dog or cat.

190
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:19,794
Although Hsin-Tien Group will not exist after we completely go legit,

191
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:21,930
but this is still the Boss's home.

192
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,832
To let the police come and go as they please,

193
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,266
it won't be good if word gets out into the mob circles.

194
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,269
Will anyone still want to do business with Hsin-Tien Group?

195
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,682
Why are you smiling?

196
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:41,216
Nothing.

197
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,885
Just like what Miss said.

198
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:46,486
After we go legit, Hsin-Tien Group will not exist.

199
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:49,391
Who cares what the mob circles think?

200
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:51,660
We'll have nothing to do with gangs anymore,

201
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:53,228
nor any cooperation.

202
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:54,663
Right?

203
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:57,599
That's for after we completely become legitimate.

204
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,868
We're not there yet.

205
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:02,838
Miss is correct.

206
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,841
Are you treating me like a kid again? I hate it when you brush me off like that.

207
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:09,010
Miss, I'm really not treating you like a child.

208
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,278
I honestly believe what you said is correct.

209
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:14,483
Fine.

210
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,484
If you're not treating me like a kid,

211
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:20,420
then how will you calm down a grown woman and make her happy?

212
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:22,180
You do know how to do that, don't you?

213
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,680
♫ Never thought I’d abandon with no regard ♫

214
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,760
♫ I’d care about jealousy; I put you inside my heart ♫

215
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,310
♫ Never thought you’d latch onto every opportunity ♫

216
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:42,020
♫ In every corner always greeting me ♫

217
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,830
♫ I simply dared not to think, also did not know how to express ♫

218
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,120
♫ my true preference ♫

219
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:57,259
Miss,

220
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,165
let me go make you a cup of coffee first.

221
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,039
None of you men are any good.

222
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,659
That time didn't count.

223
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,895
I wasn't concentrating, so the spices got to me.

224
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,563
Really.

225
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,965
But drinking hot tea actually helps.

226
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:38,400
Boss, Director Zuo is already home.

227
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,235
She's waiting for you to get home for a meeting.

228
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,903
Have Hongye go home and rest first.

229
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,504
My next itinerary, I'm fine with just him coming along.

230
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:46,273
Boss, please let me go with you.

231
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,943
My next itinerary is a private matter. I can go by myself.

232
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:53,079
But... Boss!

233
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:02,257
The Boss is waiting.

234
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,896
Then, Officer Meng, please protect our boss well.

235
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,000
What are you doing?

236
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,501
I have very capable skills.

237
00:14:13,502 --> 00:14:15,670
You've tried them first hand.

238
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:17,572
Tried what?!

239
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:25,344
Meng Shaofei, you be careful now!

240
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:32,885
Your private matter is to come to the hospital? You're not feeling well?

241
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:33,955
I'm here to repay my debts.

242
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,257
Repay debts? Why come to the hospital to repay your debts?

243
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:38,593
Because there are beds here.

244
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:40,795
Beds? What do you need a bed for?

245
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:43,364
Don't waste any more time. Let's start.

246
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,775
Go wait outside for me.

247
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
For... how long?

248
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,078
There's going to be a knife later, too.

249
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,413
About 30 minutes.

250
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:00,583
30 minutes.

251
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,752
This...

252
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:13,996
Close the door when you leave.

253
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:17,132
Hurry and get out!

254
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,841
You bringing him here today really scared me!

255
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:29,944
When did the two of you become so close?

256
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:31,946
Was it because of what happened last time,

257
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:33,949
so you guys became friends?

258
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:37,453
You only have 28 minutes left.

259
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:39,787
Let me tell you. Today's my first time.

260
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:42,290
It might hurt a lot!

261
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:45,227
Repay debts?

262
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:47,562
Why do you need a bed to repay debts?

263
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:49,865
And need to get undressed?

264
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:57,604
They're not going to do some shameful thing, are they?

265
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:00,775
Impossible.

266
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:03,310
This is a hospital, not a motel.

267
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,513
Thinking too much.

268
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:08,483
Does it hurt a lot?

269
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:10,752
Am I doing it too hard?

270
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,521
Don't use so much force.

271
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:13,955
Sorry.

272
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:17,090
It's my first time so I might not be used to the proper force and location.

273
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,226
It's okay

274
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,961
Again.

275
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,598
Don't force it.

276
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:25,033
That hurts, that hurts.

277
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:29,705
Here, wait.

278
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,608
It's too dry.

279
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:36,308
Let me put more oil on it so you'll be more comfortable.

280
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:39,514
Is that too much oil?

281
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:41,717
It's more slippery this way.

282
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:43,518
Right?

283
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,919
- Yes, yes.
- Right?

284
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,054
So much more comfortable.

285
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:47,055
Isn't it?

286
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:49,257
What are you doing?!

287
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:58,599
We're doing anti-soreness massage.

288
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,368
I just learned it and I needed someone to practice on.

289
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,442
Get down.

290
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,876
You're a surgeon. What are you doing learning anti-soreness massage for?

291
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:12,346
Well, you're a cop following a mob boss every day.

292
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:15,148
Following... Following for what reason?

293
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:18,753
Can you let him continue?

294
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,664
Go.

295
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,868
Go.

296
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:41,343
He's really angry.

297
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:44,245
Don't worry about him.

298
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:03,498
What are you angry about?

299
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:07,899
I'm angry at myself for getting all worked up. And angry at you.

300
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:09,738
Angry at me, for what?

301
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Is your body for people to line up to touch?

302
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:14,042
Twice in one day,

303
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:15,176
That tramp Andy touched you.

304
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,577
The doctor who's not doing his job also touched you.

305
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:19,646
Strange. Should I also get in line to touch you, too?

306
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,250
How many times do you want to touch me?

307
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:29,991
Go ahead. Touch away.

308
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,593
Why aren't you touching me?

309
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:34,062
I--

310
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,823
Boss!

311
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,025
This is Director Zuo's report.

312
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:05,961
Please review it first.

313
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:11,130
Boss, I have something else that I need to tell you.

314
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:15,437
It has to do with Meng Shaofei.

315
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,253
Tell me.

316
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:36,689
I really don't understand why Boss accepted Meng Shaofei's protection.

317
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:39,227
Protection is just an excuse.

318
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:43,095
Whether for him or for me, we each have our own agendas.

319
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,934
I understand that Boss is doing this because your attackers haven't been found yet.

320
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,837
So, you're giving Jack's suggestion a try;

321
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:52,574
waiting for your attackers to try again.

322
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:55,444
But Meng Shaofei has other plans.

323
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,445
What is it that you see?

324
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,081
It's you.

325
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:02,084
His plan is you.

326
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:06,285
Boss, Meng Shaofei is by your side the entire day.

327
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:08,288
That brain of his probably has many unruly thoughts running through it.

328
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:09,658
Enough.

329
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,859
Boss, believe me. I can see right through him.

330
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:15,595
Because the way he looks at you, is the same as I look at you.

331
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:17,366
Don't say another word.

332
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,502
I don't want to hear anything of this nature again from you.

333
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:25,040
- Boss, but this time Meng Shaofei--
- If you can't control yourself,

334
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,342
I'll have to transfer you away from here.

335
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,965
Hello, it's me.

336
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:53,100
Are you free?

337
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:55,103
Are you able to meet and talk?

338
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,966
Did you review everything?

339
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:27,836
Boss, after operating this way for the past few years,

340
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:30,438
about 70% of our accounts are now clean.

341
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:34,943
The returns we are getting will be invested into next month's D82 bid.

342
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:38,943
This BOT project has received a lot of attention from the industry.

343
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,684
Tang Yi, I think this is a very good project.

344
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:47,252
But the D82 land lot shouldn't be worth this much.

345
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:50,491
- Miss...
- We're still a few days away from the bid.

346
00:21:50,491 --> 00:21:54,160
Can you lend me a few of your people? So that I can go and assess it.

347
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,663
Sure, give me a list of names. Let me see who you want.

348
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:59,301
You're too good to me.

349
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:02,404
How about finding me a lawyer first?

350
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,071
Like someone that works for you,

351
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,542
someone that win's hearts.

352
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,243
Sure.

353
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,045
Thank you, Boss.

354
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:18,085
Tang Yi,

355
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,655
I've been very good lately. Haven't I?

356
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:22,590
How about giving me a present?

357
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,126
What do you want?

358
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:34,601
You're done with your meeting? Ready to go?

359
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:36,304
I still have a couple of things to do.

360
00:22:36,305 --> 00:22:38,472
Tang Yi, I want to go buy a few things.

361
00:22:38,473 --> 00:22:41,140
So, I want him to go with me to be my bodyguard and protect me.

362
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,877
- Me?
- Miss, I'll go with you--

363
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:46,578
You have someone with such skills in the office washing cups and opening doors,

364
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:49,418
isn't it overkill for such tasks?

365
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:51,018
That's quite true, Director Zuo.

366
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:53,689
We've known each other for so long and you finally know what kind of person I am.

367
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:56,655
Actually, I'm just lacking a chance to show my skills.

368
00:22:56,655 --> 00:23:00,429
Right. So, Tang Yi, let me borrow Meng Shaofei.

369
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:03,865
This way, he has a chance to use his skills.

370
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:05,300
No, that's not what I meant just now.

371
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,235
I don't need to use my skills for this.

372
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:10,938
You'll accompany Hongye shopping this afternoon.

373
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:13,875
I can't! I came here to protect you, I'm not here to protect her.

374
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,910
My schedule is done for the day

375
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,278
and I can get back home myself.

376
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,546
- But--
- Protecting her well is protecting me well.

377
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:25,152
Let's go! Where would you like to go?

378
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,987
I want to go to a lot of places.

379
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,123
You better be prepared.

380
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:31,291
I, Meng Shaofei don't have much, but I have a lot of energy.

381
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,327
Who's scared of who? Let's go!

382
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,862
Let's go, Officer Meng.

383
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:36,998
Let's go, Director Zuo.

384
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,973
Since you don't want to give her a promise,

385
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:48,643
don't blame her for treating you like this.

386
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:51,613
It's not that I don't want to give it,

387
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:54,482
it's I can't give it.

388
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:55,583
No, not that you can't,

389
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,752
but you're unwilling to give it.

390
00:23:58,553 --> 00:24:01,256
If you over think it, it'll just hurt the both of you.

391
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,936
Walk faster

392
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:16,638
I...

393
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:28,250
What do you think?

394
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:29,987
Why are you wearing seaweed on your body?

395
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:32,953
You're seaweed. Your whole body is a seaweed.

396
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:34,190
Seaweed, seaweed.

397
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,620
Seaweed, seaweed.

398
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,511
What are you staring at?

399
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:12,627
What? You've never seen these before?

400
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,863
Should I buy this?

401
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,898
I don't think so.

402
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:21,135
Okay, you really don't have any taste.

403
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:41,891
Are you looking for me?

404
00:25:41,891 --> 00:25:45,059
Miss, why didn't you let me know before taking off like that?

405
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,828
Bye.

406
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:49,197
Where are you going? Wait for me.

407
00:25:49,197 --> 00:25:51,033
You're cute when you're asleep.

408
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:52,867
What are you talking about?

409
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:56,071
I'm going to tell Tang Yi that when you sleep, you drool.

410
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,105
Don't talk nonsense!

411
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:57,939
Let me show you this one.

412
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,574
This style has a push-up design,

413
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:03,111
and this one is cute.

414
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:04,545
It should be very suitable for you.

415
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:05,579
Would you like to try them on?

416
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:06,515
Sure.

417
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:09,150
What size do you need?

418
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,053
Shopping lingerie with your girlfriend?

419
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:14,556
Good man.

420
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:16,858
I'm going to go try them on first.

421
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,061
Your girlfriend is very pretty; she has a nice figure.

422
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:23,096
No, she's not my girlfriend! These...

423
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:26,969
Can you wrap these two up for me?

424
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:29,237
- Okay.
- Thank you.

425
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:31,138
Come here.

426
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:34,842
What?

427
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:37,480
Red little piggies. Cute.

428
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,512
My present to you.

429
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,514
No thanks.

430
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,351
This one really is a bit too big.

431
00:26:44,152 --> 00:26:46,186
Right, this should be enough.

432
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,522
You underestimate me.

433
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,356
And this one, too.

434
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,258
- Okay.
- Thank you.

435
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:54,262
I'm so happy today. You've worked hard today.

436
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:56,865
I said I'd treat you to ice cream. Why don't you want any?

437
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,167
I don't take bribes.

438
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:00,936
I'm a bodyguard.

439
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:02,404
Why use me as a shopping cart?

440
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:03,905
You agreed to Tang Yi's request yourself.

441
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:06,675
What's wrong? You want to go back on your word?

442
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:08,711
I keep every word of my promises that I make to my friends.

443
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:14,115
I didn't say you were Tang Yi's friend.

444
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:15,285
Miss!

445
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:18,053
You really don't want Tang Yi to make more friends?

446
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,855
That would have to depend on what type of friends.

447
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:23,725
One that's sincere or one that wants to use him.

448
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,890
I'm telling you! I will not tolerate anyone that uses Tang Yi.

449
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,964
What's wrong?

450
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:32,632
Nothing. Iust that the way you protect Tang Yi is quite unique.

451
00:27:32,632 --> 00:27:35,170
Fine. I won't blame you for intentionally bullying me.

452
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,704
Who cares if you blame me or not.

453
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:38,940
As long as you are willing to lea—

454
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,477
Hide! Someone's shooting!

455
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:45,513
Honey, run!

456
00:27:53,788 --> 00:27:56,257
Get in the car

457
00:27:58,226 --> 00:28:00,160
Be careful

458
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:12,906
Call the ambulance.

459
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:15,276
I'll call.

460
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,977
Hello, 911? We're at a parking lot.

461
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,887
Tang Yi!

462
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:32,393
Is she okay?

463
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:34,996
Just some abrasions. I already gave her some medication.

464
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:38,333
But she might have suffered a minor concussion, so I ran an MRI just to be sure.

465
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,701
Just waiting for the results now.

466
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:44,172
You know, the bullet came right at us.

467
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:46,841
My brain went blank. I really couldn't do anything.

468
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:48,944
Dr. Jiang, the surgery room is all prepared

469
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:50,245
and the backup blood supply is ready, too.

470
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:52,279
Okay, I'll be right there.

471
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,714
Is it Meng Shaofei?

472
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:55,249
He took a bullet to his abdomen.

473
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,252
I need to head over.

474
00:28:57,252 --> 00:28:58,385
Bandage up her wounds.

475
00:28:58,386 --> 00:28:59,754
Okay.

476
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:05,193
Miss, please give me your hand. I have to bandage you.

477
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:07,029
Sure, I understand.

478
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:08,997
I'll handle it right away.

479
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:11,565
- Zhao Zi.
- Yes.

480
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:13,900
- Bring all the related info on Big K and come with me.
- Okay.

481
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,505
Captain, should I send these back?

482
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,775
- Who's handling this?
- Shaofei.

483
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:22,843
Send them back first.

484
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,311
- Captain.
- Captain.

485
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:26,747
You need to sign this report first.

486
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:27,781
Why are you just bringing this now?

487
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:29,416
Because Brother Shaofei's not here.

488
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:32,020
With him not here, you didn't know to bring this directly to me?

489
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,220
Okay.

490
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:35,489
Okay, get it over to them quickly.

491
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,860
Captain, this is this months' list of restaurants for birthday celebrations. Pick one.

492
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,561
You need to ask me where we're going to eat, too?

493
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:41,995
Shaofei's responsible for this, too.

494
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:45,467
Just call him and ask him.

495
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:47,401
Captain, we caught the criminals.

496
00:29:47,402 --> 00:29:49,872
Then start writing up the statements. Why are you telling me?

497
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,939
You need me to do it for you?

498
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:58,677
When that punk's not here, everyone forgets how to work?

499
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,150
- Zhao Zi!
- Yes.

500
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,886
Hurry up. What's taking you so long?

501
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,030
Captain!

502
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,220
Captain!

503
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,990
Be careful.

504
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:12,159
Something happened to Senior.

505
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,195
He's in the hospital right now.

506
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:16,330
In the hospital?!

507
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:26,808
Meng Shaofei. Where's Officer Meng?

508
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:27,841
Officer Meng took a bullet to his abdomen.

509
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:30,077
He's still in surgery.

510
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,312
How did he get shot?

511
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:33,047
We're not sure.

512
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:34,949
Brother Pao,

513
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,785
please don't worry.

514
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:40,623
We, the Shi Hai Corporation, will be responsible for everything. The medical costs...

515
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:42,723
Get away!

516
00:30:42,724 --> 00:30:44,260
Tang Yi, just stop what you're doing!

517
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,460
- It's not his fault.
- Don't touch him.

518
00:30:46,461 --> 00:30:47,895
Not his fault.

519
00:30:47,895 --> 00:30:50,499
- If it's not your fault, then who's fault is it?
- No.

520
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:51,665
Let me ask you.

521
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:55,069
I agreed for Shaofei to protect you, not for you to use him as a shield against a bullet.

522
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:56,370
Why did this happen?

523
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:58,873
Why? Tell me!

524
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:00,741
Captain!

525
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,347
You listen to me. You better pray nothing happens to him;

526
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:09,017
or else, I'll for sure find evidence for your crimes and take you down to the police station!

527
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:11,052
- Captain, let's go.
- I won't be nice to you!

528
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:12,152
Captain, calm down.

529
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:13,855
- Tang Yi!
- Captain, calm down.

530
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:16,756
Let me go!

531
00:31:39,214 --> 00:31:40,914
Tang Yi,

532
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:43,251
I'm sorry.

533
00:31:48,055 --> 00:31:49,824
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,163
I'm sorry.

535
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,306
I'm sorry.

536
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:11,778
How could this happen?

537
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:14,281
He went to protect Tang Yi.

538
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:17,885
How did he end up taking a bullet for Zuo Hongye?

539
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:20,954
You know his personality better than anyone.

540
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:23,691
He does whatever he wants and always likes to be first.

541
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:27,128
He just likes to be the one that protects everyone.

542
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:29,163
Captain was really worked up just now.

543
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:34,969
Seriously, I've never ever seen him grab someone so much taller than he is and scream at him like that.

544
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:38,840
Actually, Captain's the one that's most worried for A-fei.

545
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,310
As expected. Nothing good comes out of meddling with Hsin-Tien Group.

546
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,944
Yes.

547
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:47,081
I think after the Captain finishes this cup, I'll take him home first.

548
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,851
He was on duty all night yesterday and hasn't slept,

549
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,085
and not in a good mood.

550
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:53,120
Let's go.

551
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:54,989
Sure.

552
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:07,668
Yuchi.

553
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:09,703
Are you okay?

554
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:12,306
The surgery's over.

555
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:14,308
The doctor said it went well.

556
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:17,345
He's in recovery now; waiting for the anesthetic to wear off.

557
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:18,813
Where's the Captain?

558
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:20,915
He's inside.

559
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:24,153
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

560
00:33:24,153 --> 00:33:26,154
No need to worry too much now.

561
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:28,221
The patient's blood pressure is normal now.

562
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:29,356
The wound isn't infected.

563
00:33:29,357 --> 00:33:32,393
Just waiting for the anesthetics to wear off. If his wound heals smoothly,

564
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:34,027
he should be able to leave very quickly.

565
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:35,531
- Thank you.
- No problem.

566
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:36,630
Captain, your tea.

567
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:39,434
Excuse me. Can we go in to see him?

568
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,770
Not yet. You need to wait until he's in the general ward.

569
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,838
Okay.

570
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,108
This time, this punk was lucky the fates were on his side.

571
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,778
Let's see if he'll be this rash from now on.

572
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:54,147
Where did Tang Yi and his people go?

573
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:55,849
They left a long time ago.

574
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,821
Once they heard he was going to be okay, they all took off.

575
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:02,222
And they said they would take full responsibility.

576
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:06,661
Zhao Zi, once we get back, start investigating immediately who attacked them.

577
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:08,162
Yes.

578
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:12,132
Who exactly dares to touch my Unit 3.

579
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,336
I will process and lock up each and every one of them.

580
00:34:16,037 --> 00:34:17,771
Also,

581
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:20,241
starting right now, I want all of you, when out on missions,

582
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:22,342
to be extra careful and cautious of your own safety.

583
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:24,947
I don't want to see anyone get hurt. Understand?

584
00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:26,947
Yes.

585
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:32,487
Once A-fei gets moved to the general ward, call me.

586
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,220
Yes.

587
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:45,900
Boss!

588
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,634
Where is he?

589
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:48,236
Inside.

590
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,675
Get out.

591
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,845
Boss, let me handle it. Don't get your hands dirty.

592
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,212
Get out.

593
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:00,914
Let me handle this small matter, Boss.

594
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:02,282
Small matter?

595
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:05,617
Someone tries to take one of my people out is a small matter. Then, what is considered a big matter?

596
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:10,457
Sorry, Boss. I misspoke.

597
00:35:10,457 --> 00:35:12,360
I'll get out right away.

598
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:23,137
Don't.

599
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:23,938
Sorry.

600
00:35:23,939 --> 00:35:25,505
Spare me.

601
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:27,508
Sorry.

602
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:30,811
I hope you can resist for a long time

603
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:33,448
because I'm going to do my best.

604
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:37,320
Don't.

605
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:42,256
Don't.

606
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,796
Don't. I know I was wrong!

607
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:50,965
No need to tell me now. I'll take my time.

608
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:51,632
Sorry!

609
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:52,732
Let me see how long you can last.

610
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,501
I really didn't know!

611
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:54,801
Then don't say anything.

612
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:56,137
I don't need to know.

613
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:58,138
Relax.

614
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:00,107
He won't kill him.

615
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:02,875
The Boss still understands this principle.

616
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:05,847
Why should I be worried about that punk?

617
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:07,447
Then I misunderstood.

618
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:09,550
I saw you getting so nervous.

619
00:36:10,184 --> 00:36:12,185
I thought you knew each other.

620
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:13,587
What do you mean?

621
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,288
What do you mean by we know each other?

622
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:16,756
Who the hell is he?

623
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,625
Will I know this kind of little punk?

624
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:23,494
Brother De, is it necessary for you to be this angry?

625
00:36:23,494 --> 00:36:27,632
I'm just casually saying. You're just casually listening.

626
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:31,970
Some things shouldn't even be casually spoken.

627
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:35,039
Also, be careful of your knife.

628
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,450
I'm so sorry!

629
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,590
I'm sorry toward him!

630
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:09,309
Why did you take so long before returning my message?

631
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,746
The Boss already caught the guy.

632
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:16,850
Are you trying to get me killed?

633
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:18,652
No!

634
00:37:19,353 --> 00:37:21,954
The plan was executed as I reported it to you.

635
00:37:21,954 --> 00:37:24,723
Making it look like someone is putting pressure on the upcoming bid.

636
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:27,326
Also, I instructed them to only use bats

637
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:30,295
to teach Meng Shaofei a lesson and make it look like he can't protect anyone,

638
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:31,966
that's all.

639
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,834
Bats?

640
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,237
But they used guns.

641
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:39,339
Previously, you said you can get rid of Meng Shaofei,

642
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,208
so I reluctantly cooperated.

643
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:44,711
Now that you let things get this far,

644
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:47,979
or do you have other motives?

645
00:37:47,982 --> 00:37:49,249
I--

646
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,850
Director Zuo, all these years, I've been with Boss and did so many things,

647
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,222
there's no way I would do this!

648
00:37:55,223 --> 00:37:59,090
Furthermore, I really don't know why things turned out like this.

649
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,894
I called my people to confirm and

650
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:04,065
before my guys got there, it already happened.

651
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:07,034
I really didn't send that person there.

652
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,770
I was going to say

653
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:14,140
that this punk, I'll handle myself.

654
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,508
But I never thought that the Boss insisted on asking himself.

655
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:20,848
And he's even doing it personally.

656
00:38:22,316 --> 00:38:25,186
Director Zuo, I never thought that

657
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:29,153
the Boss would react to Meng Shaofei getting injured so dramatically.

658
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:37,698
Anyway, my part in cooperating with your show ends here.

659
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:40,932
If that punk were to inadvertently say something,

660
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:43,169
you're on your own.

661
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,672
Director Zuo!

662
00:38:57,718 --> 00:39:00,054
We sent the guy to Dr. Jiang.

663
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:07,492
Boss, who sent him?

664
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:12,432
Just out of pure curiosity,

665
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,234
since he dares to move the one person our boss holds most dear.

666
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,446
Chen Wenhao.

667
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:39,026
What are you doing following me?

668
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:43,194
We already found out who sent them.

669
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:48,836
Chen Wenhao.

670
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:52,239
I already told Tang Yi to be careful.

671
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:55,942
And now Chen Wenhao really made a move.

672
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:02,350
Miss, this time was all luck.

673
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:06,987
What if something were to really happen?

674
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,857
We would be very worried.

675
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:17,865
That cop isn't one of us.

676
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,535
That's something that the Boss needs to worry about, not you.

677
00:40:26,273 --> 00:40:29,642
Since Tang Yi met that cop,

678
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:32,045
nothing good has come of it.

679
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:35,649
I used my own way to protect him. What right do you have to criticize me?

680
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:38,683
The way Boss reacted to him, I'm sure you saw it, too.

681
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:44,188
Meng Shaofei is different.

682
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,093
If you really care for Boss,

683
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:49,063
you need to let him handle it on his own.

684
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't want to see you get hurt.

685
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:58,239
You don't want to see me get hurt?

686
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,343
Do you know who hurts me the most?

687
00:41:04,845 --> 00:41:07,548
It's you, Gu Daoyi.

688
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,321
- I'll take you home.
- No, you're dodging again.

689
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:21,825
Why is it that every time this subject comes up, you dodge the subject?

690
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:25,396
Why can't you just accept my feelings for you?

691
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:30,069
I just want to tell you...

692
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,572
I like you.

693
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,342
Zuo Hongye likes Gu Daoyi.

694
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,115
This is not like.

695
00:41:43,684 --> 00:41:46,352
It's due to habit and dependency.

696
00:41:46,353 --> 00:41:48,855
After all, I have taken care of you for so many years.

697
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:51,658
So, you've misunderstood that this was a feeling of like.

698
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:54,561
I don't misunderstand.

699
00:41:54,562 --> 00:41:56,262
I've liked you since I was young.

700
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,697
Had a crush on you for so long.

701
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:59,899
Having confessed to you for so many years.

702
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,837
How could this be a misunderstanding?

703
00:42:06,474 --> 00:42:07,974
Miss.

704
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:10,144
You're right.

705
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:12,445
I'm a habit.

706
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,049
Yes, I'm used to it.

707
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:18,950
I'm used to you being good to me, I'm used to you taking care of me,

708
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,822
I'm used to you cleaning up after my messes,

709
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:26,227
And then I treated this habit as real feelings.

710
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:29,461
I'm awake now, Gu Daoyi.

711
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,364
Don't come any closer.

712
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:35,466
You being nice to me is just something that Tang Yi asked you to do, isn't it?

713
00:42:39,707 --> 00:42:42,109
Let's just leave it like this.

714
00:42:47,014 --> 00:42:49,850
Thank you for all of these years,

715
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,960
Uncle Daoyi.

716
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,880
♫ following love is also ice cold ♫

717
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:06,810
♫ The deeper we walk, the more we are unable to be honest with each other ♫

718
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:12,450
♫ Allow the accustomed love to continue to sink ♫

719
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:18,500
♫ The two people that wants to always believe ♫

720
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:25,400
♫ Only left to choose deny ♫

721
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,640
♫ Then how is it not love? ♫

722
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,130
♫ No one has the courage to admit ♫

723
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:42,880
♫ We are no longer ourselves ♫

724
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:48,676
Toothbrush. Shampoo.

725
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:51,444
Rinse cup.

726
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:53,479
Thermal mug.

727
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,615
Forgot to bring the thermal mug.

728
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:57,717
A-fei, are you awake?

729
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,318
A-fei! A—

730
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,298
Why is he inside?

731
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:23,110
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

732
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,750
♫ Never thought I’d abandon with no regard ♫

733
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,890
♫ I’d care about jealousy  ♫

734
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:33,930
♫ I put you inside my heart ♫

735
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:37,450
♫ Never thought you’d latch onto every opportunity ♫

736
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:44,100
♫ In every corner always greeting me ♫

737
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:49,000
♫ I simply dared not to think, also did not know how to express ♫

738
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,950
♫ my true preference ♫

739
00:45:53,950 --> 00:46:02,500
♫ How can I think about that? I simply shouldn’t be thinking of you ♫

740
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,570
♫ Avoiding your attention, I can finally breathe ♫

741
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:13,380
♫ What situation is this, I don’t want to be awake ♫

742
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,910
♫ Lonely (Lonely). Silent (Silent) ♫

743
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:21,980
♫ No longer able to guard the saint principle that is in the way ♫

744
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,480
♫ I just want to not care, not think, love till the end ♫

745
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,310
♫ My entire life is completely wasted away ♫

746
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:33,090
♫ No need to get hurt ♫

747
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:39,040
♫ We just want to mutually help each other ♫

748
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,500
♫ Steal a bit of savage ♫

749
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:48,370
♫ One more person to share with, why not? ♫

750
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:54,690
♫ Don’t mention love (don't mention love), it was just assembling some possibility ♫
