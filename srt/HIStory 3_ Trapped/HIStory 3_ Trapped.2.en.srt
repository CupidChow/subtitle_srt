17
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,219
Section Chief Yan was just too much

18
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,320
Why pick on Senior?

19
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,459
Senior, have a shrimp. I'm giving you some energy.

20
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,460
Seriously, after that entire meeting, those people from Interpol looked at Unit 3

21
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,359
as if they owned us.

22
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,199
Interpol is made up of the top elites,

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,170
there aren't that many of them.

24
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,370
We need to work overtime again.

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,139
But will this Chen Wenhao really go to that many different places?

26
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,239
Tea houses, cafes, private clubs and nightclubs.

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,549
So many places.

28
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,950
That's right. We don't have that much time or people to watch all these places.

29
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,449
Tang Yi is really something, too.

30
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,689
Forget whether he has anything to do with this murder.

31
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,259
He got his rival boss to come back directly;

32
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,930
He has provoked his rival gangs.

33
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,829
A mess, no matter how you look at it.

34
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,260
Didn't Tang Yi say he was trying to go legit?

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,630
Why make this move?

36
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,130
I know Tang Yi is not that kind of person.

37
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,840
I really don't believe he would just kill someone like that.

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,239
But I just can't figure out the reason yet.

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,879
It's okay, Senior. Don't think too much about it.

40
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,209
Eat more food first.

41
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,909
Isn't this one of your favorites?

42
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,580
This.

43
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,450
You haven't eaten the shrimp I gave you before.

44
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,090
Yes.

45
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,949
You guys eat, I'm going to head home first.

46
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,619
You barely touched your food.

47
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,630
- I'm not hungry, you guys go ahead.
- What's wrong?

48
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:02,259
A-fei!

49
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,829
Senior, I'll go with you.

50
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,459
It's okay, you stay and eat with everyone.

51
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm going now. Bye-bye.

52
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,709
Don't you guys think that A-fei is a bit strange this time?

53
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,139
What do you mean?

54
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,570
If it was before, he would drink a lot and start bad mouthing them.

55
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,779
No one would be able to hold him back.

56
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,850
Look at him today. Not even a sip of alcohol.

57
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,379
So quiet.

58
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,349
Nothing to say, I guess.

59
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,719
In front of so many superiors today, and then to let Interpol ridicule him.

60
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,189
We really need to help our senior track this Chen Wenhao.

61
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,689
We can't give Interpol anymore excuses to pick on him.

62
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:36,899
Yes, we need to work together to help A-fei.

63
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,629
Cheers!

64
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,230
Jun Wei.

65
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,999
Our life is so hard, overtime work is coming.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,209
Tiring.

67
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,209
Okay, let's all help A-fei.

68
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,810
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

69
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,010
Are you by yourself?

70
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,350
What's wrong?

71
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,620
Aren't you already used to the fact that I'll show up?

72
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,760
Waiter, I'd like to change tables.

73
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,090
Sure.

74
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,190
Waiter, please bring me an extra cup.

75
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,299
Just ignore him.

76
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,800
What's the problem? We can drink together.

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,430
Officer, what can I help you with?

78
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,499
The person that took out Wang Kunchen was you, right?

79
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,480
Regarding the Wang Kunchen case, I already gave my statements to the police.

80
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,309
I also gave them my whereabouts that evening.

81
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,550
I don't want to have to repeat myself.

82
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,249
But at the scene,

83
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,690
we found your cufflink.

84
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,999
This style is very popular at my store.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,759
It's a very good seller.

86
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,830
Shall I provide you with our invoice so you can see the numbers yourself?

87
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,180
Did Wang Kunchen die because he knew something?

88
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,680
Or was his death necessary so you can achieve some kind of goal?

89
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,749
You even got Wang Kunchen's business partner to come back from Cambodia.

90
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,690
In these past four years, you've never once personally taken action,

91
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,460
nor given orders to have anyone killed.

92
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,059
To be able to get you to go against your principles, must be quite a special reason indeed.

93
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,300
Unless, this was a mission that Tang Guodong left to you four years ago?

94
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,660
[- He's here.]
[- The situation has changed, change time and location.]

95
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Did you bring money?

96
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,320
Waiter, check please.

97
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,820
Okay.

98
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,319
I pay the bill? What do you mean, Tang Yi?

99
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,820
Thank you.

100
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,390
Tang Yi!

101
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,530
Sir, hello. Today's bill comes to NT$3250.

102
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,369
Will you pay by cash or credit card?

103
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,570
I... I'll pay cash.

104
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,340
Sure.

105
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,580
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

106
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:05,630
Unless, this was a mission that Tang Guodong left to you four years ago?

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,970
[Recipe for spicy tomato sausage gnocchi]

108
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,820
Add olive oil by circling the pot twice.

109
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,450
Can I circle it three times?

110
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,820
That's fine, too. The point is to let the oil heat evenly.

111
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,389
You have to add by circling the pot.

112
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,260
Circling...

113
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,030
When cooking, don't smoke!

114
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,869
When you put the gnocchi into the pot, you need to stir them a bit,

115
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,870
or else they will stick to the pot.

116
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,579
This looks exactly like how you make it.

117
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,010
You have to taste it to know.

118
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,950
Not spicy enough.

119
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,330
Little Tang, you eat that spicy?

120
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,029
That's strange... No matter how I cook it, it never tastes like yours.

121
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,299
Ruling a large nation is like cooking a small delicacy.

122
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,869
Have you heard this saying before?

123
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,100
No.

124
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,670
All these years, taking care of our organization's large and small details,

125
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,239
I've come to discover that nothing should be done in haste

126
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,309
but never neglected or slow.

127
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,249
You have to be very careful and consider each detail In order to really get things done.

128
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:26,250
Take cooking, for example.

129
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,749
Every one of our brothers is like an ingredient.

130
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,389
You really need to understand each ingredient's unique flavors,

131
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,089
in order to be able to combine them.

132
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,160
Only in this way, will the dish not taste strange.

133
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,029
Ingredients?

134
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,159
Old Tang, what ingredient do you think I am then?

135
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,670
- Lotus root.
- Lotus root?

136
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,700
Why lotus root?

137
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,939
You forgot how we met for the first time?

138
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,979
You were dirty all over.

139
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,380
Just like lotus roots when you first dig them out from the mud.

140
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,580
So you dislike me.

141
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,020
Lotus roots are dirty when born but pure when cleaned.

142
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,129
Even if you were born in the worst of environments,

143
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,800
you still retain the essence of innocence.

144
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,629
I understand, Old Tang. I will always retain my innocence.

145
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,569
Actually insisting on being able to cook,

146
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,670
there's another reason.

147
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,240
What is it?

148
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,980
People like us who are surrounded by death daily,

149
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,010
we never know when it's our turn to meet Yama.

150
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,120
If we can't even take care of eating, the simplest task in life,

151
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,119
then where is the fun in life. Right?

152
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,660
Little Tang, you have to treat every meal seriously,

153
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,430
in order to treat life more seriously.

154
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,559
I will.

155
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,269
Once I learn how to cook like you,

156
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,129
I'll let you taste my cooking.

157
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,969
Done learning!

158
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,399
You little brat,

159
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,469
just learning this little bit

160
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,839
and already you want to represent my Tang family to be out to show off and swindle?

161
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,580
I'm confident.

162
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,909
I won't let Old Tang's craft get lost.

163
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,909
Good, you're ambitious.

164
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,620
But it's still way too early for you to take the spatula from my hand.

165
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,490
No, it isn't.

166
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,390
I won't let you down.

167
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,589
But today, we still need to eat this,

168
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,790
which doesn't taste like yours.

169
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,940
Master Tang,

170
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,740
that person has finally returned.

171
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,649
What happened four years ago,

172
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,620
I will personally take revenge for you.

173
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,390
Hsin-Tien Group.

174
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,490
Boss. Second-in-Command.

175
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,300
Wang Kunchen.

176
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,600
Aren't you trying to go legit?

177
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,500
Aren't you against dealing drugs?

178
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,240
I thought you never kill people?

179
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,059
Wang Kunchen.

180
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,130
Cambodia.

181
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,699
I never believed you could ever kill anyone.

182
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,139
What did Wang Kunchen know that forced you to kill him?

183
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,540
Tang Yi!

184
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,609
What a coincidence.

185
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,740
What brings you here?

186
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,479
You also like to eat Japanese food by yourself?

187
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,779
I love eating. It's my passion don't you know?

188
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,679
You haven't answered my question.

189
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,349
I'm the one that should be asking you this question.

190
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:55,350
Why are you here?

191
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,159
I'm here to investigate the Wang Kunchen case.

192
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,729
Who are you meeting here?

193
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:09,999
Since the police are investigating a case, then I won't disturb you.

194
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,939
Since you're here, you might as well help the police.

195
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,779
I'm looking for a man named Chen Wenhao.

196
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,380
Do you know him?

197
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,520
I don't know him.

198
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,949
Looks like we're here for the same reason.

199
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,150
We're waiting for the same man.

200
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,530
You killed Wang Kunchen so that you could bait Chen Wenhao to come back!

201
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,330
Wang Kunchen's death has nothing to do with me.

202
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,870
Your movements lately have not been the same as before.

203
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,130
Since Wang Kunchen died,

204
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,150
you've been acting as if you're waiting for someone to appear in front of you.

205
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,490
You want to meet Chen Wenhao.

206
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,260
What connection does the drug lord of Cambodia have with you?

207
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,030
Don't go.

208
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,230
Are you running away because I'm right?

209
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,369
I have nothing to say to Officer Meng.

210
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:20,340
Does Chen Wenhao have a connection to what happened four years ago?

211
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,510
Tang Yi!

212
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,980
What really happened four years ago?

213
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,350
I'm getting closer to the truth, right?

214
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,459
Officer Meng isn't focusing on his current investigation,

215
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,060
but wants to continue violating my human rights.

216
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,259
If my guess is right,

217
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,460
then tracking you is also a method of my investigation.

218
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,799
Chen Wenhao is also a member of Hsin-Tien Group,

219
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,439
or does he have some type of grudge again Hsin-Tien Group?

220
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,039
So you used anything to try to get him to return.

221
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,370
I told you to get lost, don't you understand?

222
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,979
These four years...

223
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,879
my patience with you is at its limit.

224
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,220
Don't challenge my temper.

225
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,349
Tang Yi, I'm going to get the truth from you today.

226
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:10,120
If I don't get it from you today, I won't let you leave.

227
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,630
For the last time... Get out of my car

228
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,700
You!

229
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,780
The Boss wants you to go see him.

230
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,560
I never thought I'd get cuffed with my own handcuffs.

231
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,829
It's not the first time.

232
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:29,569
Can you not be so sarcastic when you talk?

233
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,399
If it weren't for you taking my gun earlier,

234
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,340
is this what you wanted?

235
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,970
Stop arguing.

236
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,680
You'll be in trouble for kidnapping a cop.

237
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,350
You should worry about your own safety first.

238
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,840
Why do you always head up a mountain whenever you're committing a crime.

239
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,879
I told you to shut up.

240
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:12,279
I didn't intentionally say that.

241
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:15,009
But can you guys come up with something different?

242
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:16,210
Because doing it this way isn't really–

243
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,780
Now!

244
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,120
Tang Yi!

245
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,730
Tang Yi, you go first!

246
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,770
Go!

247
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,980
Over here!

248
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
Yes!

249
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:55,620
Yes, Superior!

250
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,520
I know.

251
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,700
You guys really know how to keep me busy.

252
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,160
It was Interpol again!

253
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,139
What is it that you have against those people?

254
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:13,600
Or have you not written enough self-reflection papers?

255
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,309
What are you huh-ing for?

256
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:16,969
I just felt my heartbeat,

257
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,910
and I'm not feeling too well.

258
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,639
If your heart didn't beat,

259
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,779
would you still be able to stand here?

260
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,280
I'm feeling worse than you are right now!

261
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,650
I told you to look after A-fei. Where are you looking?

262
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,220
Well, he's...

263
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,319
There are so many of you,

264
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,260
and couldn't even look after one of him.

265
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,429
My team member disappeared during an operation.

266
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,229
If this was to get out, where should I hide my face?

267
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:42,429
Captain,

268
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,369
we were all busy trying to see if Chen Wenhao would show up.

269
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,369
Everyone had their own zone to watch over, who knew he would disappear?

270
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:48,969
How do we know where he went?

271
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,110
That's right.

272
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,239
I think if Senior left, he must have had–

273
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,610
Don't make excuses for him.

274
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,520
He must have seen Tang Yi again.

275
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,820
Zhao Zi,

276
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,489
I won't talk about the others.

277
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,489
You've known A-fei the longest.

278
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:09,430
Why didn't you think to take precautions?

279
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,160
What's wrong? Are you okay?

280
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,860
- Brother Zhao Zi!
- Here, sit.

281
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,499
Hurry, move out of the way.

282
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:17,370
Come.

283
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,771
Don't get too excited!

284
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,770
- Deep breaths. Slowly, slowly.
- Let me give you a massage. Here.

285
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,440
Zhao Zi,

286
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,839
I didn't mean to scream at you.

287
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:29,109
I was just talking too fast My voice got a little loud.

288
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:31,249
Follow me and take deep breaths.

289
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:33,280
Here, breathe.

290
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,650
Exhale.

291
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,450
Inhale.

292
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,560
Full breaths.

293
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,530
Exhale.

294
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,359
Better?

295
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
How is it? Are you feeling better?

296
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,400
Much better.

297
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,099
Do you have a heart condition?

298
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,439
Go get it looked at; just to be safe.

299
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:56,640
Yes, I think you should go check it out just to be safe.

300
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,379
I don't know. I don't feel chest pain.

301
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:01,850
Just my heart continues to beat and beat.

302
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,419
So you're feeling okay now?

303
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,100
I'm okay now.

304
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,550
If you're okay, then go find A-fei and bring him back!

305
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,100
I've never had this happen before.

306
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,660
Could it be that something happened with A-fei?

307
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,169
Don't talk nonsense!

308
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,370
Fine, just rest a little.

309
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,570
- Go!
- Hurry!

310
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,839
- This way!
- Hurry up!

311
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,250
- Don't run!
- Don't run!

312
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,320
Don't run!

313
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,020
Where did they go?

314
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,749
You go that way. We'll head this way.

315
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,369
Wait.

316
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,239
This area is too open; it's dangerous.

317
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,870
Go that way.

318
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,150
- Look up ahead!
- Go!

319
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,349
- Hurry up!
- Go!

320
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:15,790
Hurry up, up ahead!

321
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,720
- There's movement there!
- Didn't we go this way before?

322
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Over here, quick!

323
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,130
Hurry!

324
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,900
Here!

325
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,670
- Anything over there?
- No.

326
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,769
Check over there.

327
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:35,340
Let's go over there.

328
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,450
Go!

329
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,419
A-fei, are you inside?

330
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:52,520
Meng Shaofei, leave a message.

331
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,020
A-fei, let me tell you. Hurry up and pick up your phone.

332
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,830
If you don't pick up, Captain's going to throw me into my grave.

333
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,100
A-fei!

334
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,309
Hey, I'm at A-fei's place's alleyway.

335
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:11,240
He's not home and not answering his phone.

336
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,679
Okay, stay in touch.

337
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,410
I'll call you as soon as I find him.

338
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,280
Okay, bye-bye.

339
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,760
Are you looking for me?

340
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,599
Get up. Let's go!

341
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,930
What do you want? Where are you taking me?

342
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,410
Don't let them get away!

343
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,340
Anything?

344
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,709
-Go this away!
- Check over there!

345
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,720
That was close.

346
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
How did I break this?

347
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,330
It won't turn on anymore.

348
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,070
Hurry and call the cops.

349
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,100
You think I'd call the cops?

350
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,799
Then call your people. Just call for support.

351
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,109
I didn't bring my phone.

352
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:20,240
Are you a caveman? Who goes out without bringing a phone?

353
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,010
Go check over there

354
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,480
This way.

355
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,850
There's no one here. Let's go look over there!

356
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,780
Over there.

357
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,179
Hurry up and keep looking!

358
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,180
They're really good at hiding!

359
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,720
We've looked everywhere and can't find them!

360
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,930
- Look over there.
- Over there.

361
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,030
If we didn't have these, everything would be good.

362
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,829
Who brought them?

363
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,970
Fine, it's all my fault.

364
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,000
What are you doing?

365
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,030
That works, too?

366
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,510
Why did you bring me here?

367
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,980
Where did Meng Shaofei take my boss?

368
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,750
A-fei really took off with Tang Yi?

369
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,020
Are you playing dumb with me?

370
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,699
They really are together.

371
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,999
Do you know where they are?

372
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,030
I really need to find him.

373
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,229
Forget it, you probably don't know either.

374
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,670
Or else, you wouldn't have brought me here.

375
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,309
If I don't find him, it'll be me writing the apology letters.

376
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,980
- Call him.
- I tried already. The phone's off.

377
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,420
I don't believe you.

378
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,950
I told you already, I just can't reach him.

379
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,319
Then give me his number, I'll call him.

380
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,890
No way.

381
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,490
Call.

382
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,959
We are the police.

383
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,729
I need to protect my colleague's safety.

384
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:28,829
I'm not going to casually give A-fei's number to you.

385
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:30,570
Definitely no way.

386
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,270
Even if you stare at me,

387
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,140
even if you beat me to death,

388
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,250
no matter what, I won't give it up.

389
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,070
Hey! Where are you going?

390
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,740
Open the door!

391
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,210
Hey, don't leave me here by myself.

392
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,260
This is not the way down the mountain.

393
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,700
Hide in that house first.

394
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,979
Who were those people earlier?

395
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,650
Are they Wang Kunchen's people or Chen Wenhao's people?

396
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,660
Say something.

397
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,260
♫ The right feeling is waiting ♫

398
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:28,980
♫ To meet the right us and then stop ♫

399
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,010
Why did you protect me?

400
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,149
Until I find evidence of you committing a crime,

401
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,419
you are a regular citizen.

402
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,590
You are under my protection.

403
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,289
Don't you feel like you're contradicting yourself?

404
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,890
Is it so hard to just say thank you?

405
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,960
Thank you.

406
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,640
You said it just like that?

407
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
How else?

408
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,009
I thanked you, what's your response?

409
00:29:57,009 --> 00:29:58,940
You're welcome.

410
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,080
Help me get this off.

411
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,110
I don't have the keys.

412
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,249
Where are you going?

413
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,379
Stay here.

414
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
I'll go with you. Going alone is too dangerous.

415
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,320
I told you to stay here.

416
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,930
Then be careful by yourself!

417
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,020
You really didn't find any routes down the mountain just now?

418
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,830
I was just asking.

419
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,770
But thank you.

420
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,969
On such a cold day, I'm glad you got wood to build a fire.

421
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:05,269
All we're missing is a chicken; I'm so hungry now.

422
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,750
You really can't help me get these off?

423
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,190
It's going to hurt.

424
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,529
I, Meng Shaofei have endured bullets, who's afraid of a little hurt.

425
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:29,030
How painful can this be?

426
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,070
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, it really hurts.

427
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,369
Thought you weren't afraid of pain?

428
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,109
Hurt, it really hurts!

429
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,739
I haven't even put it in yet.

430
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:39,379
Then forget it.

431
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:41,479
It's okay, I'll just wear it like this.

432
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:43,250
I'll just wear them.

433
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,750
How can that not hurt?

434
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,620
Strange person.

435
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:06,900
- What are you doing?
- It's so cold outside, I'm going to start a fire inside.

436
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,609
We'll sleep inside tonight.

437
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:09,939
Who's going to sleep inside with you?

438
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,470
You.

439
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:14,339
Fine. If you're not afraid of the cold, then you sleep here yourself.

440
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:15,950
I'm sleeping inside.

441
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,850
What are you doing?

442
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,149
Borrowing your lighter to start a fire.

443
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,550
Don't touch it.

444
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,320
Why are you so mean?

445
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,619
I'm just borrowing your lighter. How else am I going to start a fire?

446
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,769
Just borrowing a lighter.

447
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:42,670
Why be so mean?

448
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,710
What's so special about the lighter?

449
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,610
So weird, then how am I going to start a fire?

450
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,690
Here.

451
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,529
What's this?

452
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,600
Don't you like this?

453
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,530
Nothing is for free.

454
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,470
You taught me that.

455
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,310
What do you want me to do?

456
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,610
Little Tang, you are really hard to swindle.

457
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,679
You know it.

458
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,550
Disband Hsin-Tien Group and become legitimate.

459
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,849
You're already doing that.

460
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:29,050
I need someone to continue.

461
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,990
Don't talk as if you're about to die, okay?

462
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,489
When you're in the mob, you have to understand that you might live today and die tomorrow.

463
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,370
Are you willing to accept?

464
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,200
Using reverse psychology now?

465
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,140
You will accept.

466
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,180
You of all people hate drugs the most.

467
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,249
You need money to maintain people.

468
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:03,320
There is no gang that doesn't touch drugs.

469
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,089
Since we've decided to put an end to this,

470
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,360
you have to prepare yourself.

471
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,130
Is there a problem with tomorrow's meeting?

472
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,870
No, it's just that...

473
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,239
Little Tang,

474
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,039
just pretend it's a safety measure, I'm asking you.

475
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,839
I beg you to accept it.

476
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,940
How old are you?

477
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,850
Humanity is very weak.

478
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,420
It can't stand being tested.

479
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,690
Excuses are used to escape, making reasons to do wrong.

480
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,890
In the end,

481
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,760
everyone forgets that we need to be responsible for our own actions.

482
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:52,729
The money we rely on from fighting, killing, and the drugs we deal with is dirty money for sure.

483
00:34:52,729 --> 00:34:55,140
We live to make money, but don't have a life to spend it.

484
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,370
Little Tang,

485
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:01,110
I want a more stable life for our brothers.

486
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,020
I'm not afraid of you laughing at me.

487
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,519
Old Tang has spent many years to realize

488
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,359
that living a normal life is true happiness.

489
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,129
What's so good about normal?

490
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:20,690
You will just get bullied.

491
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,369
Being normal will allow you and your brothers to live a very stable life.

492
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,179
Some people, because of me,

493
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:36,950
were forced to give up their normal life.

494
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,980
I owe them too much,

495
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,620
with no way to repay them.

496
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,390
Who? Women?

497
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,129
One day, there will be a person

498
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,299
that will let you understand

499
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,700
what the feeling of a normal life is.

500
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,020
Are you willing to accept?

501
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,030
I agree.

502
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,029
If anything happens to you,

503
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,429
I will continue your wish.

504
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,870
Even if I die, I'll still–

505
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,439
We only have one life, don't waste it.

506
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,810
When you're in the mob, you have to understand that you might live today and die tomorrow.

507
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,570
Little Tang,

508
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,179
I really didn't waste my time treating you so well.

509
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:49,619
Little Tang,

510
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,520
not bad.

511
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,729
I really admire you.

512
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:03,570
You can sleep anywhere.

513
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,240
Let me tell you.

514
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,270
To be a person is to be able to go with the flow.

515
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,380
A young master like you who can't sleep unless sleeping on his own bed

516
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,480
will never be able to understand.

517
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,180
Do you know how to practice the art of escaping?

518
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,220
You have to start at an early age.

519
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,530
Start by bending your thumb until it breaks.

520
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,399
When it heals, break it again.

521
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,730
It heals, break it again.

522
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,000
Repeat it over and over until one day you finally learn it.

523
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,209
Can you please tell me which young master grows up this way?

524
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,520
Who forced you?

525
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,220
No one forced me, just myself.

526
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,560
Sometimes the gang is closer to death than the law.

527
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,200
When you are just trying to survive,

528
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,560
you will force yourself to do many things.

529
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,740
So...

530
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,539
it's not that you can't sleep,

531
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:19,640
but you are afraid to sleep.

532
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,380
Are you trying to leave the gang life, so that's why you're trying to go legit?

533
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,219
I'm doing this under the cover of everything.

534
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,960
Sailing under false colors.
(T/N: hang up deer head and pretend to be selling dog meat)

535
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,599
Pretending to go legitimate but actually...

536
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,370
Sorry.

537
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,269
It's my fault.

538
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:47,769
I was too arrogant and judged you from what I saw.

539
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,610
Tang Yi,

540
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,270
I'm sorry.

541
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,380
I already said this much, can you at least give me some type of reaction?

542
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,389
It's the first time I saw a monkey examine himself.

543
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,720
Who are you calling a monkey?

544
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,760
Tang Yi, I'm really serious about my apology.

545
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,129
Let me tell you.

546
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,959
Even if you are serious about becoming legitimate,

547
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,629
I will continue to watch you.

548
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,469
If you dare use anything that is against the law,

549
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:19,970
I will throw you into jail without hesitation.

550
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,869
Keep watching me?

551
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,969
Yes, watching you.

552
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,440
Watch you with both of my eyes.

553
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,399
You want to sleep inside?

554
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,430
It's pretty cold outside.

555
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,299
Fine. Good night.

556
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,480
So cold.

557
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,370
So cold

558
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,170
Meng Shaofei.

559
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,110
Hot.

560
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,489
Meng Shaofei.

561
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,190
What?

562
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,859
You have a fever.

563
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,800
Because your cut's infected.

564
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,599
It's okay.

565
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:31,000
Just let me sleep a little longer.

566
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,519
Meng Shaofei,

567
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,320
get up quick.

568
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:55,930
- What?
- Get up quick.

569
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,130
You have a fever. It's light outside now.

570
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,069
I think they're going to find this place pretty quickly.

571
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,429
Let's hurry and go down this mountain.

572
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,000
Are you okay?

573
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,940
I'm fine.

574
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,210
Why is your jacket on me?

575
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,880
Thank you.

576
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,120
Are you okay?

577
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,319
I'm fine. Just worry about yourself.

578
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,529
Let me tell you.

579
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,629
Before you tell me what happened four years ago,

580
00:42:35,629 --> 00:42:37,830
I will continue to watch you.

581
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,020
I'm fine. You can keep going.

582
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,800
Wait. Isn't it this way?

583
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,359
This way.

584
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,329
I'm telling you, it's this way.

585
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,800
Let's go.

586
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,911
Tang Yi, Tang Yi, it's clearly this–

587
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,470
Be careful.

588
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,940
You okay now?

589
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,480
I'm fine.

590
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,820
♫ Never thought I’d abandon with no regard ♫

591

♫ How can I think about that? ♫

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,130
♫ I simply shouldn’t be thinking of you ♫
