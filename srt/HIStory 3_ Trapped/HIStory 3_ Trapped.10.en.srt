00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,220
♫ How can I leave you behind? ♫

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,560
♫ Leave you here alone ♫

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,740
♫ It's you who was here as I was desperate ♫

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:22,520
♫ and crying; I finally realized myself  ♫

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,620
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

6
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,480
♫ You always don't like to say anything ♫

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,720
♫ It gave me a dream with you ♫

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,130
♫ How many times I wanted to confess from the bottom of my heart ♫

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,130
♫ How I lost to sadness and loneliness ♫

10
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,930
♫ As you are waiting ♫

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,980
♫ Never wanting to let go ♫

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,500
♫ A promise to grow old together while seeing the sunrise and the moon sets with a smile ♫

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,900
♫ How can I leave you behind? ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,290
♫ Leave you here alone ♫

15
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,470
♫ It's you who was here as I was desperate ♫

16
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:25,300
♫ and crying; I finally realized myself  ♫

17
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,300
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

18
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,670
I'll let you guys talk first. I'll come back in a little bit.

19
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:05,204
You look even worse than the guy lying inside.

20
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,645
Is he okay?

21
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:13,413
Still full of energy and asking where his man is.

22
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:19,019
I seriously think there's another place that Meng Shaofei is injured.

23
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:19,856
Where?

24
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:21,591
His head!

25
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:26,926
Because of you, he continues to get hurt and continues to wait for you to find him.

26
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:30,030
He's clearly the one that's injured but still worries about you.

27
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,634
You tell me. If his head isn't injured then what is?

28
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:37,907
Your personality of disregard for others,

29
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:42,041
I believe only someone like Meng Shaofei that the fates favor will not die because he's with you.

30
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:45,949
In order to help you avoid regret for the rest of your life,

31
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:48,517
listen to me, Brother.

32
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:51,121
Meng Shaofei has escaped calamity twice,

33
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:53,581
but this doesn't mean he will the third time either.

34
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,125
Love and life are both beautiful.

35
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,331
But both can disappear at a moments' notice.

36
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,600
If you cherish this relationship,

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,302
you may need to let go of things that must be let go.

38
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:08,504
Don't make it difficult for him.

39
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,344
Remember what I'm saying.

40
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,685
Hi, Little Uncle!

41
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,553
Is everything okay where you are?

42
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:26,289
I just got to Mali, it's pretty good.

43
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,590
Waiting for everyone to get ready then we're leaving.

44
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,758
When we find our first gem, I'll let you know first.

45
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:34,360
Okay. You said it. When you get your first gem, don't forget to take a photo for me.

46
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,397
I know.

47
00:03:35,398 --> 00:03:36,532
By the way, Little Uncle.

48
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,333
Do you know what it looks like when an iceberg is melted by love?

49
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,403
Iceberg?

50
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:41,805
No, what does it look like?

51
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,338
Looks like that Tang Yi.

52
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,759
Tang Yi with the look of someone who died.

53
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:51,447
Shaofei!

54
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:01,124
Wake up!

55
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,628
If you worry about me, then don't let me die.

56
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,437
You're in a really good mood for someone who just got shot.

57
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:24,142
Then, as my boyfriend seeing that I'm okay, isn't your mood, too, not good?

58
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:26,148
It's very not good.

59
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,654
Fine.

60
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:39,828
Don't be mad at me.

61
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:42,865
Standing in front of a bullet is my natural instinct.

62
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:48,637
I'm angry at myself.

63
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:51,140
In that case, it's better if you focus your anger on me.

64
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,944
Next time, if you fire a gun again,

65
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:57,079
I'll still rush in front of it.

66
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:03,418
I know you're trying to stop me from killing anyone.

67
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:05,288
Yes.

68
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:08,856
Because I don't want to see you turn into a sharp and ruthless blade.

69
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:15,461
Revenge may grant you a brief feeling of peace and satisfaction,

70
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,735
but it will also worry and disappoint those that love you.

71
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:22,940
Including you?

72
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,041
No shit! Of course, I worry about you!

73
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:29,545
And I'm the one that's most worried.

74
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:33,149
Tang Yi,

75
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:36,952
let the truth come out

76
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:39,522
and let the killer be dealt with by the law.

77
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,223
This is justice.

78
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:44,060
This is giving back the victims their rights.

79
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,329
But if you take action and punish him illegally,

80
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:51,364
society will only see a mob boss killing a police officer.

81
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:55,734
Then all the things that Brother A-zhi did will be buried forever.

82
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:58,441
This is the result you want?

83
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:13,822
Not to mention,

84
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:16,525
you'd have to pay with your future.

85
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:20,329
Do you think this is what Master Tang wanted to see?

86
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,337
I will turn over He Hang to the police,

87
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,179
along with Jou Guanzhi.

88
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:52,194
Tang Yi,

89
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:54,864
I love you.

90
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:19,555
A-fei,

91
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:27,496
it's almost time.

92
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:29,832
Can I take him away first?

93
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:06,135
What's wrong with the two of you?

94
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:09,769
Sitting here all night long, not saying a single word.

95
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,908
Just keep drinking.

96
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:19,012
I really don't understand why everything had to turn out like this?

97
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:25,285
We used to all come here often for late-night snacks.

98
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:28,357
Now it's just the three of us.

99
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,732
I always looked up to Captain as an example.

100
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:40,567
I also believe Brother A-zhi was passionate about being a police officer.

101
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:44,040
But I don't know what to believe in anymore.

102
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,442
Will we ever be able to

103
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,946
have those days again?

104
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,860
It's okay,

105
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,029
We'll be better than before, right?

106
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,631
It's okay.

107
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,422
Why are you here?

108
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:09,458
You're drinking?

109
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,427
Drinking when I'm happy,

110
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:14,830
drinking when I'm also not happy.

111
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,364
You're not happy?

112
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:18,066
Happy.

113
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,769
I'm very happy.

114
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,737
Because I realized that to achieve some things,

115
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:27,276
some people will do what they're not supposed to do.

116
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:30,345
Turns out that everyone has another face.

117
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:32,848
Just realizing this point

118
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:35,784
is enough cause for celebration.

119
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:38,253
You're talking about what happened with your unit?

120
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,057
It turns out that Captain was covering for Brother A-zhi selling drugs.

121
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,260
It turns out that Brother A-zhi committed all those bad things.

122
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:46,896
We are the police.

123
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,965
Aren't we supposed to chase the bad guys?

124
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:52,068
How can he be worse than the bad guys?

125
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,837
Do you know why I became a police officer?

126
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,940
Because I believed that in this world there were no bad people.

127
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,943
The reason why they do bad things...

128
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:03,746
is because they're forced to.

129
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,047
So, by becoming a cop, I want to tell them

130
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:10,149
there are so many beautiful things in this world, waiting for us to discover.

131
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:16,926
Am I also wrong for thinking this way?

132
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,960
Are you also like them,

133
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,463
with a second face?

134
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,335
I came to see you today

135
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,338
to tell you

136
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:07,242
that I'm leaving in a few days.

137
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,913
You're really going?

138
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:12,948
Where are you going?

139
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,819
Why is everyone leaving me?

140
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,920
Mom and dad left me, Grandma left me,

141
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:25,528
Captain went to jail, Brother A-zhi is also in jail. Why are you leaving now, too?

142
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:28,430
But I already promised people that I'd go.

143
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,743
Then tell me, what I should do?

144
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,813
You're asking me?

145
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,217
If you don't want me to leave,

146
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,554
then I will stay.

147
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:56,825
Don't leave.

148
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:04,026
Where's my colleague?

149
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:05,393
In the washroom, I think.

150
00:14:05,393 --> 00:14:07,295
Go ahead and eat first.

151
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:10,833
You guys aren't eating?

152
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,954
Captain.

153
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:35,090
How did it go?

154
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,993
Was she really happy?

155
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:40,259
Look. Wedding gown photos.

156
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,400
And now, the bride's brother, Jukuan, on behalf of their father, will walk the beautiful Little Ya

157
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,910
slowly towards the handsome and gentle groom, Yucheng.

158
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,960
Little Ya and Yucheng were in the same class in university.

159
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,296
Little Ya always tried to help...

160
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,698
Very successful and very warm.

161
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,700
Little Ya's smile looks really happy!

162
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,360
The two of them began to date sweetly.

163
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,741
Right now, her brother is giving Yucheng her hand.

164
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:27,542
Although her eyes were a bit swollen,

165
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,320
she was the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.

166
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,290
Now, let's have the couple bow to the brother to show their gratitude.

167
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,680
Gratitude for raising them all the way till now.

168
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,460
Thank you, Brother. Okay, after the bow...

169
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,094
Little Ya,

170
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:49,397
Daddy's very sorry.

171
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,205
Now let's use our warmest applause to bestow our greatest wishes to the couple, Little Ya and Yucheng.

172
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,541
You and Sister Lizhen have always been my examples.

173
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:03,979
I believed everything that the two of you taught me.

174
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,714
You once told me,

175
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,185
"Justice is lighting an oil lamp in the wind.

176
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:11,286
We are keepers of the lamp,

177
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:14,690
and we need to always be on alert.

178
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,358
Because even though this lamp is very small,

179
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:18,594
it is very important.

180
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:21,997
It will lead people to walk down the right path."

181
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,668
But...

182
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:29,671
you became a person that let that lamp go out.

183
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:33,342
You hid the truth from four years ago

184
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:37,643
and cast suspicions on Sister Lizhen's allegiance and unfounded criticisms.

185
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,055
I know.

186
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,226
I won't receive any of your forgiveness.

187
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:58,100
Because in between my role as a police officer and a father,

188
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:02,837
I selfishly chose to be a father.

189
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,944
You don't regret it?

190
00:17:14,884 --> 00:17:17,186
Four years ago,

191
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:22,053
A-zhi told me he killed Lizhen and Tang Guodong.

192
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:25,461
At the time, I was very scared.

193
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,262
But...

194
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,132
at the same time, relieved.

195
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:35,537
Because in reality,

196
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:38,240
I saved my own daughter.

197
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:42,778
So that I can see her so happy at this moment

198
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:55,624
A-fei,

199
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:58,226
actually, I hated you at one time.

200
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:03,432
When everyone else gave up,

201
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:08,799
stopped looking into the details of the case between Lizhen and Tang Guodong,

202
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:13,542
only you held on to Tang Yi like a dog with a bone.

203
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,744
You kept asking for an answer.

204
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:23,385
Even if there was no one in the world willing to stand beside you,

205
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:26,588
you still stood steadfast and relentless.

206
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:29,925
But you never actually stopped me.

207
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,228
That's right,

208
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:36,165
I didn't.

209
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,701
Because these past years,

210
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:43,539
you reminded me every day of what a stupid thing I did.

211
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,773
I wanted to see when you would give up,

212
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:50,309
to confirm to me that you were like everyone else, and no different than me.

213
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,724
I had fallen

214
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:06,528
and wanted others around me to also be like me.

215
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:11,433
It wasn't like that at all.

216
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:16,338
You didn't stop me

217
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,940
because you were also waiting.

218
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,244
You were waiting for me to get all the facts.

219
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,813
You were waiting for me to tell the truth.

220
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:28,583
You just didn't have the courage to say it on your own.

221
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:35,724
You only chose to be a father

222
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:38,894
but never gave up being a police officer.

223
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,901
Don't think about it anymore.

224
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,137
How can I not think about it?

225
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,573
Even Captain's involved in this case.

226
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,310
Who would've thought that a drug and stolen goods case

227
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,145
would have such a big impact.

228
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:35,117
All of Brother A-zhi's things are here.

229
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,952
Thank you.

230
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:42,154
Senior, is everything okay between you and Tang Yi?

231
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,594
He's now out on bail but under house arrest,

232
00:20:46,594 --> 00:20:49,631
neither good nor bad; just going by the book.

233
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:54,065
What if he needs to serve time in jail later? What are your plans?

234
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,473
I don't know what will happen in the future,

235
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:59,774
but I will wait for him.

236
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,249
Have you heard? The new personnel has been confirmed.

237
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:08,382
No.

238
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:10,986
Who is it? New team leader? Do we know who it is?

239
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:12,222
You guys don't know either?

240
00:21:12,222 --> 00:21:14,556
When will they start?

241
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:16,825
Hello?

242
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,294
Yes, I'm Meng Shaofei.

243
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:30,638
Uncle,

244
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:32,641
I think I should return this to you.

245
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:48,589
I heard...

246
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,626
that you were Lizhen's favorite junior officer.

247
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,731
After she was gone,

248
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,534
thank goodness you were there to follow through with the case

249
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:02,337
and return her reputation.

250
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,909
Thank you for all you've done for Lizhen.

251
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:15,850
In Sister Lizhen's last years,

252
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,252
she was very concerned about the drug cases.

253
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,855
She often said

254
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,356
drugs have deeply harmed people.

255
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:24,458
But as soon as we find one channel,

256
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:26,361
we can save a lot of people.

257
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:29,463
Her last years,

258
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:31,566
her focus was all on drug investigation cases.

259
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:39,941
If you want to receive Sister Lizhen's forgiveness,

260
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,544
don't sell drugs anymore.

261
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:51,353
You can't help but go with the flow.

262
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:56,158
Lizhen...

263
00:22:56,992 --> 00:22:59,027
must be very disappointed with me.

264
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:16,977
This lifetime,

265
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,847
I've done many things wrong.

266
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:21,649
The only right thing

267
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,352
was to love you.

268
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:30,926
At the time, the only thing that I thought I did right,

269
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:34,329
from where we stand now, was the worst wrong that I could have ever done.

270
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,634
My life...

271
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:44,605
probably started when I first stepped into the gang

272
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:46,775
and it sealed my losing streak.

273
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:51,746
Uncle,

274
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:53,949
have you gone to see Tang Yi?

275
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,218
He won't see me.

276
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:58,819
He said,

277
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,222
there's no need to meet.

278
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:04,925
Uncle don't worry about it now,

279
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:06,495
his personality is indeed like this.

280
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,366
You are with Tang Yi now?

281
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:22,010
Yes, Uncle.

282
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,746
I'm sincere.

283
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:27,649
I have no right to say anything.

284
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,854
God has given me back this son,

285
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:35,957
but our father-son relationship

286
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:39,628
will probably never be reconciled.

287
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:41,930
No, it will.

288
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:45,132
Tang Yi looks very cold and emotionless

289
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:47,802
because he lost a great deal.

290
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,938
In reality, he needs a lot of love.

291
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:53,808
As long as Uncle is willing,

292
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:55,811
I'm positive you will be able to get Tang Yi back.

293
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:02,483
Look.

294
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:03,952
Me and Lizhen.

295
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,587
The mob and the police.

296
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,588
Who would've thought that our son

297
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,925
would also be a gangster who was in love with a cop.

298
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,630
The path that you have chosen will be quite difficult in the future.

299
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,301
I'm very happy that

300
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:22,938
there's still you that is next toTang Yi.

301
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,275
What I can't do for him,

302
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:30,445
I hope that you can do for me.

303
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,047
No matter what, don't give up on him,

304
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:34,416
Okay?

305
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:36,952
Uncle,

306
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,753
you can rest assured,

307
00:25:39,754 --> 00:25:41,923
I will never give up on him.

308
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,545
Then,

309
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:06,915
I will entrust him to you.

310
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,443
Why do you care so much for him?

311
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,879
Because he is your birth father.

312
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,248
I'm very thankful he brought you into this world,

313
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:42,817
to be able to meet with me.

314
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,623
Even though I know he's not the one that killed Master Tang,

315
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:50,458
I still can't

316
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:52,394
accept him as my birth father.

317
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:56,330
And after Hsin-Tien Group becomes legitimate,

318
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:57,364
I will not be able to have any contact

319
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,267
with those that sell drugs.

320
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:05,739
Actually, he's still very much

321
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,876
in love with Sister Lizhen.

322
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:11,211
For someone who is very emotional like him,

323
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,113
to suddenly find out that

324
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:14,949
he mistakenly judged his best friend and girlfriend,

325
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,152
his heart must be loaded with guilt.

326
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:23,591
He lost both love and friendship.

327
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:24,526
If he can't even get close to

328
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:26,560
his only remaining family,

329
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,228
then in this world,

330
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,331
he truly has nothing at all.

331
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:33,033
I'm done beating.

332
00:27:47,515 --> 00:27:49,850
I know it's hard for you to forgive him in this short amount of time.

333
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:52,454
This isn't something that you can let go easily.

334
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:55,322
But when I saw Uncle

335
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:57,257
having to face such an unrecoverable pain,

336
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,260
a past that he can never make up for,

337
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:01,795
this type of regret,

338
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:04,132
I don't ever want to see you go through.

339
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:17,677
You need to pay attention when you're cooking.

340
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:27,255
See?

341
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:27,922
As long as you are willing,

342
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,125
you can always repair it.

343
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:32,660
Master Tang always used to say

344
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:34,963
ruling a nation is like cooking.

345
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:38,365
But after having experienced all of these things,

346
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:40,601
I finally realized that

347
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:43,638
people are not that simple.

348
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:58,318
He said he was going to go see Sister Lizhen.

349
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,054
How about you?

350
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:00,755
Do you want to go?

351
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:04,526
Tang Yi!

352
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,235
I don't know.

353
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,872
She's not in my memories.

354
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,274
I don't know where to

355
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:21,543
place her in my heart.

356
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:26,814
In her situation then

357
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:28,682
and during that generation,

358
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,117
I believe that she thought

359
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:31,552
sending you to a normal family

360
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:34,054
would be the best for you.

361
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:35,255
What happened later

362
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:37,258
was not something that she could foresee.

363
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:40,929
I don't blame her.

364
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:44,733
It's just that...

365
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:46,634
I don't know how

366
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:48,737
to have a connection to her.

367
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,141
Tang Yi,

368
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:56,276
not letting go of an obsession

369
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:59,213
is the trap that we make for ourselves.

370
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,416
Then regrets will only be regrets.

371
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:05,954
Maybe, you guys can have a different ending.

372
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:15,029
Thank you for not giving up on me.

373
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:17,264
Thank you for letting me know

374
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:19,433
that my existence in this world

375
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,035
has meaning.

376
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,439
Thank you for loving me.

377
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:29,076
Are you confessing to me now?

378
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,845
You can't tell?

379
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:33,313
You are Tang Yi.

380
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:35,382
Why would you confess to me?

381
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:37,484
And I'm going to be like you.

382
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:38,419
Be like me how?

383
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,954
First kiss then speak.

384
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,567
Don't try to get off that easy.

385
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:55,203
We're not finished yet.

386
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,040
Hurry.

387
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:02,609
What are you going to draw?

388
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,746
Eyes.

389
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,681
Mouth.

390
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:08,282
What about the nose?

391
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,283
Nose can wait.

392
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:11,920
Done.

393
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:13,053
Why do you need to also make your omelet rice

394
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:15,422
have the same stone face?

395
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:16,191
It eeds a smile!

396
00:31:16,192 --> 00:31:18,592
I told you many times before.

397
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:20,295
Isn't this cuter?

398
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:21,695
These eyes!

399
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:22,696
What's wrong?

400
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:24,499
The eyebrows are crooked!

401
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,501
This is crooked.

402
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:27,634
This is you.

403
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,438
The one you drew is pretty ugly.

404
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:14,015
Jack,

405
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,716
why are you here?

406
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:16,884
Starting today,

407
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:18,786
I'm moving here to live with you.

408
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:23,790
Why are you moving to my house?

409
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,094
That day, you asked me to stay.

410
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:28,195
Yeah, you could say that.

411
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,097
But what I meant by stay was not this kind of stay.

412
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:34,334
You know, because of you asking me to stay,

413
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:36,637
I gave up everything.

414
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:38,272
What do you mean?

415
00:32:38,273 --> 00:32:39,840
I quit my job.

416
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:44,042
So, I now have no salary and no home to go home to.

417
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:47,846
So... you need to take responsibility.

418
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:54,886
Wait. Where is your family?

419
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:58,390
People like us who live with danger with each passing day,

420
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,327
we don't have a family.

421
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:02,229
I'm alone wherever I go.

422
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,797
- So... take me in
- But...

423
00:33:05,801 --> 00:33:06,867
Think about it.

424
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:11,069
I can share your rent and can handle all the housework.

425
00:33:11,105 --> 00:33:14,173
Also, I'm a great cook and can help you prepare your every meal.

426
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,642
Aren't I a great bargain?

427
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:17,177
Seems that way.

428
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:18,612
Are you hungry?

429
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:20,815
Let me put something together for you to eat.

430
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:30,324
Actually, I can do all of these things, too.

431
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:33,226
You don't need to take everything on.

432
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:38,633
Housework is done with the family, that's why it's called housework.

433
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:39,933
Right.

434
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,702
We are a family.

435
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,403
So, we'll do housework together.

436
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:45,005
You can do Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

437
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:47,086
I'll be Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturday plus Sunday.

438
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,278
I'm hungry.

439
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,239
Will you give me something to eat?

440
00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:28,416
You definitely loved me.

441
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,686
That's why you gave birth to me.

442
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,724
You must have wanted me to have a normal life.

443
00:34:37,725 --> 00:34:39,760
That's why you sent me away.

444
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:46,734
But you never thought that

445
00:34:47,935 --> 00:34:50,938
I would still end up on the path to become the mob.

446
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,370
[Beloved Mother, Li Lizhen's grave]

447
00:34:53,374 --> 00:34:56,043
This is what you didn't want to see happen the most.

448
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:02,450
You have always been in my heart.

449
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:07,655
I have missed you very much.

450
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:15,630
Thank you for letting me know that you loved me.

451
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:25,539
Mom,

452
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:28,509
thank you for giving birth to me.

453
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:20,321
Do you still remember what this is?

454
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:24,458
This is the first present that I gave to you.

455
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:40,073
I recall that I was very poor back then.

456
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:42,276
I could only afford one flower.

457
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,814
But you still had a big smile on your face.

458
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:53,053
What should I say?

459
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:56,323
You lied to me for 28 years.

460
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:02,061
You even pulled one over on a trickster like me who did 24 years' of jail time.

461
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:09,937
The last time we met,

462
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:14,942
you told me you didn't love me anymore.

463
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:20,514
A lie, right?

464
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:34,461
Our family of three

465
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:36,831
is finally able to come together.

466
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:41,535
But who'd believe it turned out like this.

467
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,406
It really makes me sick.

468
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,445
Lizhen,

469
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:55,750
I'm sorry.

470
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,856
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

471
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,837
She...

472
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:53,507
Your mother,

473
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,411
never let me know you existed.

474
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:02,450
But we still ended up meeting.

475
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,256
She really is very stubborn

476
00:40:09,924 --> 00:40:12,226
and despises evil with a vengeance.

477
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:16,430
If she knew, she would be so angry.

478
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:16,753
If back then, I didn't choose to walk this path,

479
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,462
life would probably be so different.

480
00:41:27,101 --> 00:41:29,737
The "probably" that couldn't have happened,

481
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:37,408
perhaps now is no longer important.

482
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:46,954
True.

483
00:41:47,955 --> 00:41:50,924
Each one of us chooses our own lives,

484
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,328
we can't blame anyone else.

485
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,315
This was to get revenge on Tang Guodong,

486
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:17,250
to try and recruit Jack.

487
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:21,288
It contains all the information on Hsin-Tien Group.

488
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:25,692
I have no use for it.

489
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:19,846
Don't repeat my mistakes.

490
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:15,630
[This lifetime, I've done many things wrong. The only right thing was to love you.]

491
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,306
- Where's the Boss?
- The Boss and Dr. Jiang are chatting upstairs.

492
00:45:29,443 --> 00:45:30,810
You guys are back.

493
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,479
Brother Daoyi.

494
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,614
Why are you still here?

495
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:36,883
Didn't you know that I live here?

496
00:45:36,884 --> 00:45:38,918
Being together is being together,

497
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:41,120
but at least try not to be so blatant about it;

498
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:43,857
moving in and making it your home so quickly,

499
00:45:43,857 --> 00:45:45,358
isn't it too without restraint?

500
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,227
Sister-in-Law. (T/N: older brother's wife)

501
00:45:49,363 --> 00:45:52,098
What did you just call me?

502
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:53,332
Sister-in-Law.

503
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,335
Is there a problem with that?

504
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,273
I'm okay with you calling me that.

505
00:46:00,274 --> 00:46:01,874
He really has no shame.

506
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,543
He actually admitted it.

507
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,812
What are you embarrassed about?

508
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:07,580
I'll talk to you later! I need to rush to get some groceries!

509
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:09,349
I'll be back in two hours! Stay for dinner tonight!

510
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,117
I'm cooking!

511
00:46:10,118 --> 00:46:11,652
Bye-bye!

512
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:16,456
So, what did he mean by that just now?

513
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:20,193
I think, some things

514
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,994
can only be understood

515
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:24,230
but not said.

516
00:46:24,231 --> 00:46:26,233
Then, what about us?

517
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:29,702
Only understood,

518
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,537
can't be said.

519
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,640
Is that okay?

520
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,275
Not okay!

521
00:46:44,918 --> 00:46:46,920
Are you done smiling?

522
00:46:49,189 --> 00:46:53,790
I specifically came over to see what an iceberg that is melted by love looks like.

523
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,961
Tang Yi in love is like an antique that has just been dug up;

524
00:46:56,961 --> 00:46:58,231
so rare in this world

525
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,032
that I want to look at it longer.

526
00:47:00,033 --> 00:47:01,935
Just drink your tea.

527
00:47:03,937 --> 00:47:06,305
Why are you in love but still like an enigma?

528
00:47:06,306 --> 00:47:08,541
You're like a closed up clam.

529
00:47:09,143 --> 00:47:10,943
In this world, only Meng Shaofei

530
00:47:10,944 --> 00:47:13,746
would be bored enough to try and pry open such a clam.

531
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,082
True love is invincible!

532
00:47:17,684 --> 00:47:19,118
You're one to talk.

533
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,419
What do you mean?

534
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,255
Andy didn't tell you?

535
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,323
Tell me what?

536
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:25,725
I got Andy's message this morning.

537
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:28,161
There's an English guy that just won't let your Little Uncle go

538
00:47:28,162 --> 00:47:30,096
and insisted on sharing the same tent with him.

539
00:47:30,096 --> 00:47:31,698
F***! Why are you only telling me now?

540
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:33,733
I thought you knew.

541
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:36,736
Fine.

542
00:47:40,641 --> 00:47:42,441
Why doesn't he answer!

543
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,544
It's still nighttime there.

544
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:51,683
I'm telling you! Get me a ticket to Mali right away!

545
00:47:51,683 --> 00:47:53,085
I know there's no direct flight.

546
00:47:53,086 --> 00:47:55,521
I'll give you an hour to find a way.

547
00:47:55,522 --> 00:47:57,023
I want to be there in the shortest time possible,

548
00:47:57,024 --> 00:47:58,825
You hear me?!

549
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:03,929
What are you looking at? You haven't seen me angry before?

550
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:06,166
Never seen you jealous before.

551
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,800
A jealous Jiang Jintang is like an antique that's just been found.

552
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,270
So rare in this world

553
00:48:11,271 --> 00:48:13,340
that I really need to take a longer look at it.

554
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,343
Why are you copying me?

555
00:48:17,878 --> 00:48:19,579
Jintang,

556
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,315
it's true that love requires you to guard it.

557
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,217
But if you can be with the one you love,

558
00:48:24,218 --> 00:48:26,053
that's true happiness.

559
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,087
Some words are left unspoken.

560
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:30,122
Once you miss the opportunity, it will turn to regret.

561
00:48:30,123 --> 00:48:32,759
I'm hoping you will not end up like that.

562
00:48:35,229 --> 00:48:39,096
I never imagined you were capable of saying such emotional words.

563
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:41,133
Me either.

564
00:48:41,134 --> 00:48:42,902
Not bad.

565
00:48:42,903 --> 00:48:45,603
I'm happy for you; you're more human now.

566
00:48:45,606 --> 00:48:46,873
The info is true.

567
00:48:46,874 --> 00:48:48,541
I'm not lying.

568
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:50,142
You need my help?

569
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:51,644
Don't be polite with me.

570
00:48:51,645 --> 00:48:52,845
No need.

571
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,415
I'm going back to go pack now.

572
00:49:06,593 --> 00:49:08,594
- For you.
- Thanks.

573
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:12,931
- I want to drink this.
- No way.

574
00:49:12,931 --> 00:49:14,201
That's mine.

575
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,301
What a coincidence.

576
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:16,669
How are you guys?

577
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:18,337
Why are you here?

578
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:20,506
You guys are here thoughtfully and lovingly picking up your partner.

579
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:21,908
I'm waiting for someone to get off work.

580
00:49:21,908 --> 00:49:23,443
That's normal.

581
00:49:26,346 --> 00:49:28,014
You said you wanted to quit.

582
00:49:28,015 --> 00:49:29,815
There's got to be another reason, right?

583
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,553
I quit because I found something that I really want to do,

584
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,621
no other reason.

585
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:37,824
Chen Wenhao already told me.

586
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:47,066
Before, you unceasingly went after him.

587
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,903
Now, you've finally fulfilled your wish. Right?

588
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,538
Congratulations, ex-Boss.

589
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:56,540
You used me because you wanted to cooperate with Chen Wenhao?

590
00:49:57,144 --> 00:49:58,911
What's in the past is in the past.

591
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:00,947
I have my own pressures and reasons to deal with, too.

592
00:50:00,947 --> 00:50:04,350
Relationships between people are based on mutually using each other,

593
00:50:04,351 --> 00:50:06,252
there are no real feelings attached.

594
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:10,620
In order to achieve one's goal, a moderate amount of lying is acceptable.

595
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,559
Don't get too hung up on the past, okay?

596
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:16,894
Easy come, easy go. That's the way to maintain peace in this world.

597
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,199
So, what we have between us is just a mutual using of each other

598
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,766
So, what we have between us is just a mutual using of each other

599
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,936
and no amount of true feelings are attached?

600
00:50:24,471 --> 00:50:25,938
Zhao Zi,

601
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,240
that's not what I meant.

602
00:50:28,241 --> 00:50:30,977
A-fei, I'm staying at your place tonight.

603
00:50:30,978 --> 00:50:32,178
Tang Yi!

604
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:33,013
Zhao Zi,

605
00:50:33,014 --> 00:50:35,147
I've never lied to you.

606
00:50:35,148 --> 00:50:36,415
You're trying to lie to me again.

607
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:37,416
Let's go!

608
00:50:42,556 --> 00:50:43,490
Put me down!

609
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:44,523
A-fei!

610
00:50:44,524 --> 00:50:46,559
A-fei, save me!

611
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,195
Sit.

612
00:50:48,196 --> 00:50:50,363
A-fei, save me!

613
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:53,666
- Afei, save me.
- Sit.

614
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:55,968
- Let's go.
- Let me off!

615
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:57,903
Let me off!

616
00:50:57,904 --> 00:51:00,206
Where are you taking me?!

617
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:01,708
We don't have helmets on,

618
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:03,476
we'll get stopped by the police.

619
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,945
For you, I don't mind getting caught.

620
00:51:05,946 --> 00:51:09,515
When did they start seeing each other?

621
00:51:09,516 --> 00:51:10,851
I don't know.

622
00:51:19,626 --> 00:51:21,427
Zhao Zi!

623
00:51:21,428 --> 00:51:23,128
Shorty!

624
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:26,232
Shorty!

625
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,935
- Let me go!
- Zhao Zi, listen to me.

626
00:51:28,935 --> 00:51:32,072
Don't touch me! I don't want to be used by you!

627
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:38,944
Zhao Lian, listen to what I'm saying.

628
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,649
Everything that's in the past, I won't explain to you.

629
00:51:46,086 --> 00:51:49,486
I admit that during this time, I've given you truths and lies.

630
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,971
But never once did I say them for the purpose of using you,

631
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:54,260
not one single word.

632
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:55,762
Do you understand?

633
00:51:57,397 --> 00:51:59,732
I have never used you,

634
00:51:59,733 --> 00:52:01,801
never once.

635
00:52:01,802 --> 00:52:03,669
How do I know which words were real,

636
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,971
which ones were false?

637
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:06,739
How do I believe you?

638
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,074
At one time, my most trusted superior,

639
00:52:08,075 --> 00:52:08,875
my most trusted senior,

640
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,676
neither one can be trusted now.

641
00:52:10,677 --> 00:52:12,879
What do you want me to believe in now?

642
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:17,150
You can believe your heart.

643
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,988
Ask your heart,

644
00:52:22,988 --> 00:52:25,325
"Are you still willing to trust me?"

645
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:35,801
You can believe in nothing,

646
00:52:35,802 --> 00:52:37,970
but these two sentences,

647
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:39,939
you must believe in.

648
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:44,310
I like you

649
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:48,611
and I stayed because of you.

650
00:52:49,282 --> 00:52:52,649
These two sentences, you better imprint them into your memory.

651
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,524
Shorty,

652
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:01,592
when I was first attracted to you, it was only a curiosity.

653
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:03,429
How can someone be so silly,

654
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,264
so naive,

655
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,000
at the same time, so horny.

656
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:08,667
I'm not!

657
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:10,803
You are.

658
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:13,038
You touched me... here.

659
00:53:13,038 --> 00:53:15,008
That's because you wanted me to touch you.

660
00:53:15,008 --> 00:53:16,242
I don't care.

661
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:19,278
Anyway, I was attracted to you.

662
00:53:19,278 --> 00:53:20,980
Let me tell you.

663
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,649
This is the first time I've ever cared so much for someone.

664
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,217
I worried that if you didn't have me,

665
00:53:25,218 --> 00:53:27,420
what you would eat for your daily meals.

666
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,355
I worried that if I wasn't waiting for you at home,

667
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:31,424
you'd be lonely when you come home.

668
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,626
This is the first time I'm so reluctant to give someone up.

669
00:53:36,496 --> 00:53:39,265
So when you wanted me to stay,

670
00:53:39,265 --> 00:53:41,734
I made up my mind to stay,

671
00:53:42,736 --> 00:53:45,038
because I didn't want to leave you.

672
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:58,083
If you still don't believe me

673
00:53:58,084 --> 00:53:59,818
or want me to leave,

674
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,521
I will leave.

675
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,024
But you need to prepare yourself,

676
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:07,738
because there will be a good chance that you will never see me again.

677
00:54:08,428 --> 00:54:10,930
Are you trying to scare me?

678
00:54:10,931 --> 00:54:12,832
I'm serious.

679
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:19,235
So, do you want me to go or do you want me to stay?

680
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:22,642
One word, I won't make a fuss.

681
00:54:29,783 --> 00:54:32,317
- I'm leaving.
- Stay.

682
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:47,099
Nervous?

683
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,035
A little bit.

684
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:54,440
Wait for me a bit longer.

685
00:54:58,445 --> 00:55:00,346
Are you ready?

686
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,251
Almost ready.

687
00:55:05,752 --> 00:55:07,353
Okay.

688
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,691
Come on.

689
00:55:16,496 --> 00:55:17,763
You're researching this?

690
00:55:17,764 --> 00:55:20,233
Not... Not really.

691
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:22,868
Reading that won't help you,

692
00:55:24,037 --> 00:55:26,339
I'm more of use.

693
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,386
Wait!

694
00:55:39,387 --> 00:55:43,553
I think... we didn't close the window.

695
00:55:44,357 --> 00:55:46,760
What are you doing?

696
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,062
This way... no one can see.

697
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,332
What do you want to do?

698
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:54,066
I'm going to devour you!

699
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:55,001
No!

700
00:55:55,002 --> 00:55:57,069
Don't move so much!

701
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,571
That tickles.

702
00:56:00,307 --> 00:56:02,241
That's not what it said in the book just now.

703
00:56:02,242 --> 00:56:03,242
Slow down!

704
00:56:03,243 --> 00:56:04,710
Don't be so hasty!

705
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:05,711
You're really ticklish?

706
00:56:08,515 --> 00:56:10,649
Here, I come!

707
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:14,954
Here, I come!

708
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,356
Zhao Zi, don't! Don't!

709
00:56:18,892 --> 00:56:20,059
Zhao Zi, be more gentle!

710
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,960
Don't move!

711
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,260
I'm ticklish!

712
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,061
I always wanted to ask you,

713
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:59,029
why is that little house and that lighter

714
00:56:59,032 --> 00:57:01,134
so important to you?

715
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:04,370
That little house was the first birthday gift that

716
00:57:04,371 --> 00:57:05,804
That little house was the first birthday gift that

717
00:57:05,805 --> 00:57:07,807
I gave to myself after coming to Hsin-Tien Group.

718
00:57:09,476 --> 00:57:11,811
I always wanted a home.

719
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,617
The lighter is my promise to Master Tang,

720
00:57:18,618 --> 00:57:20,819
to legitimize Hsin-Tien Group.

721
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,422
To let all the brothers live a normal life.

722
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:29,261
It truly is a formidable task.

723
00:57:31,398 --> 00:57:33,632
But this task will need to wait until I get out

724
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:35,635
in order to continue.

725
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:49,948
Thank you.

726
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:51,950
Thank me for what?

727
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:54,553
Thank you for agreeing to hand Brother A-zhi over to the police.

728
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,955
This way, I don't need to arrest you myself.

729
00:57:56,956 --> 00:57:59,359
It's you that saved me.

730
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,460
I'm the one that should thank you.

731
00:58:02,128 --> 00:58:04,995
It's you that showed me that not letting go of an obsession,

732
00:58:04,998 --> 00:58:07,500
is the way to getting ourselves trapped.

733
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:10,804
And more importantly,

734
00:58:10,804 --> 00:58:13,939
causing even more pain to those that love me.

735
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:17,043
It's you who saved me.

736
00:58:28,188 --> 00:58:31,123
You need to report to them tomorrow.

737
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,529
No matter what happens on the inside,

738
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:39,732
you just need to remember,

739
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,134
I love you.

740
00:58:47,907 --> 00:58:50,442
Then, will you wait for me?

741
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,645
How can I not wait for you?

742
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,516
Look at how many injuries I have suffered for you.

743
00:58:56,516 --> 00:58:58,250
Look.

744
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,986
I took a knife on the mountains for you.

745
00:59:00,987 --> 00:59:04,421
And this... saved your Zuo Hongye.

746
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:06,525
And here...

747
00:59:06,526 --> 00:59:09,696
This one I know, don't say it.

748
00:59:09,696 --> 00:59:11,396
You owe me this much.

749
00:59:11,397 --> 00:59:14,564
Of course, I'm going to wait for you to slowly make it up to me.

750
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,503
I can make it up to you now.

751
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:19,138
Come on then.

752
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,013
Scared?

753
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:46,986
Are you afraid to let go?

754
01:01:46,986 --> 01:01:48,486
Nope.

755
01:01:49,822 --> 01:01:52,625
Don't you think you're conflicted?

756
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,693
Not at all!

757
01:01:54,694 --> 01:01:57,861
Openly expressing your emotions is not difficult.

758
01:02:02,368 --> 01:02:04,069
Thank you.

759
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:06,937
I said it, your reply?

760
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,446
You're welcome.

761
01:02:18,084 --> 01:02:20,018
It's true that you're going to leave me.

762
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:22,054
It's true that you're afraid to let go.

763
01:02:22,055 --> 01:02:24,156
It's true that you'll miss me.

764
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:29,028
But pretending you're feeling fine is fake.

765
01:02:29,028 --> 01:02:30,796
You're the only one in this world that thinks so.

766
01:02:30,797 --> 01:02:32,064
That's right.

767
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:34,885
Because I'm the only one in this world that understands you.

768
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,537
I'm telling you, don't pretend you're fine.

769
01:02:40,537 --> 01:02:41,973
Don't be too afraid to let go

770
01:02:41,974 --> 01:02:44,342
and don't miss me too much.

771
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,344
I will continue to watch you.

772
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,180
Continue to watch me?

773
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:48,213
That's right.

774
01:02:48,214 --> 01:02:51,350
Both my eyes will be watching you.

775
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:27,653
Tang–

776
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:34,160
I will miss you.

777
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:58,460
