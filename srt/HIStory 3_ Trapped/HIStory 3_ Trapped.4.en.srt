00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,220
♫ How can I leave you behind? ♫

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,630
♫ Leave you here alone ♫

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,830
♫ It's you who was here as I was desperate ♫

♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

6
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,490
♫ You always don't like to say anything ♫

7
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:41,700
♫ It gave me a dream with you ♫

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,170
♫ How many times I wanted to confess from the bottom of my heart ♫

9
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,190
♫ How I lost to sadness and loneliness ♫

♫ As you are waiting ♫

♫ Never wanting to let go ♫

♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

18
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,681
- Something's wrong.
- F***!

19
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,592
Got a visual on the target.

20
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:55,398
I told you.

21
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:57,466
Every time you come, there's always a problem.

22
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,747
This police are pretty tactful.

23
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:14,750
Keeping their cool when arresting drug dealers.

24
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:19,787
But these people trying to sell drugs in my territory, they really don't want to live anymore.

25
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,858
How did you know something was going to go down?

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,962
You know a cop?

27
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:29,031
I know him well.

28
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:31,934
The one that suddenly made you so passionate towards me?

29
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:35,338
Are you worth getting passionate over?

30
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:39,674
I know. But that person for sure isn't you.

31
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,211
How about we continue where we left off?

32
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:46,916
- Nevermind.
-Tell me. Tell me.

33
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,518
If you don't give me an answer, I'm not letting you go tonight.

34
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:53,521
What if I said, it was just a moment of impulsiveness?

35
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,928
It would be great if these words would happen to you.

36
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,520
Boss, it's Meng Shaofei.

37
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,492
Should I drive the car in first?

38
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:41,136
What can I do for you?

39
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:48,111
I have something to ask you.

40
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,645
What is it?

41
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,184
This is not the right place. Follow me.

42
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:03,958
What a cute outfit you have on today, Officer Meng.

43
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,962
I was on an operation just now.

44
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:07,980
These cups are really antique looking.

45
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,315
All right, I'll take these over there first.

46
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,349
His name's Andy.

47
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,357
He owns the bar, and business is pretty good.

48
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,094
Really?

49
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,199
The drinks he mixes are pretty good.

50
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,703
Oh.

51
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,708
I'm pretty close to him.

52
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,484
I'm even closer to his boyfriend.

53
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:26,091
So Andy really has a boyfriend?

54
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,210
Why would you keep someone else's picture?

55
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,513
I don't have many friends. The ones that I can take photos of, are even fewer.

56
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:51,082
Excuse me. Here's some tea.

57
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:05,930
If we're speaking frankly, I can also be considered your friend.

58
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,635
If you don't count the first four years,

59
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,270
the past few days, I've rescued you,

60
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,504
you've rescued me,

61
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,605
you gave me a discount on my suit,

62
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,407
I also gave you a small charm for a gift.

63
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,100
If you consider all of these details, I can at least be considered half a friend. No?

64
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,094
Charm...

65
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,330
Oh, you're talking about that? I didn't bring it.

66
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,536
You really want it?

67
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,005
Fine, I'll bring it over in the next couple of days.

68
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,675
Look at you. All your words and actions are always so vague.

69
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:52,612
Are they?

70
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,314
Sure, like just now.

71
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,915
If you want the charm, just say it.

72
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,050
Why stick out your hand like that?

73
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,600
Let me tell you. People will mistake you for wanting to shake their hand.

74
00:07:00,284 --> 00:07:01,887
Really.

75
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,691
Your shirt is very nice.

76
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,094
You mean this one?

77
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,364
This...

78
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,566
My colleague picked it out; a girl.

79
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:16,202
She likes you.

80
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,906
I don't think so.

81
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,208
She's very cute.

82
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,083
As long as you like it.

83
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,586
I think you really have strange tastes.

84
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,790
This frog...

85
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,759
How can this look good on me when I wear it?

86
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,027
I don't believe you.

87
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,499
Fine.

88
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,529
Boss, I'll run with you.

89
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,097
No need.

90
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,266
It's not safe to be by yourself. I'll accompany you.

91
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,102
Did you find out who attacked me?

92
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,703
Not yet.

93
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,406
Then your main mission should be on finding out who attacked me

94
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,409
and not running with me.

95
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,478
Boss.

96
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:34,881
Because we still haven't found out who,

97
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,616
that's why it's dangerous.

98
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,884
Let me go with you, okay?

99
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,118
I can protect you.

100
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,652
I won't be able to bear it if you get hurt again.

101
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:41,954
If you do get hurt again...

102
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,923
I regard you as a brother.

103
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,392
- But I-
- Only as a brother.

104
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,302
I understand.

105
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,092
What's up?

106
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,226
Skipping work?

107
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,527
Who's skipping work?

108
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,463
I'm on field duty today.

109
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,197
Can I help you with something?

110
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,401
I said I was going to bring this over for you.

111
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,143
- Run a lap with me.
- I can even do two.

112
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,804
Hey, your shoelaces are undone.

113
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,633
No need to chase him!

114
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,906
Exactly, how many people have you offended?

115
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,875
So many people want to kill you.

116
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,943
Because I deserve punishment for my crimes.

117
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,979
- You're injured!
- It's nothing.

118
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,782
I'm going to head home first.

119
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,884
I'll protect you.

120
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,721
It was so hard interrogating the one's we brought in last night

121
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,256
The ones from last night were so difficult to question. I'm exhausted.

122
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,490
That's because you're too inexperienced. Next time, I'll teach you some tricks.

123
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,427
- Let's go get some Thai food to reward ourselves.
- Thank you, Jun Wei.

124
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,130
Shorty!

125
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,065
Hi.

126
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,501
What are you doing here?

127
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,270
Brought in for questioning, right?

128
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,805
I came to repay you for the instant noodles. Last time, I said I was going to make it up to you.

129
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:48,341
Instant noodles?

130
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,408
No need! We're going for a big meal now. Jun Wei said he's treating.

131
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:52,645
When did I say I was treating?

132
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,813
Didn't you agree with me just now?

133
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:54,881
No, I didn't.

134
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,048
If I say it, I mean it.

135
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,017
That's my principle.

136
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,052
How about next time then?

137
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,320
Just this time then.

138
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,055
He already said no.

139
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,792
I'm already here, brother.

140
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,765
Brother, take care. We're going to go eat first.

141
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:16,235
Jun Wei, I...

142
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,570
Let's go. Let's eat some instant noodles.

143
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,771
But I'm still working.

144
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,939
I'll bring you back later.

145
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,896
This apron, it looks like it was made for a woman.

146
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:47,933
This belonged to my grandmother before she passed.

147
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,202
She passed a long time ago.

148
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:56,073
Your grandmother's remnant... You didn't put it away for safe keeping?

149
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,412
My grandmother said that objects are just objects.

150
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,880
Their value is given by people.

151
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,249
If it's useful, then don't waste it.

152
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,384
Your grandmother was very wise.

153
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,496
It tastes exactly the same as the last time.

154
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,699
I can remember anything, as long as I want to remember it.

155
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,735
Chopsticks, bowl, and cup. All ready for you.

156
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,240
I told you I was going to make it up to you.

157
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,405
You're too much of a control freak.

158
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,854
What do you think? Compared to Thai food?

159
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,790
Thai food is better.

160
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,528
Thai food really is much better.

161
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,896
No matter how you cook instant noodles, it has its limits.

162
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,533
Don't make things too difficult for instant noodles.

163
00:13:55,968 --> 00:14:00,169
Then... if you don't compare it to Thai food, how is it?

164
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,841
It's good.

165
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,024
Don't move.

166
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,026
How old are you?

167
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,705
This was my grandmother's sewing kit.

168
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,244
She always used that to sew my clothes in the past.

169
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,083
That was given to her when she bought our rice cooker.

170
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,294
- That's my...
- wisest grandmother?

171
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,897
Yes.

172
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,840
Don't go upstairs. It's a mess upstairs.

173
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,310
Jack!

174
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,315
You live alone?

175
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,384
Yes.

176
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,052
- Love eating?
- Yeah.

177
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,054
Girlfriend?

178
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,022
No.

179
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:23,956
Virgin?

180
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,491
Yes.

181
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,260
We're the police.

182
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,129
If we're not interrogating someone, then we're chasing after criminals.

183
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:32,832
We're shorthanded as it is now.

184
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,834
Every day I'm busy protecting the public,

185
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:37,136
when do I have time for a girlfriend?

186
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,539
This has nothing to do with being a virgin.

187
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,809
How is it not related? What? I can't be a virgin?

188
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,444
I haven't even had my first kiss yet. Awesome, right?

189
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:50,947
Awesome! You're the most awesome!

190
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,850
Hey!

191
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,652
What?

192
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,787
I'll introduce someone to you next time.

193
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,623
Really? You're not lying to me?

194
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:01,393
Seriously. I swear to you.

195
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,862
Then let's exchange Line accounts.

196
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,897
When you want to introduce her to me, just text me using Line.

197
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,399
Okay.

198
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,474
[Jack]

199
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,143
Got it.

200
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,098
Idiot.

201
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:48,171
Dr. Jiang, are... are you sure this doesn't need stitches?

202
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,276
It's okay. I just need to clean it.

203
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,178
Take a tetanus shot.

204
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,112
It's not that serious.

205
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,252
Tang Yi!

206
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,054
Let me see.

207
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,555
This wound is really deep! How did this happen?

208
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,959
- Does it hurt?
- It's okay.

209
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,993
Who was it this time?

210
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,694
I'm not going to tell you so you can fire them.

211
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,565
Quack. Will the wound get infected?

212
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,234
Dragon-lady, I've been taking care of Tang Yi for so many years now,

213
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:18,804
have I ever let him down?

214
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,473
Who knows if your medical skills have gotten worse or not?

215
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,745
- It's you.
- It's you.

216
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,215
- Can't you just leave him alone?
- Did you let A-yi get hurt?

217
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,851
Why is Meng Shaofei here?

218
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:32,952
I've already told you so many times.

219
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:33,986
If you get mixed up with him,

220
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,688
nothing good will come out of it.

221
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,690
Like this time. Like last time.

222
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,991
This time, he helped me.

223
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,396
What did you say?

224
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,932
Fine. I don't care how he helped you,

225
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:51,835
I just don't want you to have anything to do with him.

226
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:54,271
And you. There's nothing here that's any of your concern.

227
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:55,941
The door's that way.

228
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,443
So odd! This isn't even your house. Why can't I be here?

229
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,845
I can't come and see a friend?

230
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:00,913
Who's your friend?

231
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,214
Him.

232
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,449
You're friends?

233
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,553
Yes.

234
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,291
Half.

235
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,528
What do you mean half?

236
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,396
Believe me, I won't let you worry.

237
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:20,666
Fine. Then you continue to do whatever you want.

238
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,701
You didn't hear a word I said just now.

239
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,236
Miss,

240
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,772
Boss already made all the preparations.

241
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,574
So even you're going to say I'm overreacting, too?

242
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,512
Hongye...

243
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,847
Boss, Miss didn't mean what she just said.

244
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,783
I know. I understand her temper.

245
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:41,987
Go and stay close to her. Don't let her anger overcome her.

246
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,789
I'll call her later.

247
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,729
I already informed my colleagues at the station.

248
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,232
They'll have people go and check out the scene to see if there is any evidence.

249
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,333
I don't need the help of the police. I'll find out myself.

250
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,637
Why are you still like this?

251
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,408
Excuse me doctor, are you any good?

252
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,209
Don't let his wound get infected.

253
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,811
One leaves and another comes to take her place.

254
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,746
Officer, if my medical skills aren't any good,

255
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:11,481
you would still be in the hospital for a couple of more weeks.

256
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:12,851
I think that's because I recuperated very quickly.

257
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,387
Don't think that you're awesome.

258
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,989
A Yi, I'm heading out.

259
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,159
- Be careful of your wound.
- Okay.

260
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,261
If you need anything just call me.

261
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,099
Don't you need to work?

262
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,101
I'm going to get some rest.

263
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:37,074
Officer Meng. This way, please.

264
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,548
Mint chocolate

265
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,550
and a passion fruit sherbet.

266
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,886
Am I that angry?

267
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,155
Why did you order these two flavors?

268
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,490
Being with Miss for so long, of course, I know

269
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,692
what flavors go with what type of mood you're in now.

270
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,363
True.

271
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,664
No matter the good or bad things, you always bring me here.

272
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,482
Don't forget our rule.

273
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:20,652
After these two scoops, no third scoop. Enjoy it.

274
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,954
I'll eat as many scoops as I want. Mind your own business.

275
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,535
All better now?

276
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,003
No.

277
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,272
Didn't you say Tang Yi was going to call me?

278
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,407
Why hasn't he called yet?

279
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,613
Boss is probably busy with something else.

280
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,680
He's busy? I'm not busy?

281
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,450
Just the Shi Hai case is taking up all my time.

282
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,552
And now there's the police. They've made things more complicated.

283
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,188
And Tang Yi even admitted...

284
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,589
What is he?

285
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,224
Half a friend?

286
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,560
What the hell is that?

287
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,961
And he clearly promised me

288
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,764
that he wouldn't do anything that will make me worry.

289
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,334
Boss definitely knows that you worry about him,

290
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,970
just like he worries about you.

291
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,438
All of you treat me like a little girl that needs protection.

292
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,978
No. We all think that you are grown up now

293
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,414
and can handle yourself.

294
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,816
The one who is the least qualified to say that to me is you.

295
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,690
I promised Master Tang that I would take good care of Miss.

296
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,794
Miss, Miss.

297
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,130
Again with the Miss.

298
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,932
So what Master Tang said is more important than what I say to you?

299
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,189
This is the flavor to eat when you're angry.

300
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,690
Eat.

301
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,471
Are you an idiot?

302
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,006
That's over exaggerating.

303
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,207
You didn't do that the other day.

304
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,676
You didn't have enough to drink that day?

305
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,410
Let me tell you. I was planning to do it that way.

306
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,479
- I just forgot.
- You're full of crap.

307
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:31,282
That day, you clearly looked like a...

308
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,752
What are you doing!

309
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,022
What time is it?

310
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,391
You're fooling around!

311
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,659
I asked you to find Big K's supplier.

312
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,660
Did you find out already?

313
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,096
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

314
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,099
Come in!

315
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,272
Here. Eat something, eat something.

316
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:57,809
This time our commander was very pleased.

317
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,811
Our Unit 3 successfully caught Big K.

318
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,180
Here, I especially bought these to bring here.

319
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,414
Everyone, eat up.

320
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,115
Let's celebrate. Come.

321
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:06,184
- Thank you, Captain!
- It's nothing, you deserve it.

322
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,085
Smells so good, Captain.

323
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:07,920
If it's not enough, there's more.

324
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,755
- Captain!
- Here, here.

325
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,689
A-fei, perfect timing. Come grab some food.

326
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,859
I have a request.

327
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,926
What is it? Just say it, it'll be your reward.

328
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,863
I want to protect a witness and I'm hoping you'll give me permission.

329
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,566
For work? No problem.

330
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,101
Which case? Who do you want to protect?

331
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:25,604
Tang Yi.

332
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,576
What?

333
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,111
But this time, I have a legitimate reason.

334
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:35,613
First, forget about whether Tang Yi has anything to do with Wang Kunchen's death,

335
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,849
but him provoking Chen Wenhao is the truth.

336
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,552
Not to mention, he's already been attacked twice.

337
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,355
This proves that Chen Wenhao is targeting him.

338
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:48,124
If you agree to this, I can also investigate Chen Wenhao's tracks.

339
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,428
Zhao Zi.

340
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:57,270
That's right. Isn't Interpol also pressuring us, saying we can't find Chen Wenhao's whereabouts?

341
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:02,237
Right. So, I'm sure that this would also help our cooperation with Interpol.

342
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,612
Why do I get the feeling that this is an excuse to find out what happened four years ago?

343
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:13,885
But what I just said is reasonable, isn't it?

344
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,989
Very reasonable.

345
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,605
You're going to protect me?

346
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,773
That's right

347
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:39,008
In order to avoid the immediate and possible risk of endangering one's personal safety,

348
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,345
they can ask the people's housekeeper;

349
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:41,546
also known as the police,

350
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,814
that's me,

351
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,183
to request for protection.

352
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,084
I didn't make a request.

353
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,185
I know you wouldn't request it,

354
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,987
so I requested it for you.

355
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,888
That's too funny.

356
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,056
Officer Meng,

357
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,624
you think we're just playing around here?

358
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,559
Our boss doesn't need police protection.

359
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,561
I'm not only protecting your boss,

360
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,397
I'm also protecting myself.

361
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,465
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

362
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:03,867
Last time, when we were stranded on the mountain I was there.

363
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:06,038
This time on the street when we encountered the sniper,

364
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,373
what a coincidence, I was there, too.

365
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,041
Originally, I was certain that the target was you.

366
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,544
But after these two incidents, I'm starting to wonder

367
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:15,979
perhaps that the target might even be me.

368
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:17,182
You're full of crap.

369
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,183
I think you're just here to keep watch over our boss.

370
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,786
You gangsters offend people,

371
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,688
and I, Meng Shaofei, have also offended a few.

372
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,689
Especially by you Hsin-Tien Group, isn't that true?

373
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,094
I'm not going let the police tail me everywhere.

374
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,364
You can't refuse.

375
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,698
We're half-friends, aren't we?

376
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:37,734
Friend's will help each other, isn't this a given?

377
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,272
Boss,

378
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:43,906
if word gets out that we're involved with the police, how will others look at us?

379
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:46,244
Brother De, that's not how I see it.

380
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:49,581
Until now, we still haven't found the one who attacked Boss.

381
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,083
So if we put both targets together,

382
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,884
we won't be distracted.

383
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,186
Rather than letting Officer Meng be out making trouble,

384
00:25:56,386 --> 00:26:00,190
this subtle balance of you-watch-me, I-watch-you

385
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:02,194
is pretty good, don't you think?

386
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,474
Here.

387
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,679
You can temporarily stay here. This is the bathroom.

388
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,648
You can use anything here.

389
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,550
Thanks for backing me up just now.

390
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,153
No need to thank me, because I need your help with something.

391
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,191
What can I help you with?

392
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:34,726
Hey, Brother Jun Wei.

393
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,795
You looked really good as a bartender the other night.

394
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,463
If we weren't on duty, I would've already drunk a big glass.

395
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,966
It would've made acting like a psycho who is heartbroken and drunk more realistic.

396
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:44,536
You don't need to drink and it's already realistic.

397
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,604
If you continue drinking--

398
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,008
What happened? Not in a good mood?

399
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,910
The dealer we caught yesterday won't give up where he got his drugs from.

400
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:59,315
The Captain wants us to find a way to break him.

401
00:26:59,315 --> 00:27:01,520
If A-fei were here now, that would be great.

402
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,687
Yes. What's he thinking by protecting Tang Yi?

403
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:06,791
We're shorthanded as it is already.

404
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,899
See, speak and it shall be answered.

405
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,535
Hello. A-fei, what's up?

406
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,703
Zhao Zi, are you my brother? If you are, come help me with something.

407
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,305
Okay, what is it?

408
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,506
Come and take a look at the security system at Tang Yi's place.

409
00:27:23,506 --> 00:27:25,575
Hang on, A-fei. We're swamped over here, too.

410
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:27,479
You're the best at this type of stuff.

411
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,313
It won't take up that much of your time. Hurry up.

412
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,516
What's wrong, Senior?

413
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:34,385
He wants me to help him with something at Tang Yi's place.

414
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:37,920
What? He's asking you to go now?

415
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,391
We're already way behind as it is, Captain's going to be hounding us soon.

416
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:44,329
Don't worry, the Captain did agree to this.

417
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,498
Right. Anyway, I'll be back very soon.

418
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,450
You're leaving tomorrow.

419
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,284
It's the middle of the night, don't scare people like that!

420
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:12,355
Don't you have your own place? Why don't you go home?

421
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,826
You've been chasing after Tang Yi about what happened four years ago.

422
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,528
Knowing you won't find anything,

423
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,529
so you use police tactics to coerce him into agreeing.

424
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,265
You're the police and you're playing friend games with people.

425
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:23,635
You're really cunning.

426
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,870
Think whatever you like.

427
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,304
I'm already living here now.

428
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,673
I'm definitely watching Tang Yi.

429
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,945
I really don't understand. What kind of grudge our Hsin-Tien Group has with the police?

430
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,313
Whether it's you or the police officer from four years ago.

431
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,453
Or are you trying to be like Li Lizhen? Relying on help from our Hsin-Tien Group

432
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:45,423
and hoping to get some benefits?

433
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,892
Zuo Hongye! Don't talk nonsense!

434
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,094
What? Did I say something wrong?

435
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,732
You were taught by Li Lizhen.

436
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,734
Since she was the one that taught you,

437
00:28:55,734 --> 00:29:00,003
how you think and your methods must be quite similar.

438
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,540
Sister Lizhen never relied on help from Hsin-Tien Group, and she would never have colluded with you guys.

439
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,376
Then, why did she die in the same place as Master Tang?

440
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,916
That's right. What's a police officer's monthly salary?

441
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,120
A bribe here and there

442
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,588
is quite the norm.

443
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,856
I won't allow you to slander her.

444
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,590
Get away!

445
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,295
Don't touch her!

446
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:26,097
Tang Yi, he's bullying me.

447
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,499
I touch her?!

448
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,767
Did you know what she said just now?

449
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,734
I don't care what she said, just don't touch her!

450
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,373
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

451
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,675
He just scared me, that's all.

452
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,647
Okay.

453
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,482
As long as you're okay.

454
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,387
Tang Yi, you bastard!

455
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:51,590
Me, hit someone?!

456
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,291
Meng Shaofei hit a girl?

457
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,726
Didn't even get the facts.

458
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,928
Hard to believe that the head of Hsin-Tien Group

459
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,164
could be tricked by Zuo and not even know!?!

460
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,466
That manipulative Zuo Hongye.

461
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,236
Didn't even give me the chance to explain.

462
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,805
Only listens to her.

463
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,607
And what's with the hero act anyway?

464
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:09,941
Be careful that you can't be a hero,

465
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,710
- turns out you're a...
- ...coward.
 (T/N: hero - ying xiong, coward - gou xiong)

466
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,783
Officer Meng,

467
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,685
can I ask you what you're so angry about?

468
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,661
Zuo Hongye doesn't hold anything back when she speaks.

469
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,830
Everyone in the world knows that.

470
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,431
You're the police. We're a gang.

471
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,101
Our standpoints are different.

472
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,104
Do you really need to get so worked up?

473
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:49,078
Looks like, you're not really angry at Zuo Hongye,

474
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,416
but care more about my boss.

475
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,691
Don't forget why you came here in the first place.

476
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:03,559
If you let your emotions take over, it might ruin things.

477
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,372
Meng Shaofei,

478
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,440
it's not like you don't know the relationship between Tang Yi and Zuo Hongye.

479
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,310
He's good to her, partial to her,

480
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,811
cherishes her in the palm of his hands. That's all that he should do.

481
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,648
Then, why do you care so much?

482
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,249
What's wrong with you?
(T/N: Are you sick?)

483
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,218
Who he spoils should have nothing to do with you.

484
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,320
Why get so pissed off?

485
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,404
I know what Hongye said.

486
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:25,043
I also know how much Li Lizhen means to you.

487
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,413
I apologize on her behalf.

488
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,014
I'm sorry.

489
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,650
Forget it.

490
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,318
If the person that said what she said

491
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,953
doesn't believe she said anything wrong,

492
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
then a bystander's apology to me is unnecessary.

493
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,623
Hongye is the one person that I care about and value the most.

494
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,760
In Hsin-Tien Group, she is the only person that I can completely trust.

495
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,498
She is me.

496
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,932
And I am her.

497
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,935
Together, we're going to accomplish Master Tang's last wishes.

498
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,137
Our goal is to allow all of our brothers to live a normal life.

499
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:56,407
That gives you the right to not hear my explanation?

500
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,612
Don't pull me.

501
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,893
What are you doing?

502
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,309
What are you doing?

503
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,478
Lay down

504
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,183
I'll do it myself.

505
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,751
You injured your back. How are you going to do it yourself?

506
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,421
Just lay down.

507
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:24,560
Looks like, you're not really angry at Zuo Hongye,

508
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,697
but care more about my boss.

509
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,404
That's enough.

510
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,240
What's wrong?

511
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,907
It's late. That's good for now.

512
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,285
Meng Shaofei, have you lost your mind?

513
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,587
Master Chen, He Hang is here.

514
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,735
Wang Kunchen has suddenly left.

515
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,671
The foundation that he's built up in the past few years,

516
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,940
can't just go to waste.

517
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,642
I've considered your credentials.

518
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,178
We must make sure everyone gets a share.

519
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:50,114
We can't just let this channel disappear.

520
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,990
[Basic Information: Tang Yi]

521
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,658
Master Chen, Tang Yi won't give us a way out.

522
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:05,330
We can only rely on and seek refuge from you.

523
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,166
Look at you.

524
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,400
You don't think we can get this list of names ourselves?

525
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,170
What I want is Hsin-Tien Group's every dirty and clean intel and information.

526
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,475
Show me your loyalty, will you?

527
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,283
No problem.

528
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:29,151
Master Chen, before Master Tang's death, Hsin-Tien Group was--

529
00:36:29,151 --> 00:36:31,089
Still not willing to change the way you address me?

530
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,824
Master Tang?

531
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,325
Yes, Master Chen.

532
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,993
Tang Guodong started to go legit when he was still alive.

533
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:39,030
Originally, he still had a little leeway.

534
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,932
Everyone also just let it be.

535
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,001
When that punk Tang Yi took over,

536
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,436
he aggressively cut off all drug dealings.

537
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,805
Right now, on the surface, it seems like everyone listens to him,

538
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,707
but in reality, everyone's pissed off.

539
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:55,880
The young are hasty in their work.

540
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,549
Tang Yi handles Hsin-Tien Group right now. Legitimizing is left to Zuo Hongye.

541
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,319
The two of them, while Tang Guodong was still alive,

542
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:06,590
have they contributed anything to Hsin-Tien Group?

543
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:12,764
What's the relationship between Tang Guodong and Tang Yi?

544
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,434
There're rumors in our circles that they're father and son.

545
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:20,605
This, Master Chen, we're not 100% certain either.

546
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:23,372
When Tang Guodong brought the two of them back that year,

547
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,176
only Tang Yi changed his last name to Tang.

548
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:29,045
Later on, he was the one closest to Tang Guodong.

549
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:33,014
After all of these years, no one ever questioned or wanted to find out where he was born and his background?

550
00:37:33,014 --> 00:37:36,354
We didn't dare to question their relationship.

551
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:40,155
But Tang Guodong and Tang Yi are indeed like father and son.

552
00:37:40,155 --> 00:37:44,493
Moreover, Tang Guodong had stipulated in his will that Tang Yi would be his successor.

553
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,931
So now Tang Yi is the head of Hsin-Tien Group.

554
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:51,501
No one dares to say too much.

555
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,107
Tang Guodong's son.

556
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,611
There's a light here.

557
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,419
My hair's kind of messy.

558
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,624
Your car is very luxurious.

559
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,793
There seems to be a lot of things that are electric-powered.

560
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,894
Even the chairs move!

561
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,336
Country bumpkin, are you finished playing around?

562
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,204
Don't you see it's raining outside? Why are you opening the sunroof?

563
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:04,940
Who are you calling a country bumpkin? I've been in other cars with sunroofs.

564
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,950
What exactly do you want?

565
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,584
Nothing. Just a little thirsty.

566
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,087
Checking to see if there's water in this car.

567
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,903
Thank you.

568
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,699
Officer Meng just said that you wouldn't enter our work area.

569
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:06,835
So odd, this entire building belongs to Hsin-Tien Group?

570
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:08,472
Office Meng, please keep your word.

571
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,174
No need to continue to say officer this and officer that.

572
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:13,275
Are you trying to remind everyone that there's a cop behind your Boss?

573
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:18,080
What are you two big guys arguing about and holding up the elevators?

574
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,218
You're here.

575
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,386
Come on, get in.

576
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,260
Am I late?

577
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,728
No.

578
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,763
A-de, if Mr. Meng would like to stay,

579
00:40:33,763 --> 00:40:36,500
then show him to the office waiting room.

580
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,401
Yes.

581
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,503
Let's go upstairs first.

582
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,742
- Enough is enough.
- What are you talking about?

583
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,711
You really can put on an act. Don't think that I can't see through you.

584
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,480
If you have something to say, just say it.

585
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,949
Bottling it up and hiding it, what's the point?

586
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:55,885
Bottling it up and hiding it, are your filthy thoughts!

587
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:59,488
Don't think I don't know. The way you look at our Boss...

588
00:40:59,488 --> 00:41:01,425
It's so disgusting!

589
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,493
That's right. I like your Boss.

590
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:06,363
What's that to you?

591
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,311
Who I, Meng Shaofei, likes,

592
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,246
there's no need for others to make remarks.

593
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,315
If you have time to spread rumors and gossip,

594
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,683
why not go home and spend it working on your fighting skills.

595
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,092
Meng Shaofei!

596
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,202
Tell me.

597
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:50,471
The person that was selling drugs that day was one of your Hsin-Tien Group's lackey's.

598
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,478
And I also found out who attacked you.

599
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,685
But let me prepare you for the news.

600
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:04,019
Once you know who it is, you're not going to be very happy.

601
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,968
See? I told you, you wouldn't be happy.

602
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:23,373
I really didn't think it would be him.

603
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,291
Don't always scrunch your eyebrows.

604
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,695
I really didn't think it would be him.

605
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:48,464
It's okay. Just relax.

606
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,004
Relax.

607
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,107
Relax

608
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,013
Meng Shaofei!

609
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:06,048
Let's get rid of our mutual enemy first, then work out our issues.

610
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:20,897
Didn't we just agree on getting rid of the enemy in front of us first?

611
