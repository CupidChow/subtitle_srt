00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,280
♫ How can I leave you behind? ♫

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,620
♫ Leave you here alone ♫

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,860
♫ It's you who was here as I was desperate ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:22,550
♫ and crying; I finally realized myself  ♫

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,270
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,600
♫ You always don't like to say anything ♫

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,830
♫ It gave me a dream with you ♫

8
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,160
♫ How many times I wanted to confess from the bottom of my heart ♫

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,170
♫ How I lost to sadness and loneliness ♫

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,970
♫ As you are waiting ♫

11
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,030
♫ Never wanting to let go ♫

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,530
♫ A promise to grow old together while seeing the sunrise and the moon sets with a smile ♫

13
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,950
♫ How can I leave you behind? ♫

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:14,440
♫ Leave you here alone ♫

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,530
♫ It's you who was here as I was desperate ♫

16
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:25,310
♫ and crying; I finally realized myself  ♫

17
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,280
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

18
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,765
I found this birth certificate.

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,300
While going through Sister Lizhen's personal belongings, along with this note,

20
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:48,138
I also found Tang Yi's foster father and confirmed all of this.

21
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:59,748
Tang Yi's birthday is October 21, 1990.

22
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:07,526
You were sent to prison in February of 1990.

23
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,528
When Sister Lizhen went to visit you in jail,

24
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:13,298
it was May 17, 1990.

25
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,802
Impossible.

26
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,204
Lizhen would never lie to me.

27
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:04,181
I brought some dishes which I personally cooked for you.

28
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,086
They're all your favorites.

29
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,389
This week someone on the inside came at me again.

30
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,491
Did you set it up?

31
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:18,631
F***! I should have known it was you.

32
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,590
How long do you want me to stay inside?

33
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:25,137
Shih-Ho Clan has put out the word to have you killed.

34
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,708
Being on the inside will be safer than coming out.

35
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,609
I'll handle it.

36
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,777
Just another few months and you'll be able to come out.

37
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,217
A few months?

38
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,952
Really?

39
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:45,253
Tang Guodong, don't forget I took the rap for you and am doing time for you.

40
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,994
Are you going to let me out?

41
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,697
Or do you think that I don't need to come out?

42
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,567
Because without me makes no difference to Hsin-Tien Group, right?

43
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,268
But Lizhen is waiting for me!

44
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,036
Of course, I know.

45
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,005
But right now is not a good time.

46
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,240
You'll be in danger if you come out.

47
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,609
You're full of crap!

48
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,376
Shih-Ho Clan is nothing.

49
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,345
You're the head of Hsin-Tien Group. How can you not know how to handle them?

50
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:07,313
Who are you bullshitting?

51
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,249
Wenhao.

52
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:28,399
Lizhen. Lizhen.

53
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,873
Did you lose weight?

54
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,712
Lizhen, how did you know that I was here?

55
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,349
How does she know that I'm here?

56
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,918
How can you lie to me like this?

57
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,421
I didn't.

58
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,057
Lizhen, I didn't do this on purpose.

59
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,980
I just didn't know how to tell you.

60
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,895
I didn't want to lie to you.

61
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:57,764
I just thought--

62
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,699
I'm pregnant.

63
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,538
Really?

64
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,784
We have our own child?

65
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,086
Okay, Lizhen, I'm sorry. I really didn't do this on purpose.

66
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:24,522
Listen to me. I'll be getting out of here very soon.

67
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:27,460
Tang Guodong told me a few more months and I'll be able to get out.

68
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,428
How about this? Take a leave of absence first.

69
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,063
Because being in the CID is too dangerous.

70
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,397
Go home and rest. I'll take care of the living expenses...

71
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:35,401
No need.

72
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,303
I already had an abortion.

73
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,573
I said I already had an abortion.

74
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,798
Why?

75
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,501
How can you have an abortion?

76
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,068
I believed in you so much.

77
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,903
How can you let down my trust?

78
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,640
I didn't want to lie to you.

79
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,975
I just wanted to make more money.

80
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,044
It was all for our future.

81
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,712
I couldn't let you carry all the burdens,

82
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,247
isn't that how it should be?

83
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,683
Why did you have to get rid of the baby?!

84
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:29,088
Tang Guodong! Didn't I ask you to take care of Lizhen?

85
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,422
- Chen Wenhao!
- Why did you bring her here?

86
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,858
Calm down and listen to me!

87
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,330
The two of us live in two different worlds.

88
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,866
It's impossible for us now.

89
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,671
Wenhao, take care of yourself.

90
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:50,643
No, Lizhen, Lizhen. Lizhen! Lizhen! Lizhen!

91
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,677
Tang Guodong, why did you bring her here!

92
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:53,845
You bastard, you!

93
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,914
Don't be like that, Wenhao.

94
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,850
I'm going to cut you when I get out!

95
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:03,089
I will get you out, Wenhao!

96
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,457
Why do both of you treat me this way?

97
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,531
Did you already know that Lizhen came to visit me in jail?

98
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:15,365
You knew about my relationship with Lizhen and used this to trick me to let Tang Yi go?

99
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:17,069
I don't know what Sister Lizhen said to you

100
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,070
when she went to visit you in jail.

101
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,375
I only know that after she visited you,

102
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,744
she took almost a year off from work.

103
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:29,612
For someone that's a workaholic like her, this was very odd.

104
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,117
When she came back,

105
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,286
she was still a workaholic.

106
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,224
But she never again took any long leaves of absence

107
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,258
and never got in relationships; never married.

108
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,590
Impossible.

109
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,905
Lizhen would never lie to me.

110
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,140
She told me she had an abortion;

111
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,877
she got rid of the baby!

112
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,381
So? What does this mean?

113
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,790
Tang Yi,

114
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:18,180
Sister Lizhen was your mother.

115
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,400
Chen Wenhao,

116
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,271
he is your father.

117
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,409
Are you trying to use my feelings for you against me?

118
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,511
Meng Shaofei, do you really think that emotions will affect me?

119
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,149
In this lifetime, the only one that treated me as a father

120
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:40,920
was Master Tang.

121
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:49,762
Tang Yi, Sister Lizhen may not have been the best mother,

122
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,365
but she used her own ways to love you.

123
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:57,000
Your foster father said that she went to see you every year,

124
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,871
until you ran away at 12 years old.

125
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,974
She immediately took off from work

126
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,208
and disappeared for 3 whole days.

127
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,390
No one could get in touch with her.

128
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,713
That doesn't change what's happened in my past.

129
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,817
- Tang Yi.
- Tang Yi.

130
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,323
You really are the son of Lizhen and me.

131
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,293
You, shut up!

132
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,498
I don't have parents.

133
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,599
When I was cold and starving,

134
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,102
it was Master Tang that gave me food to eat.

135
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,438
When I almost gave up on myself,

136
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,941
it was Master Tang that pulled me out from the swamps.

137
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,409
He is the most important person to me.

138
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,444
He is my father!

139
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,013
And you...

140
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,082
you killed him.

141
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,517
I didn't!

142
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,885
I really wanted to kill him with my own hands but I didn't.

143
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,955
You're lying!

144
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,640
Little Tang.

145
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,232
I'll go upstairs myself. You wait for me here.

146
00:09:58,232 --> 00:09:59,899
Why?

147
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,034
Who are you meeting?

148
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,303
Why can't I come with you?

149
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,939
Hold this.

150
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,607
Don't learn it.

151
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,942
I don't want to; it stinks.

152
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,300
Old Tang!

153
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,489
What?

154
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,325
Be careful by yourself.

155
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,595
Stop smoking.

156
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,026
Old Tang!

157
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,034
It was this face, I remember it clear as day!

158
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:12,404
It was you that killed Master Tang.

159
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,700
Yes.

160
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,720
I went to meet with Tang Guodong that day, that's true.

161
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,819
But I never ever thought

162
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,890
I would see him and Lizhen together.

163
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,770
Lizhen!

164
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,730
Lizhen!

165
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,700
Tang Guodong...

166
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,239
Tang Guodong!

167
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,908
Lizhen!

168
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,110
Old Tang!

169
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,849
These past 28 years,

170
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:01,250
what's gotten me through each day is the hatred I have for Tang Guodong.

171
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,558
I only wanted to do one thing.

172
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,658
I wanted to stand in front of him and let him tell me himself,

173
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:12,131
why he treated me that way?

174
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,930
Then kill him with my own hands,

175
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,905
to make up for the life I missed.

176
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,406
Are you finished?

177
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,842
Even if this is the case,

178
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,211
it doesn't change the fact that you killed Master Tang.

179
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,912
Tang Yi! Tang Yi!

180
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,149
Tang Yi, just calm down!

181
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,385
Don't you want to find the real killer?

182
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,320
He's the real killer.

183
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,722
Tang Yi!

184
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,690
If he was the killer,

185
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,991
why did he stay in the same spot and wait for you to see him?

186
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,532
Even if he had the motive to kill Tang Guodong,

187
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,268
then why did he kill Sister Lizhen?

188
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,538
Tang Yi!

189
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:56,141
Do you really want to avenge Tang Guodong's death?

190
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,710
Or are you just trying to vent your own anger?

191
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,804
Tang Yi...

192
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,039
Only by finding the real killer

193
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:31,243
can you truly avenge Master Tang's death.

194
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,685
Fine.

195
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:46,422
I will go find proof and then kill you with my own hands!

196
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:49,400
Tang Yi! Tang Yi!

197
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,190
Tang Yi!

198
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,364
Tang Yi!

199
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,870
Tang Yi!

200
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,920
Tang Yi!

201
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,470
Tang Yi!

202
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,076
Why?

203
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,511
You clearly know he's not the real killer.

204
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:09,047
Why are you treating me like this?

205
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,717
Tang Yi!

206
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,522
Tang Yi! Tang Yi!

207
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,890
Tang–

208
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,626
Tang Yi!

209
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,838
Tang Yi!

210
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,576
Tang Yi!

211
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,180
Tang Yi.

212
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,549
Tang Yi, where are you?

213
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,819
Tang Yi!

214
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,022
Where did you go?

215
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,758
Tang Yi.

216
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:54,927
- Tang Yi.
- Don't touch me!

217
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,029
- Tang Yi, listen to me.
- Don't touch me!

218
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,064
Tang Yi!

219
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,366
Don't be like this.

220
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,304
I understand it's hard for you to come to grips with the truth.

221
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,806
I know.

222
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,574
I don't care who he is,

223
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,177
I only want to avenge Master Tang's death!

224
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,978
Tang Yi.

225
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,713
Don't be like this.

226
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,684
I understand how you feel right now.

227
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:23,119
But what's most important now is to find the real killer, is it not?

228
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:25,690
Do you know what really happened four years ago?

229
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,927
It's that nothing happened.

230
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,230
Nothing at all.

231
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,465
Don't pay attention to me!

232
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,600
Tang Yi, don't be like this.

233
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,869
Don't be like this.

234
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,772
Tang Yi.

235
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,706
Tang Yi, listen to me.

236
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,641
Tang Yi!

237
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,657
Tang Yi! Tang Yi!

238
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,327
Tang Yi, don't do this to yourself. I'm begging you.

239
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,115
Tang Yi.

240
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,885
Don't do this.

241
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,640
I know.

242
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,559
I really do know.

243
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,698
Why?

244
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,234
Why did you ask me to come out today?

245
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:18,036
I just wanted to let the commander know that

246
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:21,170
this mission is almost complete.

247
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,844
Here are all of Hsin-Tien Group's relevant and irrelevant information.

248
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:29,582
Of course, there's also what you most covet,

249
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:34,082
Chen Wenhao's entire Taiwan businesses including names and distributors.

250
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,522
Have you verified it?

251
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,991
Of course.

252
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,498
Great job.

253
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,435
The rumors are true when they say you're the mercenary.

254
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,704
I'm glad the police didn't

255
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:54,000
waste so much money by hiring you.

256
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,042
Since this mission is over,

257
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,177
let's discuss the next one.

258
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:03,690
I'm sure you'll be very interested indeed.

259
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,185
Tell me about it.

260
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,220
Chen Wenhao's main territory;

261
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,123
information on his entire operation in Cambodia.

262
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,726
For many years now,

263
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,294
we've been cooperating with the Cambodian government

264
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:19,628
and have not been able to infiltrate this drug route.

265
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,801
Chen Wenhao has laid a very intricate network.

266
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:27,740
In Cambodia, he's got both the mob and government working for him.

267
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,476
You, alone

268
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:33,578
will be able to infiltrate them?

269
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:36,981
Of course, I won't be able to do it by myself.

270
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:39,651
But Chen Wenhao personally invited me to join him,

271
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,821
this will make the difference.

272
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,191
If you can handle Hsin-Tien Group here,

273
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,760
I'll get you the information that you want.

274
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
I don't understand.

275
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,399
A mercenary works for money,

276
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,102
you're willing to give up your benefits?

277
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:03,404
I can't resist such a borderline life-threatening and stimulating temptation.

278
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:06,809
Besides, we're not cooperating for the first time.

279
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:09,581
The price will be negotiable.

280
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,183
And...

281
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,518
this time I'm bringing it up myself.

282
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,987
This mission is even more challenging.

283
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,488
What do you say?

284
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,132
Okay.

285
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:31,700
We'll take care of getting you out of Hsin-Tien Group.

286
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,874
I hope that when you get to Southeast Asia,

287
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,643
you'll be able to get us more of the intel that we need.

288
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,243
Commander,

289
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,448
happy cooperation.

290
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,380
Hi!

291
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,616
Welcome home.

292
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,617
How come you're here so late?

293
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:21,586
And getting wet.

294
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,389
I missed you.

295
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:27,125
Even if I get wet, I still want to see you.

296
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,260
Something big happened at the station today.

297
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,296
I'm not in the mood to joke around with you.

298
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,365
I'm not in the mood to joke either.

299
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,702
Tonight, I did something very scary.

300
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,442
I'll probably not be able to see you for a period of time.

301
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,680
Are you scared?

302
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,883
Do you not want to have anything to do with me anymore?

303
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,684
Keep quiet.

304
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,185
Since you did something scary you should try to be more inconspicuous.

305
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:57,256
If you're seen by anyone, you'll be in a lot of trouble.

306
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,524
And yet you still stand out in the open in front of my house,

307
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,793
and didn't even think to hide and wait.

308
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,295
Quickly, tell me your answer.

309
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,497
Do you like me or not?

310
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,080
I'm leaving soon.

311
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,880
And I don't know if I'll be able to come back or not.

312
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,218
Do you want me to leave satisfied,

313
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,522
or with a broken heart?

314
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,299
Be careful it's hot.

315
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,411
Drink some milk to warm up your stomach.

316
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,951
Don't eat this type of late-night snack from outside!

317
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:03,285
Let me cook you something to help you cheer up.

318
00:22:03,285 --> 00:22:06,492
Actually, when I saw you outside just now,

319
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,726
it already cheered me up.

320
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:10,028
Really?

321
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,964
Ever since my grandmother died,

322
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:16,932
I've been living alone so there is no one waiting for me to come home.

323
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:28,713
But seeing you just now waiting for me at my door,

324
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,682
knowing that someone's waiting for me come home,

325
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,319
my heart mysteriously felt warm.

326
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,457
Hurry up and cook.

327
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,493
If you don't cook, what am I going to eat?

328
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,062
Eat me?

329
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,564
Saying nonsense again.

330
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,433
Get away.

331
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,336
I want to eat tofu.

332
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,973
Eat my tofu?
(T/N: take advantage of me?)

333
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,979
I really can cut tofu, right?

334
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,018
I put in the egg already, where's your tofu?

335
00:23:08,018 --> 00:23:10,100
Let me have a taste to see if it's any good.

336
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,100
I'm sorry.

337
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,581
This gown was made to be sexy,

338
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,917
with an open-back design.

339
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,457
This one you see here is one that will accentuate your back,

340
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:31,095
and the front is open.

341
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,899
The design of this one and this one is similar,

342
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,000
it also has an open-front and accentuates the back.

343
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:40,668
This one's special because all the lacework is imported from Dubai.

344
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,177
You like it?

345
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:51,081
Then, the white one can be the one you wear in the procession.

346
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,218
This red one will be to thank the guests as they're leaving.

347
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,386
- Okay, let me try them on for you to see.
- Sure.

348
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,455
This one.

349
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:58,924
Go.

350
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,702
Dad,

351
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:14,872
is it beautiful?

352
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,812
Dad, don't cry.

353
00:26:23,812 --> 00:26:26,418
If you cry, I'll cry, too.

354
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,354
Beautiful.

355
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,823
Really beautiful.

356
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,226
Just like how your mom was back then.

357
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,194
I'm just trying on a bridal gown.

358
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:40,362
Then on the day of the wedding, you'll be balling your eyes out.

359
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,834
That's right.

360
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,202
I'll be crying my guts out for sure.

361
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,104
You can't.

362
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,607
You have to look handsome and smile,

363
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,748
hold my hand as you walk me down the aisle.

364
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,179
Okay.

365
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,780
Little Ya.

366
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,249
Dad.

367
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,251
You're here.

368
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,485
Look, dad picked this white gown for me.

369
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:02,620
Is it beautiful?

370
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,988
Looks really good.

371
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,590
Let me go try on the next one.

372
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,793
Go downstairs and wait for me.

373
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,995
Dad, sit here.

374
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:12,696
Little Ya.

375
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:14,497
What is it?

376
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,947
Let me hug you again.

377
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,385
No crying.

378
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,157
I'm okay.

379
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,290
[Xizhi Precinct, New Taipei City Police Department]

380
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,393
Zhao Zi! Brother A-zhi!

381
00:29:57,393 --> 00:29:59,363
Something happened.

382
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,798
What happened?

383
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,900
Captain went to the inspector's office and gave himself up.

384
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,368
Gave himself up for what?

385
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,369
I don't know.

386
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,937
Someone there told me.

387
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,174
You didn't bother to ask for more details?

388
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,874
They wouldn't tell me much.

389
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:11,975
Are you sure you heard right?

390
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,911
You didn't make a mistake?

391
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:15,112
No, I saw Captain inside.

392
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,880
Then, why did Captain give himself up?

393
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,916
I don't know. What should we do?

394
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,861
Milk? Orange juice?

395
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,439
Are you okay?

396
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,577
Drinking Coke in the morning is not good.

397
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:48,311
Drink milk. It's healthier.

398
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:50,081
Tang Yi.

399
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,085
Come on, let's eat breakfast.

400
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,301
Dig in.

401
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,643
I asked Zhao Zi to continue the investigation first.

402
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:22,744
To see if we can find any other leads on the killer from four years ago.

403
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,782
You investigate your case, I'll look into my case.

404
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,454
So, you believe what Chen Wenhao said?

405
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,222
You believe he's not the killer?

406
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,158
Even if the truth changed,

407
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,294
my target is the same.

408
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,798
If you find out who it is,

409
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,833
hand the person over to me.

410
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,069
Eat.

411
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,070
You need to head to work later.

412
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:57,881
Boss,

413
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,184
I caught He Hang.

414
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,819
Good, go and prepare first.

415
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,454
I'll be right there.

416
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:08,993
Tang Yi?

417
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,361
An eye for an eye.

418
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,030
I won't hurt him.

419
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,532
But I will handle his betrayal first,

420
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,501
then hand him over to you.

421
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,677
Hello, Zhao Zi.

422
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,612
You said the Captain sold drugs? Gave himself up?

423
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,488
- What's going on now?
- Senior.

424
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:42,689
A-fei, we heard that Captain sold hidden drugs and stolen goods to the mob.

425
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:44,127
How is that possible?

426
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,228
Why would he do that?

427
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:47,664
Motive? What was the motive?

428
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,032
Could it have to do with five years ago

429
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:51,668
when Little Ya was ill and had to get surgery?

430
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,203
What surgery did Little Ya have?

431
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,738
Myeloid Leukemia (Bone Marrow Leukemia).

432
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,241
The Captain was so worried, he was literally going crazy.

433
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,408
There were no matches here domestically for a bone marrow donor.

434
00:32:59,408 --> 00:33:01,912
Everyone had lost all hope.

435
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,613
But later through another channel, a matching bone marrow donor was found

436
00:33:04,613 --> 00:33:06,483
and saved Little Ya's life.

437
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:10,152
The Captain did this to get money to save Little Ya?

438
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,223
So?

439
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,291
The Commander is going to do a big internal sweep and investigation

440
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,193
because they heard that there are other officers involved.

441
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,594
It might be Brother A-zhi.

442
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,530
Brother A-zhi?

443
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,068
Where is Brother A-zhi?

444
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:28,170
I don't know, he's been missing since a while ago.

445
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,945
Didn't even pack up his things.

446
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,617
Zhao Zi, come with me to his house to check.

447
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:40,685
A-fei, wait for me.

448
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,486
Everyone help out.

449
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:44,120
Try calling his family or friends. Quickly.

450
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:48,960
♪ Where is it? ♪

451
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,133
C'mon!

452
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,402
Pick a song.

453
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,675
Ko-san, I know you have the means.

454
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:09,578
Whether it's Southeast Asia or anywhere, just let me leave here.

455
00:34:09,578 --> 00:34:11,415
I didn't think this day would ever come.

456
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,052
The cops would come to beg me for help.

457
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,322
Just previously, you had your team come and look into me.

458
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,825
Today, you come back to beg me.

459
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,193
Can't you cops just walk out the country's door openly?

460
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:30,731
Or is it some kind of trap for today? Officer Jou?

461
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:34,936
Ko-san, we've been dealing with each other for over 10 years now.

462
00:34:34,936 --> 00:34:37,407
Throughout, I've let you go many times.

463
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:41,008
You know very well and clearly, what info I have on you.

464
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,881
If it wasn't because you can no longer be a cop,

465
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,950
would you come to me?

466
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,219
Would you be able to use that info on me?

467
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,555
True, I can't use it.

468
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,257
But my colleagues can use it.

469
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,292
Or would Ko-san like to try me?

470
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,435
I still would like to show my sincerity.

471
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,605
So, would Ko-san like to drink to celebrate

472
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,642
or drink for penalty?

473
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:27,657
A boat is leaving the day after tomorrow.

474
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,059
One person, one bag.

475
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,495
I can't wait that long.

476
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:35,230
Officer, you think I run a cruise ship company?

477
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,034
Sail whenever we want?

478
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,902
If you need something quicker, go find someone else.

479
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:41,105
I'm leaving.

480
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,606
Ko-san!

481
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:47,311
These next two days, I'll figure it out myself.

482
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,884
Wait for my message.

483
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,398
Big Brother Chen,

484
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,599
I'm a little curious.

485
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,000
Is the person you're looking for really that important?

486
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,006
Very important.

487
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,443
But this person is really not easy to find.

488
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,912
I didn't get a good look at his face,

489
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:25,049
and it's the blurry image from four years ago.

490
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:28,086
So, I need to depend on you.

491
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,921
You know so many people,

492
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,254
I'm counting on you.

493
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,722
Of course, it's not a problem.

494
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,691
Anything that Big Brother Chen requests,

495
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,593
I will do everything to do it.

496
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,462
Even if you just give me a hair to go on,

497
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:39,996
I'll find a way to dig them out.

498
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,400
Just leave it to me, okay?

499
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,405
- Let's toast to Big Brother Wang.
- Thank you.

500
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:47,704
Big Brother Wang, cheers!

501
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,574
Thank you.

502
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,714
Boss Tang who you introduced to me last time;

503
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,482
regarding the D82 project, he hasn't really gotten back to me.

504
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,853
I understand. Here. Go spend this first.

505
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,090
Thank you, Big Brother Chen.

506
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,492
I will take care of everything for you.

507
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,400
Sorry.

508
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:28,980
Lizhen! Lizhen. Lizhen.

509
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:34,784
Who is it? Stop!

510
00:37:34,784 --> 00:37:36,520
Who are you?

511
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,827
Tang Guodong. Tang Guodong!

512
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,496
Lizhen.

513
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,309
Grab him.

514
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,928
Could it really be Brother A-Zhi who did it?

515
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:30,106
Excuse me, we're currently doing a search.

516
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:31,441
You guys can't come in.

517
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,876
Search?

518
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,413
We're on the same unit as Jou Guanzhi.

519
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,914
What's the situation here?

520
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:41,216
Jou Guanzhi is involved with a murder case and drug case from 2015. (T/N: Taiwan year is 104)

521
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:42,752
There's a warrant issued for his arrest.

522
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,854
You said that there's a warrant out for Brother A-zhi?

523
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,623
Can you please give me more details?

524
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,758
Which murder case?

525
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,627
As the investigation of the case is not public,

526
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,596
I can't divulge too much.

527
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:53,930
Sorry, we're starting our evidence collection now.

528
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,033
I need to ask you guys to leave first.

529
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:00,404
2015 murder case.

530
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,247
Hello, it's me.

531
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:12,115
The murder case from four years ago–

532
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,417
Hello?

533
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:15,286
Busy?!

534
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:17,488
Such an important matter...

535
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,693
A-fei, wait for me.

536
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,262
Zhao Zi, you head back to the station first. Ask people to look for A-zhi.

537
00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:28,850
Tang Yi, you better not have done anything stupid!

538
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,077
Tang Yi!

539
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,613
- Officer Meng!
- Tang Yi.

540
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:44,347
A-fei, help me.

541
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,782
Tang Yi.

542
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,384
If you kill him now,

543
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,086
we'll never know the truth then.

544
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:53,154
Don't you want to know what happened four years ago?

545
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,892
Let me bring him in.

546
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,896
I'll make sure to get the truth.

547
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,430
You've been investigating this case for four years,

548
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,332
have you found any evidence?

549
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,901
You think without any evidence, he'll admit to killing them?

550
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,603
If you take him back to the station, we will never find out the truth.

551
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:09,839
A-fei... A-fei,

552
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
take me back to the precinct.

553
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,777
I'm begging you.

554
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,046
Did you really kill them?

555
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,985
Why did you kill Sister Lizhen?

556
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,888
Why cause her to be suspected of colluding with the mob?

557
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,992
Talk!

558
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,999
Captain already gave himself up,

559
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,569
now the police are investigating you.

560
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,707
Talk!

561
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,345
Okay.

562
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:49,512
Tang Yi!

563
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,248
I'm begging you.

564
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:58,355
We took the drugs that were being inspected at the station,

565
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:01,856
confiscated them, and sold them back to the mob.

566
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:03,993
It was that He Hang.

567
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,995
Him. It was him that enticed us

568
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,499
and gave us a commission.

569
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,370
We?

570
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:14,838
Who's we?

571
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,172
You and who?

572
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,908
Captain?

573
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,844
And then?

574
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,813
Tang Guodong...

575
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,016
Tang Guodong wanted to legitimize.

576
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:31,654
He started looking into Hsin-Tien Group's drug supply channels.

577
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,830
I don't even know what he found out,

578
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:40,661
but He Hang said Tang Guodong found evidence of us selling

579
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,768
and found who the link was with the police.

580
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,804
I... I didn't know Tang Guodong

581
00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:50,407
would go see Sister Lizhen.

582
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,977
He Hang said... He Hang said

583
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,780
that Li Lizhen was working with Tang Guodong.

584
00:41:56,781 --> 00:42:00,250
He said... He said...

585
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,684
I forgot.

586
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,722
So for this, you killed Sister Lizhen, is that right?

587
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,725
Shaofei, I'm begging you totake me back to the station.

588
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,427
Don't leave me alone here.

589
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:13,831
You kowtow (T/N: bow in respect) to Master Tang first!

590
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:14,864
I'm going to kill you!

591
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,001
Tang Yi! Tang Yi.

592
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,437
Let me take him back first.

593
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:24,138
These past four years, every day I just wanted to avenge Master Tang's death.

594
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,776
Tang Yi! Tang Yi!

595
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,379
I can't stand by and watch you kill someone.

596
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,481
If you are determined to take your revenge,

597
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:34,915
I will have to arrest you myself, do you know that?

598
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,188
Then arrest me!

599
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:41,592
Tang Yi!

600
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,512
I think...

601
00:43:38,264 --> 00:43:40,933
it hurts more than last time.

602
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,330
♫ Never thought I’d abandon with no regard ♫

603
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,490
