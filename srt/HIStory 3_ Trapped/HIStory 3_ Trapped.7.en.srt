1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,230
♫ How can I leave you behind? ♫

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,660
♫ Leave you here alone ♫

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,900
♫ It's you who was here as I was desperate ♫

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,530
♫ and crying; I finally realized myself  ♫

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,000
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

6
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,480
♫ You always don't like to say anything ♫

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,600
♫ It gave me a dream with you ♫

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,070
♫ How many times I wanted to confess from the bottom of my heart ♫

9
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,220
♫ How I lost to sadness and loneliness ♫

10
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,980
♫ As you are waiting ♫

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,060
♫ Never wanting to let go ♫

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,520
♫ A promise to grow old together while seeing the sunrise and the moon sets with a smile ♫

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,060
♫ How can I leave you behind? ♫

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,520
♫ Leave you here alone ♫

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,470
♫ It's you who was here as I was desperate ♫

16
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:25,440
♫ and crying; I finally realized myself  ♫

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,200
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

18
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:42,001
Don't worry. This isn't as serious as it looks.

19
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,670
That quack bandaged it too outrageously.

20
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,011
What are you doing?

21
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,586
Does it still hurt?

22
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,898
Too soft.

23
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:53,303
This guy... really knows how to tease.

24
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,717
Smells so good.

25
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,885
Is this the spicy dish that goes with coke from last time?

26
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:10,787
You can't eat spicy food right now and you can't drink coke.

27
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:14,294
Party pooper.

28
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,496
But I didn't know you could actually cook.

29
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,665
Master Tang taught me.

30
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,433
Master Tang said that ruling a large nation is like cooking a small delicacy.

31
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,435
If I understand the intricacies of cooking,

32
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,039
managing the organization will be very natural.

33
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,139
I don't understand that, but this is really tasty.

34
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,512
Perfect for someone that loves to eat like me.

35
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,681
It's hot.

36
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,649
Idiot.

37
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,721
It will be safer for you to stay at the police station than staying with me.

38
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:47,326
Why say that, all of a sudden?

39
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,862
I'm the target of the attacks.

40
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,763
So, you already know who it is?

41
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,465
This matter doesn't concern you. I'll handle it.

42
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:59,101
How can I let you privately settle a large case such as shooting of an officer?

43
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,040
Tell me. Besides dealing drugs,

44
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,678
is there something else between you two?

45
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,514
Tang Yi!

46
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,785
Promise me you won't get involved and I'll tell you.

47
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,853
If you can't promise me, then don't ask.

48
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,757
Why are you so stubborn and not telling me?

49
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,960
Why keep it a secret?

50
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:25,228
Tang Yi, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?

51
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,903
Since your youth to adulthood,

52
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,438
growing up alone,

53
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,140
in this entire world, not even one person cared for you?

54
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,281
That's how my childhood was.

55
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,789
What are you doing, going into my room?

56
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,261
I asked you, why did you come in and are rummaging around?

57
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,962
How did you get in? How did you open the lock?

58
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:34,899
I just came in to get this picture of me and mom.

59
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,169
Who gave you permission to take my things?

60
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,205
Are you a thief?

61
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,140
I didn't steal it. It wasn't yours anyway.

62
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,108
That's a picture of me and mom.

63
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,943
You dare to argue?

64
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,678
She's not your mother, I am also not your father!

65
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:50,382
And she's dead.

66
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,284
What do you want with her picture?

67
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:56,890
It's my birthday today. I just wanted to see her and tell her that it was my birthday today. Is that wrong?

68
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,624
You dare talk back?

69
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,959
I get pissed off just looking at you.

70
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,594
Every day, I feed you and give you a place to stay.

71
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,463
You're still not satisfied? You're still not happy?

72
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:07,898
- Tell me, tell me!
- If you're so unhappy about it,

73
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:10,934
- why did you adopt me in the first place?
- I didn't want to!

74
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,638
If your mom didn't insist that she wanted you, I wouldn't have adopted you!

75
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,607
I don't even want you to live in this house, do you know that?

76
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:21,013
Then don't.

77
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,925
Stealing a bike. It's so big, are you sure you can ride it?

78
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,395
This isn't yours!

79
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,362
I saw the whole thing. You're so young and already lying!

80
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:42,002
I saw it! You stole it. You're thieves!

81
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,703
What are you doing?

82
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,437
Brave, are you?

83
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,438
You want to die?

84
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,806
Hitting back?

85
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,508
You're dead.

86
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,711
You're all thieves!

87
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,679
- What are you doing?
- It's clear that you guys stole it!

88
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,247
What are you doing?

89
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,349
Don't run!

90
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,387
Stop!

91
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,289
Fast, are you?

92
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,192
Let's see where you can run to.

93
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,694
I'll block them for you.

94
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,497
You run first.

95
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,203
Had enough?

96
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,638
They're thieves. They stole a bike.

97
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,378
Still not leaving?

98
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,649
Didn't I tell you to run just now?

99
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,384
I'm the one that took the bike.

100
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,288
It's none of your business. Why did you help me?

101
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,988
I was the one that held the bike so you could run.

102
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,424
That's why it's my business, too.

103
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,093
Then, what about your injury?

104
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,195
Don't worry. I can take more hits than you.

105
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,863
I can fight well, too!

106
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,498
You two, hurry and go home.

107
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:49,435
I don't have a home.

108
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,975
Then are you hungry? Do you want to eat something?

109
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,609
- No.
- Yes.

110
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,984
I'm Tang Guodong.

111
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,721
They all call me Master Tang.

112
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,756
What's your name?

113
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,795
You're really not hungry?

114
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,205
Or you don't like these dishes?

115
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,276
It's okay.

116
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,678
Then just eat when you feel like eating.

117
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,780
Let me go check on Hongye, the one that just ate three bowls.

118
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,651
Are you finished taking a bath?

119
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,910
I had thought that in this world,

120
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,945
no one would ever love me.

121
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,849
Until I met Master Tang.

122
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,596
You're back.

123
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,000
Today, I made a lot of...

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,535
I'm sorry, dishes that I like to eat.

125
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:32,472
I'm sure you'll like them, too.

126
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,009
Quickly go drop your backpack off upstairs and come down to eat.

127
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,310
Okay.

128
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,288
Today's dishes are especially tasty, right?

129
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,524
Then eat more.

130
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,925
Okay.

131
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,963
This dish is my favorite.

132
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,397
Spicy gnocchi with tomato and sausage.

133
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,465
It's very delicious,

134
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,501
you have to eat it.

135
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,315
Have some soup.

136
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,490
You really can't stand spicy foods?

137
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,125
It's too spicy.

138
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,995
It's good because it's spicy.

139
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,645
There's one more dish, hang on.

140
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,460
♪ Happy birthday to you, ♪

141
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,390
♪ Happy birthday to you, ♪

142
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:17,844
♪ Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. ♪

143
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,878
Happy birthday!

144
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,883
Before you make a wish,
you have to put this on.

145
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,087
Go ahead, make a wish.

146
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,600
Starting from now,

147
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,703
I will celebrate every one of your birthdays with you.

148
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,414
Thank you.

149
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,884
Let's blow out the candles together.

150
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,692
Do you think this is round enough?

151
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,695
How about this, round enough? Is it okay?

152
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,530
It's okay.

153
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,832
Good, that's good.

154
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,213
Who does this look like?

155
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,250
I don't know.

156
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,283
Me, Old Tang.

157
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:34,620
Does it?

158
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,422
How about this?

159
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,224
I don't know.

160
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,925
You, Little Tang.

161
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,762
Old Tang and Little Tang.

162
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,696
A gift for you.

163
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,799
Birthday gift.

164
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,439
You want to get rid of me? (T/N: riding over my head)

165
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,541
I wouldn't.

166
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,972
Master Tang gave me my first hug,

167
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:03,408
celebrated my first birthday,

168
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,578
gave me a home.

169
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,515
He made me realize that I wasn't alone anymore.

170
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,185
But four years ago,

171
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,454
he was in front of me,

172
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,291
lying in his own blood.

173
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,762
Killing someone's dearest most beloved person, destroying their world.

174
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:27,399
Tell me!

175
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,640
Can I really let someone like this get away with it?

176
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,271
So, for these past four years,

177
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,506
the reason why you won't divulge any clues about Tang Guodong's murder

178
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:39,211
is because you wanted to take revenge yourself.

179
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,881
This is all that I can tell you.

180
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,984
But, Tang Yi,

181
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:50,085
the best way to get revenge is to let him receive punishment of the law and not to act privately.

182
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:51,323
No.

183
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,092
I've been waiting so long for him to come back.

184
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,995
I will never hand him over to anyone else.

185
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,166
Tang Yi,

186
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,301
you have to know,

187
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,204
if you insist on personally taking revenge,

188
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,173
as a police officer,

189
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,875
I must act according to the law.

190
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,080
You do what you have to do.

191
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,281
I will do what I need to do.

192
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,510
[What to do when a man confesses to a man?]

193
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:40,172
Welcome to this new world.

194
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,077
Prepare some Vaseline.

195
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,015
Suzhen, are you standing up?

196
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,456
Are these people going to give me a serious reply or not?

197
00:15:58,456 --> 00:15:59,824
What is it?

198
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:01,694
Nothing.

199
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:07,563
I was too stupid to think that I would get a correct response from people.

200
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,376
Hey, what do you do when a man confesses his feelings for you?

201
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,844
I don't know.

202
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,679
You don't know? How can you not know?

203
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,515
Didn't Tang Yi kiss you the other day?

204
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,786
What did you say after that?

205
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:32,021
I was the one that confessed my feelings for him that day. He was just responding.

206
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:35,325
Forget it. You're giving me nothing to go on.

207
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,298
After I was admitted to the hospital, were there any updates on Chen Wenhao?

208
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:43,701
There were, but nothing of any use.

209
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:44,802
Doesn't matter, send them to me.

210
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:46,705
Sure.

211
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:49,841
Sent them.

212
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,842
Thanks.

213
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,422
I've reviewed this project previously. It all looks good.

214
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:07,290
- Go ahead with your plans.
- Okay.

215
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,194
Boss.

216
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,197
- Miss, your tea
- We started opening investments for stores on the D82 project.

217
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,232
These are the stores that are interested in working with us.

218
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,234
Please take a look.

219
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,110
You're familiar with these companies?

220
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,779
Yes, I've already screened them for Miss.

221
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:33,715
We feel that these companies are the ones most suitable for the D82 project cooperation.

222
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,231
Pengcheng Construction, then.

223
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:49,301
Are you sure?

224
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,505
But they are not the first choice.

225
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,672
They've only been in business for five years.

226
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,874
I'm not sure if they have the capital or the practical experience needed.

227
00:17:57,874 --> 00:18:00,510
Zhao Renguang, the CEO of Pengcheng Construction, is very talented.

228
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,547
Only 31 years old, about your age.

229
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:05,684
And I also had someone look into him privately.

230
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,820
He's good in all aspects.

231
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,388
Why are you vetting him?

232
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:13,359
To know yourself and your enemy is the sure way to victory.

233
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,925
If a company's CEO is an opportunist and full of tricks,

234
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:19,197
then his company's scorecard is probably false.

235
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:20,499
Also, this Zhao Renguang

236
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,669
has a very successful company and is someone of very good character.

237
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,238
Have a meeting with him first to discuss.

238
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:30,173
Even if we don't work with them in the end, it's also good to have him as a friend.

239
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:32,678
Me, be friends with him?

240
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,381
Previously at a wine reception, he told me that he was interested in you.

241
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:39,717
Go and have a chat with him first.

242
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:42,986
Whether it's for business or personal purposes, you have nothing to lose.

243
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,124
Sure, just making friends.

244
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,805
Are you looking for me?

245
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,775
Boss.

246
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,611
Regarding Zhao Renguang,

247
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:10,412
making arrangements like this at the last minute, may not be of the best interest for Miss.

248
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:13,416
Not good? How so?

249
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,990
Miss is just temporarily mad at me.

250
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,428
I don't think you need to go out of your way to make arrangements.

251
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,397
I only wanted her to make a new friend.

252
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:27,932
Also,

253
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:31,033
aren't you always rejecting Hongye's feelings for you?

254
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,840
I'm just hoping that there is someone that I can trust who can be with her,

255
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,812
help her, even protect her.

256
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,682
Since you don't want to be that person,

257
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,216
then you shouldn't stop Hongye from finding her happiness.

258
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,759
Yes.

259
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,362
I know.

260
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,201
Brother Daoyi,

261
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,773
some things, you can't turn back from regret.

262
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,842
For Hongye,

263
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,543
as long as there is love,

264
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,079
there is no one unworthy.

265
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,984
Boss,

266
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,488
I'll leave you now.

267
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,291
Brother Daoyi.

268
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,194
What is it?

269
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:33,029
Chen Wenhao has sent word that he wants to have tea with you next week.

270
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:35,968
Says he wants to introduce you to a friend.

271
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,403
Sure, I will be there.

272
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,937
Boss!

273
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,705
Chen Wenhao just sent people to attack Director Zuo, even though there is a truce now.

274
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:46,742
But this invitation doesn't seem to be as innocent as just having tea.

275
00:20:46,742 --> 00:20:48,814
I don't care what his motives are.

276
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,814
If he dares to invite me, I will dare to go.

277
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,385
Boss!

278
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,518
Master Tang,

279
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,386
it's been another year.

280
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,048
Tang Yi,

281
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,049
happy birthday.

282
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:07,120
♪ Happy Birthday to you, ♪

283
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,040
♪ Happy Birthday to you, ♪

284
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,400

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,100
♪ Happy Birthday to you. ♪

286
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,377
You don't need to be too touched.

287
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:29,500
I've been chasing after you for four years. That's why I know it's your birthday today.

288
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,218
But I don't celebrate my birthday.

289
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,687
But just now, you were hiding by yourself and are upset.

290
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,726
Fine.

291
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,161
You have to be happy on your birthday.

292
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:46,798
You also have a birthday hat.

293
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,104
Why do you have that music box?

294
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,672
I have the exact same one.

295
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,907
It was part of Sister Lizhen's things.

296
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:02,311
It was the only thing that my birth mother gave to me.

297
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:17,326
That's your birthday cake and present that your birth mother gave you.

298
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:19,397
I'm going out.

299
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,068
Okay.

300
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,269
Put this on.

301
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,570
I wore this when I was a kid.

302
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,771
Let me see you put it on. It's only once a year.

303
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,477
Come, make a wish.

304
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,579
Look.

305
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,279
This is you, this is me.

306
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,983
Make a wish.

307
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,887
I wish--

308
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,323
Give me a wish for a present.

309
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,891
Sure.

310
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,100
I wish...

311
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,736
that every birthday from now on,

312
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:33,104
I'm there beside you.

313
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,347
So every year from now on, you'll celebrate my birthday with me?

314
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,286
What? You don't want me to?

315
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,157
Even if I don't want you, you're already here.

316
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,532
You have me now.

317
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,401
You'll never be alone on your birthday again.

318
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,843
Then I don't want a cake that's too sweet.

319
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,046
You have a say?

320
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:15,878
I personally made this by hand, you should be saying thank you!

321
00:25:15,878 --> 00:25:17,616
You're welcome.

322
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,525
Okay.

323
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,831
Cut it.

324
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,299
Okay.

325
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,501
Then, I'm going to cut your head first.

326
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,603
Why are you like this?

327
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:44,306
You should add more sugar. The sweeter the better.

328
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:47,210
You eat this much sugar, and aren't afraid of getting sick?

329
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,379
I'm not scared.

330
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:52,247
From the day I met you, I knew there was no cure.

331
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,287
Then, let me join you.

332
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,589
You're finished, you!

333
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,728
Too much.

334
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,399
Get over here!

335
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,800
That hurts.

336
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,560
Thank you.

337
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,295
I'm very touched.

338
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,599
Thank you.

339
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:55,870
Director Zuo, should I ask Uncle to join us for dinner?

340
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,509
Don't pay much attention to him.

341
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,676
Uncle Daoyi just accompanies me to protect me.

342
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:02,812
If he didn't insist, I wasn't going to have him come today.

343
00:28:02,812 --> 00:28:05,948
I heard from Director Tang that Director Zhao has investments in Helsinki?

344
00:28:05,948 --> 00:28:08,319
Yes, in the IT industry.

345
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,159
Most guys who learn that I'm from a gang family

346
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,393
usually, respectfully keep their distance.

347
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,697
Director Zhao, aren't you afraid?

348
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:23,599
I really admire your direct style in the business field; it's never indecisive.

349
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,137
The manner of a strong woman.

350
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,507
Gang background and a strong woman.

351
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:31,943
Sounds like this woman is not one to mess with.

352
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:35,347
Director Zhao, you're quite brave.

353
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,584
Hongye,

354
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,921
I like you.

355
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,989
I don't want to miss this opportunity with such an exceptional person like you.

356
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:50,362
I would like to date you with marriage as our goal.

357
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:53,865
Very well.

358
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,700
I like a man who is direct.

359
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,769
I don't do things that waste time.

360
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,769
I agree to date you with the goal of marriage in mind.

361
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,202
Miss,

362
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:37,008
you actually don't need to be so impulsive when doing things.

363
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,680
I think you misunderstood.

364
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,083
I only acted in my best interest.

365
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,622
Zhao Renguang has a successful business,

366
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,291
he's straight forward and direct,

367
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,561
and he's about my age.

368
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,529
And most importantly, he likes me.

369
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,103
But you don't like him.

370
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:06,838
To continue shamelessly clinging onto a man that doesn't love me,

371
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,273
To continue shamelessly clinging onto a man that doesn't love me,

372
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,110
I'm even ashamed of myself.

373
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,412
Besides, Tang Yi was right,

374
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,815
I'm not getting any younger.

375
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,984
So, give me your blessing,

376
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,687
Uncle Daoyi.

377
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,697
A-de is driving me there.

378
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,468
I'll call you when I'm done.

379
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:38,870
Bye.

380
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,023
Boss, I'm sorry.

381
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,093
I forgot to put in new water yesterday.

382
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:30,821
The bill, please.

383
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,723
Okay, NT$90.

384
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,825
Thank you.

385
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,249
Cancel the meeting.

386
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,285
Take me home first.

387
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,187
Boss, then let me call them for you.

388
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,988
No need.

389
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,457
Yes.

390
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,199
Boss.

391
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,550
You know,

392
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,591
I really love you.

393
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,195
Sorry.

394
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,140
Don't run.

395
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,376
Tang Yi, listen to me!

396
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:33,644
Where are you going?

397
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,146
Come back.

398
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,451
You hit me?

399
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,286
Do you know? I really do love you.

400
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,155
Why won't you give me a chance?

401
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,225
What do I lack compared to Meng Shaofei?

402
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,259
Get away.

403
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,560
He's a cop!

404
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:53,297
We're gangsters.

405
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,365
You're dead.

406
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,067
Tang Yi, don't fight it.

407
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,668
Get away.

408
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,984
Get away!

409
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,955
Tang Yi. F***!

410
00:34:18,955 --> 00:34:21,924
Come back! Today, you're mine!

411
00:34:21,924 --> 00:34:24,310
[Calling: Jack]

412
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,815
What are you doing?

413
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,184
Tang Yi.

414
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:47,417
You... let go.

415
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,318
What are you doing?

416
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,650
Not only did you attack me, but attacked a cop, too.

417
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,300
Li Zhide!

418
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,672
You are getting more and more bold!

419
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,173
What do you mean, attack a cop?

420
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,376
I don't know about that.

421
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,910
But everything that I did,

422
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,779
I did it for you.

423
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,247
Selling drugs behind my back

424
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,215
and colluding with those that are against going legit to try and kill me!

425
00:35:20,215 --> 00:35:21,451
This is what you mean by "all for me"?

426
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:23,453
I didn't!

427
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,222
That day the attack at the parking lot,

428
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,890
and the person that sniped at me was He Hang.

429
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,459
You gave He Hang my schedule.

430
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,995
No... No...

431
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:35,165
I would never let He Hang go and kill you.

432
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,401
Don't you know that I love you?

433
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,902
Tang Yi!

434
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,173
Yes.

435
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,509
It's because I love you.

436
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,379
So I wanted to kill Meng Shaofei.

437
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:54,117
But I have never once thought to kill you.

438
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,753
Not even once.

439
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,422
I kept on giving you chances.

440
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,623
You're getting more and more out of hand!

441
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,164
I know you are trying to fulfill Master Tang's last wishes.

442
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,598
That's why once you took over, you cut off all our drug sources.

443
00:36:10,598 --> 00:36:14,235
But do you know how many people need this to make a living?

444
00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:16,440
I helped you to appease everyone privately,

445
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,408
I helped you so much, have you ever thought of that?

446
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,242
I helped you so much, have you ever thought of that?

447
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,710
So, you drugged me?

448
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,190
Because I couldn't stand it!

449
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,715
I quietly did so much for you.

450
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,984
Why did you choose Meng Shaofei?

451
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,352
Why?!

452
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,522
Why him?!

453
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,692
Since you're not willing to give anything,

454
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,295
I took what was rightfully mine.

455
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,164
I don't care what your excuse is.

456
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:46,066
In Hsin-Tien Group, there's only one ending for those who betray.

457
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:47,838
Tang Yi! No!

458
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,506
Hand this person over to the police.

459
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,340
Get lost!

460
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,009
Meng Shaofei,

461
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,011
it's all because of you!

462
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,047
If you never showed up,

463
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,318
Boss would've surely accepted me one day.

464
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,287
I really regret why I didn't kill you.

465
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,022
- Why do you talk so much nonsense!
- Tang Yi!

466
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,124
- Come on!
- You can't!

467
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,025
Tang Yi, come on! Kill me!

468
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:10,494
Don't pull me.

469
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,662
I hate you!

470
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,900
Why won't you give me a chance to love you?

471
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,403
What the hell are you doing? Do you know where this is?

472
00:37:20,403 --> 00:37:21,805
I'm a cop.

473
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,740
I can't let you handle this your way.

474
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,142
This is Hsin-Tien Group business. What does it have to do with the police?

475
00:37:27,142 --> 00:37:28,847
Tang Yi!

476
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,815
What's more important? Accomplishing Tang Guodong's last wishes or venting your personal anger?

477
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,155
Promise me!

478
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,090
Don't handle this your way.

479
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,093
Give him to me to take care of.

480
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,898
Tang Yi!

481
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,101
You want me to leave the country?

482
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,937
Because of what A-de has done,

483
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,773
conflicts within the organization have begun to surface.

484
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,209
Plus, Chen Wenhao could make a move at any moment.

485
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,477
For your safety, it's best to leave the country and lay low.

486
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,880
You really plan on handing one of our own to the police?

487
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,789
The one who attacked Meng Shaofei belongs to Hsin-Tien Group.

488
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,657
In order to not let the police hassle us, you must actively cooperate.

489
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,895
Also, if we don't hand A-de over to them,

490
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:51,927
then no one will take me seriously when I talk about the matter of prohibiting drugs.

491
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:55,197
then no one will take me seriously when I talk about the matter of prohibiting drugs.

492
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,707
What are you planning?

493
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:08,142
Cleaning house to prepare for a head-on confrontation?

494
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,349
I won't be impulsive.

495
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,150
I will handle it carefully.

496
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,653
I can only rest assured if you are not here.

497
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,688
But I will worry about you.

498
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,123
How can I leave you at a time like this for you to face this alone?

499
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,261
Miss, Boss wishes for you to leave the country–

500
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:28,398
I have my own plans.

501
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,104
Since Master Tang's passing,

502
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,907
we've been through so many crises.

503
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,044
What gives you the right to tell me to leave,

504
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,713
and I have to leave?

505
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,149
Tang Yi,

506
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,784
I'm begging you.

507
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,819
Let me stay, okay?

508
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,587
I really can't handle the possibility of losing you.

509
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:57,460
Hongye,

510
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,462
you are the most important person to me;

511
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,465
and also, my most vulnerable weak spot.

512
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,800
Only with you safe, will I rest easy.

513
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,950
Fine.

514
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,687
Then give me a few days to get my things in order.

515
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,880
I'll leave once everything is taken care of.

516
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:27,791
Thank you.

517
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,761
But you need to promise me one thing.

518
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,497
- What is it?
- You're not allowed to die.

519
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,332
If you die, I will hate you forever.

520
00:40:38,332 --> 00:40:41,103
I can't promise you something that I can't control.

521
00:40:41,103 --> 00:40:44,872
But I will promise you, I won't let you hate me forever.

522
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,379
Don't disappoint my trust in you.

523
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,340
Pick the location quickly; the sooner you leave the better.

524
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,385
Helsinki.

525
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:59,480
Last time, Renguang mentioned it to me.

526
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,326
I'll go there with him.

527
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,410
You only need to buy one ticket to Helsinki.

528
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:22,746
I'll go by myself.

529
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:25,647
Miss, are you serious?

530
00:41:25,647 --> 00:41:27,150
I'm serious.

531
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,119
Since I've decided to let go,

532
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,789
then you should let go, too, and let me go alone.

533
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,058
Miss, I promised Master Tang.

534
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,593
I will take care of Miss,

535
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,595
- Take care of Miss.
- Enough!

536
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,597
It's really enough!

537
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:44,635
Miss, please let me stay by your side.

538
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,006
I will never leave you.

539
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:00,782
What do you want me to do so that you will be satisfied?

540
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,953
You say that I mistook my feelings for you.

541
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,188
You want me to wake up.

542
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:07,123
Fine, I did my best to wake up.

543
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:08,491
I've decided to date someone else.

544
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,794
Then, what's the meaning of you doing this?

545
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:13,695
Every time when I'm about to give up, you give me some hope.

546
00:42:13,695 --> 00:42:16,798
Then when I think that you're finally going to face it,
you pull back.

547
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,268
Gu Daoyi,

548
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,205
do you enjoy playing me like this?

549
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,614
I really am letting go this time.

550
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,786
So this time, I'm going to persist till the end.

551
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,791
So, I'm begging you.

552
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:45,326
Please let me go and let yourself go.

553
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,036
Don't! Let go.

554
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,170
I don't want to.

555
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,640
Let go. Let go.

556
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,210
No. Let me go!

557
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,780
Let me go.

558
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:07,084
I don't want to. Let go.

559
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,187
Let go.

560
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,890
I thought that I could forever

561
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,701
refuse your feelings for me.

562
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:27,730
But I realize that

563
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,608
it's getting harder and harder.

564
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:37,810
Seeing you...

565
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,818
ignoring your feelings,

566
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,589
and then having to say words to refuse you,

567
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,726
it really pains me as well.

568
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,410
Miss,

569
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,685
the two us

570
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,888
have quite an age difference

571
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,292
and I'm only your assistant.

572
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,031
I keep reminding myself,

573
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,901
"You cannot cross that line."

574
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,774
Because I know

575
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:41,776
you will definitely meet a man that is worthy of you.

576
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,288
Now that you are leaving,

577
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,861
I can't let go.

578
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,500
Sorry.

579
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:09,237
My inferiority has hurt you.

580
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,880
Hongye,

581
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,887
I'm not letting go this time.

582
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,893
I love you.

583
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,898
I have always loved you.

584
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,707
Gu Daoyi,

585
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,846
if you play me again this time,

586
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,840
I will definitely kill you.

587
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,085
I will kill you for sure.

588
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:02,420
♫ Become accustomed that everything is two people ♫

589
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:09,480
♫ Is that love? We don’t dare ask again ♫

590
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,380
♫ Never thought of other possibilities ♫

591
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:20,460
♫ After a long time, this feeling ♫

592
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:26,720
♫ has already sunk too deep ♫

593
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,537
What is it? What did you find?

594
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:49,672
From the jailhouse records of Chen Wenhao,

595
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:52,941
it seems like his relationship with Tang Guodong was pretty good.

596
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,077
Because in the first year, it looks like

597
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:56,779
Tang Guodong visited him almost every week.

598
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,082
But later on, it suddenly stopped

599
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:00,950
and they never communicated again.

600
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,819
This is kind of strange.

601
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,053
Or was it because something happened between them

602
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:06,956
that caused them to stop communicating?

603
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,125
This is even stranger.

604
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,194
Sister Lizhen also went to visit Chen Wenhao

605
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,797
and went together with Tang Guodong.

606
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,135
Why would they be together?

607
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:21,138
Did they know each other?

608
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:29,241
Four years ago, the rumors of Tang Guodong and Sister Lizhen, could they be true?

609
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:36,110
♫ Never thought I’d abandon with no regard ♫

610
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,120
♫ I’d care about jealousy  ♫

611
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:42,190
♫ I put you inside my heart ♫
