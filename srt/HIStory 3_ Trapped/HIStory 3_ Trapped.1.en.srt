00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,550
♫ You always don't like to say anything ♫

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,780
♫ It gave me a dream with you ♫

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,220
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

18
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,150
Tang, this is my Shi-Ho Clan's territory,

19
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,160
that you have once again disrupted.

20
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,330
Coming here today, you should be more conscious.

21
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,839
If your Hsin-Tien Group doesn't want to deal with drugs, want to become legitimate,

22
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:06,069
that's because you don't have the balls!

23
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,469
Your constant provocations,

24
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:10,909
others might be too scared of Hsin-Tien Group,

25
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:13,640
but, I, Old Ke, am not afraid!

26
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,950
So?

27
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,949
You destroyed so many of our places.

28
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:23,250
How do you want to settle this debt?

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,900
If you don't give me an answer today,

30
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,070
then you can forget about leaving!

31
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,680
You!

32
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,120
It's about time.

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,830
Tang Yi!

34
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,739
I advise you all not to do anything without thinking first;

35
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,439
or else, your boss will have an extra hole in his head.

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,010
I certainly won't care about it.

37
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,250
- Hold on to this for me.
- Everyone, freeze! Police

38
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,960
Nobody moves! Drop your guns!

39
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,360
Put down your guns!

40
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,360
Hands up!

41
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,199
Where's Tang Yi?

42
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,929
I'm representing Hsin-Tien Group today to negotiate with Shi-Ho Clan.

43
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:46,070
Don't bullshit me.

44
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,940
Was it Tang Yi that came to negotiate with you today?

45
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,839
Officer, it was just him.

46
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,620
Jun Wei, Zhao Zi! Take everyone back!

47
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:01,919
Yes.

48
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,220
Don't move. Keep your hands up!

49
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,690
Tang Yi! Tang Yi!

50
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,730
Tang Yi!

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,639
You knew I would come, right?

52
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,969
You used me to catch the Shi-Ho Clan,

53
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,070
to teach them a lesson and to make me look like a fool, right?

54
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,210
You're getting smarter.

55
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,480
Don't leave!

56
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,050
Tang Yi!

57
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,360
Are you arresting me right now?

58
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,190
Do you have evidence?

59
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,730
Or do you want to get sued for violating my human rights?

60
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,730
I, Meng Shaofei, am not afraid of getting sued by you again.

61
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,029
If you don't come clean about what happened four years ago,

62
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,240
I vow I'll continue to watch your every move.

63
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,709
I already said everything I had to say.

64
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:59,110
I'm sure you already read through the files many times.

65
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,509
Don't think I'm an idiot.

66
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:05,750
A-fei! The captain knows.

67
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,619
He called and ordered us back to the police station.

68
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:10,289
Yuqi still hasn't arrived with the search warrant yet?

69
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,820
Not yet.

70
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,160
What now?

71
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,829
Who do you think I am?

72
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,639
The search warrant wasn't even granted yet,

73
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,499
and you secretly went ahead and took action.

74
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:27,810
How could you even think of doing something like this?

75
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,109
I think you're completely out of control with no regard for the law!

76
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:40,279
I'm warning you! Don't think I can't do anything to you or I can't control you.

77
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,720
Captain, the official report.

78
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,769
All this time, you haven't let go of Tang Yi.

79
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:01,609
I just turned a blind eye and didn't bother you about it.

80
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:05,409
Who would've thought you would really do something like this and go over my head.

81
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,820
Don't think that just because you've been a cop for a few years,

82
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,850
made some achievements, and you can just do whatever you want!

83
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,270
Captain! Have some tea.

84
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,389
This time, the search warrant was just a little delayed.

85
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:20,060
We still have evidence of them negotiating and brought them all back.

86
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,860
So what?

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,229
Then in the future, whenever Hsin-Tien Group does anything, you'll always bring a team to attend?

88
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,600
When they go to the restroom, you should probably get in line with them, too.

89
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,270
Who do you think you are? Paparazzi?

90
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,270
Or you think we're a private detective firm?

91
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,439
Let me tell you. Little Ya is getting married soon. I have a lot of things lately.

92
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,950
Can I beg you to not cause any more trouble for me?

93
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,709
It's because they colluded with each other; or else, I would've already caught Tang Yi!

94
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,950
What the hell are you thinking?

95
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,250
Inside, now!

96
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,929
Zhao Zi was fanning him,

97
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:03,099
I burned a calming incense,

98
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:05,999
you brought him his favorite tea,

99
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:08,509
why is he still so angry?

100
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:12,539
Looks like this time, Shaofei really stepped on Captain's landmine.

101
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,509
Will there be any casualties?

102
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,379
Should we call the police first?

103
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:18,820
Aren't you the police?

104
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,320
Here.

105
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,119
Read these carefully again.

106
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:28,389
Captain, I've read these files from four years ago over many times.

107
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:30,059
Read them many times?

108
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:32,630
Then, did you see the main point?

109
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,269
He said in his report very clearly.

110
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,439
I don't know, means I don't know.

111
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,569
Captain, at the time Sister Lizhen and Tang Guodong and Tang Yi

112
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,539
were all found laying at the scene of the crime.

113
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,480
Only Tang Yi made it out alive, how could he not know anything?

114
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,179
It's because he's the sole survivor that whatever he says goes.

115
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:51,719
You think the police didn't investigate this thoroughly enough?

116
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:55,549
That year, in this case, one who was shot and killed was a police officer.

117
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:57,459
The other was the leader of Hsin-Tien Group.

118
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:01,489
Everyone in society, media, upper elites, were all waiting for us to break this case,

119
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:05,029
but Tang Yi's statement did not have any gaps.

120
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:08,260
It's not that there are no gaps, it was because we didn't have enough evidence.

121
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,599
Why are you arguing about this with me now?

122
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,939
You claim we didn't have enough evidence.

123
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:14,469
Then, let me ask you this,

124
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:16,209
You've been chasing Tang Yi for four years now.

125
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,180
Have you come across any new evidence?

126
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,739
I just haven't found it yet.

127
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,979
But what if Tang Yi wasn't the victim?

128
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:26,379
What if it was a set-up, to take over Hsin-Tien Group from Tang Guodong?

129
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,449
Set-up?

130
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:31,689
So, he also set-up to take a bullet right next to his heart?

131
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,790
You know. He almost died from losing too much blood that year.

132
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,029
And was in the ICU for over half a month.

133
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:39,359
He almost lost his life! How could he set it up? What set-up?

134
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,369
As police, we believe in evidence.

135
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:43,100
Evidence! Do you have evidence?

136
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,599
Yes, I don't have evidence!

137
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,099
But I'm positive of one thing, that Tang Yi was lying in his testimony!

138
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,149
Why don't you change careers to be a screenwriter?

139
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,879
Captain.

140
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,619
No need. It should be me calling you captain.

141
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:00,919
Captain, I implore you to consider this.

142
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,289
In these past four years chasing after him, how many times have you been sued by his lawyer?

143
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,329
And all the cases are pending verdict, none of them have been confirmed.

144
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:10,429
Not to mention all of your apology letters, so thick they can be used to press down on instant ramen cups.

145
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:11,430
And me.

146
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,929
Because of all of your shenanigans,

147
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,229
do you know how many times I've had my head chewed off by my superiors?

148
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:16,170
I'm begging you...

149
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:17,499
- Captain!
- ...please--

150
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:20,600
People from Interpol are here to take Jack away.

151
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,539
Why are you taking him away?

152
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,840
It's like this. I gave your colleague the paperwork already.

153
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,680
There are no problems. He needs to come with us to help with an investigation.

154
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,949
Investigate what?

155
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,880
I can't share this info with you, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

156
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,859
A-fei.

157
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,859
Don't go!

158
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:43,829
Captain, we were the ones that caught him.

159
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:45,659
Another division wants him and just takes him, and you just let them do it.

160
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:47,360
Isn't this absurd?

161
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,769
Last time, because you were chasing Tang Yi, you made a mess of their Thailand case.

162
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:53,670
Giving them Jack, who you caught, will just make up for that time.

163
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,709
I order you to stop pissing them off! Are we clear?

164
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,240
Go back!

165
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,049
Where are you going?

166
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:02,550
I'm off for the day.

167
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,950
Go tail him

168
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,551
and make sure he doesn't get into trouble

169
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:05,750
Yes.

170
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,899
What do you want?

171
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,309
Captain wants me to follow you.

172
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,560
I am going home.

173
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,300
How long have I known you?

174
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,639
And you're still trying to lie to me.

175
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,579
You're off to find Tang Yi again, aren't you?

176
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,280
What if I am?

177
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,289
You want him to sue you for stalking an innocent civilian again?

178
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,850
I am off work now, off duty!

179
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,989
Running into him would be a coincidence, why would he sue me?

180
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:48,160
Coincidence. You don't even know where he is.

181
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,760
How can you coincidentally bump into him?

182
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,930
Who said I don't know?

183
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,609
Tang Yi really is here.

184
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,080
He inspects this store every Wednesday afternoon.

185
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,310
- How about tomorrow?
- Metro Business Hotel.

186
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,710
- Saturday night?
- Asia Club.

187
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,950
- How about Sunday noon?
- Guandu Manor.

188
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,849
You really do know!

189
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,189
But why are Tang Yi's whereabouts so easy to track right now?

190
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,359
Before it was really difficult to know.

191
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,019
But starting from this year, his appearances suddenly became more accurate.

192
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,989
I also think it's kind of strange, that's why I thought—

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,600
The owner would like to invite the two of you inside.

194
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,900
Sure.

195
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,070
Shaofei! What are you doing?

196
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,939
Her boss asked us to go inside, so let's go.

197
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,739
Once you go in, you'll go from using your mouth to using fists; and when we're screwed, what should we do?

198
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,979
Don't worry. I swear I won't this time.

199
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,649
Also, isn't the captain's daughter getting married soon

200
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,450
He asked us to dress up. We can't embarrass him.

201
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,719
What are you going to wear? Do you own any dress clothes?

202
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,390
This?

203
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,650
- We're already here at a tailor shop. We'll each pick up a suit. Let's go
- A-fei!

204
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,359
Don't pull me!

205
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,259
What's wrong with picking out a suit?

206
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,760
Senior!

207
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,660
Let go of me!

208
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:00,900
Did you need anything from me?

209
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,669
Who's looking for you?

210
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,800
I'm here to buy clothes.

211
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,210
Suit.

212
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,849
1, 10, 100, 1000

213
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,390
- 10,000. This costs NT$60,000 (approx. USD$1,904)
- So expensive!

214
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,160
It's my gift to you. For protecting and serving society.

215
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,360
No need.

216
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,800
Then, do I get one, too?

217
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,859
Are you trying to get killed?

218
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,529
Give him a discount.

219
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,440
If he can... afford it.

220
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,970
No need.

221
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,209
Then, thank you, Officer Meng, for your patronage.

222
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,510
Here, help measure Officer Meng.

223
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,150
This way, please.

224
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,990
NT$60,000. You're really going to spend this much?

225
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,430
Sir, let me take your measurements.

226
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,099
A-yi!

227
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,499
What's up? You're back?

228
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,970
I bought your favorite.

229
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,970
You bought me something?

230
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,139
- Shoulder length...
- Are you tired?

231
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,580
Sure, I'll be back a little later.

232
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,740
Who's he talking to? So gentle.

233
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,450
So handsome.

234
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,949
What are you wearing? How old are you?

235
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,390
I can't afford it anyway.

236
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,190
Then, let's not eat dinner.

237
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,670
I'll be back later.

238
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,500
Okay, bye-bye.

239
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,040
Officer Meng has really good taste.

240
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,780
The suit you picked uses imported hand-tailored fabric from the UK.

241
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,689
It looks especially good on you.

242
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,360
It's just that it's quite expensive.

243
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,019
But since Officer Meng likes it,

244
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,360
We'll be sure to give you a discount.

245
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,999
No need.

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,200
I said, no need!

247
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,909
A-fei, no wonder this is a luxury brand.

248
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:27,539
Even just hanging on the wall, you can feel that it gives off the manner of the elite.

249
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:29,680
Don't touch it!

250
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,549
Didn't I tell you not to touch it? This suit cost NT$60,000! Take it off.

251
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:39,789
You're eating instant noodles around it? What if you spill it?

252
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,989
How many criminals do we need to catch before we make NT$60,000?

253
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,559
They offered us a discount.

254
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,759
Stop jabbering.

255
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,770
Take your instant noodles outside. What if you spill it?

256
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,699
What do you say we quit being police?

257
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,969
Let's go work for Tang Yi, how's that?

258
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,870
Sure.

259
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,600
We'll both quit tomorrow and become undercover officers next to Tang Yi.

260
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,300
We can still continue investigating.

261
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,900
What do you think, boss?

262
00:14:56,941 --> 00:14:57,979
Don't be rash!

263
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,739
I was just kidding.

264
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,380
We'll see if you dare to say nonsense again.

265
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,149
Tell me. You've been chasing after Tang Yi for so long,

266
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,749
If people didn't know you, they'd think you had a crush on him.

267
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,760
What crush! He's a gangster, I'm a police officer.

268
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,589
Let me tell you. Don't sound so confident.

269
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,199
The gods love playing with people.

270
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,999
If I say impossible, then it's impossible.

271
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,269
Impossible?

272
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,999
If it's impossible, why would you draw his wanted poster?

273
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,339
Even listed his height.

274
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,110
And posted it right here, where you pass by as soon as you walk in the door.

275
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,809
I posted it there to remind myself, motivate myself to find out--

276
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,079
...The truth from four years ago.

277
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,810
Right!

278
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,350
But you can't deny when Tang Yi smiled today, he looked pretty good.

279
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,659
Too bad he's a mob boss.

280
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,929
If he were a celebrity, I'm sure he would have tons of fans.

281
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:54,829
I would be his fan.

282
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,370
You're crazy!

283
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,140
I'm not crazy, let me tell you.

284
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,140
Right now, people with great smiles like that are in demand.

285
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,939
Once they get posted on the web, they definitely get a lot of fans.

286
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,309
And not just liked by girls.

287
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,380
Guys would like them, too.

288
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,549
Who says? I don't like him.

289
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,549
If you spent the time and effort into chasing girls as you do Tang Yi,

290
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,919
you'd probably already have a dozen kids by now.

291
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,289
What are you talking about?

292
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,890
You're still single and living with your mom.

293
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660
What are you doing?

294
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,469
Who was the one that said I bought such an expensive suit

295
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,370
and didn't want me to eat instant noodles every day,

296
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:30,529
so he bought me a lunchbox to eat?

297
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,869
Who told you to say what you just did?

298
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,899
I regret it.

299
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,370
You pay for what you just said.

300
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,389
Boss, once we dealt with the drug dealers working for Wang Kunchen,

301
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:01,199
he has kept a low-profile lately.

302
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,070
Now, he spends most of his time at his club.

303
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,269
Send a lawyer to get Jack out.

304
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,809
We need him to handle Wang Kunchen's situation.

305
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,080
Boss, I can handle it myself.

306
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,880
Yes.

307
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,849
Once we dealt with the drug dealers working for Wang Kunchen,

308
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:55,090
he has kept a low-profile lately.

309
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,020
He spends most of his time at his club.

310
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,880
You're finally done showering.

311
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,420
Don't catch a cold.

312
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,689
You see a beautiful girl wearing this and you have no reaction?

313
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,120
It breaks my heart.

314
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,360
Tell me. What am I to you?

315
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,230
Little sister.

316
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,130
I'm all grown up, what little sister?

317
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,570
As soon as I landed, I didn't even drop my luggage off at home first

318
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,640
and headed over here to see you.

319
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,109
Is this right?

320
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,150
Welcome back.

321
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,160
I heard that Officer Meng got Jack.

322
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,130
He's still making things difficult for you?

323
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,169
Who was the one that told you this time?

324
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,769
I'm not telling you.

325
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,539
Or else, if you fire someone again, we're going to have no one left.

326
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,439
Did that Officer Meng wreck your plans?

327
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,979
- No.
- No?

328
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,479
Not only did he not this time,

329
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,049
he even put Old Ke and his gang all in prison.

330
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,620
He helped me big time.

331
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,820
So you gave him a suit to thank him?

332
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,790
Why does it seem like you two are more and more like friends?

333
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,299
You should still stay clear of that Officer Meng.

334
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,430
Don't forget. He was the one that caused you a lot of grief for the first couple of years.

335
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,669
He really pissed people off.

336
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,069
Even if you figured out how to handle him now,

337
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,869
you should still be careful.

338
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,339
I know.

339
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,039
I'm serious.

340
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,380
Meng Shaofei is not a fool.

341
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,979
You know his temperament too well.

342
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,819
He also knows yours.

343
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,750
Also, these past few years, you've destroyed so many Cambodian drug channels, I'm sure you know.

344
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,790
Not too many people will notice in the first year. But one after another like this--

345
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,259
Have some water.

346
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,790
Don't change the subject.

347
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,470
You don't need to worry about the things inside the organization.

348
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,199
I'm worried about you.

349
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,569
Let me ask you. Why are you so focused on the Cambodian channel?

350
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,550
Are you trying to target someone?

351
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,549
Or does it have something to do with what happened four years ago?

352
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,420
You think too much.

353
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,249
If I knew who killed Grandfather Tang, how could I just let them go?

354
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,429
The people that oppose the move to legitimize the organization, I can't just not care.

355
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:57,099
They haven't quit dealing drugs

356
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,869
and have very strong dealings with the Cambodian channel.

357
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,710
To rid weeds, you have to remove the roots, or else they'll cause trouble again.

358
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,741
Then let me help you.

359
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:05,209
You do what you're supposed to do.

360
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,239
Run our legitimate organization well.

361
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,480
And let our brothers lead a normal person's life.

362
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,180
Leave the rest up to me.

363
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,420
Tang Yi, in order to help everyone else become legit,

364
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,959
you can't let yourself go deeper and deeper.

365
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,490
- I have my limits.
- But you...

366
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,860
Do what you're told.

367
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,240
Fine.

368
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,070
But please be careful.

369
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,770
And don't get too involved with that Officer Meng.

370
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,680
Okay.

371
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,580
I understand.

372
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,819
Boss, the renovations on our new building are complete.

373
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,630
If there are no other problems, we can start to plan our grand opening.

374
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,030
Okay.

375
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,399
I'll leave handling the opening personnel up to you.

376
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,160
No problem.

377
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,610
Meng Shaofei, this elevator is for members only. What are you doing here?

378
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,940
I have some business with the person behind you.

379
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,480
What business would I have with you?

380
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,379
You heard him. Get lost!

381
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,520
Meng Shaofei, get out!

382
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,730
Now, it's just the two of us.

383
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,130
You only have until we get to the fifth floor.

384
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,600
There's the 17th floor now.

385
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,880
What may I help you with, Officer Meng?

386
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,239
Last time at your store,

387
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,209
you insisted on giving me a discount on my suit.

388
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,379
So, I thought I would return the favor.

389
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,050
I specifically found something that is a good match for you.

390
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,290
See?

391
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,619
Exactly the same, an emotionless face.

392
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,320
It's for you, take it.

393
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,120
Exactly the same.

394
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,830
I said it's a gift to you.

395
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:04,490
Stop clinging onto what happened four years ago.

396
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,300
Because everything I've said is true.

397
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,899
It's true you were at the scene.

398
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,499
It's true you were shot.

399
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,769
It's true you almost died because of too much blood loss.

400
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,340
All of these are true.

401
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,140
But...

402
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,739
in your statement, you said you didn't see a gunman.

403
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,510
That's not true.

404
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,249
You're the only one in this world that thinks this.

405
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,449
That's right.

406
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,980
Because I'm the only one in this world that understands you.

407
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,019
Why do you believe what I said is not true?

408
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,520
Gut feeling.

409
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,530
My gut tells me you're lying.

410
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,660
Even though I don't know why you're lying,

411
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,430
but I just feel like you're hiding something.

412
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,940
Furthermore,

413
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,610
I can tell from your reaction that I predicted correctly.

414
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,980
It's making you nervous.

415
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,310
Your ears are turning red.

416
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,550
You really are nervous!

417
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,359
If you really don't want me to keep hounding you,

418
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,860
then tell me honestly the whole story about what happened four years ago.

419
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,180
What are you doing?

420
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,380
You'd better not do anything. I'm not scared of you.

421
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,920
You're not worth it for me to do anything.

422
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,899
Almost slipped, Officer Meng.

423
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,330
The one I want to take is this one.

424
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,040
What are you doing?

425
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,180
Tang Yi!

426
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,191
Tang Yi!

427
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:10,650
Tang Yi, you jerk! Get back here!

428
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,930
What kind of game are you guys playing?

429
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,730
Nothing.

430
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,080
Captain, we've already settled with the Metro Business Hotel and already compensated them.

431
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,680
They won't file a complaint.

432
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,049
Not filing a complaint means nothing's wrong?

433
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,190
Is our police budget for you to use in this way?

434
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,620
Captain, I did it for the case.

435
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,189
For the case, my ass!

436
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,260
I reminded and reiterated a million times,

437
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,790
and still you completely ignored me!

438
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,130
Starting tomorrow, no...

439
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,799
Starting immediately, you're doing desk work for three days.

440
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,069
Do not leave the building.

441
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,799
Captain!

442
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,769
Captain! How will I investigate the case like this?

443
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,239
I just don't want you to cause any more trouble. This is an order.

444
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,380
You watch him write his apology letter.

445
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,379
Don't hand it to me unless it's over 2000 words.

446
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,810
Me again?

447
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,650
Captain!

448
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:16,550
A-fei, clinging too tightly to one case is not a good thing.

449
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,460
Sometimes when we can't solve a case, it's because the time hasn't come yet.

450
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,400
As humans, we need to look forward. Don't keep holding onto the past.

451
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,130
Captain, sorry, but I can't.

452
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,000
Sister Lizhen was a very important senior of mine.

453
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,399
I won't idly stand by and watch others tarnish her credibility by saying she colluded with gangs.

454
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,239
I must find out the truth of what happened four years ago.

455
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,610
I won't let her die in vain.

456
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,840
3000 words.

457
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,680
Captain!

458
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:45,010
Shaofei! Shaofei!

459
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,390
- Brother De. Brother Jack.
- Where's the boss?

460
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,230
In the dining room.

461
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,070
Boss, the lawyer got Jack out.

462
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,840
Sorry to keep the boss waiting.

463
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,439
Boss, the lawyers said,

464
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,939
that even the Interpol Division has started watching Jack recently.

465
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,749
Perhaps we should let Jack take a break.

466
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,050
If anything arises, I can handle it.

467
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,149
Thanks for the concern.

468
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,349
Interpol Division just invited me to have a cup of tea.

469
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,850
No problems at all.

470
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,590
Jack,

471
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,819
today, we're negotiating with Wang Kunchen.

472
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:29,159
You know what to do.

473
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,690
No problem, Boss.

474
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,729
Boss, you're really going to let Jack come with us?

475
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:37,200
Are you questioning my decision?

476
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,870
No.

477
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Boss, I'm going to get ready now.

478
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,950
Bo--

479
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,020
I'll go prepare, too.

480
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,260
Boss, they're here.

481
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,500
Little Brother,

482
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,570
you probably don't remember me.

483
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,969
When I was in Hsin-Tien Group, you were still young.

484
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:54,579
I remember.

485
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:58,350
All these years, Boss Wang and those who deal drugs behind Hsin-Tien Group's backs have become good friends.

486
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,450
I hear your name every two or three days.

487
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,790
I'm very familiar with you.

488
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,559
Why are you like this, Little Brother?

489
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,090
Even if you don't want to take care of yourself. You need to at least take care of Hsin-Tien Group.

490
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,330
Why do you need to make a scene out of this?

491
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,999
Hsin-Tien Group hasn't been what it used to be for quite some time now.

492
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,530
Why should I listen to what other people say?

493
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,540
The younger generation these days are becoming more and more arrogant,

494
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,670
and don't even give us older generation any credit.

495
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,189
Fine.

496
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,660
Let me give you another option.

497
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,159
I will hand over the list of names of all the Hsin-Tien Group members.

498
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,329
However you want to clean house, I don't care.

499
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,030
I guarantee...

500
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,830
I will never do business with Hsin-Tien Group again.

501
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,340
Don't tell me you're not taking this chance I'm giving you. (T/N: I'm giving you face and you don't want it)

502
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,010
So what?

503
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,009
Then, when you walk out that door,

504
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,980
how many Hsin-Tien Group brothers can you protect?

505
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,280
We'll just wait and see.

506
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,421
Regarding the situation of cleaning house,

507
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:14,719
it's not for you, an old fellow, who Master Tang had kicked out of Hsin-Tien Group to tell me what to do.

508
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,689
What did you say? You--

509
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,600
Okay.

510
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,670
Today, we agreed to not bring guns and no fighting. Stand down.

511
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,100
Yes, Boss.

512
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,209
Since Boss Tang has made a decision,

513
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,380
let Hsin-Tien Group become history.

514
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,950
Let me help you.

515
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,350
I want you to forever remember your decision!

516
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,990
Likewise.

517
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,730
This Wang Kunchen is not that simple of a man.

518
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,929
I heard he's the largest distributor for Cambodia in Taiwan.

519
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,601
Super Drug Dealer.

520
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:30,630
As soon as he's dead, won't all the Southeast Asians in the territory create chaos?

521
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,739
I don't know.

522
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,869
During interrogation, Wang Kunchen's men said,

523
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,669
the last person he met was Tang Yi.

524
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,770
Not sure if it's the truth or they're just trying to frame him.

525
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,109
- Don't tell A-fei about this.
- Senior is here.

526
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,679
Why is everyone staring at me like that?

527
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,049
Do I have something on my face?

528
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,320
No.

529
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,390
Zhao Zi!

530
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,161
What are you guys doing?

531
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:56,429
Nothing. I suddenly really need to go to the restroom.

532
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,630
I drank too much water just now. I have to go, bye-bye.

533
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,570
Good thing I remembered using this restroom excuse.

534
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,710
What are you doing?

535
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,640
Why are you squatting?

536
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,810
Nothing.

537
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,049
Tell me now!

538
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:21,050
As soon as I walked into the office, everyone stopped talking.

539
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,320
Strange. When did everyone become so in sync?

540
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,160
This...

541
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,360
Tell me.

542
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,330
- Wang Kunchen is dead.
- And?

543
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,160
Last night.

544
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,200
Around nine o'clock.

545
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,530
Get to the point!

546
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,570
The last person he saw was Tang Yi!

547
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,939
Why are you hugging me?

548
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,240
I was afraid you would act rashly and rush out to find Tang Yi.

549
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,350
Why would I go look for Tang Yi?

550
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,210
Didn't I say it clearly enough just now?

551
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,679
Last night, Tang Yi went to meet with Wang Kunchen.

552
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,090
And then, did you guys find anything at the scene?

553
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,290
Currently, no concrete evidence yet. Only statements from Wang Kunchen's men.

554
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:05,830
But they all say the same thing, that Tang Yi was responsible for Wang Kunchen's death.

555
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,970
You don't believe it?

556
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,840
It's not that I don't believe it. I've been following Tang Yi for four years.

557
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,909
What kind of person he is, would I not know?

558
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:23,280
He didn't have any deep hatred or grudges with Wang Kunchen, why would he kill him?

559
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,720
Drugs. This is very harmful to becoming legitimate.

560
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,550
Legitimizing means no dealing drugs, that's correct.

561
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,719
But in order to clean his organization, you need to start from the inside as well.

562
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,031
And Wang Kunchen is a key figure for the Cambodians.

563
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:37,029
By killing him, will the Cambodians let him off the hook?

564
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,901
How will Hsin-Tien Group legitimize itself then?

565
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:42,600
A-fei, I never thought you'd speak up for Tang Yi this time.

566
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,500
To be clear, I'm not speaking up for Tang Yi. Am I that kind of person?

567
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,839
I'm just following the logic here. He just doesn't have any motive for killing him.

568
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,010
Where did all your training from the police academy go?

569
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,749
If you're able to maintain your calmness about things concerning Tang Yi normally,

570
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,620
then all would be all right.

571
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,919
I'm a police officer. I solve cases using my head.

572
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,950
Why would I frame him for something impossible?

573
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,890
It's not strange at all for Wang Kunchen's men to all say the same thing.

574
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,189
- They've been at odds for so long. And Tang Yi has often caused trouble for them.
- That's right.

575
00:34:11,189 --> 00:34:12,100
Zhao Zi.

576
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,699
Brother Zhao Zi, why would you tell senior about this?

577
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,769
Didn't we agree to not let him know right now?

578
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,999
Yuqi, don't worry. This time A-fei was really rational.

579
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,239
Just now, in the bathroom, he logically reasoned

580
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,409
that Tang Yi had nothing to do with Wang Kunchen's death.

581
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,110
Yes, why would you all think I'd go look for Tang Yi?

582
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,710
Really?

583
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,219
I thought that just mentioning Tang Yi's name, you'd go crazy.

584
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,751
Am I that rash of a person?

585
00:34:36,751 --> 00:34:39,019
What's that? Evidence from which case?

586
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,990
Wang Kunchen's.

587
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,900
- What is it?
- It belonged to Tang Yi.

588
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,610
Why is he chasing Tang Yi again?

589
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:01,400
- Senior!
- A-fei!

590
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,149
I told you to do desk work, where are you running off to?

591
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,710
I need to go find Tang Yi.

592
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,519
Are you kidding?

593
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,620
Captain, Tang Yi has something to do with Wang Kunchen's death.

594
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,261
How? Do you have evidence?

595
00:35:13,261 --> 00:35:16,789
Yes. The cuff link we found belongs to Tang Yi. He was definitely at the scene.

596
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:19,129
A-fei, you can't just pin hunches

597
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:21,159
all on Tang Yi.

598
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,901
Those cuff links are very common on the market.

599
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:28,239
Yes, A-fei. Your logical reasoning just now clearly didn't tell you this.

600
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,111
But the design of the cuff link is very particular, I've seen him wear it.

601
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:33,679
I just can't remember where. So I'm going to ask him.

602
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,340
Fine.

603
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,479
Think about it.

604
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,509
Who is Wang Kunchen?

605
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,950
He's the drug lord of the Cambodian channel.

606
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,719
Tang Yi is not stupid either.

607
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,389
He's been working so hard the past few years to legitimize Hsin-Tien Group.

608
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,589
Why would he hire someone to kill Wang Kunchen and darken himself?

609
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:49,629
I know! I just know!

610
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,859
That's why I think something is going on.

611
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,029
I don't care if it's his problem or your problem.

612
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,499
You just stay here at the station.

613
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,400
- Captain.
- Stay!

614
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,440
All right, A-fei. Just think about what you just said, it's very logical.

615
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,339
And that evidence, even if it really has Tang Yi's fingerprints,

616
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,350
it still can't actually prove anything.

617
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,910
Captain! Believe me.

618
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,179
Even though I really don't know why

619
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,549
Tang Yi wanted to kill Wang Kunchen,

620
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,679
but let me go ask him.

621
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,350
I can definitely get more clues from him.

622
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,620
You want to investigate Wang Kunchen's death.

623
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,929
Wait until we finish our meeting with the Interpol Division,

624
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:27,160
you'll have endless clues to track down.

625
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,470
We are going to work with the Interpol Division to investigate?

626
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,790
There are so many steps for making a cup of tea.

627
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,430
You really have a lot of patience.

628
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:01,200
Making tea can help us slow down and really think.

629
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,670
You really ought to learn it.

630
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,300
Brother Daoyi.

631
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,740
Have a seat.

632
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,910
Sit, Brother Daoyi.

633
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,080
How is Shi Hai's current status?

634
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,719
Everything is on track.

635
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,650
Right, Daoyi?

636
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,260
The company's current financial status is slowly becoming more stable.

637
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,689
Afterward, we'll be starting to bid on some large projects.

638
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,830
Boss, please don't worry.

639
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,260
Having you handle the legitimizing situation was the right choice.

640
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:39,600
Brother Daoyi, I'm troubling you to take more care of her.

641
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,340
Of course.

642
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:46,710
Tang Yi, I heard Daoyi say that the word on the street is that you killed Wang Kunchen.

643
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,580
Is it true?

644
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,750
- Didn't I tell you—
- Boss.

645
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,920
It's okay, say it.

646
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,790
There's news from Cambodia.

647
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,730
Chen Wenhao is coming back.

648
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,269
Finally coming back.

649
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,169
Why are you like this again?

650
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,409
Continuing to do things that will make me worry for your safety.

651
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,009
Nothing will happen.

652
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:23,010
Tang Yi.

653
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,450
Daoyi.

654
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,829
Good afternoon, everyone.

655
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,030
Regarding the investigation of Wang Kunchen's murder case,

656
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,970
now let me give everyone a status update.

657
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,299
According to the actual scene,

658
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:49,739
there were no signs of a fight inside the club.

659
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,739
So we can logically induce that

660
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,580
Wang Kunchen left the club

661
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,510
before getting attacked.

662
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,579
Regarding witnesses.

663
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,850
Tang Yi has an alibi for not being at the site that day.

664
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:02,119
That evening he attended a party.

665
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,249
He entered the party at 8:30

666
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,419
and left at 1:00 a.m. in the morning.

667
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,889
We've looked through the hotel's video surveillance footage

668
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:10,959
and confirmed seeing Tang Yi entering and leaving the hotel.

669
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,029
With regard to the other cameras surrounding the club,

670
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,260
they were damaged a while ago prior to the incident.

671
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,029
We'll continue to investigate who damaged the cameras.

672
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:21,669
We will expand our search in order to find new evidence.

673
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:24,469
The above is our status update from Investigation Unit 3.

674
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,210
End of report.

675
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,689
Thank you Unit 3 team for your report.

676
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:38,189
But it looks like

677
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,459
there isn't any clear evidence

678
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,689
to point out a suspect for the murder.

679
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:48,689
Regarding this, we hope that Unit 3 can quickly give us more concrete information.

680
00:39:48,689 --> 00:39:52,480
Following is the update from our Interpol Division.

681
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,239
According to our investigation,

682
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,469
as soon as Wang Kunchen's death was made known,

683
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,340
we received a tip.

684
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,280
Cambodian drug lord Chen Wenhao has returned.

685
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,150
Wang Kunchen and Chen Wenhao

686
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,379
were both Hsin-Tien Group members at one time.

687
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:11,890
In particular, Chen Wenhao had served 24 year's time in prison.

688
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,119
But four years ago,

689
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,130
he was let out.

690
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:19,530
He escaped to Southeast Asia and remained very elusive ever since.

691
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,999
Coming back this time, we believe...

692
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:25,000
Four years ago he was let out.

693
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,500
Tang Guodong was shot and killed four years ago.

694
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,909
Perhaps there's a connection?

695
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:36,040
Are there any location sighting tips of Chen Wenhao?

696
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:41,649
Currently, we're unable to be 100% sure of his location.

697
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:45,089
We can only deduce from the different reports that we've received.

698
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,489
This is why we're hoping that Unit 3

699
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,989
can provide us with their

700
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,460
full support with this investigation.

701
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,200
They are having problems finding information themselves, so they're bringing us in to cooperate.

702
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Captain Shi.

703
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:06,470
The actual capturing this time will be the sole responsibility of the Interpol Division.

704
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,640
We're requesting Unit 3 to cooperate with us.

705
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,779
Your main mission is to ensure

706
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:16,080
the validity of the sighting reports.

707
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,990
Once we have a location on Chen Wenhao, please let us know immediately.

708
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,630
Assault and capturing will be carried out by the Interpol Division.

709
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,830
This portion,

710
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,860
there shouldn't be any problems, right?

711
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,870
What a perfect method of cooperation!

712
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,940
Captain Shi?

713
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,980
No problem.

714
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,040
Of course, it's not a problem.

715
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,420
I understand.

716
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,649
That all present here are all working very hard.

717
00:41:48,649 --> 00:41:50,889
As long as we can successfully capture Chen Wenhao,

718
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,960
for both you and me, it's a good thing.

719
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,100
But the actions taken this time,

720
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,870
will be a very important step to stop the influx of drugs from Cambodia.

721
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:08,240
I hope you can control your people.

722
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,170
Especially him.

723
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,579
I don't want a repeat of last time. Destroying the plans of the Interpol Division.

724
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:17,610
No, we were—

725
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,350
A-fei, calm down.

726
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,620
I believe you also don't want to worry our superiors again this time.
