♫ How can I leave you behind? ♫

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,670
♫ Leave you here alone ♫

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,760
♫ It's you who was here as I was desperate ♫

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,600
♫ and crying; I finally realized myself  ♫

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,530
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,510
♫ You always don't like to say anything ♫

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,780
♫ It gave me a dream with you ♫

8
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,080
♫ How many times I wanted to confess from the bottom of my heart ♫

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,140
♫ How I lost to sadness and loneliness ♫

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,950
♫ As you are waiting ♫

11
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,120
♫ Never wanting to let go ♫

12

♫ A promise to grow old together while seeing the sunrise and the moon sets with a smile ♫

♫ Leave you here alone ♫

00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,550

00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:25,380
♫ and crying; I finally realized myself  ♫

17
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,020
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

18
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,660
Didn't I tell you to be careful?

19
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,670
You think I did it on purpose.

20
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,079
Have the guts to come back and show your faces?

21
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:36,080
How do you do things?

22
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,619
I gave you so many people.

23
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:40,889
Until now, there's still no news!

24
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:42,889
I told you to find out who attacked Boss,

25
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,429
and you couldn't find anything?

26
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:45,489
Why do I keep you guys around for?

27
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,560
- Sorry, Brother De.
- Brother De, sorry.

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,029
Don't apologize to me.

29
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:51,230
I hate hearing "I'm sorry."

30
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,469
I'm going to give you another two hours.

31
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:57,399
- In two hours, I want you to find out where Boss is.
- Yes, Brother De.

32
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:59,010
- Scram!
- Yes, Brother De.

33
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,379
Let's go, hurry.

34
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,080
Brother Jack.

35
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,779
Brother De, getting so angry at our boys won't help the situation.

36
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:13,419
They've been searching since yesterday.

37
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,819
They've been working quite hard.

38
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,759
How about having some coconut water to quench your temper?

39
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,460
Let me send someone to buy some.

40
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,429
The sun is really harsh now. Let's go over there to hide from the sun.

41
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:23,870
Come on.

42
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,139
Drink what coconut water!

43
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,769
Don't you know what's happening?

44
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,940
The Boss has been missing for almost 20 hours now.

45
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,539
Not only are you not worried, you even brought back a cop.

46
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:37,109
The Boss disappeared with Meng Shaofei;

47
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:39,880
the cops won't stay idle.

48
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,119
What's wrong with bringing back one of Meng Shaofei's partners to be questioned?

49
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,020
Getting involved with the cops is never good.

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,029
Brother De, doing things the old way is admittedly reliable.

51
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:57,299
But if you're too rigid, then it won't do you any good.

52
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,170
What did you say?

53
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,339
Nothing.

54
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,440
All I'm saying is, sometimes, if you do things differently,

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,709
maybe it might be more successful.

56
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,339
Anyway, you have your ways,

57
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:12,580
and I have mine.

58
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,849
You don't interfere with me,

59
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,820
I won't bother you either.

60
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,159
I'll take your silence as a yes.

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,090
Don't go back on your word. Let's go.

62
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,330
You--

63
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,800
What are you so cocky about?

64
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,230
It's okay, I can still fight.

65
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,099
Are you sure you can still fight?

66
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:04,430
Nope, I don't think I can.

67
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,740
But I can come up with a plan.

68
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,839
This was my strength as a child.

69
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,939
Have you played before?

70
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:16,979
Are you kidding?

71
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,280
I was the accuracy master.

72
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,820
Again.

73
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,829
Missed me.

74
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,270
- Hurry up!
- Sh*t!

75
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,869
Missed by a mile.

76
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,339
- Again!
- Quiet!

77
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,340
I'm over here!

78
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,709
Missed again.

79
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,119
Being too noisy will affect my accuracy.

80
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,280
How about we stand still?

81
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,119
Did we hit them?

82
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,219
Does hitting their feet count?

83
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,889
- I think so.
- I think so, too.

84
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:04,289
Still missed by a mile.

85
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:05,860
Again.

86
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,769
You're really burning up.

87
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,800
Let me think again.

88
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,679
How did you come up with such an awesome idea?

89
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:26,509
You must be kidding, I was top of the class at the police academy.

90
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:27,879
Then what?

91
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,450
Let me tell you. Based on our good looks,

92
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,180
there's going to be a beautiful girl passing by soon who will stop her car and rescue us.

93
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,389
Just wait and see.

94
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,219
When you see the girl later, don't keep trembling. Hold it in.

95
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:37,290
Okay. Hold it in.

96
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
There they are.

97
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
There's a car coming.

98
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,770
Girl or a guy?

99
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,570
Girl. I told you it would be a beautiful girl.

100
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,970
Hi!

101
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,280
We were kidnapped--

102
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,410
So...

103
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,339
- We lost playing a game. So we were wondering if you could give us a lift?
- That's right!

104
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,749
We lost playing a game.

105
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:02,180
It looks like you guys are trying to trick me.

106
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,420
No, we're not! We were playing... Dare.

107
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,689
Right, Dare.

108
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,959
Pervert!

109
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,390
No! We're not perverts, we're--

110
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,670
Top of the class at the police academy, huh?

111
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Donuts.

112
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,290
Who is it?

113
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,130
What?

114
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,730
Why are you bothering me?

115
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,769
Meng Shaofei's cell phone number.

116
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,910
Why are you still here?

117
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,850
Tell me.

118
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,280
Let me go.

119
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,150
I'll go look for him with my colleagues. Wouldn't that be quicker?

120
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,449
And when they start to look for me,

121
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,149
you'll be finished.

122
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,689
If you still won't say, I'll...

123
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:14,389
How about bringing ten things to trade?

124
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:15,291
What?

125
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,329
Nothing comes for free in this world.

126
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,589
Of course, you can't have the number for nothing.

127
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,499
Plus, I'm starving right now.

128
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,400
Let me think. There are ten digits in the phone number.

129
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,639
Trade one thing for each digit:

130
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,439
I want some instant noodles, vegetables, meat,

131
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:35,240
eggs, toast,

132
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,009
and some milk.

133
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,179
You can eat all of this?

134
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,449
I haven't eaten anything since this morning.

135
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,340
If I get too hungry and forget his number, and then what?

136
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:51,761
Now let me think: cheese slices, a pot, Chopsticks, spoon.

137
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,330
Wait!

138
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,530
I'm about to pee myself. I want to trade for the restroom.

139
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,429
What time is it now? Are you serious?

140
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:03,269
I'm serious.

141
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,440
You're afraid I'm lying to you?

142
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,940
When I'm finished peeing, I'll give you his phone number.

143
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,509
Don't worry.

144
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,409
It's only the wound that's infected; plus, his body's weak.

145
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,249
Nothing too serious.

146
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:48,419
I've never doubted the Jiang family's skills,

147
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,220
especially yours.

148
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,889
What exactly is going on with you?

149
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,519
Previously, it was either yourself that got injured,

150
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,889
or you hurt someone else.

151
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,989
In order to let Hsin-Tien Group's boss

152
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:04,059
to be personally escorted here for treatment, it's a first time for me.

153
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,299
Tell me. Who is this person?

154
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,610
- No one.
- No one?

155
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,010
We just spent a night together on the mountain.

156
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:18,480
Just spent a night together on the mountain?

157
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:21,649
And then you show up with injuries all over your body?

158
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,479
Tell me. What did the two of you do on the mountain?

159
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,660
Idiot.

160
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,919
Help me contact his people.

161
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,860
I'm going to head home.

162
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,429
Tell me honestly. What actually happened?

163
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,330
Nothing.

164
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,200
Did you--

165
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,610
Thank you.

166
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,609
What is your stomach made of?

167
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:54,219
This is nothing.

168
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:56,079
I don't gain weight from eating anyway.

169
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,219
You ate so much and you still won't gain weight?

170
00:10:58,219 --> 00:11:00,150
What a waste of food.

171
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,129
Unable to finish all the food is called a waste of food, okay?

172
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:06,830
Help me carry this.

173
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,939
You don't want to try?

174
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:25,510
I have perfect confidence in my own cooking skills.

175
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,749
I meant A-fei's phone number.

176
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,519
You don't want to try calling?

177
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,049
Didn't you say he turned off his phone?

178
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:33,190
Aren't you afraid I'm lying to you?

179
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,550
Cell phone.

180
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,630
You check for yourself so I can eat more peacefully.

181
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,709
Has anyone ever told you, you're kind of weird.

182
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,909
That's you.

183
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,209
You brought me here for questioning for no reason.

184
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,349
When did I question you?

185
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,949
You held me for a night

186
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,850
That counts, too?

187
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,849
Of course, obstructing my freedom.

188
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,750
According to article 296 of the criminal code--

189
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,659
What are you doing?

190
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,220
We have work to do. Don't you need to get ready?

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,960
My noodles!

192
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,430
Such a pity.

193
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,940
I just had a few bites.

194
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,240
I'll make it up to you next time.

195
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,510
Sure.

196
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,780
You're cooking really is quite good.

197
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,749
I have stuff to do, I'll let you go today.

198
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,049
I'll come by another time.

199
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,619
I can really go?

200
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,590
I'm leaving then.

201
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,089
- Bye-bye.
- See you another time.

202
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,630
Hello, Yu Chi? What's wrong?

203
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,570
Hospital?

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,069
Senior,

205
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,009
you mean when you were passed out,

206
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,580
Tang Yi took you to the hospital,

207
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,349
He indeed was the one that brought me here,

208
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,220
Is he capable of being that kind?

209
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,349
He didn't escape and actually brought you to the hospital?

210
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,689
And returned your gun?

211
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,789
Looks like he's not as bad as we thought.

212
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,489
This is what he should have done.

213
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,289
After all, they were after Tang Yi.

214
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,129
Senior was innocently caught up in the situation.

215
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,700
If it wasn't for Tang Yi, Senior wouldn't have gotten hurt.

216
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,929
But he could have easily just not cared about A-fei's wellbeing; let him fend for himself.

217
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:29,499
With Tang Yi's personality, I'm sure he would be capable of doing that.

218
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:32,170
True. Besides, he doesn't have any good impressions of A-fei.

219
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,109
He probably wished the quicker he disappeared, the better.

220
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,679
I don't think this was an act of kindness.

221
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,679
The Mob helping the police. If this gets out, Senior will definitely be criticized.

222
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:43,979
That's true. This type of rumor is very scary.

223
00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:47,019
Just like that time when Sister Lizhen and Tang--

224
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,020
What? I didn't say anything wrong. There were already rumors floating around saying--

225
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,130
Sister Lizhen didn't.

226
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,070
Big mouth.

227
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,210
A-fei, get some more rest.

228
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,240
Get better first.

229
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,049
No need, I'm okay.

230
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:12,879
I can be discharged from the hospital today.

231
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,580
Senior, you should rest for a few more days.

232
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,820
Yes. Don't you still have a fever?

233
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,289
- Don't try to be brave.
- It's just a little fever.

234
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:24,059
I'll be fine after a good night's sleep at home.

235
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,089
It's better if you get some more rest.

236
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,059
I'll tell the Captain to give you another day off.

237
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,499
Captain knows?

238
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,969
How could he not know?

239
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,369
You left the team secretly,

240
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,299
and spent the night with Tang Yi.

241
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,969
Now you're lying in the hospital and haven't shown up for work all day.

242
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:39,739
I just talked to the Captain a while ago.

243
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,240
He suggests that you might as well take some time off and get some rest.

244
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,910
Why?

245
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:50,249
He's afraid that he'll beat you too hard. You'll have to come back after a few more days.

246
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,759
Did you find out who attacked me?

247
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,489
Up till now, we still don't have any results from the investigation.

248
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,899
But I feel the person with the most motive...

249
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,999
Speak.

250
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,700
Chen Wenhao.

251
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,039
He's the one with the most motive.

252
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,309
If it's because of Wang Kunchen's issue that he's back,

253
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,040
just getting back for such a short time and immediately something already happened to you,

254
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,209
so I believe he's the most suspicious.

255
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,949
I don't believe that's the case.

256
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,479
We got rid of Wang Kunchen just a few days ago.

257
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:28,319
In order to set up this type of attack would require a lot of time to plan.

258
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,400
For someone with a cunning personality as Chen Wenhao,

259
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,129
he would have to be very sure of all the details before executing his plan.

260
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,059
I don't believe there would be anyone that stupid

261
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,999
to have just come back to an unfamiliar place and get themselves into trouble.

262
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,299
That's just your opinion.

263
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,399
Yes. It might also be someone working for Wang Kunchen

264
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,939
that's come knocking,

265
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,909
or someone that we haven't even considered who couldn've attacked Boss.

266
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,010
You... What do you know?

267
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,681
How long have I been here? You've only been here for over a year!

268
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:57,219
Do you know the workings of the mob better than I do?

269
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,219
Do you really need to get so angry?

270
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,119
I'm just stating my opinion.

271
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,559
It may not be right,

272
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,259
but it may not be wrong either.

273
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,190
What do you mean? Stop playing word games with me.

274
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,759
Brother De, I'm being very serious.

275
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,330
Okay!

276
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,300
Get me some proof, or else all of this is just talk.

277
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,610
Yes, Boss.

278
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,650
Tang Yi! Tang Yi!

279
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,589
I'm fine. I'm okay.

280
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:40,960
You're fine, what's this?

281
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,360
Fine, I'm sorry I let you worry.

282
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,530
Why do you keep getting involved with that police officer?

283
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,570
Because he continues to let you get hurt

284
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,969
and then to end up alone in such a dangerous place,

285
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,410
I already told you that I'd help you.

286
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,339
- Why insist on doing this on your own?
- Sorry.

287
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:59,980
Don't apologize to me!

288
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,280
Not every "I'm sorry" can be traded for an "It's okay."

289
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,190
You clearly know how important you are to me.

290
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,889
Whether it was fighting alongside each other in the streets

291
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,889
or coming to Hsin-Tien Group later;

292
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,329
if I don't have you beside me,

293
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,400
I, Zuo Hongye, would not be who I am today.

294
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,799
But now, all I can do is watch you sink deeper and deeper,

295
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,040
and can't do anything about it.

296
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,539
Because you don't tell me anything.

297
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,110
All I can do is worry.

298
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,570
Do you understand how that feeling is really very hard to take?

299
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:41,620
♫ It’s a habit living in your eyes to search for my radiance ♫

300
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,810
♫ I can’t count how many dreams I’ve sacrificed; just afraid that you’ll...  ♫

301
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,680
The Zuo Hongye I know has grown up.

302
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,579
She isn't that emotional.

303
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,300
That's because of you.

304
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,020
♫ still exists in your embrace ♫

305
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,490
All right. It's my fault.

306
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,329
I promise there won't be a next time.

307
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,030
No way.

308
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,470
I really won't do that again next time.

309
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,169
Then how about not being alone anymore?

310
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,009
Let me accompany you together.

311
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,309
Your safety is my limit.

312
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,010
You also know how important you are to me.

313
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,080
The organization and you will always be more important than my own life.

314
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,549
So after all this, you just want me to keep worrying.

315
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,689
You never really look out for your own safety.

316
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,510
I don't want to lie to you.

317
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,049
But I promise you, I will give my all to take care of my own safety.

318
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,349
Okay. Then you promise me one thing.

319
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:50,689
Stay away from Meng Shaofei, okay?

320
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,960
From the day you first met him, nothing good has come of it.

321
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,059
Okay?

322
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,430
Okay, I will.

323
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,139
It's okay.

324
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,180
It's just a small wound.

325
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,980
Let me see.

326
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,780
- Does it hurt?
- Of course.

327
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,490
Does it really hurt?

328
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,250
- Stop messing around.
- It really hurts.

329
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,020
Hello?

330
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,419
Why would you make a move?

331
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,019
I told you. It's not the right time to discuss it with him right now.

332
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:56,920
I need for you to wait a little longer.

333
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,629
I know.

334
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,960
But give me some more time!

335
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,599
Okay.

336
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,440
I will handle the situation.

337
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,370
Wait for my updates.

338
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,970
Boss! Jack, he--

339
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,279
Did you see my suit from yesterday?

340
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,509
Suit?

341
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,379
It's getting sent to the cleaners.

342
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,480
Boss, what are you looking for?

343
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,379
Where is it?

344
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,120
Jason, bring it over. Quickly.

345
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,489
Boss.

346
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,749
- Where is Boss's suit from yesterday?
- Here.

347
00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:02,820
Hurry.

348
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,030
Boss, what did you lose? Let me get more people to help look for it.

349
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,369
What are you doing here?

350
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,670
It was Jack that let him in.

351
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,939
Officer Meng came first thing this morning. I couldn't get rid of him.

352
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:21,269
He insisted that he see you; he has something to tell you.

353
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:22,880
- I came because last time--
- I'm busy.

354
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,610
No, I just have something to return to you.

355
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,349
When we were getting off the mountain, it fell on the road.

356
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,690
I saw it and picked it up.

357
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,730
I had a fever at that time and I was pretty groggy as you know.

358
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,399
And then we ran into those people, I didn't get a chance to return it to you.

359
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,669
I saw it when I got home. I'm sorry.

360
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,910
Thank you.

361
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,480
Thank me?

362
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,379
This lighter is very important to me.

363
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,919
So thank you for picking it up. Thank you for returning it to me.

364
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,659
Actually, I'm here today... because I need to thank you.

365
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,259
Thank you for taking me to the hospital. Thank you.

366
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:18,069
I don't want to owe you a favor.

367
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,629
I'll give you a chance.

368
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,230
Sure. Then tell me what I want to know.

369
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,470
Anything but this one thing.

370
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,609
Okay, then I'll treat you to a meal.

371
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:30,540
Let me return my thanks.

372
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,880
Sure. Let's go.

373
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,320
Okay.

374
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,030
Brother De.

375
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,550
What would the two of you like to eat today?

376
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,480
Me?

377
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,049
Simmered fish fillets.

378
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:15,460
Okay.

379
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,859
From Italy. This is really from Italy?

380
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,490
Yes.

381
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,529
Spicy orecchiette pasta from Italy.

382
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:24,399
And colored vegetables and sliced meat with spicy bean sauce.

383
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,930
Do you eat spicy foods? I forgot to ask.

384
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,360
Okay.

385
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,099
Forget the colored vegetables and sliced meat. Change it to shredded pork buns from Beijing.

386
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:35,610
You order something.

387
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,740
Spicy sausage gnocchi.

388
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:38,980
That's it?

389
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:40,509
I'm treating you today.

390
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,380
It's okay.

391
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,250
Fried water spinach.

392
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,120
Would you like to order a drink?

393
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,990
-Tea.
- Coke.

394
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:49,390
Okay.

395
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,730
We'll be back with your orders shortly.

396
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,370
Have some water.

397
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,980
It still hurts a bit.

398
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,519
Here.

399
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,120
Let me get it myself.

400
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,180
Then eat some appetizers.

401
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,140
Let me tell you. Whether a restaurant is good or bad,

402
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,449
just trying their appetizers will give you the answer.

403
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,349
- Understand your food?
- Yes.

404
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:50,649
I have a short and dumb colleague who is a foodie.

405
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,249
Every appetizer has to be made intentionally; it can't be careless.

406
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,290
You like this, too?

407
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,660
- Here have it all. I don't want it, I'm going to try this.
- It's okay.

408
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,230
You eat it.

409
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,029
If you like it, go ahead. Why so courteous, right?

410
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,280
Here are your orders.

411
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,590
Dig in.

412
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,989
Let me tell you. This dish is a must-order.

413
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:39,300
One word "spicy."

414
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,240
Really spicy.

415
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,340
Try it.

416
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,350
These are all really good, too.

417
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,589
You're just going to eat that?

418
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,360
This is very good? Let me try it.

419
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,390
This. It's spicy.

420
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,600
Have you tried this? Eat a mouthful of spicy food and then follow with a sip of coke.

421
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,470
I don't eat like that.

422
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,809
Why eat spicy food with hot tea?

423
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,950
Are you an old man?

424
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,550
Okay, I'll try the tea.

425
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,769
This takes the spicy out of it completely.

426
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,399
Are you here to eat or provoke me?

427
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,409
No, I'm telling you.

428
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,169
This is something you really don't know.

429
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,909
My foodie brother and I will eat

430
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,639
from restaurants to night markets,

431
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,879
from night markets to roadside stalls,

432
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,979
and for every spicy dish, you have to pair it with coke.

433
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:05,420
I'm serious.

434
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,219
Take a bite of the spicy food.

435
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:12,089
Your tongue will immediately have a jumping sense of stimulation.

436
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,059
Hurry and follow with a sip of coke.

437
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,959
It will just shoot straight to the brain.

438
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,700
Awesome!

439
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,969
Really. You don't believe me?

440
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,870
Here.

441
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:22,939
Have a bite of the spicy food.

442
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,140
Hurry.

443
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,269
Drink some coke. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

444
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:29,040
Now, really. If you wait, it'll be too late.

445
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:30,680
Hurry, hurry.

446
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,480
See?

447
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,750
What do you think?

448
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,119
You don't like it?

449
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,359
Okay.

450
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,030
You don't have gourmet's luck.

451
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,629
You're too serious.

452
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,130
You're so methodical and never smile.

453
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,869
You know how to order food, but don't know how to eat it.

454
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,170
It's a pity.

455
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,880
B is here.

456
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,590
And as for C, it is over here.

457
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,260
There's also D.

458
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,830
Confirm it for yourself first.

459
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,569
Senior, you're here.

460
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,300
Where's the Captain? How come I didn't see him?

461
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,440
He just stepped out.

462
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,139
How's his mood today?

463
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,679
Today, he's...

464
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,140
You can tell him. Let me be prepared.

465
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,309
Not good! Not good at all!

466
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:43,250
Captain, you're here.

467
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,759
- Look at you.
- Captain, that hurts.

468
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,859
All refreshed and rested.

469
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,959
Did you sleep well?

470
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,659
Just because of you, I...

471
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,559
couldn't eat well or sleep well.

472
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,299
Captain, your thoughts should be focused on Little Ya's wedding.

473
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,169
As for my minor issue, you can just...

474
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,470
Don't need to worry about them, right, Boss Meng?

475
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,410
Yes.

476
00:29:08,411 --> 00:29:09,579
Do you want me to send you directly to

477
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,380
the hospital for another few days?

478
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,249
Looks like 3,000 words apology letters

479
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,919
are not fun enough for you.

480
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,079
How about 5,000 words? What do you say?

481
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,049
Captain, how can you just bump it to 5,000 words?

482
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:23,459
Actually, my hand still hurts a lot.

483
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,329
And I still have a bit of a fever.

484
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,959
I'm really not feeling too well today.

485
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,459
I forced myself to come to work today, Captain.

486
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,530
That's right, Captain.

487
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,399
Senior's injuries aren't totally healed.

488
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,029
Also, he really still has a bit of a fever.

489
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:37,499
What did the doctor say?

490
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:41,270
He said that I just needed to get more rest,

491
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,239
have a joyful mood,

492
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,110
and rest quietly.

493
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,549
Quiet rest, is that right?

494
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,220
Yes.

495
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,549
Then, let's do this.

496
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,049
Come with me to Interpol first.

497
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,919
Apologize for your disappearance from work.

498
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,190
After we get our butts chewed out, I promise you.

499
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,429
I will let you rest quietly with a joyful mood.

500
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,000
Let's go!

501
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,900
- Captain, this really does hurt.
- Captain, Senior's injuries aren't healed yet

502
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,539
Don't make excuses for him.

503
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,840
You don't learn the good and only learn the bad.

504
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,340
How do you teach your juniors?

505
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,980
Let's go. Little bastard!

506
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,981
- Captain!
- Senior!

507
00:30:18,981 --> 00:30:20,149
Let's go!

508
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,749
Disappearing from work. You're really something.

509
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:24,850
Yuchi, where is Captain taking A-fei?

510
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,889
To apologize.

511
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,720
Apologize?

512
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,120
Watch him more closely.

513
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,759
If anything comes up, please inform me immediately.

514
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,790
- No problem.
- Yes.

515
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,630
We'll leave now.

516
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,410
I'm sorry.

517
00:30:49,411 --> 00:30:52,909
I left the team during work and caused a lot of trouble for everyone.

518
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,959
You're the one that Lizhen specifically looked after, right?

519
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,959
Yes.

520
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,729
Because of a case from four years ago,

521
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,259
you continue to cling onto Tang Yi relentlessly.

522
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,630
Actually, I really admire you.

523
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,369
But after these last few years of observation,

524
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,769
I've realized...

525
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,599
that you're just an impulsive,

526
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,669
reckless,

527
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,999
selfish coward.

528
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,839
Zhengqiang,

529
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,569
A-fei is very diligent with his investigations.

530
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,839
He's diligent in the wrong places.

531
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,209
That is pure stupidity.

532
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,149
You are his superior officer.

533
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,010
Don't you know that acting this way is quite dangerous?

534
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,250
I'm sorry.

535
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,649
I'm the one that acted alone. It has nothing to do with Captain.

536
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,119
Last time, you screwed up Thailand.

537
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,789
This time, Cambodia. You messed up again.

538
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:40,659
I'm starting to wonder

539
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,199
if you guys at Unit 3

540
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,930
really do still want to

541
00:31:42,931 --> 00:31:44,329
cooperate with us or not.

542
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,469
Or should I just let the commander know

543
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,039
that Unit 3 and Interpol's cooperation will come to an end right here.

544
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,939
Let some other unit be responsible.

545
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,510
How can that be?

546
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,810
Since this is our district, of course, we are the most familiar with it.

547
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,650
Then show me the professionalism you should have.

548
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,919
No problem.

549
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,590
I promise. This is the last time.

550
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,060
I'm very sorry.

551
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,569
Not bad.

552
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,379
You didn't talk back this time.

553
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,980
Growing up?

554
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,780
I was the one at fault from the start.

555
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,479
The most important thing is... he's not you, Captain!

556
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:39,919
What do you mean?

557
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,349
When he chews you out, you take it?

558
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,159
But when I yell at you, you talk back?

559
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,620
Is that right? You little bastard!

560
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,429
- Captain, that's not what I meant.
- You little bastard!

561
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,329
It's because you're a nice person. You understand me.

562
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:50,860
It's like that?

563
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,269
- Smooth talker.
- Captain!

564
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,199
- That really hurts.
- I'm doing it on purpose.

565
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,640
Captain,

566
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,169
sorry.

567
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,540
Thank you for standing up for me.

568
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,690
So disgusting!

569
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,190
This is this week's records

570
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:20,759
of all the guests that booked rooms

571
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,899
and the name lists.

572
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,630
Times are all listed on the list. You can take a look.

573
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,270
What if they didn't have a reservation? The walk-in customers,

574
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,509
do you have records of those, too?

575
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,650
Yes, they're all already on there.

576
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:35,810
A-fei,

577
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,039
I've looked through the lists already.

578
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,980
It's not there.

579
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,080
All right. Thank you.

580
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,680
If there's anything else, we'll come back again.

581
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:44,019
No problem.

582
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,549
Thank you.

583
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,349
Interpol's been here before, too.

584
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,819
Why do you want to come again?

585
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,960
I came because I wanted to see if there were any clues that were missed.

586
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,929
Also, that meeting for them was so important.

587
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,800
Chen Wenhao!

588
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,770
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

589
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,260
Chen Wenhao!

590
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,049
We were so close!

591
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,620
I didn't think they would really come here.

592
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,590
The person that attacked me, do you know who it was yet?

593
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,860
I still need a bit of time, Boss.

594
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,129
I hope I won't need to wait too long.

595
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,930
No problem.

596
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,409
Let's head over to the store first.

597
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,070
Yes.

598
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,850
You're a little late today.

599
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,120
If I knew you were coming ahead of time, I would have canceled my previous appointment.

600
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
Why? Officer Meng is more well off than I thought.
 (T/N: your pocket is so deep)

601
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,460
Are you looking for another suit?

602
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,159
This one is very expensive and doesn't suit you.

603
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:06,670
Who says it doesn't suit...

604
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,890
The suit from last time was...

605
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,100
Forget it.

606
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,210
Or have you found something else of mine,

607
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,010
and want to go for coke plus spicy food?

608
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,649
Officer Meng, you're so punctual with your visit today.

609
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,250
Please let me know what I can help the police with.

610
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,749
You really had nothing to do with Wang Kunchen's death?

611
00:35:29,749 --> 00:35:33,090
What are you still asking this same question? I've said everything that I can say.

612
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,559
Did you find any new evidence?

613
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,099
Then Wang Kunchen's death has nothing to do with Chen Wenhao's return?

614
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,799
I'm very busy. I don't have time to play with the police--

615
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:47,510
I have an idea of who attacked us last time.

616
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,949
Officer Meng is quite quick at solving the case this time.

617
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:57,009
I went back to the scene yesterday. Chen Wenhao was there, too.

618
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,989
He really did show up there.

619
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,349
So, it means that our police info was correct.

620
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:05,059
Just that the time was different than what we found out.

621
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,329
Or maybe he knew we were waiting for him,

622
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,559
so he changed his schedule. Or you were waiting for him, too?

623
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,469
Why are you telling me all of this?

624
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,409
You singled out his line in Taiwan.

625
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,879
I don't want Chen Wenhao to get a step ahead of us and kill you first.

626
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,850
I'm not worried.

627
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,490
What is it you really want to ask?

628
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,330
After these four years, no matter what I ask you, you always have that same expression.

629
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,609
I guess I'll never get any info from you.
(T/N: I admit defeat meeting you, a clamshell)

630
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,439
I'm better off investigating myself, thinking it through myself.

631
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,640
Or perhaps,

632
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,080
when you feel like telling me, you'll tell me?

633
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,919
Hello, Zhao Zi.

634
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,120
I know, I know we have a meeting.

635
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,589
I'm headed back now.

636
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,130
Bye-bye.

637
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,409
Boss, since he's already appeared,

638
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,610
how should we proceed next?

639
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,319
Mission lists. One copy for everyone.

640
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,959
The music festival is starting soon.

641
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,329
This is the peak season for transactions.

642
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,159
Does everyone see the back of the list?

643
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,330
This is the information about our target for this mission. Goes by the nickname Big K.

644
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,470
We've been tracking this person for quite some time now.

645
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,009
This time, we've finally come into some intel.

646
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,269
He's going to be at this pub tomorrow night to conduct his transaction.

647
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:08,350
In other words, tomorrow night, I want to see this guy in our interrogation room.

648
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:12,819
So please, everyone, bring your game faces.

649
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:16,519
During the mission tomorrow, everyone look after your designated areas.

650
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,289
Guard your positions. Don't abandon them.

651
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:23,689
I'm talking about you, Boss Meng.

652
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,429
If you cause any trouble again, I'll shoot you myself.

653
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:28,469
Yes.

654
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,600
Any questions?

655
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,700
No.

656
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,040
Captain, why are we split like this?

657
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,409
You have a problem?

658
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,550
- No.
- Very good.

659
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,320
It's already pretty good, Shaofei. I'm a cleaner.

660
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,390
Yes, I'm a psycho who is heartbroken and drunk.

661
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:51,460
That's perfect! I'm a bartender. I'll mix drinks for you.

662
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,890
- You can drink until your drunk.
- Sure.

663
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,059
Senior, it says here that we need to play a couple.

664
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,200
What do you think we should wear that's good?

665
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,070
Anything's fine. It's a mission.

666
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:06,069
Don't you have any outfits that you particularly like?

667
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,070
Not really.

668
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,009
Then, I'll prepare them.

669
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,910
Thank you, Senior.

670
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,489
Drink. Drink.

671
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:22,390
Happy Birthday.

672
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,859
Won't we stand out too much wearing these outfits?

673
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,370
Stand out? Standing out is good.

674
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,900
If we're too low key here, it would attract people's attention.

675
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,040
All right.

676
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,030
Cosmopolitan.

677
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,379
Senior, isn't that too strong of a drink for you?

678
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,379
It's at least 40 proof. (abv. 40%)

679
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,079
We're already here. Should I order milk instead? I'm just holding it.

680
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,990
I think you're more conspicuous.

681
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,190
Then, give me a Martini.

682
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,790
How's the scene?

683
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,259
Haven't found the target yet.

684
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,530
Haven't found the target? You still busy being love birds?

685
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,799
Be more serious!

686
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,470
Yes.

687
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,469
Senior.

688
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,310
What are you doing?

689
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:13,839
Let's go dance.

690
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,309
We're here to work.

691
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,609
We're playing the role of a couple.

692
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,539
What couple comes here and doesn't dance?

693
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,850
If we're going to act, then act the part.

694
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,049
But I don't really know how to dance.

695
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,479
I'll teach you.

696
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,879
Here, raise your hands.

697
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,521
- Isn't this too much?
- No it's not. Watch.

698
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:29,159
Just move with the music,

699
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,260
then you can see all around this place.

700
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,230
Right?

701
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,359
- Hey, you two!
- What are you doing?

702
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,350
You're too drunk.

703
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,240
He's drinking for real?

704
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,750
Haven't you not come for quite some time?

705
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,850
I've missed you so much.

706
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,720
Do you have to be so sweet?

707
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,850
You don't want to add any sugar?

708
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,169
You found the target?

709
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,630
Not yet.

710
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,840
Let me tell you. I want to know who attacked me.

711
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,649
Want me to work as soon as you see me?

712
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,149
You haven't seen me in such a long time, don't you miss me?

713
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,220
You sure you want me to come more often?

714
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,389
Forget it.

715
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,190
Every time you come here, something happens.

716
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,800
Senior, a slow song.

717
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,370
Can you slow dance once with me?

718
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,120
Let's dance.

719
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,160
It's Tang Yi.

720
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,630
Looks like the rumors floating around the mob are pretty accurate.

721
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,400
What rumors?

722
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,710
That Tang Yi is very popular, has a lot of charisma;

723
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,339
and that in Hsin-Tien Group, he's had a lot of lovers.

724
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,980
And...

725
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,880
And what?

726
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,550
Both guys and girls.

727
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,850
Looks like it's true.

728
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:48,760
That's right, Chen Wenhao met with the broker.

729
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,129
I know.

730
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,960
You know?

731
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,770
Who told you?

732
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,270
Who dares to steal my job?

733
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,870
Laugh?

734
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,610
You're fickle.

735
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,279
Found someone else, right?

736
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,240
Of course not.

737
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,680
Is he better than me?

738
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,349
He's impulsive, stubborn,

739
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:15,649
destructive and immature.

740
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,290
But...

741
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,860
Not bad.

742
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,330
Sounds like you're getting along with him pretty well.

743
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,580
What?

744
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:30,470
Want to abandon me?

745
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:36,330

Come on!

756
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,659
Suddenly so passionate with me. Definitely fishy, okay?

757
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,840
- Something's wrong.
- F***!
