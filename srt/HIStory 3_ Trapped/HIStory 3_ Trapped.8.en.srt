♫ How can I leave you behind? ♫

00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,660
♫ Leave you here alone ♫

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,810

♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,550
♫ You always don't like to say anything ♫

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,640
♫ It gave me a dream with you ♫

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,140
♫ How many times I wanted to confess from the bottom of my heart ♫

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,170
♫ How I lost to sadness and loneliness ♫

♫ As you are waiting ♫

♫ Never wanting to let go ♫

17
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,300
♫ I can't ever be without you ♫

18
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,776
Chen Wenhao.

19
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,211
Chen-san.

20
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,482
I was a little worried, whether Boss Tang would agree to come

21
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,916
and then not show up.

22
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,921
I didn't expect, not only did you keep your word,

23
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,055
and you only brought one little brother with you.

24
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,091
The young are very courageous.

25
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,693
Little Brother, we're just going to have some tea and chat a little.

26
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:12,265
Relax.

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,300
Coming here to have some tea and chat with Chen-san,

28
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,969
why bring so many people with you?

29
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,837
Or should I have been more prepared when it came to Chen-san,

30
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,207
because of what he may be planning for me behind my back?

31
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,593
Young people are so fearless.
(T/N: a new-born calf has no fear of the tiger)

32
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:48,396
Little Brother, when I was your age, I wasn't afraid of anything at all either.

33
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,069
When you join the mob,

34
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,139
people always think relying on loyalty is all that's required.

35
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,109
But loyalty,

36
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,180
was the one thing that locked me up for 24 long years.

37
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,216
What's loyalty?

38
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,119
It's bullshit!

39
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,123
Afterward, I understood.

40
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,425
When you're the mob,

41
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,561
you do whatever you need to do.

42
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,063
No one stands in the way of another's wealth.

43
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,700
This is what loyalty truly means, right?

44
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,838
True. What Chen-san said is very reasonable.

45
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:29,075
The loyalty of this generation is to do whatever you need to do.

46
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,909
Bribing those working for others,

47
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,010
and making them do unforgivable things to their own brothers,

48
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,882
this is a hypocrite.
(T/N: fake noble person, real vile person.)

49
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,684
If word gets out,

50
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,088
I'm afraid many brothers in the circle will feel ashamed.

51
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,757
Who wouldn't avoid such a hypocrite?

52
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,995
Don't you agree, Chen-san?

53
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,222
Boss Tang,

54
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:20,623
after our last meeting, I kept our agreement at heart

55
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:24,561
and made it very clear to my people to not sell drugs to people in Hsin-Tien Group.

56
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:28,998
From then on, not one bag of drugs was passed to the hands of Hsin-Tien Group.

57
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,672
Boss Tang, I'm sure you've felt our sincerity.

58
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:36,810
Of course. Since our last meeting, our Hsin-Tien Group

59
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,477
has not received even one bag of Chen-san's product.

60
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,146
That's right! We have definitely respected and kept our promise.

61
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:44,616
But it's strange,

62
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,485
there are still people spying on us and leaking information to the police.

63
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:52,421
Just last month, three of our boats carrying products were raided.

64
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,562
This led me to suspect that

65
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,265
perhaps we didn't do enough.

66
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:12,612
Chen-san, I think you've misunderstood me.

67
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,648
If Chen-san would like, I can have my people ask around to see

68
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,718
who is trying to embarrass Chen-san.

69
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:23,286
Fine. Then please do so.

70
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:28,862
If you find out, please let them know that Chen Wenhao

71
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:33,329
has always been one to repay kindness with kindness. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

72
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,001
If they dare to provoke me,

73
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,804
then they're clearly looking for a war.

74
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,107
In that case, don't blame me for not being courteous.

75
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,109
No problem, I will for sure pass these words on.

76
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,614
Whatever has been done, the person that did it always knows they did it.

77
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:57,653
Even if others don't say it, they should still always be ready to payback for what they've done.

78
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,528
Then, let me thank Little Brother Tang first.

79
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,236
Me, I have nothing except for one thing: patience.

80
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,339
Since I've had 24 years in jail to cultivate it.

81
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,909
When the nobleman takes revenge, three years is not a long time.

82
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:20,676
If there is a score to settle, no matter how much time passes, I will never forget.

83
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,249
I wonder if Little Brother Tang

84
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,519
is like me in this regard?

85
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,025
Of course, I'm not like you.

86
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:37,196
But when it comes to settling scores, I'm exactly like you.

87
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:41,230
Except, I'm more of a "return a drop of water with a full spring" kind of guy.

88
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,001
Whether it's a debt of gratitude or revenge,

89
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,405
I will repay it tenfold.

90
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,144
Then it goes to say that

91
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,481
great minds think alike.

92
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,955
Little Wang,

93
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,527
- let me introduce you.
- Big Brother Chen.

94
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,362
This is Boss Tang.

95
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,063
Don't be fooled by his young appearance,

96
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,333
he's a hero of his generation.

97
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,402
This person, you should already know.

98
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,939
Just call him Big Brother Wang.

99
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,740
We're all family here.

100
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,375
There'll be many opportunities to cooperate in the future.

101
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,277
Yes, of course.

102
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,746
It's an honor to finally meet Mr. Tang.

103
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:31,751
I never had a chance to meet Mr. Tang. It is finally by fate today,

104
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,587
that I can speak to Mr. Tang for a bit.

105
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:38,554
Little Wang, Hsin-Tien Group is planning to legitimize itself.

106
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:41,961
So, please do your best to help their sister companies.

107
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,261
Yes, of course, I will!

108
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,662
Everything that big Brother Chen has requested, I will give my all to help Boss Tang accomplish it.

109
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,233
Let me report to Boss Tang first.

110
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,268
If you have never cooperated on a government BOT project before,

111
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:53,837
and you aren't clear on all the tiniest details and intricacies involved,

112
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:56,607
then you will lose before you even know you've lost.

113
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:59,677
Also, when the government comes to do their inspection,

114
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,546
they have only one standard process, self-representation, and interpretation.

115
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:05,451
The complexities of these dealings are much too tricky for outsiders.

116
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,687
But luckily our company can provide such a service.

117
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,324
We are professionals.

118
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,825
Here.

119
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,566
Where did they run to?

120
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,033
Guodong, here!

121
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,269
Go look over there.

122
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,975
Hide! Quick!

123
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,390
Listen to me.

124
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,259
If they decide to come back around,

125
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,061
I'll fend them off and you run first.

126
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,630
Why are you trying to be a hero?

127
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,667
We either fight together or we run together.

128
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,301
If not, then...

129
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,770
Then what?

130
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,142
We get beaten together, that's what.

131
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:06,243
I thought you had a good plan for us to get away.

132
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:09,613
How's your wound? It's pretty deep.

133
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,217
I won't die.

134
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,084
It's a souvenir.

135
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,822
This way you'll always remember how much you owe me.

136
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,456
Okay.

137
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,567
Lighter.

138
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,671
Didn't bring one.

139
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,144
Are you kidding me?

140
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,415
Even if we are going to get beaten,

141
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,584
we can't just sit here and wait for them to come and beat us.

142
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,020
We have to think of something.

143
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,356
Of course, we're not waiting for them to come and beat us.

144
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,691
My girlfriend is still waiting for me.

145
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,227
Didn't you just say you were going to fend them off for me and let me run first?

146
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:59,762
And now, thinking about a woman.

147
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,271
We've been together for some years now.

148
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,072
As soon as she graduates, we'll be preparing to get married.

149
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:11,207
I'm telling you now. If you guys have kids, I want to be the godfather.

150
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:13,578
Of course, who else would it be?

151
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,413
Godfather. Red envelope.

152
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:18,650
No problem.

153
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,818
When our ability is more stable, we'll have as much money as we want.

154
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,694
- You said it.
- I said it.

155
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,664
Okay, just for what you said...

156
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,034
Today, I will make sure you walk away alive.

157
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,868
If not, your God Son won't be able to carry your photo at your funeral.

158
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:40,773
Are you ridiculing me?

159
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,842
Tell your son to carry your funeral photo.

160
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,143
I'll have my own son, okay?

161
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,380
Where did they go?

162
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,719
I don't know. Go look over there.

163
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,319
Let's go.

164
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,872
- There.
- Where are you going?

165
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,272
Run, keep running!

166
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,042
Let's see how far you can run!

167
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,784
Punch you into a pig's blood cake!

168
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,956
Come on!

169
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:30,890
Get them!

170
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,860
Still running?!

171
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,760
Beat them!

172
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,173
It wasn't easy for us to get a stable foothold.

173
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,643
If you really get indicted and sent to jail,

174
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,878
we'll have nothing.

175
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,648
We're not as strong as the Shi-Ho Clan yet.

176
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,249
If we don't give them an explanation,

177
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,719
Hsin-Tien Group might as well as be finished.

178
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,720
If you really do end up in jail,

179
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,289
Hsin-Tien Group will definitely be finished.

180
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,426
Wenhao...

181
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,328
I'll go.

182
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,308
The whole set-up was my plan.

183
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,143
I was the one that acted.

184
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,478
It has nothing to do with you.

185
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,484
Tang Guodong, listen to me carefully.

186
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,251
The entire plan and set-up were mine, Chen Wenhao's, alone.

187
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,753
I, Chen Wenhao, was the one who acted,

188
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,555
and it really has nothing to do with you at all.

189
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,858
What are you talking about?

190
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,258
And...

191
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,926
I can take more beatings!

192
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,696
Come on! I'm not afraid of anyone!

193
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,032
Are you an idiot?

194
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,836
One takes responsibility for one's own actions.

195
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,205
I'm not going to let you take the blame alone.

196
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,175
You're the one that's an idiot.

197
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,611
Tang Guodong, you're the head of Hsin-Tien Group.

198
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:03,916
You need to look at the big picture.

199
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,883
If the things that we've fought so many years for disappears,

200
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:07,853
you'd be okay with that?

201
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,056
What can you do on the inside?

202
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,042
Take care of her for me.

203
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,111
You can't let her know.

204
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,990
I promise you.

205
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,297
Do some charity work, get a name for yourself,

206
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:54,834
start a foundation.

207
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,894
Our company also provides a one-stop shop to help you with all of these services.

208
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,773
If Boss Tang has any needs,

209
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,874
please give me a call anytime. Okay?

210
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,176
If I have any need for these, I'll definitely call you.

211
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,212
Thank you!

212
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,980
Chen-san, let's leave it like this for today.

213
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,284
Little Wang, accompany Boss Tang out.

214
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:17,186
Of course. Boss Tang, this way.

215
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,780
Captain said that was when Sister Lizhen was first transferred here,

216
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:45,181
so she went to see Chen Wenhao probably to investigate the case.

217
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,852
But why go with Tang Guodong if it was to investigate the case?

218
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,829
Why Tang Guodong?

219
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:02,233
Sister Lizhen got close to Tang Guodong,

220
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,101
the infiltration failed; must not have been related to Sister Lizhen.

221
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,544
It must have been something…

222
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,864
Sister Lizhen.

223
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,600
Did you really continue to communicate with Tang Guodong?

224
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,570
You were killed with him, why?

225
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,279
Wenhao?

226
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,349
Sister Lizhen and Chen Wenhao were together before?

00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,321
Birth certificate.

228
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,224
Li Lizhen.

229
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,792
Sister Lizhen had a baby?

230
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:42,533
Time: October 21, 1990.

231
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,070
Same day as Tang Yi.

Why do you have that music box?

233
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,412
I have the exact same one.

234
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:58,547
It was the only thing that my birth mother gave to me.

235
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,923
Can't be, could it?

236
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,933
Hello, I'm investigating a case!

237
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:15,067
I can't talk to you right now, bye-bye.

238

Why won't you answer my calls?

is he doing well now?

00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,287
What does he do now?

267
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,557
He's...

268
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,827
quite well.

269
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,430
That's good.

270
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:43,499
Actually, after all of these years, I regret it.

271
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:45,169
I will always remember

272
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,609
the day we went to the hospital to adopt him.

273
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:52,977
My wife was so happy to pick him up from his baby bed,

274
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,714
crying and laughing at the same time while saying,

275
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,916
"Honey... My life is complete now."

276
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,940
Frankly, I didn't want to adopt a child.

277
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,332
But for my wife, I was willing to accept him.

278
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,136
No one expected that just after a few years,

279
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,373
my wife died.

280
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,409
After my wife died,

281
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,470
I didn't sort out my emotions well.

282
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,816
Every time I thought of him,

283
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:35,817
I would think about how my wife and I didn't have our own child.

284
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,056
There's a regret in life.

285
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,292
Which is no matter how hard you try,

286
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:43,695
you can never make up for it.

287
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,720
Just like how his existence

288
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,632
was a reminder to me every day of this regret.

289
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,941
Uncle,

290
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,375
I think Auntie's last few years,

291
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,545
because she had Tang Yi,

292
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,015
she felt her life was complete and happy.

293
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,884
It fulfilled her wishes of becoming a mother.

294
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,922
It was also because you agreed to adopt him, that

295
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:12,830
Auntie's last days passed by happily.

296
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,860
If you had disagreed in the beginning,

297
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,361
then Auntie would have left this world full of regret.

298
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,438
I think for Auntie,

299
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:27,706
whether the child was her own or not wasn't the most important thing.

300
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,146
Uncle,

301
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,282
the regret that you have with Auntie

302
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:40,552
has already been erased.

303
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,058
Shaofei,

304
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,894
you've already disappeared for an entire day.

305
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:53,264
It's okay if you don't take my calls.

306
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:57,832
At least you can send a text to let me know you're safe. Okay?

307
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,778
All set?

308
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,015
My flight is in a few days.

309
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,520
You guys are fighting?

310
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,624
I don't know why but he's disappeared for an entire day.

311
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,361
Doesn't even call

312
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:24,495
or send a text to let me know he's safe.

313
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,833
You're really serious about this guy.

314
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,811
I know you're worried about my identity.

315
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:41,113
I also know you don't want me to walk down an even more difficult path.

316
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,448
But, in love,

317
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,417
when no one is there to walk with you,

318
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,520
that's the most difficult path.

319
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,057
I'm not alone anymore.

320
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:54,793
I know.

321
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:58,329
I used to believe that as long as two people like each other,

322
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:00,231
it could be considered as love.

323
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,735
But actually, you need to find a reason to be together

324
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:06,037
and to know what position to place the other person.

325
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,608
Tang Yi, we are a family.

326
00:25:12,608 --> 00:25:14,513
To know what makes you happy,

327
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,215
there's nothing that could be a better beginning.

328
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,988
You, too.

329
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:25,055
We don't need the fairy tale love story that others believe in.

330
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,458
As long as we can hold the hand of our partner,

331
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,261
that's what happiness is.

332
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,063
All right.

333
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:36,265
Now there are less and less people to protect you.

334
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:38,836
But more and more people want to go against you.

335
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,808
So, your "half-friend"

336
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:45,543
can protect you now. I'll feel safer knowing this.

337
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:48,544
Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself.

338
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,148
Take good care of yourself.

339
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:52,716
Be careful.

340
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,219
Let Daoyi be good to you.

341
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,654
Okay, I will.

342
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:01,424
You must be careful, okay?

343
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,066
- You have to treat me to lunch.
- Fine, what do you want to eat?

344
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,536
Ramen and sushi.

345
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,539
- Hi.
- Hi.

346
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,080
I don't think I can treat you today.

347
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,084
I'm going to go now.

348
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,918
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, I'm sorry!

349
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:29,921
I'll have to let you eat alone again.

350
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,526
My bento?

351
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,327
I'm really sad. We haven't seen each other for so many days,

352
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:40,463
you don't even care about me, only care about your bento.

353
00:26:40,463 --> 00:26:43,799
I know you're doing well. I didn't need to ask.

354
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,038
How do you know?

355
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,518
Because you're the type of person that can do well anywhere.

356
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,843
It's fine if you want to eat it,

357
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,246
tell me where Meng Shaofei is first.

358
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,849
So, it was because Tang Yi asked that you came.

359
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,383
You didn't come to deliver my bento?

360
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,389
Boss didn't ask me, I just wanted to help him.

361
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:05,489
But the bento was something that I carefully prepared for you!

362
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,858
An act of love overflowing the entire box, can't you tell?

363
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:10,662
Didn't think you'd say such mushy things.

364
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,962
An act of love, you're so disgusting.

365
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:15,766
Are you an idiot?

366
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,235
Let me tell you.

367
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,837
Life is too short.

368
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,172
If you don't say what you want to say

369
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,675
and the next second get killed by someone,

370
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,110
you'll regret it forever.

371
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,112
Someone wants to kill you?

372
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,680
You're worried about me?

373
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,281
Why can't I?

374
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,850
I promise you.

375
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,287
That before getting your reply,

376
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:39,022
I will continue to stay alive.

377
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,459
Then, in that case, I won't give you my reply yet.

378
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,896
You really want me to live a long life?

379
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:46,897
Shorty?

380
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,533
No, I don't.

381
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,737
How so?

382
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,608
Not giving me a reply

383
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:57,942
doesn't that mean you want me to continue to live?

384
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,443
Shorty,

385
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,347
actually, you like me. Right?

386
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,049
No way!

387
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,935
Master Chen extends his invitation.

388
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,743
Master Chen, he's here.

389
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,578
Master Chen.

390
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,115
Sit.

391
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,470
I never thought that

392
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,840
Master Chen would invite me here personally.

393
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,676
Able to be the host to someone as talented as you,

394
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,780
what is a little something to show you my sincerity?

395
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,019
For someone as smart and talented as you,

396
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,855
you should have started your own "house" much earlier.

397
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:23,227
I don't understand what Master Chen is referring to.

398
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,967
If we disregard our sworn moral codes

399
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:35,339
and just casually hand over our own people to the police,

400
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:39,310
is someone like this worth following?

401
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,949
Aren't you afraid becoming another Li Zhide?

402
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:56,627
This is Wang Kunchen's everything in Taiwan.

403
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,930
I can give this to you.

404
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:03,534
What do I need to offer Master Chen in return?

405
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,941
No need to touch your knife.

406
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:13,110
Very easy.

407
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,346
I want to know the details of the financial flow of Hsin-Tien Group and Shi Hai,

408
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:19,616
and the names of their business partners.

409
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,919
The more detailed the better.

410
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,701
Master Chen,

411
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,737
sake for me is

412
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,606
not strong enough of a drink.

413
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,448
You bastard.

414
00:30:52,448 --> 00:30:54,318
I admire you.

415
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,489
Someone as smart as you,

416
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,156
to be stuck in such a small place is too much of a pity.

417
00:31:02,156 --> 00:31:05,496
How about if we talk directly about Cambodia?

418
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:17,772
Look at you. Why are you so good at cooking for?

419
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:19,477
Brother Zhao Zi, why are you here?

420
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,945
Didn't you go eat with Brother Jun Wei?

421
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,446
What are you doing?

422
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,251
Is that a bento from your loved one?

423
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,853
A friend made it.

424
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,290
Girlfriend?

425
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,092
If not, then why are you blushing?

426
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,827
What girlfriend?

427
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,730
Don't be embarrassed.

428
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:44,998
Having someone willing to cook for you is a very lucky thing to have.

429
00:31:44,998 --> 00:31:47,437
You're really lucky.

430
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:49,439
You have a girlfriend now?

431
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,408
Captain, it's not what you think.

432
00:31:52,408 --> 00:31:58,146
It's amazing to see that someone with your behavior would be wanted.

433
00:31:58,146 --> 00:32:00,451
What girl is this kindhearted?

434
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,320
How am I as bad as you say I am.

435
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,120
Oh no!

436
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,657
The prosecutor said that Li Zhide is dead.

437
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:10,226
Li Zhide is dead? What happened?

438
00:32:10,226 --> 00:32:11,763
I'm not sure about the details either.

439
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,903
All I know is that the prosecutors are aggressively looking into this case.

440
00:32:14,903 --> 00:32:18,133
These last few days, while you were getting Li Zhide's written statements,

441
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:19,938
did he seem out of the ordinary?

442
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,338
No, no problems whatsoever.

443
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:25,809
He just didn't talk. Good thing we had Brother A-zhi so we could get some answers out of him.

444
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:28,344
A-zhi? A-zhi was there, too?

445
00:32:28,344 --> 00:32:30,613
Yes, he was really hard to crack.

446
00:32:30,613 --> 00:32:33,417
Brother A-zhi told us he could help us.

447
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,486
- Captain!
- Captain!

448
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,592
What happened with Li Zhide, was it you?

449
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,895
I don't know what you're talking about.

450
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:50,031
He died at the prosecutor's. What's his death got to do with me?

451
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,636
I didn't say he was dead.

452
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:55,404
If you didn't do it, how did you know?

453
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,074
And you even knew where he died!

454
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:04,512
Were you scared he was going to give you up, so you killed him to shut him up?

455
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,620
Of course, I was afraid he was going to give me up.

456
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,154
Captain, aren't you afraid?

457
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,629
You did this yourself.

458
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,497
It has nothing to do with me.

459
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,167
You're wrong.

460
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,670
All of these things have to do with you.

461
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,674
You're the one that let A-fei investigate this case,

462
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,374
and then what happened?

463
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:33,444
Li Zhide was brought in.

464
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,313
And forced me to keep him quiet by killing him,

465
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,982
so that he wouldn't give us up.

466
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,918
His death is your fault.

467
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,188
I'm just taking care of the problem you caused.

468
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,699
Four years ago,

469
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,934
you watched everything that happened and kept quiet.

470
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:02,040
Even took money to keep quiet.

471
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,873
These past four years, you always knew that I didn't stop,

472
00:34:04,873 --> 00:34:07,445
but you never once stopped me either.

473
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:13,251
Letting someone under you to illegally sell the drugs that we confiscated.

474
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,453
You say you have nothing to do with this?

475
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,389
You're "the" accomplice!

476
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,194
Why?

477
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,897
Why couldn't you just stop?

478
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,598
And let things end four years ago?

479
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,739
These past four years,

480
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:39,377
I have not had one day of peace.

481
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:43,078
Every day I live in regret, you know?

482
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,583
A-zhi,

483
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,152
it's been four years.

484
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,254
Isn't it enough?

485
00:34:51,254 --> 00:34:53,157
Enough.

486
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,291
The little salary we make as cops is just enough to fill our pockets.

487
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:58,663
Then to have to take care of the debt collectors.

488
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,931
How can this be enough?

489
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,834
Captain,

490
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,905
once you take the money,

491
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:11,509
your hands are stained.

492
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,177
We're on the same boat;

493
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:16,113
there's no difference between us.

494
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,982
Also, your daughter Little Ya can stay alive

495
00:35:20,982 --> 00:35:25,586
and can be happily preparing for her wedding is also because of the money from back then.

496
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:28,025
The money is already spent now.

497
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:31,993
The only thing to do now is to make sure no one can bring up that case again.

498
00:35:31,993 --> 00:35:35,299
Or else, I won't let a single one of them get away with it.

499
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,770
A-zhi,

500
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,306
just stop.

501
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,675
Stop once and for all, okay?

502
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:47,009
Don't make a mistake again and again and sink deeper and deeper.

503
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,919
Captain, don't worry.

504
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,055
I've been very good at keeping this in the dark.

505
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,557
As long as neither one of us talk,

506
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:03,192
after some more time passes, no one will find anything about this case

507
00:36:03,192 --> 00:36:04,595
and all will be behind us.

508
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,295
No worries.

509
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,619
A-de died too suddenly.

510
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,253
We have to find out who did it.

511
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,554
Yes.

512
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:35,156
Also, keep an eye on all Hsin-Tien Group faction leaders' responses.

513
00:36:35,156 --> 00:36:37,861
Stabilize our own people.

514
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:40,922
Since I was the one that handed A-de over to the police,

515
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:43,732
if we don't handle this carefully, things will just get worse.

516
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:45,836
It's not beneficial for Hongye's legitimizing progress.

517
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,538
Understood. I'll go take care of this right now.

518
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,702
If you dare, don't ever call me back!

519
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,803
Don't reply to my messages!

520
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:28,443
Meng Shaofei, where the hell are you?

521
00:37:28,443 --> 00:37:31,248
Why won't you answer my calls?

522
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:38,685
Shaofei, when you hear this message, call me back. Okay?

523
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:48,095
Shaofei, you've already disappeared for an entire day.

524
00:37:48,095 --> 00:37:51,101
It's okay if you don't take my calls.

525
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:55,836
At least you can send a text to let me know you're safe. Okay?

526
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:03,878
Shaofei, I'm really worried about you.

527
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:06,249
I want to know where you are.

528
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:08,718
Have you eaten? Are you cold?

529
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:11,322
Can you call me?

530
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,856
I want to hear your voice so I can be at peace.

531
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:19,964
You called me 59 times

532
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,732
and left 15 voicemails.

533
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:24,969
You were really worried about me?

534
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:29,306
I thought that Officer Meng had evaporated from this world.

535
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,415
Sorry.

536
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:40,718
My phone fell under the car seat

537
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,386
and then it ran out of battery.

538
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,106
I was investigating a case and didn't notice.

539
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,792
Sorry to let you worry for so long.

540
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,995
I'm going to put a tracking device on you next time.

541
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,768
Let me ask you.

542
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,904
I even went to Unit 3.

543
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:03,840
They said you took the day off.

544
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,208
Now you tell me you were investigating a case. What were you actually doing?

545
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,249
What is it?

546
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,990
You need to first answer some of my questions.

547
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,391
I'll answer you after you answer my questions, okay?

548
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:25,829
What exactly is going on with you?

549
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,357
Don't get angry yet.

550
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:56,591
This time, listen to me. It's very important.

551
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,800
What is it?

552
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:12,643
Do you remember the names of your adopted parents?

553
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,383
You agreed just now.

554
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,527
He Ruyu. Li Shouxin.

555
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:38,369
Is this the address of where you lived when you were young?

556
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,440
You're investigating me?

557
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,075
Why are you investigating my past?

558
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:48,144
I didn't investigate you on purpose.

559
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:51,813
At first, I was going after a case and then...

560
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,052
I realized that it may have connections to you.

561
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,620
What case?

562
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,990
What does it have to do with me?

563
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,462
What is it?

564
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,935
Tang Yi,

565
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:13,571
listen to me.

566
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,372
I found–

567
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,142
Hello?

568
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,015
Tang Yi, what is it?

569
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,280
Tang Yi!

570
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,390
Tang Yi! Tang Yi!

571
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,490
Tang Yi!

572
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:44,930
Tang Yi!

573
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,569
Tang Yi!

574
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,437
Can you first tell Daoyi to not act blindly? Let the police handle this matter, okay?

575
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,008
Tang Yi!

576
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:55,614
Hongye!

577
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:58,014
Don't come any closer!

578
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,586
Let her go right now!

579
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,355
You're late.

580
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,775
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

581
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,077
Looks like I walked into your trap.

582
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:30,547
Tang Yi.

583
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,783
I really don't have any interest in going legit with you

584
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,585
and going back to living some kind of normal life.

585
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:37,354
I haven't settled my score with you yet.

586
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,988
How dare you make a move first and to cooperate with Chen Wenhao?

587
00:42:40,988 --> 00:42:42,492
To betray the organization!

588
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,694
Don't talk to me about betrayal!

589
00:42:44,694 --> 00:42:47,597
Brother Hao is an elder of Hsin-Tien Group.

590
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:48,965
If he didn't go to jail back then,

591
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:52,067
you wouldn't even have the chance to sit in the boss' seat today!

592
00:42:52,067 --> 00:42:56,770
Chen Wenhao isn't worthy of being in Hsin-Tien Group.

593
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:57,675
Neither are you.

594
00:42:57,676 --> 00:43:00,375
You're the one that's not worthy, who do you think you are?

595
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,480
As soon as you took Tang Guodong's place, you started legitimizing,

596
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,115
Broke all our means to financial wealth.

597
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:07,448
If it wasn't for A-de who kept stopping me, you'd be dead already!

598
00:43:07,448 --> 00:43:11,052
Now that he's dead, how do we know it wasn't you?

599
00:43:11,052 --> 00:43:12,923
A-de's dead?

600
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,124
Stop acting. He died in police territory.

601
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:19,228
Don't say you didn't help Tang Yi.

602
00:43:19,228 --> 00:43:22,633
You, a police officer colluding with a gang.

603
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,201
The private matter between the two of you that is shameful,

604
00:43:25,201 --> 00:43:26,704
don't think for a second that we don't know.

605
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,984
What are you talking about?

606
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:31,575
What are you doing?

607
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:36,413
Don't be rude to our guests.

608
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,194
I didn't think our friendship would end so quickly.

609
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:08,311
Such a shame, Little Brother Tang.

610
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:11,549
I actually really do admire you.

611
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:14,751
But who told you to be Tang Guodong's son?

612
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:18,255
He stole my girl from me,

613
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,291
killed my child,

614
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,926
he destroyed my family!

615
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,635
There are so many guns here tonight,

616
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,204
it doesn't look like I'll be able to escape today.

617
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,907
But even if I die,

618
00:44:37,907 --> 00:44:39,477
I won't die alone!

619
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,211
Tang Yi!

620
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:45,148
Tang Yi.

621
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:53,756
A dutiful son must pay for a father's debt.

622
00:44:53,756 --> 00:44:57,724
Chen Wenhao, he is your son! You can't kill him!
