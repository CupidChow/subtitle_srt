Brother Zhao Zi, what are you doing here? Why don't you go inside?

24
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,109
Someone's inside.

25
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,444
Who is it?

26
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,679
It's better if you don't go inside.

Why can't I go in?

28

It's Tang Yi.

29
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,650
That's even more reason to go in!

30
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,052
My senses are very keen. It's better if you don't.

31
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:42,788
What do your senses have to do with going inside or not?

32
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,056
Listen to me. Don't go inside.

33
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,258
Brother Zhao Zi, let go.

34
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,561
If Tang Yi does anything to Senior—

35
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,436
Excuse me, sorry to disturb you.

36
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,179
Brother Zhao Zi, don't let Tang Yi in next time.

37
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,016
Please, see how tall he is and how tall I am?

38
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,253
Even in basketball, you can't guard someone like that.

39
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,356
Even if you can't guard, you still have to do it.

Once you get involved with the gang, nothing good will come from it.

41
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,026
Haven't you noticed that since Senior started getting involved with Tang Yi,

42
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:24,363
he's been getting injured more and more?

43
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,598
And his injuries are getting worse and worse.

44
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,300
But if it's something that A-fei wants to do,

45
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,968
no one can stop him.

46

We can't let this continue.

00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,939

After all these years, have you been waiting for this day to come?

55
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,202
Using many of your resources:

56
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,105
touching my people and interfering with my channel.

57
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:52,075
When did Hsin-Tien Group become so interested in the drug business?

If you have something to say, then say it.

I don't like beating around the bush.

If we had a mutual understanding at the start,

61

it would've been much easier talking afterward.

so I replied with Zuo Hongye.

I'm used to using bullets to say hello,

66

but it seems like your Zuo Hongye is fine.

What do you want?

69
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:55,004
I heard that Tang Guodong took you in and personally raised you.

70
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,210
Tang Guodong really appreciated you.

71
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,045
He raised you as if you were his own son

72
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,314
and let you take his last name.

I used to be part of Hsin-Tien Group as well.

Even though I'd left, I still remember a lot of things.

75
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,629
I regarded Tang Guodong as family.

76
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,865
I even served time for him.

77
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,700
The result?

78
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,469
It wasn't long before that he forgot this brother.

79
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,604
Even secretly getting married and having a kid, and then hiding them.

80
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:29,608
He even kept this from me.

81
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,581
If I hadn't served time,

82
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,218
you would be calling me "Uncle" now.

83

Those who show grace towards Hsin-Tien Group,

84
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,990
I will certainly treat them like family.

85
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,025
But those that betray Hsin-Tien Group,

86
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:51,793
no matter who they are, I will make sure they pay for it.

87
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,404
We both come from Hsin-Tien Group.

88
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,940
Of course, we're a family.

I don't want to have Hsin-Tien Group as an enemy,

91
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,052
since this isn't my territory.

92
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,857
To be able to continue to do business, to continue to make money is the most important.

I can forget about Wang Kunchen's situation,

94

Pretend that we didn't know each other until we had a good fight.

You continue to legitimize yourself.

I'll agree to not take any more Hsin-Tien Group's orders,

00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,974
From half to a whole?

165
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,642
Let's go back.

166
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,043
No.

167
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,679
I've been lying long enough.

168
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,770
Let me get some more fresh air.

169
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,691
Having the wound here is kind of a hassle.

170
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,693
Can't even laugh.

171
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,830
At least you're still alive.

172
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,599
A wound will heal.

173
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:25,334
But if a person dies, there's no returning from that.

174
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,307
Are you talking about Tang Guodong?

175
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,920
Everyone's afraid of dying.

176
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,980
But the scariest is not dying yourself,

177
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,020
but those that you cherish die.

178
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:49,258
If you die yourself, you can't feel anything anymore.

179
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,430
But the death of those you cherish...

180
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,766
To those that are left alive

181
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,280
will have to bear the pain of loss

182
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:01,103
and you never know when this type of pain will end.

183
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,014
Meng Shaofei,

184
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,384
I'm very happy that you're still alive.

185
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,793
You've been going against me for four years.

186
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,929
It wasn't until I was outside the surgery room

187
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,198
that I realized I don't want to lose you.

188
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,937
Whether it was four years ago,

189
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:34,806
when Master Tang died

190
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:40,008
and my grief had been diluted because of all the anger you'd caused me.

191
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,646
Or now, your uncontrollable nearness

192
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,887
has made me feel the comfort of someone looking out for me again.

193
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,299
You made my life change.

194
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,502
To the extent that I like this kind of change.

195
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,274
Meng Shaofei,

196
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,511
I hope you can continue to live your life.

197
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,513
Just do it for me.

198
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,900
♫ The right feeling is waiting ♫

199
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:41,100
♫ To meet the right us and then stop ♫

200
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,013
I will live my life.

201
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,450
If you like this type of change,

202
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,119
I will do my best to make you like it even more.

203
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,501
I'm definitely pursuing you, Tang Yi!

204
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,839
Are all you gangsters heartless?

205
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,012
They're all here.

206
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:56,281
Last time during my physical examination,

207
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,782
the doctor said all my organs are intact and overly healthy.

208
00:21:59,782 --> 00:22:04,219
But my captain says you gangsters are all heartless.

209
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:06,692
If I become friends with you...

210
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,261
If I was really heartless,

211
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,263
where did you get this meal from?

212
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,465
That's true.

213
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,634
And I've been treated by you more than once.

214
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:18,704
Fine. Forget it.

215
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,073
You're okay with it, but I'm not.

216
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,342
What's wrong?

217
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,143
In the future, don't believe what anyone says.

218
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,411
Then, what do I believe?

219
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,179
Believe me.

220
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,450
Believe in my eternal life.

221
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,553
What are you talking about?

222
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,955
A-fei, how come it's just you?

223
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:40,091
Where's Tang Yi?

224
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,393
He said he was going to head home first.

225
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,594
I see.

226
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,029
Shorty, I'm going to go, too.

227
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,564
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

228
00:22:47,564 --> 00:22:50,101
You want to eat some breakfast?

229
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,436
Oh, sorry, but there's none left.

230
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,506
That's okay, I'm checking myself out of the hospital.

231
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,273
Checking out?

232
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,810
A-fei, you have a hole in your stomach.

233
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,279
How can you leave the hospital so quickly?

234
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,581
Sorry.

235
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,282
There's still stuff waiting for me to get done. If I'm even slower, I won't be able to catch up.

236
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,552
Catch-Catch what?

237
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,987
Criminals?

238
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:13,825
Don't worry. He's already been tied like a mummy and sent back to Unit 3.

239
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,359
I'm not talking about catching criminals. It's...

240
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,730
I just need to check out of the hospital.

241
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,866
You just can't check out!

242
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,034
If you don't behave, I'm going to call the captain.

243
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,672
- You wouldn't dare.
- Of course, I dare.

244
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,879
Fine.

245
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,446
Forget it.

246
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,450
What do you want?

247
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,251
Drink water.

248
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,687
Then, you can't check out.

249
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,791
I'll help you tidy up your stuff.

250
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,433
I agree.

251
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:33,705
If anything happens to you, I will continue your wish.

252
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,341
Even if I die, I'll still–

253
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,908
We only have one life,

254
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,345
don't waste it.

255
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:44,213
When you're in the mob, you have to understand that you might live today and die tomorrow.

256
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,585
Little Tang,

257
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,287
I really didn't waste my time treating you so well.

258
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,789
Little Tang, not bad.

259
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,899
Also,

260
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,502
if the day comes,

261
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,541
when you're forced to choose between Hsin-Tien Group and yourself,

262
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,409
promise me. Leave Hsin-Tien Group.

263
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,215
I've already made my vows. No matter what happens–

264
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:19,781
All right, don't vow. Vows are for me.

265
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,552
Hsin-Tien Group is something that your uncles and I had created.

266
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:25,824
I have a responsibility to live and die with it, you don't.

267
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:28,025
You're saying right now that I don't have a right?

268
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,093
Because you still have a future, silly boy.

269
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,501
There are so many other beautiful things in life

270
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,503
worth for you to chase after, understand?

271
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,006
Are there?

272
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,974
Of course, there are.

273
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,543
Love.

274
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,809
How old are you? Have you fallen in love yet?

275
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:51,613
If you've never been in love, you don't count as having really lived.

276
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,954
Every one of us has a missing rib on our bodies.

277
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,823
And that missing rib is on someone else's body.

278
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,094
Find someone to fall in love with.

279
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,430
Live a normal and stable life.

280
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,399
It's pretty nice, for real.

281
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,869
Maybe you don't think you need it now or have any expectation of it,

282
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:22,378
but I hope that one day you will understand

283
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,351
that being able to love someone is the happiest

284
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,919
and the luckiest of things.

285
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,193
Then bring them

286
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,461
so that I can see what your rib looks like.

287
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:15,033
If you don't come clean about what happened four years ago, I vow I'll continue to watch your every move.

288
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,302
I told you to get lost, don't you understand?

289
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,273
These four years, my patience with you is at its limit.

290
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,208
Don't challenge my temper.

291
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,877
You're too serious.

292
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,481
You're so methodical and never smile.

293
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,784
Tang Yi!

294
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,804
What are you doing?!

295
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,746
My hair's kind of messy.

296
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:04,482
The chair can move!

297
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,984
You should stay away from that Andy.

298
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,386
The way he looks at you, I just see it as weird. You are a mob boss.

299
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,250
Do you really want to know or are you jealous?

300
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,880
Both.

301
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,530
I said I was going to bring this over for you.

302
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,043
If you like this type of change,

303
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,213
I will do my best to make you like it even more.

304
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,747
I'm definitely pursuing you, Tang Yi!

305
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,530
Are you serious?

306
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,432
Okay, I'll let the captain know.

307
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,334
What do you want to tell me?

308
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:02,107
Captain, Brother Zhao Zi said, Senior keeps wanting to leave the hospital.

309
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,873
So, he was wondering If you could stop by to see him.

310
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,414
Don't you see that I'm busy? Who has time for him?

311
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,815
You're not going to see him?

312
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,784
See what? I already know what he looks like.

313
00:29:13,784 --> 00:29:16,220
If I go see him, will he look different?
(T/N: will he grow into a flower?)

314
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,924
Captain, you clearly care about him.

315
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,495
The day he was shot, you rushed to the hospital and wanted to beat up Tang Yi.

316
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,362
Captain, you can't be like that.

317
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,631
Yes, Captain is Mr. Tough guy.

318
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,533
Captain's hard on the outside but mushy on the inside.

319
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,534
All right, all right. Why so noisy?

320
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:33,103
Pains in the butt!

321
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,740
I'm going to the interrogation room.

322
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,608
- How old is he?
- Captain's embarrassed.

323
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,610
Look at him all embarrassed.

324
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,744
I'm going to the interrogation room.

325
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,412
You idiot.

326
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,516
- I'm going out.
-Bye-bye.

327
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,450
And he's like that towards Zhao Zi, too.

328
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,392
I can finally leave the hospital!

329
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:58,196
Don't move so much! Be careful not to tear the stitches.

330
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,764
You haven't left the hospital yet and will have to check back in.

331
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,065
Why are you cursing me?

332
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,700
Brother Zhao Zi is right.

333
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,603
Senior, you need to be careful.

334
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,405
How about I ask Dr. Jiang to come and persuade you?

335
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,508
No need, please don't ever call that Dr. Jiang again.

336
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:13,209
Every time he comes by, he talks about a bunch of boring medical knowledge.

337
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:15,613
If I hear anymore, I'll be ready to become a doctor.

338
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,720
Should I send it or not?

339
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,250
Will it be read with no reply again?

340
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,527
Doesn't come to see me and won't reply to my messages.

341
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,495
Or did I get shot?
(T/N: means rejected)

342
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,630
Shot? Where were you shot?

343
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,399
- What's wrong with your wound?
- What are you doing? Sexual harassment?

344
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,367
- No, didn't you say something about your wound just now?
- I didn't.

345
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,371
Take my stuff to my place.

346
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:42,207
Why?

347
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,909
You're not going back with us?

348
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,976
You're not thinking about going to see Tang Yi again, are you?

349
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,048
I can't?

350
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,683
Of course, you can't, Senior.

351
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,551
You forgot how you got your wound?

352
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,353
Tang Yi wasn't the one who fired the gun.

353
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,722
But it's all because of him!

354
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,791
Don't have anything to do with him anymore.

355
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,027
We're cops. He's a gangster.

356
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,429
He lives in a different world than ours.

357
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,164
Black and white don't mix together.

358
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:07,364
Do you know this?

359
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,533
Yuqi, don't talk about black and white.

360
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,335
This world is colorful.

361
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:15,269
If you continue to get involved with him, your world will only be red.

362
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,943
I'm telling you! From now on, I forbid you to meet with him.

363
00:31:19,943 --> 00:31:23,178
And forbid you to go find him. And forbid you to even mention this person.

364
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,882
Yuqi...

365
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,724
You're here!

366
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,092
What are you doing here?

367
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,529
You're not welcomed here. Please leave.

368
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,664
I came to give you my reply.

369
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,730
What reply?

370
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,516
Senior,

371
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,860
are you serious?

372
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,889
You like Tang Yi?

373
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,195
I like him.

374
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,664
But he's a gangster. You're a cop.

375
00:32:48,664 --> 00:32:51,668
How can a cop be in a relationship with a gangster?

376
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:55,737
Like is like. It has nothing to do with positions.

377
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,648
Is it because you've been chasing him for four years

378
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:08,383
and then he was kind enough to take you to the hospital a while ago? So, you misunderstood him–

379
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:10,520
Yuqi,

380
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,156
you don't need to make excuses for me.

381
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,392
I like Tang Yi.

382
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,194
It's just that simple.

383
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,862
But–

384
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:22,499
Yuqi, those of us that are Criminal Investigators,

385
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,201
every operation that we go on,

386
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,836
whether we can come back alive or not, we don't even know.

387
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,773
I, Meng Shaofei,

388
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,642
cannot be considering the eternal things.

389
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,946
I want to grasp today.

390
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,894
Senior,

391
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,731
I like you.

392
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:59,004
I've liked you for a long time.

393
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,274
I know.

394
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,950
But I have Tang Yi now.

395
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,953
Yuqi,

396
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,057
you will meet someone that's suitable for you,

397
00:34:22,057 --> 00:34:24,529
someone who also likes you, too.

398
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,703
I know you're worried that I'll be discriminated against, right?

399
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,508
Please, who am I?

400
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,577
I'm Meng Shaofei.

401
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,013
Am I afraid of how others see me?

402
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,760
Your senior is very strong.

403
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,725
You're too unconventional.

404
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,562
Now you've fallen in love with a gangster.

405
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,298
I'm scared you won't have any friends.

406
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,935
How can that be?

407
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,150
I have you guys.

408
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:14,070
Let me go check to see if Brother Zhao Zi is done with the packing.

409
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,823
- Your door isn't locked?
- Nope.

410
00:35:28,823 --> 00:35:30,795
But this one is.

411
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,804
Actually, you don't really need to especially escort me home.

412
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,238
If I don't take you home, what excuse do I have to come to your home?

413
00:35:43,238 --> 00:35:46,411
If you want to come, just tell me directly.

414
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,083
Stinky A-fei.

415
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,985
Wanted me to bring his luggage home.

416
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,321
Turns out he wanted me to do his laundry.

417
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,624
What kind of brother does that?

418
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,026
Don't even need to wash it by hand.

419
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:06,594
Even too lazy to throw it into the washing machine. What's up with that?

420
00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:08,565
If you didn't want to do it, why didn't you reject him?

421
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:09,633
He's injured.

422
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,536
If he hurts his wound again, what then?

423
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:15,236
In times like these, if your brothers, you'll help each other out.

424
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,042
Didn't you notice that you're quite conflicted?

425
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,876
How so?

426
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,578
Brain.

427
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:23,681
You're the one with a problem.

428
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,451
My boss and your colleague are a couple now.

429
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:27,951
You don't seem surprised.

430
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:29,821
I was shocked.

431
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:34,155
What I mean is, they're both males.

432
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,663
Are you looking down on my brother right now?

433
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,297
Let me tell you! No matter who A-fei likes today,

434
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:43,899
even if the whole world is against it, I will still support him.

435
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:47,535
If you look down on him, then you're not my friend.

436
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:52,843
What are you doing?

437
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:57,612
- Shorty, you've attracted me.
- Huh?

438
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,866
What do you want?

439
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,802
I'm hungry.

440
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:20,604
Do you have anything to eat?

441
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:25,006
There are instant noodles downstairs. Go cook them yourself.

442
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,679
Aren't you supporting Meng Shaofei?

443
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,947
I support him,

444
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,383
but I didn't say I support myself.

445
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,951
Since you support him,

446
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,486
then you also have to support me.

447
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,421
After all, you so actively attracted me.

448
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,623
You need to take responsibility.

449
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,159
I'm going to go cook instant noodles.

450
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,865
I'm still not completely sure about my feelings for you.

451
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,434
I haven't accepted yet.

452
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,769
But we can try.

453
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:54,938
What are you saying?

454
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,905
- Am I that ugly?
- Yes.

455
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,108
What did you say downstairs just now? Say it again.

456
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,344
I'm still not completely sure about my feelings for you.

457
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,146
I haven't accepted yet.

458
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:38,381
But we can try.

459
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:41,682
You changed into scum within a second, deceiving my feelings for you.

460
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:44,986
It's because I don't want to deceive you, so I'm telling you clearly first.

461
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:47,390
First? You already kissed me at the hospital today.

462
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,892
The whole world saw.

463
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,096
Now you say you want to try?

464
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:52,729
What? Inspect the goods first before placing your order?

465
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,280
I'm serious about trying with you first.

466
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:01,135
Because I've never cared this much for an outsider.

467
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,748
I like you, that's my business.

468
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:15,149
I want you to like me, that does need me to give more effort.

469
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:19,821
But I know that with my good looks, I'm confident I'll be able to
attract you very soon.

470
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,961
Then, I'll give you a chance right now to seduce me.

471
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:27,964
Don't think that I don't dare.

472
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:30,034
I'm just afraid you won't be able to stand it

473
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,136
Try me.

474
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,060
Let's shower together?

475
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,065
Let's go.

476
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,500
That's it?

477
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,634
Yes, what else?

478
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,469
Why talk so much? Just do it.

479
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,606
That's true.

480
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,420
Let's just do it.

481
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,485
What are you doing?

482
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,619
You took my clothes off just now.

483
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:31,810
Now, it's my turn to take your clothes off.

484
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,527
You're nervous?

485
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:38,595
No.

486
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:40,697
I'm really enjoying this.

487
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:42,233
Really?

488
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,490
Then, I'll continue.

489
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,809
Last one.

490
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,953
Don't worry,

491
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,754
This isn't as serious as it looks.

492
00:43:11,754 --> 00:43:14,658
That quack bandaged it too outrageously.

493
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,264
What are you doing?

494
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,620
♫ Never thought I’d abandon with no regard ♫

495
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,590
♫ I’d care about jealousy  ♫

496
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:46,700
♫ I put you inside my heart ♫

497
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,190
♫ Never thought you’d latch onto every opportunity ♫

498
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:56,880
♫ In every corner always greeting me ♫

499
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,760
♫ I simply dared not to think, also did not know how to express ♫

500
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,790
♫ my true preference ♫

501
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,030
♫ How can I think about that? ♫

502
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:15,100
♫ I simply shouldn’t be thinking of you ♫

503
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:21,420
♫ Avoiding your attention, I can finally breathe ♫

504
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,200
♫ What situation is this, I don’t want to be awake ♫

505
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,710
♫ Lonely (Lonely). Silent (Silent) ♫

506
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:34,640
♫ No longer able to guard the saint principle that is in the way ♫

507
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,240
♫ I just want to not care, not think, love till the end ♫

508
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,200
♫ My entire life is completely wasted away ♫

509
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,810
♫ No need to get hurt ♫

510
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:51,800
♫ We just want to mutually help each other ♫

511
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,290
♫ Steal a bit of savage ♫

512
00:44:54,290 --> 00:45:01,500
♫ One more person to share with, why not? ♫

513
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,120
♫ Don’t mention love ♫

514
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,310
♫ Don’t mention love (It was just assembling some possibility) ♫
