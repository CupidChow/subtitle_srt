00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:08,148
(Episode 7)

3
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:13,818
Hey, kitty! I'm going to eat you up!

4
00:00:20,258 --> 00:00:21,427
Oh, right.

5
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,668
I'm no longer a dog.

6
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:38,546
(This webtoon series will
stop being published.)

7
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:40,778
It's a little embarrassing
to upload a notice.

8
00:00:41,518 --> 00:00:43,318
No one's even waiting to read the next one.

9
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:48,958
I'm craving tteokbokki.

10
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:51,357
One that's made with
really thick rice cakes.

11
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:00,707
Do you want to go and
eat tteokbokki together?

12
00:01:01,168 --> 00:01:02,448
One that's made with rice cakes.

13
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:05,438
Hey, you're amazing.

14
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:08,908
Do you even know how to read minds?

15
00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:13,748
But I guess you don't
know how to tell time.

16
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:19,587
I need to go to work.

17
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:31,998
Thanks...

18
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:34,298
for last night.

00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:52,048
(Sonamu)

20
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:00,998
Hey.

21
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:07,298
The weather is great today.

22
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:12,767
The breeze is very nice.

23
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:20,178
I'll see you then.

24
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:31,386
("We're not the ones who
decide to raise cats.")

25
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:32,687

(Quote by Paul Leyhausen)

27
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:45,308
Are you interested?

28
00:02:45,808 --> 00:02:47,278
(We're hiring.)

29
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:52,177
I don't want your money.

(Sonamu)

31
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:08,627
Hey, why are you going to
stop publishing your webtoon?

32
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:10,226
I'm done publishing "Beodul Love".

33
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:12,427
Why? It means so much to you.

34
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:13,837
I'm also done with Jae Seon.

35
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:14,838
What?

36
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:17,438
Can you set me up on a blind date?

37
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:19,967
Will you stop being so lame?

38
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:22,006
What? This is what people always do.

39
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:24,076
Seeing a different guy is the
best way to get over a guy.

40
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:25,178
No, not that.

41
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:28,318
You told me so many times that
you were done with Jae Seon.

42
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:30,718
I made it clear with him too.

43
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:34,538
I told him that I'm going to stop
following him around like a puppy.

44
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:40,088
I'm sick of liking a guy who's like a cat.

45
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:45,267
You're right.
You should start seeing someone.

46
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,997
A blind date? Okay.
What kind of guy do you want?

47
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:49,468
Someone who's like a dog.

48
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,938
Is that supposed to be a good thing?

49
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,766
Someone who likes no one
else but me like a loyal dog.

50
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:53,807
Someone who only cares about me,

51
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:55,236
follows me around, and always waits for me.

52
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:57,808
From now on, I'm only going to
date guys who are like dogs.

53
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,507
Hey, you're that kind young man.

54
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:25,836
You're here again.

55
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:27,337
Welcome.

56
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:29,407
Have a seat.

57
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:36,118
Hey, you're the guy who came
here with Dae Sung last time.

58
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:39,217
Today, you came alone.
Come here and take a seat.

59
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:50,097
You don't have any money?

60
00:04:54,938 --> 00:04:56,538
Call your family or something.

61
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:00,368
My goodness.

62
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:03,907
My gosh, I thought you
were a decent young man.

63
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:08,447
You look completely normal,
but this is very impolite.

64
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:10,446
I guess he really wanted to eat here.

65
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:11,747
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

66
00:05:11,748 --> 00:05:13,118
Stop.

67
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:16,457
Don't touch anything.
Leave everything as it is.

68
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:21,058
I'll teach him a lesson and turn
him into a decent human being.

69
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:23,428
She's going to make me human?

70
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:25,228
(Devoted Mr. Gogalbi)

71
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:30,537
My gosh, he's so handsome.

72
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,668
My goodness.

73
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,108
Hey, guys. I'm back.

74
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:46,717
Hey, you're...

75
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:54,298
Sorry.

76
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:58,498
Were you also in my high school art club?

77
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:04,938
You seem oddly familiar.

78
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:08,808
- You're here.
- Did you hire a part-timer?

79
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:12,248
Well, I'd love to hire him.

80
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:14,378
But your mom's keeping him here.

81
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:19,086
I'm keeping an eye on him so
he doesn't do anything funny.

82
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,917
Mom, you really know
nothing about marketing.

83
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,638
Look at this place. It's completely packed.

84
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:31,568
He's handsome enough
to be your lucky charm.

85
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:36,767
Well, it's nice to see that we
have a lot of customers today.

86
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:41,076
Gosh, but I never got
to take a break today.

87
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:45,178
Let me sit down for a minute. My goodness.

88
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:49,548
Gosh, I want to get a massage.

89
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:59,228
My gosh, it's okay. We have customers here.

90
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:03,628
Okay, fine. That feels very nice.

91
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:07,438
You're doing great. Yes, that's it.

92
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,738
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Oh, gosh.

93
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:14,206
My goodness, I'm sorry. Let me...

94
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:16,336
- It's okay.
- No, I'll get you a new one.

95
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,608
I'm sorry. Gosh, I should throw this away.

96
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,118
He's a dog.

97
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:30,417
- I guess he really likes it.
- He's a dog.

98
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:32,827
- Our fish is really delicious.
- He's definitely a dog.

99
00:07:34,358 --> 00:07:36,457
- Enjoy.
- Jae Seon.

100
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:39,967
Be honest with me.
Do you like Sol Ah or not?

101
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:41,738
Are you going to ask her out or not?

102
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:45,368
- What?
- Are you going to date her or not?

103
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:53,277
What are you doing?

104
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:55,318
Stop being so vague.

105
00:07:55,748 --> 00:07:57,847
I respected your way of doing things,

106
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:00,418
and Sol Ah told me to stay quiet, so I did.

107
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:03,418
But this is where it ends.

108
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:06,428
It's time to draw a clear line this time.

109
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:09,197
Stop giving Sol Ah hope.

110
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:11,826
I don't intend on giving her hope.

111
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:13,697
Good for you, you punk.

112
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:18,368
I'm going to set her up on a blind date.

113
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:20,308
What?

114
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:22,207
Should I not?

115
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,248
- Do whatever you want.
- You'd better not regret it.

116
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:30,988
Who's the guy?

117
00:08:31,548 --> 00:08:32,747
Hey, Doo Sik.

118
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,388
I'm waiting on top of the stairs.

119
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:38,528
How long do I need to wait
for that guy who's like a dog?

120
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:41,727
I sent him on a cab,
so he'll be right there.

121
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:07,818
Guk Bong.

122
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:09,918
What are you doing here?

123
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:11,457
I'm here on a blind date.

124
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:14,058
You too?

125
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:18,568
Look at you all dressed up.

126
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:22,337
Well, I wish you good luck.

127
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,957
Is this where you're
meeting your blind date?

128
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,138
No way.

129
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:01,808
Did Ko Doo Sik send you here?

130
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:04,408
Then are you the dog...

131
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:07,048
I mean, the part-timer?

132
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:09,178
You work at Devoted Mr. Gogalbi?

133
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:16,117
I haven't been on a blind date in ages.

134
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:21,117
What do you think about me...

135
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:23,227
as your blind date?

136
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:26,428
Blind date, my foot.

137
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:31,568
Forget it. Let's just go get some food.

138
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:33,408
Come on.

139
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:57,528
Stop following me from behind.

140
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:01,668
Where are you going?

141
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:05,298
You told me not to walk behind you.

142
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:08,808
No, I meant let's walk together.

143
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:11,107
My gosh, let's go.

144
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:20,217
Look.

145
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:44,106
Hello, we opened a kimchi stew restaurant.

146
00:11:44,107 --> 00:11:46,246
Participate in the event,
and win a free gift.

147
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,617
- It's being held over there.
- To celebrate our opening,

148
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:50,717
- Let's try that.
- we're holding an event.

149
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:54,486
- Hello.
- Hello.

150
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:57,627
If you guess the correct
cup, you get to win a prize.

151
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:00,333
- Would you like to play the game?
- Yes.

152
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:01,357
Okay then.

153
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,268
This one.

154
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,706
- You're wrong.
- Let me try one more time.

155
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:13,438
- One more time? Okay.
- Yes.

156
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:26,648
This one.

157
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,287
- You're wrong.
- Let me try one last time.

158
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:32,057
- One last time? Okay.
- Yes, it'll be the last time.

159
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:33,227
Okay.

160
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:36,456
- It's my last time.
- It's in here.

161
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:37,597
- Okay.
- Watch carefully.

162
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:46,288
(Play a game with the
swindler, and win a free gift.)

163
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:52,808
This one?

164
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,347
Goodness, I'm sorry.

165
00:12:58,117 --> 00:12:59,587
Goodbye.

166
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:06,888
Would you like to give it a try?

167
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:10,627
- Yes, he wants to play.
- Okay then.

168
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:25,008
Gosh, you got it right! Nice!

169
00:13:26,977 --> 00:13:30,048
Try it again. Try it one more time.

170
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:34,957
(Free gift)

171
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:37,087
One more time.

172
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:40,428
One more time.

173
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:42,658
Gosh, I was really impressed.

174
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:45,827
- What do you want to eat?
- Tteokbokki made with rice cakes.

175
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:48,768
"Tteokbokki"?
There's a place I frequently go to.

176
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,907
Should we eat a spicy one or...

177
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:53,737
No, let's eat the sweet one today.

178
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,438
Hey.

179
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:01,518
Hey, I thought you wanted tteokbokki.

180
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:02,918
Yes, tteokbokki.

181
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:04,586
Let's go eat that.

182
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:07,017
There's a tteokbokki restaurant
right around the corner.

183
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:11,028
They use freshly made rice
cakes, so it's very chewy...

184
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:21,898
Tteokbokki...

185
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:24,467
It's okay. Eat up.

186
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:29,077
Hey, you can't just...

187
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:34,447
You need to put it in front of you first.

188
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:40,347
We can't call this a blind
date, but I had a lot of fun.

189
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:41,818
Thank you.

190
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:45,428
I always used to envy my
friends who had older siblings.

191
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:48,727
I wonder if I could think
of you as my older brother.

192
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,338
Did you get touched by what I said?

193
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,018
You're so not my older brother.

194
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:13,418
Are you going to stop
drawing "Beodul Love"?

195
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:17,758
I want to keep seeing your drawings.

196
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:21,357
I don't know what to draw next.

197
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:23,097
Draw whatever you want.

198
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:28,138
I found out that people don't
always like what I like.

199
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:35,508
And more importantly,
I don't know what I want to draw next.

200
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:38,547
I guess other people
have it all figured out.

201
00:15:38,548 --> 00:15:40,648
I guess they quickly get new ideas.

202
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:43,577
But not me.

203
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:47,217
I guess I'm just not good enough.

204
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:51,788
Try looking for it again.
I'm sure you'll be able to find it.

205
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:53,857
I'm not sure.

206
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:56,697
But when are you leaving?

207
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,268
I'm leaving?

208
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:01,638
You're not?

209
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:05,438
Oh, I see. Are you going to leave
after you save up some money?

210
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:07,408
Why would I leave?

211
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:09,977
I thought your dream is
to become a travel writer.

212
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:11,747
No, it's not.

213
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:14,178
Then what's your dream?

214
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:26,487
(Jae Seon)

215
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:30,797
The person you have reached is unavailable.

216
00:16:30,798 --> 00:16:32,726
(Sonamu)

217
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:35,038
(Call logs, Kim Sol Ah)

218
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:42,206
I'm going to put this in my room.

219
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:44,337
And I'm going to put this one on my desk.

220
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:46,548
Where should I put this?

221
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:50,918
Where were you?

222
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:53,048
On a blind date.

223
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:00,857
Yes. A date. I had a blind date.

224
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:02,528
I called you.

225
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:04,198
Oh, did you?

226
00:17:04,427 --> 00:17:05,626
I didn't know.

227
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:09,997
It's been a while since I had fun
that I couldn't check my phone.

228
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:12,367
We ate sushi and I got this as a present.

229
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,077
Your present is a cat doll?

230
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:17,978
You don't like cats.

231
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,478
Well, anyway,

232
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:26,317
Bang Guk Bong used his amazing
dynamic visual acuity to win...

233
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:27,318
Wait.

234
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:31,728
Your blind date was with Mr. Bang?

235
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,367
Yes.

236
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:41,468
The point is that...

237
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,097
I'm eating and living just fine.

238
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,038
As if nothing's wrong. Everything's fine.

239
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:50,137
I'm going now. Hey, let's go.

240
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:51,508
I have something to say.

241
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:52,647
I don't.

242
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:56,417
I found someone who'll take the cat.

243
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:10,058
Hong Jo?

244
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:11,968
Who?

245
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:13,998
Someone who likes cats.

246
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:18,538
I shouldn't have left him
with you from the start.

247
00:18:18,937 --> 00:18:20,538
Thanks so far.

248
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,437
And sorry.

249
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,907
They'll come for him tomorrow evening.

250
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:28,448
Tomorrow?

251
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:44,228
Will you really send him away?

252
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:49,437
Yes.

253
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:51,468
I should.

254
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:54,268
I was just fostering.

255
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:57,107
I knew I had to send him away.

256
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:03,478
I thought you two got close.

257
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:12,587
Do you know how Hong Jo came to me?

258
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:18,627
There's a complicated history
involved with Jae Seon.

259
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,397
It's for the best.

260
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:23,238
It's all for the better.

261
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:29,238
I should get some cat snacks.

262
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,278
Since he's leaving tomorrow.

263
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:12,988
A person who abandon cats.

264
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,788
A person who won't keep them close.

265
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:22,528
(Devoted Mr. Gogalbi)

266
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,028
A person who took a cat in...

267
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,637
only to send it away.

268
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:31,867
Will you really send him away?

269
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,337
Yes.

270
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,177
I should.

271
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:37,377
I'm not a person.

272
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:41,107
I'm a cat.

273
00:20:55,258 --> 00:20:58,198
Don't you think this cat is beautiful?

274
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:01,127
Did it lose its owner?

275
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,597
Cats don't have owners.

276
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:05,268
What do you mean?

277
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,008
Dogs have owners but cats don't.

278
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:11,177
Cats just choose who
they want to live with.

279
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:14,677
And this cat chose you.

280
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:15,718
Really?

281
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:18,318
Then can I take it home?

282
00:21:23,218 --> 00:21:25,058
It's used to living outdoors.

283
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:26,788
It will come to see you.

284
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:28,758
I want to give it a snack.

285
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,397
Grandma!

286
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,538
What a lie.

287
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,478
Humans make the choice.

288
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,877
Not the cat.

289
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,647
Grandma, you were abandoned too.

290
00:21:48,978 --> 00:21:49,978
Like me.

291
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,958
I'll be abandoned once more.

292
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:58,528
As always, the choice...

293
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:00,887
was the human's.

294
00:22:03,827 --> 00:22:05,228
There's only one option.

295
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:06,998
To become...

296
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,068
a real human.

297
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,077
Kitty, have some anchovies.

298
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,207
How do you become a human?

299
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,208
A human?

300
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:25,288
My grandma once told me a fairy tale.

301
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:49,508
Where can I find mugwort?

302
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:52,278
To become human,

303
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:55,478
do I have to wait until spring?

304
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,018
Hong Jo, I brought you a snack.

305
00:23:07,258 --> 00:23:08,498
Hong Jo!

306
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:11,258
What do you think he ate this time?

307
00:23:12,097 --> 00:23:13,867
Well, I think...

308
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:17,468
I think he ate garlic.

309
00:23:17,768 --> 00:23:20,837
Last time it was milk.
This time it's garlic.

310
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:24,406
You keep feeding your cat weird stuff.

311
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:26,778
Is it so you can see me once more?

312
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,448
What?

313
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,278
I was just kidding. You looked so serious.

314
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:36,558
His symptoms aren't too bad.
I'll give him some medicine.

315
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:39,357
If he still seems unwell,
bring him right back.

316
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:42,427
Play with him when you have the time.

317
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:45,167
He could be causing trouble
just to get your attention.

318
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:49,038
(Vitamin drink)

319
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:54,877
I'm sorry.

320
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:59,377
Oh? Ji Eun?

321
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:03,448
Do you live nearby?

322
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,447
Yes. Do you live in this neighborhood?

323
00:24:07,448 --> 00:24:08,488
Yes.

324
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:12,287
Take one first.

325
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,127
No. You go first.

326
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:15,857
Okay then.

327
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,238
(Buy 1 get 1 free)

328
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:57,867
Oh, it's... It's okay.

329
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:08,377
Thank you.

330
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,448
Bye.

331
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:16,958
See you at work.

332
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,768
I go this way too.

333
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:38,508
You don't have to walk me.

334
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:40,978
I'll go on my own.

335
00:25:41,877 --> 00:25:43,577
Okay. Take care.

336
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:59,867
Why do you keep following me?

337
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,538
I'm just going home.

338
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:07,107
Just because you realized we
went to the same high school,

339
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,978
doesn't mean...

340
00:26:10,907 --> 00:26:12,708
you have to suddenly act so nice.

341
00:26:17,218 --> 00:26:18,387
Was that too much?

342
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:20,718
But I really do go this way.

343
00:26:21,818 --> 00:26:24,087
This won't work. I should overtake her.

344
00:26:33,627 --> 00:26:36,667
Why... You needn't...

345
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:37,837
What...

346
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:41,137
Will you not follow me?

347
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:42,577
Darn it.

348
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:48,077
What does she think I'll do?

349
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:51,677
(Devoted Mr. Gogalbi)

350
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,058
I feel like something just passed by.

351
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:01,228
- Hey, Dad. I'm back.
- Hey, you're back.

352
00:27:04,097 --> 00:27:06,768
Why do you look so down?

353
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:08,937
I think someone at work hates me.

354
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:19,708
My gosh, this is crazy.

355
00:27:25,788 --> 00:27:27,887
Stay still.

356
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:35,228
See? I can't even brush him properly.

357
00:27:36,728 --> 00:27:37,798
I don't deserve him.

358
00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:41,467
I keep you alone all day
because I'm busy with work.

359
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:44,038
And in the evenings,
I'm busy drawing my webtoon.

360
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,667
Plus, I always make you get sick.

361
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:49,877
You should meet someone
who truly cares for you.

362
00:27:50,907 --> 00:27:52,778
I'm too careless with you.

363
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,087
Good boy.

364
00:28:01,518 --> 00:28:03,878
You should look nice and pretty
and make a good impression.

365
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:16,877
I didn't ask for this hairstyle.

366
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,837
I'll be fine as long
as I don't fall asleep.

367
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:25,877
Then I'll stay human.

368
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:40,288
Hong Jo.

369
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,458
Hong Jo.

370
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:46,298
Hong Jo.

371
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:48,998
Hey, have you seen Hong Jo?

372
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:52,768
Did you open the window?

373
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,278
I hope he didn't go outside.

374
00:28:57,808 --> 00:28:59,077
I won't leave.

375
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:01,846
No, not you. I was talking about Hong Jo.

376
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:02,978
I'm not going to leave.

377
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:05,347
I'm going to stay.

378
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:08,147
Here.

379
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,117
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

380
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:13,287
What about your dream to
become a travel writer?

381
00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:14,488
My dream is to become human.

382
00:29:15,698 --> 00:29:16,798
A real human.

383
00:29:22,437 --> 00:29:24,538
I guess you also have
trouble falling asleep.

384
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:26,238
You keep thinking weird things.

385
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:32,548
Milk is the best cure for insomnia.

386
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:46,827
- What are you doing?
- I'm making a shadow.

387
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:50,597
Oh, a dog?

388
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:53,468
That's not how you do it.

389
00:29:57,738 --> 00:30:00,308
This is how you do it.
Stick your fingers together.

390
00:30:02,778 --> 00:30:04,708
Then you do this.

391
00:30:20,627 --> 00:30:22,728
- What about a cat?
- "A cat"?

392
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:25,698
I don't know.

393
00:30:30,768 --> 00:30:33,468
Should I adopt a dog
after I send away the cat?

394
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,228
I'm not going to fall asleep.

395
00:30:54,627 --> 00:30:57,958
(Episode 8 will air shortly.)

396
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:00,444
(Episode 8)

397
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:05,215
Bang Guk Bong.

398
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:09,214
Bang Guk Bong. Are you up?

399
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,025
I'm coming in.

400
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:18,764
Excuse me.

401
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:21,635
Oh.

402
00:31:22,534 --> 00:31:23,705
Gosh.

403
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:25,434
What?

404
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:29,534
Where is he hiding?

405
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,945
I prepared this for his last day.

406
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:36,544
Did you get his things?

407
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:40,485
The cat's things? Not yet.

408
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:51,595
I need something of yours. To come back.

409
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:52,894
What?

410
00:31:53,235 --> 00:31:54,665
I mean...

411
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:58,765
He must be used to you.
Let's give him something of yours.

412
00:31:59,034 --> 00:32:02,534
Oh. Shall we then?

413
00:32:03,974 --> 00:32:05,144
Oh.

414
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:09,774
Why would you put this in there?

415
00:32:11,444 --> 00:32:14,685
What are you playing at?

416
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:16,185
My gosh.

417
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:23,924
Hey! Not this! Are you crazy?

418
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:26,834
My goodness. Darn you.

419
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,134
Must you send him away?

420
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:33,435
What if he comes back?

421
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:35,935
Cats don't come back.

422
00:32:36,435 --> 00:32:38,174
Only dogs do that.

423
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:41,144
What if he does?

424
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:48,784
I'll send him back.

425
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:54,855
I'll be late.

426
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:58,724
Feed Hong Jo the snacks if you see him.
And lock up.

427
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:03,965
Roads are dangerous,

428
00:33:04,004 --> 00:33:06,365
and lots of people don't like cats.
See you.

429
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:18,284
You don't like them too.

430
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:20,883
- Cats.
- A leading food company...

431
00:33:20,884 --> 00:33:23,824
is releasing a pet food brand.

432
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:27,155
The client's a large company.
Who wants the project?

433
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:32,425
Whoever pulls this off will
be seen in a whole new light.

434
00:33:34,794 --> 00:33:36,294
- Ji Eun?
- What?

435
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:39,164
Why would someone else answer?

436
00:33:39,405 --> 00:33:40,474
I mean...

437
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:44,003
Ji Eun does work hard,

438
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:46,744
but she lacks the experience,

439
00:33:46,745 --> 00:33:48,443
and projects like these...

440
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,013
I'd like a fresh approach.

441
00:33:50,014 --> 00:33:51,744
- A fresh approach?
- Ji Eun...

442
00:33:51,745 --> 00:33:53,315
seems a bit overwhelmed.

443
00:33:53,954 --> 00:33:55,715
Someone can accompany her.

444
00:33:56,555 --> 00:33:57,954
Let's see...

445
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:03,025
Ko Doo Sik, Kim Sol Ah.

446
00:34:03,224 --> 00:34:04,264
Yes?

447
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:10,465
What?

448
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:11,835
Oh, yes?

449
00:34:12,865 --> 00:34:15,175
Sol Ah, are you working on "Beodul Love"?

450
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:21,614
I'm envious.

451
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:24,315
You have time for yourself when at work.

452
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:26,345
When does the next episode come up?

453
00:34:27,454 --> 00:34:28,714
I quit that webtoon.

454
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:31,984
My ego was so transparent
that I found it right away.

455
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,324
Too bad.

456
00:34:34,595 --> 00:34:37,723
Don't be too disappointed.
You have great techniques.

457
00:34:37,724 --> 00:34:39,925
Not everyone has to be creative.

458
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:42,034
Some have to take a supporting role.

459
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,134
Quietly and staunchly, behind the scenes.

460
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:45,965
Yes, I guess.

461
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:49,133
The three of you can
come up with a proposal.

462
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:50,974
- Okay, will do.
- Okay.

463
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:56,345
This is good.

464
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:18,434
Sorry for not recognizing you after
drawing together for three years.

465
00:35:18,435 --> 00:35:21,704
Now that I recognize you,
it feels like we're great friends.

466
00:35:24,305 --> 00:35:25,305
Yes.

467
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:29,074
Hey. Anyone can tell
that she's uncomfortable.

468
00:35:33,555 --> 00:35:36,954
When we're alone,
how about we speak freely?

469
00:35:38,324 --> 00:35:39,355
Eun Ji.

470
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:43,523
It's Ji Eun. Ji Eun.

471
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:45,324
I know. It's Eun Ji Eun.

472
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,065
I was confused...

473
00:35:48,495 --> 00:35:49,535
Sorry, Eun Ji Eun.

474
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,274
Ms. Eun?

475
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:04,685
You're really having trouble eating.
Do you need some help?

476
00:36:10,884 --> 00:36:15,324
(Indirect kiss!)

477
00:36:15,795 --> 00:36:16,964
I'll take some more.

478
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,634
- Some soup too.
- Hey, that spoon is dirty.

479
00:36:28,675 --> 00:36:29,704
Is that better?

480
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,944
Just have mine.

481
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:34,213
(You don't have to stop him.)

482
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:35,675
- Really?
- Yes.

483
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:38,884
- Have mine.
- Wait.

484
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:44,555
I need to use the bathroom.

485
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,805
We should've left her to eat her lunchbox.

486
00:36:54,495 --> 00:36:56,455
Why did we bring her here
to make things awkward?

487
00:36:57,535 --> 00:36:58,604
- Hey.
- What?

488
00:36:58,605 --> 00:36:59,805
Of course it's awkward.

489
00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:01,734
She's the one who tattled it to Ms. Park.

490
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:02,935
Imagine how she would feel.

491
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:07,014
No way. Don't jump to conclusions.

492
00:37:07,844 --> 00:37:09,604
You're the one who
should stop overreacting.

493
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:12,864
It's not easy getting over Jae Seon, is it?

494
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:15,254
You look so haggard.

495
00:37:17,355 --> 00:37:18,454
It's not what you think.

496
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,525
I'm sending the cat away too today.

497
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:23,694
I feel much better now.

498
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:27,365
Get over that cat with a dog.

499
00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:29,865
How did the blind date go?

500
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:33,035
Didn't I tell you?

501
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:40,375
Those darn cats ate all the food waste...

502
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:46,384
What's with that face, young man?
Why do you look so depressed?

503
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:49,315
Are you worried about something?

504
00:37:51,084 --> 00:37:53,185
I'm the man you should come
to when you're worried.

505
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:56,454
Back in the days,
my middle name was "worry".

506
00:37:57,795 --> 00:37:59,324
So, tell me what's up.

507
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:06,034
It seems to me like it's not about
some childish dating problem.

508
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,675
She's getting rid of me.

509
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:09,305
It is a dating problem.

510
00:38:09,574 --> 00:38:13,875
Yes, I knew it.
Every time, dating is the problem.

511
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:16,274
Of course she'll get rid of me.

512
00:38:16,745 --> 00:38:18,865
If I think about it,
I haven't done anything for her.

513
00:38:19,084 --> 00:38:20,284
All I did was receive things.

514
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:22,915
Well, it's natural for
people to rely on others.

515
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:25,224
I'm not even a person.

516
00:38:25,225 --> 00:38:27,324
What are you then? Are you a cat?

517
00:38:27,754 --> 00:38:28,795
Yes.

518
00:38:31,324 --> 00:38:32,394
I see.

519
00:38:32,665 --> 00:38:35,234
How can I become a real person?

520
00:38:35,235 --> 00:38:37,333
Even I'm not a proper person either.

521
00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:38,504
Gosh, you.

522
00:38:39,165 --> 00:38:40,904
You should've told me from the beginning.

523
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:44,003
I heard he's Sol Ah's stepbrother.

524
00:38:44,004 --> 00:38:46,343
- What? Is that true?
- Yes.

525
00:38:46,344 --> 00:38:49,343
If he's family with Sol Ah,
he's like family to us too.

526
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:53,244
I know. We can't even order
him around from now on.

527
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:55,185
- I guess so.
- What do we do?

528
00:38:55,514 --> 00:38:57,124
The restaurant is a mess right now.

529
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,954
We need all the help we can get.

530
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:14,604
It's not like money makes a person,

531
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:17,375
but it is necessary for
people to live more properly.

532
00:39:17,644 --> 00:39:19,944
Consider it an advance from your paycheck.

533
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:36,155
- It's made with rice cakes, right?
- Yes, it is.

534
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:38,324
Do you want some fried snacks too?

535
00:39:44,935 --> 00:39:47,074
She didn't say anything like that.

536
00:39:50,505 --> 00:39:51,974
Hong Jo, I'm home.

537
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:56,675
Hong Jo.

538
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:02,915
Hong Jo, where are you?

539
00:40:04,224 --> 00:40:05,785
Hong Jo.

540
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:11,295
Hong Jo.

541
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:13,494
Hong Jo.

542
00:40:18,364 --> 00:40:20,005
Where did he go?

543
00:40:24,744 --> 00:40:25,874
What do I do?

544
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:29,444
Hong Jo.

545
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:31,915
Hong Jo.

546
00:40:35,354 --> 00:40:36,685
Hong Jo.

547
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:39,525
Hong Jo.

548
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:42,854
Hong Jo.

549
00:40:47,635 --> 00:40:49,435
Should I go ask Jae Seon?

550
00:40:56,635 --> 00:40:58,005
I should keep looking for him.

551
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,244
Hong Jo.

552
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:20,364
Hong Jo.

553
00:41:21,265 --> 00:41:22,494
Hong Jo.

554
00:41:33,944 --> 00:41:35,074
What do I do?

555
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:37,545
Hong Jo.

556
00:41:39,244 --> 00:41:40,454
Hong Jo.

557
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:35,474
(Cat Shelter)

558
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:49,854
(Cat Shelter)

559
00:42:53,724 --> 00:42:55,395
Shall I rest in here?

560
00:43:10,374 --> 00:43:11,574
Hong Jo.

561
00:43:12,944 --> 00:43:14,175
Hong Jo.

562
00:43:15,675 --> 00:43:16,744
Hong Jo.

563
00:43:17,744 --> 00:43:19,113
Hong Jo.

564
00:43:19,114 --> 00:43:21,354
- Did you see the dead cat?
- Yes.

565
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:23,515
I feel so sorry for it.

566
00:43:26,155 --> 00:43:27,454
Where is that cat?

567
00:43:30,665 --> 00:43:33,694
I lost my cat.

568
00:43:33,895 --> 00:43:37,035
The security guard buried it
in that empty lot over there.

569
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,175
Hong Jo.

570
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:07,454
Please...

571
00:46:22,694 --> 00:46:24,435
Miss, what are you doing here?

572
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,974
I'm looking for a cat.

573
00:46:28,405 --> 00:46:30,635
I heard a dead cat was buried here.

574
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,145
Oh, that cat?

575
00:46:33,545 --> 00:46:36,874
It got hit by a car, so I buried it here.

576
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:38,744
Was it yours?

577
00:46:41,984 --> 00:46:43,385
I don't think it is.

578
00:46:48,755 --> 00:46:50,425
- Thank you.
- I thought...

579
00:46:51,025 --> 00:46:53,665
you were going to hurt the cat.

580
00:46:54,135 --> 00:46:55,535
Why would someone do that?

581
00:46:56,834 --> 00:46:59,005
Because they're noisy,

582
00:46:59,334 --> 00:47:02,005
dirty, or believed to bring bad luck.

583
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,844
Because they're weaker than humans.

584
00:47:10,885 --> 00:47:13,315
People even abandon their pets.

585
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:15,814
I saw an expensive breed nearby.

586
00:47:15,815 --> 00:47:17,655
It had hurt its leg.

587
00:47:18,055 --> 00:47:20,994
I was waiting to catch
it and look after it.

588
00:47:23,055 --> 00:47:25,525
Abandoned pets?

589
00:47:25,964 --> 00:47:29,234
An abandoned pet cat is as good as dead.

590
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,905
It'll get much colder soon.

591
00:48:11,144 --> 00:48:12,305
Is Sol Ah in?

592
00:48:14,344 --> 00:48:16,475
Why won't she answer her phone?

593
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:20,584
I came for the cat. Can I come in?

594
00:48:24,084 --> 00:48:26,524
The new owner's waiting for it.

595
00:48:26,525 --> 00:48:28,255
The agreed time's already passed.

596
00:48:30,154 --> 00:48:31,863
I'll just take the cat.

597
00:48:31,864 --> 00:48:33,065
You can't take it.

598
00:48:43,134 --> 00:48:45,143
I talked about it with Sol Ah.

599
00:48:45,144 --> 00:48:46,704
The cat's not here...

600
00:48:46,705 --> 00:48:47,745
anymore.

601
00:48:50,015 --> 00:48:51,545
What does that mean?

602
00:48:51,745 --> 00:48:53,114
Cats are like that.

603
00:48:53,614 --> 00:48:55,084
When it's time to leave,

604
00:48:55,854 --> 00:48:57,055
they leave on their own.

605
00:49:00,055 --> 00:49:01,055
Hey.

606
00:49:02,154 --> 00:49:03,195
Wait.

607
00:49:27,414 --> 00:49:29,184
I'll turn into a cat if I sleep.

608
00:49:30,815 --> 00:49:32,255
And I'll be abandoned.

609
00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:43,735
(Sonamu)

610
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:55,015
(Sonamu)

611
00:50:03,015 --> 00:50:04,015
Kim Sol Ah.

612
00:50:07,354 --> 00:50:08,594
What happened?

613
00:50:09,195 --> 00:50:11,565
The new owner waited for a long time.

614
00:50:12,624 --> 00:50:13,664
Sorry.

615
00:50:17,235 --> 00:50:18,604
Did something happen?

616
00:50:21,735 --> 00:50:23,134
I lost it.

617
00:50:25,045 --> 00:50:26,205
Hong Jo.

618
00:50:26,505 --> 00:50:27,644
What?

619
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:29,545
When?

620
00:50:31,144 --> 00:50:32,444
I don't know.

621
00:50:32,445 --> 00:50:35,114
You don't even know when he disappeared?

622
00:50:35,955 --> 00:50:37,984
I didn't see him this morning...

623
00:50:37,985 --> 00:50:39,584
And you didn't care?

624
00:50:40,154 --> 00:50:41,853
He always comes back after...

625
00:50:41,854 --> 00:50:42,854
So what?

626
00:50:43,924 --> 00:50:46,065
So you always left the window open?

627
00:50:46,364 --> 00:50:47,864
I told you to be careful.

628
00:50:48,035 --> 00:50:49,035
Yes.

629
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:52,035
I'm sorry for being careless.

630
00:50:53,265 --> 00:50:54,734
But all this while...

631
00:50:54,735 --> 00:50:56,604
Neglecting it is abandonment too.

632
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:01,374
What?

633
00:51:01,414 --> 00:51:03,015
You abandoned him.

634
00:51:04,745 --> 00:51:06,015
Again.

635
00:51:07,414 --> 00:51:09,584
"Again"?

636
00:51:12,424 --> 00:51:15,295
What are you saying?
Why would I abandon Hong Jo?

637
00:51:18,894 --> 00:51:20,124
Do you think...

638
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,134
I still have feelings for you,

639
00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:29,705
so I got rid of the cat
your ex-girlfriend had?

640
00:51:33,404 --> 00:51:35,245
Do you think that little of me?

641
00:51:35,445 --> 00:51:36,643
It's not that. You...

642
00:51:36,644 --> 00:51:38,114
I didn't abandon Hong Jo.

643
00:51:42,255 --> 00:51:43,315
The one I abandoned...

644
00:51:44,424 --> 00:51:46,525
is you, Jae Seon, not Hong Jo.

645
00:52:13,945 --> 00:52:16,755
I shouldn't have taken in his cat at all.

646
00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:26,324
A cat is a cat.

647
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:28,434
I just can't like...

648
00:52:31,604 --> 00:52:32,735
Hong Jo.

649
00:52:40,844 --> 00:52:42,275
Hong Jo.

650
00:52:43,644 --> 00:52:46,745
You darn cat.

651
00:52:47,285 --> 00:52:48,815
Hong Jo.

652
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:53,384
I can't help it. I am a dog.

653
00:52:54,555 --> 00:52:56,094
A dog that...

654
00:52:56,654 --> 00:52:58,364
fell for a cat.

655
00:53:18,914 --> 00:53:20,815
Tteokbokki and fish-shaped buns?

656
00:53:23,654 --> 00:53:25,324
Thanks anyway.

657
00:53:27,725 --> 00:53:28,854
Let's eat.

658
00:53:35,065 --> 00:53:37,805
If I hadn't gone out to look for Hong Jo,

659
00:53:38,005 --> 00:53:40,035
it wouldn't have gotten so soggy.

660
00:53:40,765 --> 00:53:42,005
You were...

661
00:53:43,874 --> 00:53:46,005
looking for the cat all this time?

662
00:53:46,245 --> 00:53:49,843
Yes. I thought I'd lost him,
but he was sleeping in the closet.

663
00:53:49,844 --> 00:53:51,384
That shameless jerk.

664
00:53:52,545 --> 00:53:53,785
Why did you look for it?

665
00:53:54,344 --> 00:53:55,614
It's not your cat.

666
00:53:58,025 --> 00:53:59,324
There's a saying.

667
00:53:59,884 --> 00:54:02,025
Cats don't have owners.

668
00:54:02,354 --> 00:54:06,164
It's the cat that chooses which
human it wants to be with.

669
00:54:06,265 --> 00:54:08,434
I bet humans came up with that.

670
00:54:08,765 --> 00:54:10,295
To avoid the responsibility.

671
00:54:10,594 --> 00:54:12,805
I guess that's possible.

672
00:54:15,434 --> 00:54:18,144
What would you choose?

673
00:54:24,914 --> 00:54:26,045
I don't know.

674
00:54:30,055 --> 00:54:31,284
(Missing cat)

675
00:54:31,285 --> 00:54:32,555
(It's called Hong Jo.)

676
00:54:37,555 --> 00:54:39,965
(Missing cat)

677
00:54:50,535 --> 00:54:51,644
Hello?

678
00:54:51,975 --> 00:54:54,475
I'm the person who said I'd take the cat.

679
00:54:56,874 --> 00:54:58,644
I'm sorry about earlier.

680
00:54:59,144 --> 00:55:00,814
The cat...

681
00:55:00,815 --> 00:55:05,225
Oh, no. I think it worked out, actually.

682
00:55:05,654 --> 00:55:06,654
Pardon?

683
00:55:06,655 --> 00:55:09,725
I just found out that I'm pregnant.

684
00:55:09,955 --> 00:55:13,065
I'd resorted to having a
pet instead of a child.

685
00:55:13,265 --> 00:55:15,265
We've been trying so hard, you see.

686
00:55:15,735 --> 00:55:17,094
I'm sorry.

687
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,805
I'm sorry.

688
00:55:22,874 --> 00:55:25,574
The doctors had said we were infertile,

689
00:55:25,904 --> 00:55:27,143
but we got pregnant.

690
00:55:27,144 --> 00:55:28,475
I'm sorry.

691
00:55:31,644 --> 00:55:34,444
Don't go. Mom.

692
00:55:34,445 --> 00:55:35,954
Mom, don't go.

693
00:55:35,955 --> 00:55:37,814
- This will be...
- Mom.

694
00:55:37,815 --> 00:55:40,054
- His second time being abandoned.
- Mom, don't go.

695
00:55:40,055 --> 00:55:43,454
- We're really sorry.
- Don't go. Don't go!

696
00:55:43,455 --> 00:55:46,823
Don't go. Don't go.

697
00:55:46,824 --> 00:55:48,134
I'm sorry.

698
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:03,344
Jae Seon.

699
00:56:31,674 --> 00:56:34,475
(I'm sorry.)

700
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:42,985
I found him in the closet.

701
00:56:43,884 --> 00:56:45,785
He was fast asleep.

702
00:56:50,725 --> 00:56:51,795
I'm sorry.

703
00:56:56,565 --> 00:56:59,705
(I'm sorry.)

704
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:05,074
Hand him over.

705
00:57:07,305 --> 00:57:08,475
I'll take him.

706
00:57:13,644 --> 00:57:15,184
Sorry, but you can't have him.

707
00:57:17,914 --> 00:57:19,025
I won't let you.

708
00:57:21,184 --> 00:57:22,795
You can't have him.

709
00:57:23,094 --> 00:57:24,154
Why not?

710
00:57:24,594 --> 00:57:26,765
You don't like cats.

711
00:57:33,735 --> 00:57:34,834
I like...

712
00:57:37,434 --> 00:57:38,505
Hong Jo.

713
00:58:03,664 --> 00:58:06,104
(I'm alone again today.)

714
00:58:17,445 --> 00:58:18,485
(I'm alone again today.)

715
00:58:24,455 --> 00:58:27,485
I think I found something I want to draw.

716
00:59:13,934 --> 00:59:15,475
Who lost their passport?

717
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:18,174
Mr. Bang Guk Bong?

718
00:59:20,874 --> 00:59:22,374
Are you Mr. Bang Guk Bong?

719
00:59:42,765 --> 00:59:45,705
(Meow, the Secret Boy)

720
00:59:45,965 --> 00:59:48,104
Hong Jo likes you too.

721
00:59:48,404 --> 00:59:50,373
Did you just come out of that house?

722
00:59:50,374 --> 00:59:52,774
She liked him for 10 years?

723
00:59:52,775 --> 00:59:55,014
It has been a long time.

724
00:59:55,015 --> 00:59:57,244
There's no room for me to get in between.

725
00:59:57,245 --> 00:59:58,644
Who are you?

726
00:59:58,715 --> 01:00:01,484
I might not be able to
show up in front of you.

727
01:00:01,485 --> 01:00:03,784
You really won't talk about yourself.

728
01:00:03,785 --> 01:00:05,025
I want to be with you.

729
01:00:05,624 --> 01:00:06,985
What can't you say?

730
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:10,124
You put the scarf around a boy's neck?

731
01:00:10,225 --> 01:00:12,025
Hong Jo was wrapped in this scarf?
