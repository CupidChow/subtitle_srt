(Meow, The Secret Boy)

2
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:09,722
My mom was against it, but I begged her.

3
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:12,363
I asked if it wanted to follow me
home, and it did.

4
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:14,492
I also used to be sick when I was young.

5
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:15,562
My dog reminds me of myself.

6
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:17,602
I tried really hard to find the owner,

7
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:19,703
but the owner never showed up.

8
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:21,372
It cried all night.

9
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:22,902
It was so small and black.

10
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:24,872
I used to be a bit depressed.

11
00:00:24,873 --> 00:00:26,003
My dog saved my life.

12
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:27,613
She was born at my house.

13
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:30,613
She was so little and couldn't
open her eyes. She was adorable.

14
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,643
I adopted my dog after I saw his mother.

15
00:00:32,644 --> 00:00:34,482
I was supposed to take care
of it for just a few days.

16
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:35,613
But it grew on me.

17
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:37,113
Her name is Winter.

18
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:38,183
He's four years old.

19
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:40,353
He was wandering in the rain.

20
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:41,923
Her ears were so clean.

21
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:43,192
He was so adorable.

22
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:44,563
She has a big appetite.

23
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:46,022
She's so cute and adorable.

24
00:00:46,023 --> 00:00:47,662
He gets scared easily.

25
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:49,064
She is a puppy-like cat.

26
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:12,983
Give it to me.

27
00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:16,093
I said give it to me.

28
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:18,563
No, not you.

29
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:20,964
Why not?

30
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:22,393
Because you don't like...

31
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:24,164
cats.

32
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:31,903
You're right. I don't like them.

33
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:40,813
You should be grateful.

34
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:45,623
I should just take a shower.

35
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:18,983
I really hate cats.

36
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:27,194
I hate guys who are like cats.

is prose; a cat is a poem.”)

Sol Ah! Sol Ah!

42
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:54,624
Hey, Sol Ah!

43
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:58,094
Sol Ah!

44
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:01,164
Kim Sol Ah!

45
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,094
Sol Ah!

46
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:05,833
Here's your breakfast.

47
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:10,374
I have good news. Guess what it is.

48
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:12,302
I was so excited that I
couldn't even sleep properly.

49
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:13,543
So I just got up...

50
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:14,612
and ran over here.

51
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:16,913
Can you guess? Try and guess what it is.

52
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:18,482
You're curious, aren't you? Make a guess.

53
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:20,512
There are two types of people.

54
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:22,254
People who are like dogs.

55
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:28,654
I don't think I can wait.
I'm just going to tell you.

56
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:30,124
And...

57
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:31,893
Your Beodeul Love is back.

58
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:39,463
And jerks who are like cats.

59
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:48,413
Kim Sol Ah, Jae Seon broke
up with his girlfriend.

60
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:51,344
Your Beodeul Love broke up with...

61
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:53,742
Thanks for the food.

62
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:55,512
Please thank your mom for me.

63
00:03:55,513 --> 00:03:56,983
See you at work. Bye.

64
00:03:58,884 --> 00:04:02,393
Hey, be careful so that you
don't crash into anything.

65
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:07,594
He broke up with his girlfriend?

66
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,333
So what? That's none of my business.

67
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:11,833
Lee Jae Seon?

68
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:13,664
Who is that?

69
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:26,414
Dad, I'll be off now.

70
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:34,193
There's also a cat living at my house.

71
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:39,224
A Persian who's always
sitting by the sunny window.

72
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:41,633
(Cat, Persian)

73
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:50,232
Mr. Kim Soo Pyung, the poet in our family.

74
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:53,243
You never eat unless I make sure you do.

75
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:54,743
There we go.

76
00:04:58,284 --> 00:04:59,344
Here you go.

77
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:05,524
I'm not hungry.

78
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:07,983
Don't forget that you have a
swimming class starting today.

79
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:09,454
I'm not interested.

80
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:12,063
Here. Try this on.

81
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:16,693
Wait. Why is this so...

82
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:24,603
Here. I also got you a trendy swimsuit.

83
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:28,714
All the ladies at the pool will
fall head over heels for you.

84
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,442
I said I'm not interested.

85
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:35,812
You're never interested.

86
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:37,513
Will you just go?

87
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:39,723
You need to work out,
find yourself a hobby,

88
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:41,993
and go outside from time to time.

89
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:44,622
I need to go now. Anyway, make sure you go.

90
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:46,922
I don't care what you do.
Just do something, okay?

91
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:49,363
There's one thing I'm interested in.

92
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:52,764
What is it?

93
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:55,273
What is it that you want to do?

94
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:56,933
Go ahead and do it. What is it?

95
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:04,983
Marriage.

96
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:10,214
What? “Marriage”?

97
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:14,654
Find yourself a new place.

98
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:17,094
Gosh, already?

99
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:19,593
You can't even do anything without me.

100
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:22,464
How will you get by on
your own if I get married?

101
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,334
I was talking about myself.

102
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,104
I want to get married.

103
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:31,904
What?

104
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:34,974
So find a place for yourself.

105
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:37,844
Cats are so hard...

106
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:39,743

(Nalsaem Design)

108
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:51,323
Hye Yeon, did the vice-president
tell us to do this?

109
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:52,964
I don't think this is the right one.

110
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:56,693
Why isn't Kim Sol Ah here yet?

111
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:00,964
Oh, my gosh!

112
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:06,204
Why would you sneak up like that?

113
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:09,044
- You startled me.
- I see.

114
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:11,544
This is for you.

115
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:16,533
(The cafe logo design
draft is due before noon.)

116
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:20,052
The cafe logo design
draft is due before noon.

117
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:21,493
You could've just told me.

118
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:30,633
Cats are everywhere.

119
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:37,274
Here's your morning coffee.

120
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:39,243
- You're here.
- Yes.

121
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:41,112
- Here.
- Thank you.

122
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:43,313
- Take your coffee, everyone.
- Thanks.

123
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:45,813
My son woke me up in
the middle of the night.

124
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:49,112
Who told you to do this?
Don't do stuff like this.

125
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:50,153
Exactly.

126
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:52,322
Your competence is what matters these days.

127
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:53,723
- Did you add an extra shot?
- Yes.

128
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:02,094
Ji Eun.

129
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:06,103
Why don't you join us for coffee?

130
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:08,072
We're all gathered over there. Come on.

131
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:10,133
- It's okay.
- No, come on.

132
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,333
She should just leave her there.
I don't think she wants to join.

133
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,813
She always eats lunch by herself as well.

134
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:18,159
Do you think she brings
something delicious for lunch?

135
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:19,682
I think it's for the better.

136
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:21,653
She eats really slowly.

137
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:24,623
Is she a cow or what?
She chews for so long.

138
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,224
Gosh, you startled me.

139
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:32,994
What?

140
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,833
Hey, wait.

141
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,463
She used connections to work here.

142
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:43,103
What do you mean?

143
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:45,602
Eun Ji Eun got a job here
thanks to the president.

144
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:47,773
Otherwise, why would the
vice-president care so much...

145
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:49,113
about someone who's so unsociable?

146
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:51,072
- Are you guys talking about me?
- Ms. Park.

147
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,113
When you talk behind people's backs,
you should only say good things.

148
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:55,212
And try to learn things from others.

149
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:56,682
- Okay.
- That's the only way you'll grow.

150
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:57,683
Right.

151
00:08:59,183 --> 00:09:02,093
Ms. Park, you look great in that outfit.

152
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:13,702
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
try to be so kind to me...

153
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:15,503
regarding things that
are irrelevant to work.

154
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:38,364
You get nothing back from cats
even if you're kind to them.

155
00:09:42,693 --> 00:09:45,433
I can't believe your dad
wants to get married.

156
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:46,703
Who is the lady?

157
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,373
Probably some lady who got
tons of plastic surgery.

158
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,973
Or someone rich who also
has a strong personality.

159
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:56,274
Or maybe she's a skilled gold-digger.

160
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:58,083
You're being hostile.

161
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,884
What's your problem? Your dad is in love.

162
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,553
And now, it's your turn.

163
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:05,624
I heard Jae Seon is going to start a cafe.

164
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:09,123
Good for him.
Although it has nothing to do with me.

165
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:10,699
Do you know what it's going to be called?

166
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,193
"Sonamu".

167
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:14,124
Kim Sol Ah.

168
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,063
Don't you see the connection?

169
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,634
You're being ridiculous.

170
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:21,244
- Don't you want to meet him?
- No, why would I meet him?

171
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:22,774
Hey, Jae Seon.

172
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:27,173
You do want to meet him.

173
00:10:27,803 --> 00:10:30,544
And you want to die, right?

174
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:32,082
Hey, come on.

175
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,754
You guys knew each other for so long.
Lee Ru Bi?

176
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:38,024
He only dated her for a year,
and they're done for good.

177
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:39,452
They dated for 10 months.

178
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:41,654
My gosh, you even kept count?

179
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:45,763
Jae Seon dated other girls too.

180
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:47,264
Why are you trying to cut ties?

181
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:49,764
By any chance,

182
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:52,063
did something happen between you two?

183
00:11:18,664 --> 00:11:20,494
Why do you always sit behind me like that?

184
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:24,394
Why are you always here?

185
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:26,703
You know why.

186
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:29,573
That's why...

187
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:32,703
you always come join me.

188
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:39,683
How long is this going to last?

189
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:42,484
What do you mean?

190
00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:46,553
We're not exactly sitting
next to each other.

191
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:49,754
But at the same time, we kind of are.

192
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:08,173
What am I...

193
00:12:10,544 --> 00:12:11,544
to you?

194
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:17,914
"What am I to you?"

195
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:20,299
Don't tell me you said
something like that to him.

196
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,453
- I would never.
- I guess you're right.

197
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:25,192
You lack common sense,
but it's not that bad.

198
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:27,193
Hey, what's so bad about that?

199
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:28,993
It's even worse not being able to say that.

200
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:31,403
Then go ahead and say it. There he is.

201
00:12:31,404 --> 00:12:32,463
Hey, Jae Seon.

202
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:35,672
He'll probably stand there with a
straight face trying to look cool.

203
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,572
I bet he'll look at me
with his sparkly eyes...

204
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:38,853
and say this with his low voice.

205
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:40,343
"Long time no see."

206
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:47,144
Long time no see.

207
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:50,384
You said you wanted coffee.

208
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,353
That's his cafe. It opened today.

209
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:59,563
Hey, Sol Ah. Are you leaving?

210
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:01,433
Hey, don't go.

211
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:19,514
I had the same dream again.

212
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:22,453
My first memory.

213
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,583
And in that memory,

214
00:13:33,264 --> 00:13:34,423
I was a human.

215
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:43,803
Why won't you make a sound?

216
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,573
Will I hear something
if I press the button?

217
00:14:00,984 --> 00:14:02,654
Maybe it's not even a memory.

218
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:05,093
Maybe it was just a dream.

219
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,874
Gosh, no.

220
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:23,842
Sol Ah.

221
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:25,342
(Sol Ah)

222
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:26,743
Sonamu.

223
00:14:26,744 --> 00:14:28,812
(Sonamu)

224
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:30,014
They're kind of similar.

225
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:32,783
Sonamu.

226
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:34,284
(Sonamu)

227
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:37,393
Kim Sol Ah.

228
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:40,563
(Kim Sol Ah)

229
00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:45,963
What am I...

230
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:49,374
to you?

231
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:50,973
You want to know...

232
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:53,073
what you are to me?

233
00:14:58,183 --> 00:14:59,244
You're...

234
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:07,024
Kim Sol Ah.

235
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,693
You're Kim Sol Ah.

236
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:24,134
What's with your face?

237
00:15:24,774 --> 00:15:27,004
What? What are you talking about?

238
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:33,984
I didn't expect that from you.

239
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,614
What?

240
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:38,723
Expect what?

241
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:40,754
You're blushing.

242
00:16:06,183 --> 00:16:07,712
Then he never called.

243
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:09,183
He fell for someone rich.

244
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:11,723
I shouldn't go. If I go,

245
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:15,024
then I'm a dog.
Not just a dog but a mad dog.

246
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:26,333
(Sonamu)

247
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:29,473
You're here.

248
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:32,702
I had to come by at least once.

249
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:35,843
We're friends. And I'm the designer.

250
00:16:35,914 --> 00:16:38,072
So, the sign's okay,

251
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:41,442
and the interior might go out
of fashion but it's fresh.

252
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:43,384
I'm done looking. I should go now. Bye.

253
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:45,423
Jae Seon!

254
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,284
Sol Ah's here.

255
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:48,794
Hey.

256
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:57,093
He must be busy.

257
00:16:58,703 --> 00:16:59,864
Let's sit over here.

258
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:07,674
Aren't you proud of him?

259
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:10,444
He set up all this on his
own while you were apart.

260
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:35,734
Drink this and go.

261
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:36,934
Thank you.

262
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:39,173
What? "Go"?

263
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,643
Drink this and then go.

264
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:44,072
That is just harsh.

265
00:17:44,073 --> 00:17:46,713
Why is he so frigid when he shouldn't be?

266
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:49,552
No. He acts all frigid,

267
00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:51,613
but Jae Seon waited for you all along.

268
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:53,152
Oh, really?

269
00:17:53,153 --> 00:17:55,623
Yes. Look at him.

270
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:58,123
He was like that for a while.

271
00:17:58,563 --> 00:18:00,823
Staring out the window.

272
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,633
He's waiting and waiting.

273
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:06,764
He's still...

274
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:09,234
waiting.

275
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:17,913
Who is he waiting for?

276
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:19,343
Wait here.

277
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:22,383
Hey. Who are you waiting for?

278
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:26,424
I doubt he'll come.

279
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:27,524
You mean...

280
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:30,353
That woman Ru Bi?

281
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:32,822
Jae Seon. Is that who you're waiting for?

282
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:33,964
No.

283
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,433
Hey, what's this? A present for her?

284
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:39,764
- I said no.
- As if it's not.

285
00:18:39,803 --> 00:18:41,004
Look at it.

286
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:43,173
It has the initials too.

287
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:45,044
K. Y. Lee.

288
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:51,073
Who's that?

289
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:54,014
My English may be poor,
but I know it's not Ru Bi.

290
00:18:58,284 --> 00:18:59,623
My father.

291
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:04,724
He still won't see you?

292
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:07,694
When did you quit studying law
abroad to learn leather crafting?

293
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:09,633
Hasn't it been 6, 7 years already?

294
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:12,863
It's time he got over it.

295
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:23,913
I'm the pitiful one,
so why is he so pitiful?

296
00:19:26,714 --> 00:19:28,184
A human...

297
00:19:28,454 --> 00:19:30,214
could open the door and leave.

298
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:44,563
Sergei. I told you not to scratch the door.

299
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,073
Do you know how much all the
furniture you ruined cost?

300
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:50,974
Let's go out.

301
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:53,774
If you want to leave that much.

302
00:20:09,994 --> 00:20:13,464
My future in-laws detest cats.

303
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,063
Take it.

304
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,912
(Devoted Mr. Gogalbi)

305
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:36,254
I'm serious.

306
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:38,413
I said no!

307
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:40,652
I can't put a cat in charge of fish.

308
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:42,993
Please, Mom. Just for a few days.

309
00:20:42,994 --> 00:20:44,552
- Why...
- Say yes.

310
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:46,263
It's just for a few days.

311
00:20:46,264 --> 00:20:48,092
A few days? A few days?

312
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:50,632
Let's say we take in
the cat for a few days.

313
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:52,933
Will fur get on my clothes or not?

314
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:55,473
Will fur get in the doenjang
stew we serve or not?

315
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:57,303
Then can we run a business or not?

316
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:00,143
Ma'am.

317
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:06,143
I'll look after it in my room.

318
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:07,613
As if!

319
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:10,454
Do you know how much work that is?

320
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:12,053
It's a no.

321
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:14,383
No. I said no!

322
00:21:28,034 --> 00:21:29,174
(Devoted Mr. Gogalbi)

323
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,684
Where's Jae Seon? Did he leave?

324
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,143
Yes.

325
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:48,853
Are they both dumped by her?

326
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,524
Kim Sol Ah.

327
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:53,093
You take it.

328
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:54,822
Her cat?

329
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:56,933
It's Jae Seon's cat. He bought it for her,

330
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:58,294
and she returned it.

331
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:02,302
Then he should keep it.

332
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:04,273
You know he can't keep it.

333
00:22:04,274 --> 00:22:05,544
Don't you feel bad for him?

334
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:08,613
He won't be able to ask anyone else.

335
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:10,974
There's no one but us.

336
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:13,812
What? You don't feel sorry for him?

337
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:15,613
Oh, forget it.

338
00:22:58,093 --> 00:22:59,393
What is it called?

339
00:23:02,994 --> 00:23:04,063
It doesn't have a name?

340
00:23:04,294 --> 00:23:08,034
Something like Kitty or Meowster?

341
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:10,234
Sergei.

342
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,903
"Sergei"?

343
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:14,704
What kind of name is that?

344
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:19,444
Sergei Rachmaninoff.

345
00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:22,184
What kind of name is that for a cat?

346
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:26,653
Did she name it?

347
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:32,994
Are you crying?

348
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:35,893
I'm not crying.

349
00:23:37,593 --> 00:23:38,934
Look at you.

350
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:42,034
Lee Jae Seon's crying over a woman.

351
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:43,833
It's not over a woman.

352
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,143
Then what is it about?

353
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:49,113
I'm allergic to cats.

354
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:02,424
Hand it over.

355
00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:05,053
Hand it over.

356
00:24:07,294 --> 00:24:09,463
No. Not to you.

357
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:10,663
Why not me?

358
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,034
You don't like...

359
00:24:16,774 --> 00:24:17,903
cats.

360
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:26,813
Yes. I don't like them.

361
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:33,754
He should be thanking me.

362
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:51,133
A human?

363
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:52,903
It's not a dream?

364
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:04,613
If I really turned into a human...

365
00:26:51,553 --> 00:26:52,694
That feels nice.

366
00:27:04,774 --> 00:27:06,544
When did you crawl out?

367
00:27:07,774 --> 00:27:09,694
Don't tell me you already
got used to the place.

368
00:27:10,573 --> 00:27:12,044
You'd better not get comfortable.

369
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:14,284
I'm only going to take care of you...

370
00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:18,353
until I find someone who will adopt you.

371
00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:21,083
So I don't want you to get too comfortable.

372
00:27:27,024 --> 00:27:28,393
Make sure you stay uncomfortable.

373
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:40,744
Hey, get back on the floor.

374
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:47,843
My gosh, are you serious?

375
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:49,883
What's the matter with you?

376
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:51,454
Hey.

377
00:27:52,383 --> 00:27:53,424
Get off the bed.

378
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:56,254
Get off the bed.

379
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:58,694
Will you... Hey! My gosh!

380
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:05,063
This is why I hate cats.

381
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:23,913
(Episode 2 will air shortly.)

382
00:29:39,096 --> 00:29:40,355
Sol Ah, is that you?

383
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,185
Do you know how surprised
I was around dawn?

384
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:19,325
That's odd.

385
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:21,525
I showed him to you last night.

386
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,065
I'm home.

387
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:28,736
Hey.

388
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:30,806
I'm home.

389
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:33,106
Close the door.

390
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:40,516
You don't even look at me.

391
00:31:52,655 --> 00:31:54,426
My gosh.

392
00:31:56,625 --> 00:32:00,065
We shouldn't let just
any beast in the house.

393
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:03,505
And it's okay to let just any person in?

394
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:07,935
I never said I'd let her in this house.

395
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:14,275
Who is it?

396
00:32:14,276 --> 00:32:16,415
Hello. We're here to see the place.

397
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:17,416
What?

398
00:32:17,845 --> 00:32:19,086
Come on up.

399
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:22,486
What...

400
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:26,755
Are you selling the apartment?

401
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,525
I decided to...

402
00:32:29,296 --> 00:32:31,625
move to the countryside with her.

403
00:32:32,766 --> 00:32:34,366
My goodness.

404
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:37,705
How could you make that
decision without talking to me?

405
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:41,375
I thought for a long time
before I made the decision.

406
00:32:41,575 --> 00:32:42,975
- So...
- So why...

407
00:32:42,976 --> 00:32:46,475
did you think about it
yourself when I live here too?

408
00:32:46,476 --> 00:32:48,986
What am I to you, Dad?

409
00:32:49,185 --> 00:32:51,916
I really didn't want to say this.

410
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:54,855
You fell for a gold-digger.

411
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:56,855
You don't know how the world works.

412
00:32:56,856 --> 00:32:59,324
You taught poetry writing
at a culture center.

413
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:02,365
Are you trying to lose what
little you have to your name?

414
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:03,865
- Kim Sol Ah.
- I take back saying...

415
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:06,695
you can do anything you want.
Don't get married.

416
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:09,135
You'll sell the apartment
to make a fresh start?

417
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:11,935
I'm sorry, but you can't do it.

418
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:14,276
Because I won't leave this apartment.

419
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,645
I got kicked out and ended up with...

420
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:19,616
someone who's about to get kicked out.

421
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:52,075
You're an adult, not a kid.
Smile and give your blessing.

422
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:57,384
I'm angry with how he's doing
it, not what he's doing.

423
00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:59,254
He couldn't bring himself to tell you.

424
00:33:59,255 --> 00:34:00,684
He was considerate so
you wouldn't get hurt.

425
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:03,184
Oh, really? He kept his mouth shut,

426
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:05,125
then gave me an ultimatum.
Is that considerate?

427
00:34:05,286 --> 00:34:06,395
Yes.

428
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:10,065
The color of the cafe logo.

429
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:12,835
Change it from hot pink to indian pink.

430
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:15,064
My gosh, Ko Doo Sik.

431
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:18,406
Someone's so considerate to you as well.

432
00:34:23,676 --> 00:34:24,846
Ji Eun.

433
00:34:25,645 --> 00:34:26,846
Do you dislike me?

434
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,375
What?

435
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:30,585
How much must you dislike me
to not want to talk to me?

436
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:34,955
I thought my breath smelled bad,
so I had my teeth scaled last week.

437
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,985
I gargled with mouthwash for hours.

438
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:38,796
- Hey.
- Leave me alone.

439
00:34:39,156 --> 00:34:41,426
I had a lot of messages to relay.

440
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:43,195
In case I got mixed up...

441
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:45,995
What's wrong with hot pink?

442
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,466
Is it because you know I like hot pink?

443
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:50,235
It is, isn't it?

444
00:34:50,236 --> 00:34:53,275
You dislike hot pink because
you dislike me, don't you?

445
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:54,906
No, it's...

446
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,806
I asked her to change it.
Why? Is there a problem?

447
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:00,375
Then shall we change it?

448
00:35:11,955 --> 00:35:13,096
Indian pink?

449
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:15,624
I really don't understand
why people like...

450
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:16,926
this whitish color.

451
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:18,526
Look at this hot pink color.

452
00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:20,735
It's nice and dark, and everyone likes it.

453
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:22,434
There's no reason to think about it.
It's a given.

454
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:23,704
Flirting? No need.

455
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,165
Playing hard to get? No way.

456
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,505
I like you for sure!

457
00:35:31,306 --> 00:35:32,875
This color is talking to me.

458
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:35,216
"Do you like me?"

459
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:38,116
"Do you like me?"

460
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:40,885
"Do you like me?"

461
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:43,325
I do.

462
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:20,556
Who wants to raise a cat?

463
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:25,666
My son is only three months old now.

464
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,265
Cats shed too much fur.

465
00:36:28,966 --> 00:36:31,806
Kittens are cute,
but I'm not fond of grown-up cats.

466
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:34,135
Why don't you just raise it?

467
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:35,704
I don't like cats.

468
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:37,106
Why do you not like them?

469
00:36:39,346 --> 00:36:41,815
Well, they don't come to me
when I call them like dogs...

470
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:43,285
and just do as they please.

471
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:46,315
Still, isn't it cute when
they come near you sneakily?

472
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:49,884
They purr lovingly next
to you at one point...

473
00:36:49,885 --> 00:36:52,496
but suddenly disappear
as if nothing happened.

474
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,156
I really can't trust them.

475
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:59,235
There are many stray cats,
but there aren't many stray dogs.

476
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:00,496
Why do you think that is?

477
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:16,415
They're too wary...

478
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,444
and spying on people
secretly annoys me too.

479
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,005
- That's because they're cautious.
- No, they're too suspicious.

480
00:37:43,676 --> 00:37:46,474
They consider people as
servants who do their chores.

481
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:48,985
No, was it a can opener that
opens their food for them?

482
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:04,666
I've heard of dogs saving people,

483
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,865
but cats can never become
animals that protect someone.

484
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:14,305
They're merely selfish traitors
that only think of survival...

485
00:38:14,306 --> 00:38:15,845
at a critical moment.

486
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,975
Wait, sir. Isn't this the
man who lives in unit 605?

487
00:38:55,176 --> 00:38:57,746
What happened? Did you call an ambulance?

488
00:39:07,756 --> 00:39:09,465
- Who is the guardian?
- Oh, here...

489
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:14,896
- He was here just now.
- We'll have to go for now.

490
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:18,865
(119 Emergency Services)

491
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:36,855
You know so much about cats.

492
00:39:37,185 --> 00:39:38,556
Doesn't that mean you like them?

493
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,656
- Let's go.
- Hello?

494
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:45,296
The hospital?

495
00:39:55,006 --> 00:39:57,646
- Where is Mr. Kim Soo Pyung?
- Over there.

496
00:40:20,036 --> 00:40:22,536
What happened? I heard you fainted.

497
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:25,065
What about work?

498
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,906
- You didn't have to come.
- Who else would...

499
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:06,815
Sol Ah.

500
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:13,556
What an unexpected coincidence.

501
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:15,455
It's so poetic.

502
00:41:16,585 --> 00:41:17,626
It's nice to see you.

503
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:19,426
I met your dad...

504
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:21,926
at the culture center
while learning poetry.

505
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:28,865
My name is Bang Sil.

506
00:41:30,536 --> 00:41:33,536
"I am a thread. and you are a needle."

507
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:37,046
"I shall enter your narrow door."

508
00:41:38,945 --> 00:41:40,614
It's my favorite poem I wrote.

509
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:43,185
Your dad criticized it harshly...

510
00:41:43,445 --> 00:41:45,286
but he eventually became my needle.

511
00:41:45,955 --> 00:41:47,855
- Right, Mr. Kim?
- Yes.

512
00:41:52,796 --> 00:41:53,995
Patient Kim Soo Pyung?

513
00:41:53,996 --> 00:41:55,025
- Yes.
- Yes.

514
00:41:55,026 --> 00:41:56,325
I have your test results.

515
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:59,065
Is it because of arrhythmia?
Bradyarrhythmia?

516
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:00,964
Oh, yes. You're right.

517
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:04,165
It's dangerous if it's bad
enough to make him faint,

518
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:05,234
so...

519
00:42:05,235 --> 00:42:08,506
You want to recommend
using a cardiac pacemaker?

520
00:42:09,105 --> 00:42:12,006
But he doesn't want to attach
a machine on his chest.

521
00:42:12,676 --> 00:42:15,115
I told you. You should listen to me.

522
00:42:16,215 --> 00:42:18,844
You should be admitted
for some more tests...

523
00:42:18,845 --> 00:42:20,385
and get ready for the procedure tomorrow.

524
00:42:20,386 --> 00:42:22,585
- Okay.
- Wait. What is going on?

525
00:42:23,156 --> 00:42:24,725
Why is my dad's heart...

526
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:26,526
Attach what on his chest?

527
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:29,796
Don't worry, Sol Ah.
It's a very simple procedure.

528
00:42:30,065 --> 00:42:31,526
- Right, sir?
- Yes.

529
00:42:32,225 --> 00:42:33,266
Well, then.

530
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,806
I told you, Mr. Kim. You heard him, right?

531
00:42:39,876 --> 00:42:40,935
Right?

532
00:42:45,276 --> 00:42:46,845
But who brought me to the hospital?

533
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:50,516
I heard the security guard
called the ambulance.

534
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:56,026
I have no memory of
coming outside the house.

535
00:42:59,926 --> 00:43:01,256
When did I come out?

536
00:43:02,056 --> 00:43:05,026
I only remember a cat.

537
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:08,896
Goodness.

538
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:03,455
What...

539
00:45:10,256 --> 00:45:11,355
Are you all right?

540
00:45:11,556 --> 00:45:12,825
Shall we meet up?

541
00:45:13,095 --> 00:45:14,455
I'm fine.

542
00:45:18,695 --> 00:45:20,095
Can you manage being alone?

543
00:45:20,396 --> 00:45:21,964
Shall I send Jae Seon over?

544
00:45:21,965 --> 00:45:25,905
(Shall I send Jae Seon over?)

545
00:45:26,236 --> 00:45:27,875
Don't you dare.

546
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:58,726
Lee Jae Seon?

547
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:01,565
Don't look at my face. It's a mess.

548
00:47:04,036 --> 00:47:07,175
I'm okay. Dad will be fine too.

549
00:47:08,605 --> 00:47:10,776
Tonight, his girlfriend will stay with...

550
00:47:12,276 --> 00:47:14,615
I mean, my dad's fiancee.

551
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,246
They're moving to the
countryside for my dad's health.

552
00:47:18,716 --> 00:47:20,686
She's called Bang Sil.

553
00:47:21,056 --> 00:47:23,026
She's so smiley.

554
00:47:24,155 --> 00:47:27,595
Dad looked like he'd lost a
few screws and grinned too.

555
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:32,565
Why am I telling you this?

556
00:47:34,696 --> 00:47:36,405
Anyway, I'm okay.

557
00:47:37,665 --> 00:47:38,835
You can go.

558
00:47:44,246 --> 00:47:46,105
You're just like him. You're a cat.

559
00:47:50,216 --> 00:47:52,446
Cats all disappear whenever they want to.

560
00:47:53,516 --> 00:47:54,815
Without a word.

561
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:59,056
I mean, they think
they're being considerate.

562
00:47:59,756 --> 00:48:01,894
In case I'll worry that he's sick?

563
00:48:01,895 --> 00:48:03,196
That I'll say he's a burden?

564
00:48:04,595 --> 00:48:06,266
If I'd never found out,

565
00:48:06,436 --> 00:48:08,516
I'd have gotten kicked out
without knowing anything.

566
00:48:11,036 --> 00:48:13,506
I'd have gotten angry with
Dad and yelled at him.

567
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:16,976
When he's sick.

568
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,786
His heart beats slower than
average and I didn't know.

569
00:48:28,056 --> 00:48:31,456
I'm so darn grateful that he's considerate.

570
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:37,125
This is why I dislike cats.

571
00:48:37,696 --> 00:48:39,664
You disappeared when you wanted to,

572
00:48:39,665 --> 00:48:41,966
and now you're back trying to comfort me.

573
00:48:44,165 --> 00:48:45,736
It's fine, so get lost.

574
00:48:50,605 --> 00:48:51,875
Go.

575
00:48:58,286 --> 00:48:59,786
I told you to go.

576
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:04,925
He really came back.

577
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:08,296
My Beodeul Love.

578
00:49:34,716 --> 00:49:36,986
You won't go when I tell you to.

579
00:49:39,325 --> 00:49:41,496
You never came to me when I waited for you.

580
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:50,266
Did you have...

581
00:49:52,506 --> 00:49:55,675
a reason you couldn't share as my dad has?

582
00:50:00,315 --> 00:50:02,875
Darn. I'm talking to myself again.

583
00:50:06,286 --> 00:50:07,915
Say something.

584
00:50:18,296 --> 00:50:19,796
(Jae Seon)

585
00:50:20,095 --> 00:50:21,135
Lee Jae Seon?

586
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:42,885
Hey, Jae Seon. Where are you?

587
00:50:44,425 --> 00:50:46,085
Why are you there?

588
00:50:47,296 --> 00:50:49,026
Just a while ago, you were...

589
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:54,165
right here.

590
00:50:54,496 --> 00:50:56,265
I was in my workshop all day.

591
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:57,966
Then you didn't hear anything I said...

592
00:51:00,536 --> 00:51:02,506
Who was I talking to?

593
00:51:07,175 --> 00:51:09,245
Kim Sol Ah. Are you there?

594
00:51:09,246 --> 00:51:11,245
Yes. I'm here.

595
00:51:11,246 --> 00:51:12,315
Where's Sergei?

596
00:51:13,516 --> 00:51:14,785
Next to me.

597
00:51:14,786 --> 00:51:16,216
Are you sure he's okay?

598
00:51:17,056 --> 00:51:19,186
He's right here, but...

599
00:51:21,256 --> 00:51:22,726
Why is he here?

600
00:51:27,236 --> 00:51:28,565
This won't work.

601
00:51:29,496 --> 00:51:31,306
You can't keep Sergei.

602
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:34,506
Gosh. You do feel bad then?

603
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:36,236
You should be.

604
00:51:36,506 --> 00:51:40,246
You should feel bad that I'm
caring for that woman's cat.

605
00:51:40,516 --> 00:51:41,946
That's not the reason.

606
00:51:42,446 --> 00:51:44,345
I'm uncomfortable leaving him with you.

607
00:51:44,446 --> 00:51:45,815
What do you mean?

608
00:51:47,186 --> 00:51:50,824
Are you more worried about her cat than me?

609
00:51:50,825 --> 00:51:52,486
Is your door locked at all times?

610
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:55,595
Cats can disappear in a split second.

611
00:51:55,996 --> 00:51:58,565
- Well...
- You might never find him again.

612
00:52:00,065 --> 00:52:03,966
If you're that concerned,
find someone to adopt him.

613
00:52:04,436 --> 00:52:06,835
I am looking, and I'll find
someone as soon as possible.

614
00:52:08,006 --> 00:52:09,575
Don't abandon him this time.

615
00:52:11,206 --> 00:52:12,245
I beg of you.

616
00:52:12,246 --> 00:52:13,446
What?

617
00:52:17,615 --> 00:52:19,186
What did he mean?

618
00:52:19,986 --> 00:52:21,556
Who will abandon him?

619
00:52:23,925 --> 00:52:26,756
I should be the one to say that.

620
00:52:56,726 --> 00:52:57,855
Hey, cat.

621
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:00,855
Did you see the person next to me?

622
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,996
How are you out here?

623
00:53:09,696 --> 00:53:12,905
Can you not talk? Answer me.

624
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:17,845
Why won't you make a sound?

625
00:53:19,145 --> 00:53:21,075
Will you make a sound if I press you here?

626
00:53:24,415 --> 00:53:25,516
Beep.

627
00:53:27,355 --> 00:53:30,686
Kid. What are you doing here?

628
00:53:31,056 --> 00:53:34,226
Where's your mom? Are you lost?

629
00:53:35,696 --> 00:53:37,395
You must feel so cold.

630
00:53:38,526 --> 00:53:39,565
Here.

631
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:47,306
There. Do you feel better?

632
00:53:48,536 --> 00:53:51,845
What's your name? How old are you?

633
00:53:53,615 --> 00:53:55,645
Why won't you make a sound?

634
00:53:57,716 --> 00:53:59,546
Will I hear something
if I press the button?

635
00:54:04,526 --> 00:54:05,526
Beep.

636
00:54:12,395 --> 00:54:13,535
Hello.

637
00:54:13,536 --> 00:54:15,796
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

638
00:54:16,196 --> 00:54:17,604
I'll find your mom. Come with me.

639
00:54:17,605 --> 00:54:20,135
It's cold, so let's go to my place first.

640
00:54:25,105 --> 00:54:26,776
Wait here for a moment.

641
00:54:34,686 --> 00:54:36,085
Yes, hello?

642
00:54:55,776 --> 00:54:56,776
Kid.

643
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:03,786
Kid.

644
00:55:05,016 --> 00:55:06,115
Kid.

645
00:55:36,986 --> 00:55:39,885
Hey. I told you not to get too comfortable.

646
00:55:44,085 --> 00:55:46,085
We can't stay here anymore.

647
00:55:47,155 --> 00:55:48,256
We must leave.

648
00:55:54,736 --> 00:55:55,736
But still,

649
00:55:57,105 --> 00:55:59,545
I don't feel lonely now that
I'm getting kicked out with you.

650
00:56:18,556 --> 00:56:19,855
You're doing this again.

651
00:56:23,026 --> 00:56:24,825
Sleep down there.

652
00:56:31,536 --> 00:56:34,476
Will you stop coming up here?

653
00:56:43,385 --> 00:56:44,516
It's her.

654
00:56:47,716 --> 00:56:50,986
She makes me turn human.

655
00:57:47,815 --> 00:57:50,915
(Meow, the Secret Boy)

656
00:57:52,746 --> 00:57:54,016
He'll get the wrong idea.

657
00:57:54,855 --> 00:57:56,056
It must be so tough.

658
00:57:56,155 --> 00:57:58,756
You're actually surprisingly clingy.

659
00:57:59,425 --> 00:58:01,325
Will you at least see me off?

660
00:58:05,425 --> 00:58:06,466
Hong Jo.

661
00:58:10,506 --> 00:58:12,165
Did I leave the ladder there?

662
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:13,835
I'll be right down.

663
00:58:18,246 --> 00:58:19,276
Oh, no!
