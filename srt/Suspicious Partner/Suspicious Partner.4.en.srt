1
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:40,780
(Attorney Eun Bong Hee)

2
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,969
(I think Ji Wook found out
I was stalking him.)

3
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,730
I couldn't even date him.

4
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,359
How many times do I have
these breakup-like situations?

5
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,159
(If you keep looking for me,
I'll find you first.)

6
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,230
"If you keep looking for me,
I'll find you first."

7
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,610
Other than for work-related things
or bumping into you unexpectedly,

8
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,050
I'll stay at least 100m away
from you at all times.

9
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,219
I have no feelings
for you whatsoever.

10
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,159
Really. I'm serious.
Please believe me.

11
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,259
Gosh, seriously.
What is she thinking?

12
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:53,710
(Attorney No Ji Wook)

13
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,349
- Mr. No.
- You left...

14
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,719
Someone was in my office.

15
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,090
What?

16
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,919
That guy was in my office.

17
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,620
The real culprit who killed Hee Jun.

18
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,889
Hey, what did you just say?
Who was in your office?

19
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,770
I think...

20
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,400
he might...

21
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,810
still be here.

22
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,479
Hey, Bong Hee.
Don't act rashly now.

23
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,919
I'm going to be there shortly.

24
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,789
So please just be safe.
Hello? Hello?

25
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,159
It's you, isn't it?

26
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,120
Where is he?

27
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
Hey, Bong Hee!

28
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:20,629
Are you all right?

29
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,269
Are you okay? I'm asking if you are
all right.

30
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,639
I missed him right
in front of my eyes.

31
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,040
This is aggravating
and maddening.

32
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,029
(Reunion and Reunion)

33
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,889
It's too late tonight.

34
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:55,399
Should I ask to send
a forensic team or not?

35
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,430
Please do.

36
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:00,040
But you can't be certain
that he was the real culprit.

37
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,439
I'm sure. Maybe.

38
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:05,009
By the way, it's been a long time
since you resigned as a prosecutor.

39
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,579
It's about time you quit acting like
a prosecutor investigating a case.

40
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:11,379
You should quit nagging me,
and just have a good night!

41
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,720
Please!

42
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,720
- Hey.
- Is the forensic team coming?

43
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,560
Hey, what was that?

44
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,329
The culprit's fingerprints might
be here, and you were sitting on it.

45
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,069
- What about the forensic team?
- My gosh, I don't know.

46
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,600
He should know that
criticism is good for himself.

47
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,709
Is he still bothered by that case?

48
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,449
I was looking around my office
like this.

49
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:44,750
But I felt... It's hard to
describe in words.

50
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,490
But I suddenly had goosebumps
all over my body.

51
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:52,089
That's when I knew that either a
person or a ghost must be...

52
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,759
in this office.

53
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,230
Right then, I heard the door close.

54
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,860
So I slowly turned around.

55
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,069
I had left the door open,
but it was closed.

56
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:03,230
I almost fainted,

57
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,370
but I pulled myself together...

58
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,769
and quickly...

59
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,910
chased after him.
For goodness' sake.

60
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:11,410
But that jerk had already hidden
himself among the crowd.

61
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,509
There were so many people
even though it was a late hour,

62
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,319
so I couldn't tell who was whom.
Everyone looked like him.

63
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,889
I was scared that he might
hit me from behind...

64
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,319
or stab me with a knife.

65
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,120
I'm not even joking.

66
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,889
Of course, you're not.

67
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:26,990
Exactly.

68
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:28,889
But it still seems like a joke.

69
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,889
Who do you mean?

70
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,029
You look really excited right now.

71
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,370
- Me?
- Yes.

72
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,569
You don't seem to know what kind of
situation you were in...

73
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,139
or how dangerous it was.

74
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,610
You don't seem to realize that you
could've seriously gotten hurt.

75
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,720
How should I put this?

76
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,079
You're talking as if you're watching
a thriller movie.

77
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,149
You just seem like an agitated kid.

78
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,220
Are you saying this because you're
worried about me?

79
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,259
Of course.

80
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,300
Anyone would be
in this kind of situation.

81
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,839
I'd feel the same way if a stranger
had gone through this kind of thing.

82
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Why?

83
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,339
Because I used to be
a prosecutor who fights crime.

84
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,910
Right.

85
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:20,509
Right?

86
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,579
The culprit's sudden appearance
made me totally forget about...

87
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,290
the promise...

88
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,720
I had made to myself
that I would stop liking this man.

89
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,889
What?

90
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,389
Why are you staring at me like that?

91
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:35,389
Wake up.

92
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,389
What?

93
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,899
It's nothing.
I was talking to myself.

94
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,500
You said I seemed very excited.

95
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,370
Yes, you're right.

96
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,439
It's true.

97
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,410
Isn't it natural?

98
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,740
I got to see the culprit who's
been hiding for the past two years.

99
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,810
It was a chance to
clear my name.

100
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,879
You could've died.

101
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,120
I'll die anyway.

102
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,449
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm already...

103
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,589
this close to dying
because of hunger.

104
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,589
That's different from
getting murdered.

105
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:07,689
What's the difference?

106
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,899
Look at the condition of my office.

107
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,459
I'm on the verge of going bankrupt.

108
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,600
I'm desperate for a job
because I have to earn a living.

109
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,970
But no one wants to hire me.

110
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,670
Why?

111
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,980
Because I'm a murderer who killed
the District Attorney's son.

112
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,810
I've been completely ostracized.

113
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,579
When I opened this law firm, there
was an article with a title saying,

114
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,490
"A Nation-Wide Famous Murderer
Becomes an Attorney".

115
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,320
My mom...

116
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,559
pretends like she's fine
when she's with me.

117
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:42,990
But she cries when I'm not there...

118
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,559
because she's upset about her
daughter being blamed.

119
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,740
So I have to solve this case
not only for myself,

120
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,240
but also for my mom...

121
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,009
and you, who lost a job
because of me.

122
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,779
I'm just saying that I'm really
happy that the culprit showed up.

123
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,120
Okay.

124
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,360
Let's catch the culprit...

125
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,889
- Of course.
- together.

126
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,259
What?

127
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:19,700
Let's catch him together.

128
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,769
Let's go now. Come on.

129
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,669
What? Where... Where are we going?

130
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:30,809
Your home. I'll give you a ride.

131
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,879
This is my home.

132
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,049
Why aren't you coming?

133
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,019
I came because you kept on begging,

134
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,419
but I don't know if I should.

135
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,690
What? When did I beg you?

136
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,860
I told you that I'd keep my distance
from you by at least 100m.

137
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,399
But you said, "I can't leave you
alone in such a dangerous place."

138
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,340
What a load of nonsense.
When did I say that?

139
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,539
You're the one who kept on
insisting and dragged me here.

140
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,870
Don't you think you're
dramatizing it a bit too much?

141
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,809
So I won't take responsibility
for whatever that may happen...

142
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,179
from now on.

143
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,710
What?

144
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,519
Hey. What does that mean?

145
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,690
What does that mean, Bong Hee?

146
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,120
My goodness.

147
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,629
Nothing much has changed.

148
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,129
Was it two and a half years ago?

149
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:28,029
I came here only once,
but I remember everything.

150
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:32,039
I remember this sofa and even
that display cupboard over there.

151
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,110
We were completely
wasted that night, so...

152
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,539
By the way,

153
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,980
don't you think...

154
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:16,850
we have a few things to talk about?

155
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,320
- Yes, we do.
- Right?

156
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,419
We do need to clarify something.

157
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:24,759
We need to get things straight.

158
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,990
- We finally think the same way.
- Yes, finally.

159
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,159
- To be honest, I...
- Did we sleep with each other?

160
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,139
What are you talking about?

161
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:40,370
- Was this not the topic?
- No, of course not.

162
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:42,370
I guess I was mistaken.

163
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,610
I thought this was the only
clarification we needed.

164
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:54,320
Eat some kimchi.

165
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,360
You overslept?

166
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:08,799
My goodness.

167
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,600
You overslept? What's your secret?

168
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,799
You have insomnia.

169
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,710
When someone gets exhausted up to
a level where they can't handle it,

170
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,710
I found out that they end up
getting knocked out.

171
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,779
Why?

172
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,440
What made you so exhausted?

173
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,710
You don't need to know. Don't ask.

174
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,279
Don't even talk to me. Get lost.

175
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,980
Well, anyway,

176
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:28,490
you're probably the only guy who
gets congratulated for being late.

177
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,120
You're also probably the only boss
who would congratulate his worker...

178
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,220
for being late.

179
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,659
Did you just push me?

180
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,429
Hey, I actually came here
to scold you.

181
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:38,629
Is that so?

182
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,799
That's right.
You should know that...

183
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,070
there are a lot of complaints
about you.

184
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,139
The employees don't even want to
run into you.

185
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,399
They think you look down on them.

186
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,440
I guess they're not completely dumb.

187
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,710
- I guess so.
- You can't do this.

188
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,710
You need to socialize with people.

189
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,450
And you sometimes need to take
the cases that you don't like.

190
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,350
- Okay.
- You'll get fired at this rate.

191
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,879
- Okay.
- I'm sitting on pins and needles...

192
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,120
- because I actually recruited you.
- Okay.

193
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:03,889
You're not...

194
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:05,860
- listening to me, are you?
- No.

195
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,590
My goodness. You little punk.

196
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,059
My gosh.

197
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,129
When did you start looking
at me, Bong Hee?

198
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,539
Mr. No, you're late.

199
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,909
The sun will be up and high soon.

200
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,490
You're late for work.

201
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,860
You need to wake up.

202
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,029
I'm so embarrassed.

203
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,600
- Sorry?
- What?

204
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,529
No, it was nothing.
I was just talking to myself.

205
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,200
Okay.

206
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,840
Thank you so much.

207
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,210
Did you get anything?

208
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,509
I'm not sure yet. A lot of people
have visited this office,

209
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,840
so I don't know what we'll get.

210
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,279
Please do your best and help me.

211
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,850
I must get something from this,
whether it's a fingerprint or DNA.

212
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,549
Did you check the building's
CCTV footage?

213
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:16,350
He wore a hat and cleverly
avoided showing his face.

214
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,820
I couldn't see his face
on the footage.

215
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,720
Then you should make
a composite sketch.

216
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,460
You must have seen his face.

217
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,360
Unfortunately,
I didn't see his face either.

218
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,429
Gosh, that's too bad.

219
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,909
Is there anything
I can help you with?

220
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,019
May I get a glass of water?

221
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:49,720
- Of course. Just a moment, please.
- Sure.

222
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,250
Have you found anything?

223
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:23,389
No.

224
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,460
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

225
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,889
- I'll wipe it.
- No, I'll clean it up.

226
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:31,600
Gosh, don't worry about it.

show up at this timing?

232
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,390
Thank you.

233
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,890
I'll stop by later if I can.

234
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,799
Yes, come in.

235
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,829
- Oh, no.
- What?

236
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,240
Mr. Bang, it's you!

237
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:49,369
Yes. Mr. No asked me to do this,
so I took time...

238
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,640
out of my extremely busy schedule
to come all the way here.

239
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,980
My gosh, I see. Thank you.

240
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,380
By the way, I met your landlord
on my way here.

241
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,750
He said your electricity and water
will be cut off as of today.

242
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,789
He'll cut off my electricity
and water? Starting today?

243
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,420
- That's way too harsh.
- He said he's put up with enough.

244
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,759
You're so behind
on your rent and utility bills...

245
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,529
that your rent deposit is almost
gone. He really wants you gone.

246
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,829
Move out.

247
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,970
This is the copy of the CCTV footage
from the dates you asked for.

248
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,970
Great.
Thank you for your cooperation.

249
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,069
Thank you.

250
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,640
It's no use checking the footage
because I don't know his face.

251
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,450
We can't get their customers list
without a warrant, right?

252
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,150
I'll have to refuse if you ask me
for a warrant. I'll get fired.

253
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,450
Of course, I won't. I'm already
beyond grateful for your help.

254
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,490
I'm glad that you know.

255
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,660
By the way, I feel like
you're being very cold to me today.

256
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,730
It's just a feeling I'm getting.
Am I right?

257
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,900
You're right. I'm punishing you for
getting disappointed to see me.

258
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:52,869
Gosh, that was...
I was disappointed in myself.

259
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,839
I'm trying to turn off my feelings
for someone,

260
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,579
but I'm having a hard time with it
and keep wanting to see him.

261
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,349
I'm serious.

262
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,619
I think I know who that someone is.

263
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,150
- Sorry?
- It's probably Mr. No.

264
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,619
Gosh! How did you know?

265
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,289
I saw you peeking at him
from afar a few times.

266
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,359
I guess I made it too obvious.

267
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,230
Don't worry. He has no idea.

268
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,759
He must know. I mean, even you know.

269
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,029
When he was a prosecutor,
his assistant clerk...

270
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,170
had a crush on him for two years.

271
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,309
Everyone knew, but he had no idea.

272
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:31,410
- Are you serious?
- He is very sharp,

273
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,380
but he's clueless when it comes to
feelings. Especially women's.

274
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,650
Gosh, that's so mean.
I wish he had figured it out.

275
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,180
He would never.

276
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,019
I see.

277
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,890
I thought he's figured out
that I've been stalking him.

278
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,759
I bet 50 dollars
that he has no idea.

279
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:51,900
Make it under 30, or you'll be
violating the Kim Young Ran Act.

280
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,730
Oh, right. The Kim Young Ran Act.

281
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:12,950
No Ji Wook and Eun Bong Hee
were together?

282
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,180
Yes, sir.

283
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:20,089
From what I heard, they haven't been
in touch for the last two years.

284
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:22,059
That's what I thought too,

285
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:25,200
but they looked pretty close
when I saw them yesterday.

286
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,170
That jerk...

287
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,049
I've been actually thinking
about asking you to come by.

288
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,480
You came to me first.

289
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,619
I'll just cut to the chase.

290
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,859
I had to visit Attorney
Eun Bong Hee's office yesterday.

291
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,529
- Did you?
- Yes.

292
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,000
And I spotted a car
in front of her office.

293
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,099
Drive safely.

294
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,630
Hey...

295
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,869
At first, I just thought
that it was parked in the alleyway.

296
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,079
Then...

297
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,680
I happened to walk by there
a few times...

298
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,279
and kept noticing it for some
reason. And I saw its license plate,

299
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,859
and it was an official state car.
How can you use it like that?

300
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,559
She killed my son. I checked
what she's up to from time to time.

301
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,799
Very occasionally. I got
someone else to do it for me.

302
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,400
Can't I even do that
when I lost my son?

303
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,339
But the problem is that it's
considered illegal surveillance.

304
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,339
So?

305
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,269
Are you here to interrogate me?

306
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,910
No, of course not.

307
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,509
I was just wondering if you have
a dashboard camera in that car.

308
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,549
I need footage of that alleyway
at that hour.

309
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:54,349
Your car was the only vehicle
that was parked there.

310
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,250
Why do you need the footage?

311
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,390
Someone might have been
captured in it.

312
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:03,490
Unfortunately, there's no
dashboard camera in my car.

313
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,230
Well, all of you high-ups
usually like to discuss...

314
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,000
confidential matters in your cars,

315
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,539
so I thought that there
might not be any footage.

316
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,069
All right, then.
Thank you for your time.

317
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:18,339
What is it that you're looking for?

318
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:24,680
Do you believe Eun Bong Hee's claim?
Are you after the real culprit?

319
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,650
- Yes.
- Let me ask you again.

320
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:29,519
Eun Bong Hee claims
that she's not the real culprit.

321
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,190
Have you seen the real culprit?

322
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,329
Then how can you believe her?

323
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:36,859
It's not her that I believe.

324
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,900
I believe
the circumstantial evidence.

325
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,099
What if you're wrong?

326
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:45,339
If that's the case, I'm letting
a killer prance around.

327
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,410
What would you do if you're wrong?

328
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,210
She's free now anyway.

329
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,440
What's the problem?

330
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,380
"Free"?

331
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,480
I'm on the verge of going bankrupt.

332
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,680
I'm desperate for a job
because I have to earn a living.

333
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,890
But no one wants to hire me.

334
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,690
Why?

335
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,890
Because I'm a murderer who killed
the District Attorney's son.

336
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,829
I've been completely ostracized.

337
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,500
I thought so too,

338
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,599
but she's actually not really free.

339
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,400
If she's innocent,

340
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:20,539
we'll have to pay
for what we've done to her.

341
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,170
I wrongly charged her,

342
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,779
and you even fabricated evidence
to peg her as the culprit.

343
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,980
If she's guilty,

344
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,619
you'll have to pay the price too.

345
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:43,759
Hey, Ji Wook.

346
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,900
Why are you coming out of there?

347
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,730
The DA will tell you about it.
I should go.

348
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,009
Just spread the truth.

349
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,319
Tell everyone that Ji Wook showed up
here and caused a scene,

350
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,519
which utterly infuriated me.

351
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,220
If the word spreads...

352
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:15,630
Everyone around him including
the attorneys at the firm...

353
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,700
will blame him whenever
they lose a case.

354
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,900
They'll completely forget
about their own incompetence.

355
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,109
They'll think that they were put
at a disadvantage because of him,

356
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,410
and that's why they lost.

357
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,309
Everyone will blame and resent him.

358
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,690
You said it's for a gift.
Is it for your husband?

359
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,990
I don't have a husband.

360
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:46,119
Then it must be for your boyfriend.

361
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:47,619
I don't have that either.

362
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,990
It's for a lady.

363
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,359
For your daughter?

364
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:53,960
I don't have a daughter.

365
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,670
Then whom is it for?

366
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:00,799
Knowing the age and gender will help
me give you a better recommendation.

367
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,740
She's around my age.

368
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,509
She must be a friend of yours. Then
let's pick something from here...

369
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:07,279
She's an enemy, not a friend.

370
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:08,609
Pardon me?

371
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,480
She tries to boss around her clients
just because she's a good masseuse.

372
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:15,890
She refuses to book me in after
having a little argument with me.

373
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,150
She keeps saying she's fully booked.
Back to back.

374
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:23,859
Do I have to give her flowers, so
I can just get a massage from her?

375
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,230
I really hate this.

376
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,759
I'll visit often.

377
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:29,400
Please do, Director.

378
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,029
This is a gift from all of us.

379
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,299
You didn't have to.

380
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:33,900
It's a small gift.

381
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,470
How can you give me a small gift?

382
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,039
You should've given me a big one
if you were going to get it anyway.

383
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,910
- Director! Goodness.
- Director!

384
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,819
I know how hard they try
to save every cent.

385
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,759
This is a living proof that
you led a good life so far.

386
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,420
You are so popular. You received a
gift on the day of your retirement.

387
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,759
You think so too, right?

388
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,359
I guess I'm quite well-liked
by others.

389
00:25:58,529 --> 00:25:59,529
You sure are.

390
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,200
What are we going to do
with your wrists? They are ruined.

391
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,700
At my age, things start
to fall apart anyway.

392
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,670
This is the law of nature.
What can I do?

393
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,970
You should rest now.

394
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,309
I know I'm not successful yet,
but soon I will...

395
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:14,380
I'm fine.

396
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,609
I'm still going to work. I'll find a
job that doesn't require my wrists.

397
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,079
Gosh, Mom.

398
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,319
I'll work even if you become
successful.

399
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,619
That's my secret of not getting
aged.

400
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,529
She retired?

401
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:30,029
You didn't get a call?

402
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,900
No, I didn't.

403
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,059
That's weird.

404
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:37,069
She said she personally gave a call
to every VIP client.

405
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:38,230
What?

406
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,369
Why did she forget me?

407
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:42,240
Why didn't she give me a call?

408
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,710
How can this be possible?

409
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,809
Ji Wook,

410
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,220
I've never been humiliated like this
in my entire life.

411
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,119
No one has ever treated
me like this.

412
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,019
That's nothing to cry about though.

413
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,420
Okay.

414
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,789
Have a warm cup of tea
before going to sleep.

415
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,390
Okay.

416
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:10,869
Did you get into trouble again?

417
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,539
I heard you had a big fight
with District Attorney.

418
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,009
What about the CCTV footages
from the shoe shop?

419
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,640
That's not important right now.

420
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,380
No, that is the important issue.

421
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,150
There were no male customers
in the footages.

422
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,180
He could have had someone
buy them for him.

423
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,220
Or he could have bought them
at a different store.

424
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,190
Goodness. How are we going to
search every store?

425
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,549
I don't think that will be possible.

426
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,759
The agency in charge of the
investigation won't even help us.

427
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,630
Well, we have to...

428
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,460
find a way.

429
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,529
I don't know what has gotten
into you all of a sudden.

430
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,440
You told her it was an ill-fated
encounter and to get lost.

431
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,809
I don't know why you are still hung
up on a case of two years ago.

432
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,579
All of a sudden,

433
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,779
this thought came across my mind.

434
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,450
If I didn't...

435
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,279
prosecute Bong Hee...

436
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,319
Then another prosecutor
would have prosecuted her.

437
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,720
That's right, but...

438
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:08,529
You know how I have a clear
conscience and am very responsible.

439
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:10,430
- Sure.
- I'm strict to the others, but...

440
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,630
- I'm even more strict to myself.
- Of course.

441
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,900
With the conscience
of an officer of the law,

442
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,960
Sure, you are conscientious.

443
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:17,569
I keep getting this feeling...

444
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,240
that I should protect Bong Hee like
her guardian, which is annoying.

445
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,509
You don't look so annoyed though.

446
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:31,250
You look rather excited and happy.

447
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,480
No way.

448
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,019
Why would I be excited?
All my good days are gone.

449
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:38,759
You know I hate getting involved in
anything that's related to Bong Hee.

450
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,420
I don't think I know it well.

451
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,730
You might be annoyed, but you
sure are drinking a lot tonight.

452
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,740
It's good.

453
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,710
The last two years
that Bong Hee wasn't present...

454
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,680
Mr. No, I can't sleep lately.

455
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,640
I have been seriously mistreated!

456
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,910
During those two years,

457
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,279
I felt safe and calm.

458
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,190
Mr. No, can this really happen?

459
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,220
How can love be a crime?

460
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,819
The line between today
and yesterday...

461
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,329
and the line between today
and tomorrow were blurred.

462
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,460
Yesterday was like today.

463
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,240
Today will become tomorrow.
The days were mundane.

464
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,410
No one ever invaded my life.

465
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:45,990
They were peaceful days
on which I also didn't invade...

466
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,490
the others' lives.

467
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,359
After I met Bong Hee, everything...

468
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,230
got messed up.

469
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:58,869
I met a stalker.

470
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:03,410
The real culprit resurfaced.

471
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,680
My space...

472
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,410
has been invaded.

473
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,799
It's dangerous and tiring,

474
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,599
but it's never boring.

475
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,269
That's a day with Bong Hee.

476
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,869
He definitely told me I could stay
until the forensic result comes out.

477
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,180
No, I can't do this.
I'm asking too much.

478
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,480
This isn't the time
to think about my pride.

479
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,880
I'm about to die.

480
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,519
Fine. I should appeal
to his sympathy.

481
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,089
I had every intention
to stay in my office,

482
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:55,759
but the water and electricity
are cut off.

483
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,890
I can live with no lights,

484
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,759
but I can't live without water.

485
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,160
- I see.
- Oh, my!

486
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,170
- Goodness!
- Hey, hey.

487
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,369
- Are you all right?
- You startled me!

488
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,369
I didn't know you were going
to be startled this bad.

489
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:08,910
- Shoot.
- Are you sure you're okay?

490
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,240
You didn't get hurt, did you?

491
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,309
You did get hurt, didn't you?

492
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,539
Oh, no. What shall we do?

493
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,880
That's all right. I'm fine.

494
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,710
- Are you sure you are fine?
- Yes.

495
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,680
By the way, I'm drunk.

496
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,849
Sorry?

497
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,079
I said I'm drunk.

498
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:30,430
I think it'd be better to go to
the hospital.

499
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,759
I sprained it only slightly. I don't
need to go to the hospital for this.

500
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,799
I'm fine.

501
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,269
Allow me.

502
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,069
Mr. No?

503
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,440
Are you all right?

504
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Yes.

505
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,799
I don't think you have insomnia.

506
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,700
I can't fall for him again.
Don't fall for him.

507
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:00,319
If she's innocent,

508
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,190
we'll have to pay
for what we've done to her.

509
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,250
If she's guilty,

510
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:07,690
you'll have to pay the price too.

511
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,059
I thought you would be different
from your dad.

512
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,670
I thought wrong.

513
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,500
What is that supposed to mean?

514
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,039
You probably think you corrected
the prosecution's mistake...

515
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:24,509
and brought justice.

516
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,509
No, that's where you are wrong.

517
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,950
You are the one
who made a huge mistake...

518
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,250
just like your father.

If only I was shameless enough
to continue living there.

What should I do?

Here.

525
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,829
Put that down.

526

Why are you pretending like
it's yours when it's not?

Let's go guys.

Do you know that you're committing
special larceny right now?

- Hurry up.

- Really?

00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,320
My gosh, what a coincidence.
It's nice to meet you.

542
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,519
Me too.

543
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:05,050
You must have injured your leg.

544
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:15,260
You didn't have to come to the
hospital with me.

545

You got hurt because of me.

546

No, it was because of those punks.

You're right.

Oh, wait.

I'm sure we'll run into
each other in the future.

00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:30,909
Maybe in court or some other places.

552
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,420
You're right.

553
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,820

I'm the one who should be
saying that.

- What...
- It's nothing serious.

564
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,820
You should've gone to the hospital
yesterday when I told you to.

565
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:14,019
That's not it. This is from...

566
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:16,789
How is it? Is your bone okay?
Did you fracture it?

567

- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

Let me tell you what happened.

Let me...

570
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:25,800
Let me sincerely apologize.

00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,539
Well, it's not exactly because of...

574
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,719
You did hurt me, but I'm fine.

575
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:47,489
You don't need to feel too sorry.
An adequate amount is enough.

Wait.

00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,429
Excuse me for a minute.

- Of course.

Yes, please.

Are you okay? Do you need anything?

- Water?
- Okay.

Mr. No, can I have that
snack over there?

586
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Which one?

00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,920

Thank you.

00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,630
It's hot.

590

May I sit with you?

591
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,849
You've already been
following me around.

592
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,719
I graduated the same high school
and college as you.

593
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:28,059
Really? Then I'll just
speak to you comfortably.

594
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,230
Of course.

595
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:34,659
To be honest, you were always
my role model.

596
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:37,130
I wanted to meet you as soon as
I became a prosecutor,

597
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,070
but you were away in the US
for your Master of Laws.

598
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,440
I was sad that you weren't here,
but you also seemed so cool.

599
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,670
I didn't go to the US
because I wanted to study.

600
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,309
I had cheated on my boyfriend,
so I went there as an escape.

601
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:58,389
I was the one who cheated.

602
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,760
Me too.

603
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:12,329
I slept with my friend's boyfriend.

604
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,369
What a wench.

605
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,309
That's right.

606
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:17,710
- Who's the guy?
- Sorry?

607
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,340
You need a partner to cheat.

608
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,039
Well...

609
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,079
What about you?
Who was the guy you slept with?

610
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,619
I forgot.

611
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:32,559
My gosh, that's so cool. You just
forgot about him just like that.

612
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:33,989
That's the only way I can go back.

613
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:36,659
- To whom?
- To the ex-boyfriend I betrayed.

614
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:40,159
I'm going to visit him and pretend
like I forgot about what happened.

615
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:41,199
I see.

616
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,070
You really are a mean person.

617
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,139
That's right.
I'm going to beg him...

618
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:49,639
for forgiveness.

619
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:51,039
My gosh.

620
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,280
You made me receive
a disadvantage in court.

621
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,349
Do you even know how serious
the situation is?

622
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,219
- Hey, hey.
- What?

623
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:05,920
Do this outside.
Why are you doing this here?

624
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,760
I should be talking to the person
who caused this problem.

625
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:09,219
- Let's go outside.
- Let go of me.

626
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,190
- Come on.
- Let go!

627
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,559
My gosh, seriously.

628
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,869
Your trial was a risky one
from the beginning.

629
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:19,800
Everyone's already gone through it.
Don't you agree?

630
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,239
It's not just this case.
Everyone's talking.

631
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,469
We're getting mistreated
in court because of him.

632
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:26,739
Who's spreading that kind of rumor?

633
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:27,840
Cut it out!

634
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,510
How dare you raise your voice here!

635
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,550
My gosh, District Attorney Jang...

636
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,619
That little...

637
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,530
People will blame Ji Wook for
every single trial they lose.

638
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:45,860
I'm sure they will.

00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,369
They'll also blame me
for their incompetence.

640
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:51,730
They'll also blame me for...

641
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,300
not having enough evidence
or data. Why?

642
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:55,969
Because people find it easier to
blame others...

643
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:57,969
than to acknowledge one's
own problem.

644
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,139
My goodness, you are so smart.

645
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,510
You really are very smart.

646
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,510
But why did such a smart guy
like you...

647
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:08,719
fight with
the District Attorney?

648
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,349
My gosh, what a headache.

649
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,349
Are you okay?

650
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:13,590
You have too much anger inside you.

651
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,389
And why do you think that is?

652
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:18,090
You should try eating temple food.

653
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,300
No, thank you. I'm not going to eat
a bowl full of vegetables.

654
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,969
Anyway,

655
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:28,039
you guys should go and reconcile
with your co-workers.

656
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,110
Get to know them a little.
Have a few drinks with them.

657
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,110
Hey.

658
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,880
Don't even try to talk back.

659
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,579
I'm already close with the others.

660
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,619
What are you talking about?
They don't like you either.

661
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,250
Everyone is saying that you're
arrogant.

662
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,789
Good grief.

663
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,789
Me?

664
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:55,559
Yes.

665
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:58,769
I'll vacate the space until next
week.

666
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,239
Please believe me.

667
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:02,909
Yes.

668
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,239
Okay. Have a good day.

669
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:08,809
(Attorney Eun Bong Hee)

670
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:13,119
I can only turn on my computer
with electricity.

671
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,119
I need to turn on my computer to
look for jobs and places to stay.

672
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:19,349
I'm on a cheap plan,
so I can't even use my data freely.

673
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:22,659
What does this guy want now?

674
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:23,929
(Woo Hee Gyu)

675
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,800
Hee Gyu, I'm totally not
excited to hear your voice.

676
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,760
What's up?

677
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:30,099
What?

678
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:33,599
Are you serious?

679
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,110
Yes, okay. Of course.

680
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:39,440
Hey, thank you so much.
You're such an awesome friend.

681
00:45:56,429 --> 00:45:57,429
What?

682
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,380
Let's order a bottle of soju.

683
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:24,449
Have a seat, guys.

684
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:29,119
What now?

685
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,900
- Come have a seat.
- Hurry up.

686
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Sit.

687
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:47,309
I've seen you on TV and newspapers,
but you look much better in person.

688
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,340
Aren't I right?

689
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,510
Yes. She's always so put together.

690
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,050
She sure doesn't look like a killer.

691
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:56,889
Thank you for the compliment.

692
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:58,489
I heard this is
a preliminary interview.

693
00:46:58,489 --> 00:46:59,889
Shall I introduce myself first?

694
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:02,159
You're already famous, so you don't
need to introduce yourself.

695
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,989
Let's chill and talk over a drink.

696
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,429
Sure, that sounds good.

697
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,800
- Let's order right away.
- Okay.

698
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,239
- Show us. Show us what you can do.
- Bring it on.

699
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:15,039
Show us. This is your chance
to impress us.

700
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:16,510
Hey! My goodness.

701
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,639
Nice. How refreshing.
I showered in alcohol.

702
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:19,809
Now, it's my turn.

703
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,550
- All right, here we go!
- Let's do it.

704
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,579
There!

705
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,019
- Nice.
- This is awesome!

706
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:29,050
- Let's raise our glasses.
- All right.

707
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:31,050
- Give me one.
- Hey.

708
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:33,590
- Gosh, thank you.
- Thanks.

709
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:35,460
I've been waiting for this day.

710
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,530
Let's hit it!

711
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,429
- Let's hit it!
- Cheers!

712
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:46,300
Is Bong Hee
trying to get a job there?

713
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,599
How would I know?

714
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,000
- You know nothing about it?
- That's right.

715
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,239
I don't even want to know.

716
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:54,440
I know a little bit
about that law firm.

717
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,550
Last year,

718
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,210
they did something.

719
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:02,119
- You said you don't want to know.
- Right.

720
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:05,050
Gosh, I'm...

721
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,389
Shall I tell you?

722
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,289
No, it's all right.

723
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:11,590
I actually don't know
anything either.

724
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,460
You lunatic.

725
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:24,670
Bong Hee.

726
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,949
Of course, I'd bump into you as
there are a lot of law firms here.

727
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,780
This makes me feel as if
I've become a successful attorney.

728
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:37,190
This feels nice.

729
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,949
Likewise.

730
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,320
By the way, why are you...

731
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,389
Why are you drinking
with those guys?

732
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,500
What do you think?

733
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,730
It's like a preliminary interview.

734
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:52,130
Does that make sense to you?
Who does a job interview at a bar?

735
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,969
Whether it makes sense or not,
I don't care.

736
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:57,039
No matter what it is, I must
hold onto it and make it mine.

737
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,179
Hey, I get that you're desperate,
but that's like a rotten rope...

738
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:01,579
Even if it's rotten,

739
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,449
it's the only thing I can
hold onto now.

740
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:05,909
It's not the only opportunity
that's out there.

741
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:06,980
If you keep looking...

742
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,019
Mr. No.

743
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:11,920
I don't have time to keep looking.

744
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,530
Look at me now.

745
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,090
I'm trying hard to act
like I'm okay,

746
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,030
and I'm inconveniencing you
by staying at your place.

747
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,369
I can't keep being this shameless
forever.

748
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,920
- Right.
- I keep drinking for everyone else.

749
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,119
We've...

750
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:48,159
made our decision.

751
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,360
Ms. Eun.

752
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:51,059
You're in.

753
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,059
Seriously? You're giving me the job?

754
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:56,300
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

755
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:58,630
- Sit down.
- Okay.

756
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,900
You really have
to repay me for this.

757
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,269
I helped you out big time.

758
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:06,940
I know. Thanks so much.
I'm really thankful.

759
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,639
You're very personable.

760
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,679
You're perfect for visitations.

761
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:15,219
It'd be great if you can wear things
that look classier and attractive.

762
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,590
Our clients...

763
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,820
love short skirts
and revealing tops.

764
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,860
Excuse me.

765
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:26,860
I'm sorry, but I don't quite
understand what you're saying.

766
00:50:27,699 --> 00:50:29,769
- What?
- Well...

767
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:32,800
I'm sure you know
what visitation lawyers do.

768
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,409
There's nothing difficult about the
job. You just have to go there.

769
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:40,309
All you need to do is visit
our clients at penitentiaries...

770
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:42,880
and say things like,
"Gosh, I see. I understand."

771
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,710
That's all there is to it.

772
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,780
All right, let's drink up first.

773
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,380
- Okay.
- Let's drink. Come on.

774
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:52,349
- Hey.
- Raise your glass. Let's drink.

775
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,420
Hey.

776
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,059
Why didn't you tell me?

777
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,760
About what?

778
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,900
Why didn't you tell me
from the beginning?

779
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:07,070
Why didn't you tell me
that this was for a visitation role?

780
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,940
Bong Hee.

781
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,940
I just thought that you were
already aware of it.

782
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,380
Short skirts?

783
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,710
And revealing tops...

784
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,619
What do you think women are?

785
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:27,820
You don't need to waste
your energy on jerks like them.

786
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:29,960
And you shouldn't waste
your drink either.

787
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:33,900
I'll drink this.

788
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:43,409
Let's go, Attorney Eun.

789
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:46,210
Let's go, Attorney No.

790
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,010
Bong Hee, it was... I was just...

791
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,750
"Attorney No". For goodness' sake.

792
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,289
- Gosh.
- What was that about?

793
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:02,059
Hey, Bong Hee. Where are you going?

794
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,239
I'm so humiliated right now,
so don't say anything...

795
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,780
You're not inconveniencing me.

796
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:32,250
Come back to me.

797
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:47,570
Come work with me.

798
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,139
Well, what do you mean...

799
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:08,719
Hey.

800
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,429
Did you see her eyes earlier?

801
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:14,099
It looked like she could really
kill someone.

802
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,199
I know, right?

803
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,500
But I honestly don't know
why she was being like that.

804
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,840
Anyhow,

805
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:23,909
she really should know her place.

806
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:25,369
Exactly.

807
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,440
- She frustrates me so much.
- Gosh!

808
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,820
- Goodness!
- Hey, what's your problem?

809
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:36,150
My apologies.

810
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:38,449
I'm severely anemic.

811
00:53:39,389 --> 00:53:41,989
- I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

812
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:46,159
Gosh, it's disgusting.

813
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,559
Goodness, that piece of...

814
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:23,500
Gosh, my head...

815
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,280
What...

816
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,449
Gosh.

817
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,130
My gosh.

818
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,349
What? No way. It can't be.

819
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:31,929
It can't be.

820
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:39,670
Did you sleep well?

821
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:48,849
My gosh, why are you acting
all embarrassed?

822
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:49,849
I don't know.

823
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:52,449
Hey, stop acting embarrassed.

824
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:54,690
Don't act that way.

825
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,059
Bong Hee, by any chance...
Last night...

826
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:07,670
Well, I don't know how
I should say this.

827
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,110
A man and a woman...

828
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,440
We didn't, did we?

829
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:14,679
I'm not sure.

830
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:17,949
Can you tell me anything other
than that?

831
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,550
I'm not sure.

832
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,849
We did it.

833
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:27,719
I'm doomed.

834
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:39,699
It serves him right.
He didn't even tell me either.

835
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,840
He should learn what it feels like
to not know...

836
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,710
whether you slept with that
person or not.

837
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:55,250
Come back to me.

838
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,750
Come work for me.

839
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,559
What did that mean?

840
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,530
He was drunk, so he probably doesn't
even remember.

841
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:12,530
Let's not care about what he said.

842
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,340
Right?

843
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,550
The number you are calling is not
available. Please leave...

844
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,690
(Attorney Eun Bong Hee)

845
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,139
Where are you going?

846
00:57:57,449 --> 00:57:59,449
You can't be going to work
on a weekend.

847
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,880
You don't need to know.

848
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:04,619
What?

849
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:09,989
- Where are you off to?
- Well,

850
00:58:10,389 --> 00:58:12,789
I need to go to my office
to take care of...

851
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:17,699
The guy from the forensic center
called me. The results must be out.

852
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:27,110
Yes. Would it be possible to hear
the results in person?

853
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:28,940
Okay.

854
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,940
It's not him.

855
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,579
I'll go see you right now.

856
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,349
Okay.

857
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:37,550
Please tell me your location.

858
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,730
Hi.

859
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:47,829
It's been a while.

860
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,170
(O.WHEN's "How to Say" is available

(Love in Trouble)

862
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,679
Ji Wook, you know that...

863
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,420
we can't just easily
forget about each other.

864
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,920
There's nothing left
between you and I.

865
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:47,590
Yes, Ms. Eun.
I'm sorry to tell you this.

866
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,460
We couldn't find anything special.

867
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:52,659
Hey, Ji Wook.
I heard you're going to quit.

868
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,429
This is my resignation letter.

869
00:59:54,429 --> 00:59:55,800
You're going to open
a law firm, aren't you?

870
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,099
Honey.

871
00:59:57,099 --> 00:59:58,670
Why? Are you hungry?

872
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:00,969
Why am I doing this?

873
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:04,110
Why am I always
feeding you like this?

874
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,510
Why? Are you worried that
they might think I'm your wife?
