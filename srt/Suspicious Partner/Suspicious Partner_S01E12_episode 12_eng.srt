1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720


2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,080
Tateishi-san!

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,970
Tateishi-san!

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,890
Tateishi-san!

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,780
-  Dad! 
 - Haruto! Run! 

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,850
 Mr. Prosecutor! 

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,090
 Take Haruto and run. 

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,940
 I've got you now. Let's go. 

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,730
 Dad! 

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,050
 Run outside, all right? I'll go get your father. 

11
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,340
Thank god...

12
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,020
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

13
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,400
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,970
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

15
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,000
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,430
♫  Here's the love that I long for  ♫

17
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,030
   

18
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,320
Sakura, there's something I need to tell you.

19
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,340
Right.

20
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:31,470
I remember what really happened in that house fire.

21
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:39,140
Your father was innocent.

22
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,550
He wasn't the one who set the fire.

23
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,140
It was the opposite.

24
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,470
After he rescued me, he went back in to save my parents.

25
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,720
- But because he did... 
 - Then why was he declared guilty?

26
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,400
It was my fault.

27
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,610
What do you mean?

28
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,750
I testified against your father. I said he was the culprit.

29
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:25,120
 Haruto-kun. This man was at your house, right? 

30
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,650
 And he set your home on fire, didn't he? 

31
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,360
I...

32
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,910
I said your father set the fire.

33
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,220
I testified against him to Prosecutor Aoki.

34
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,470
 Isn't that right? 

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,660
I'm responsible for his ruling.

36
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,770
What do you want?

37
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,690
My father's name was Miyashita Mikihiko.

38
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,840
I am the daughter of the man

39
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,890
you pinned that house fire on.

40
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,910
My father is an innocent man. He is no arsonist.

41
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,890
And like him, I did not murder your son.

42
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,570
Yet you only believe what you understand to be true.

43
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,080
You ignore conflicting testimonies and even forge evidence in your favor.

44
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:28,280
Both my father and I have done no wrong.

45
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,360
You are the one who has.

46
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,280
Recognize the crimes you have committed.

47
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,380
We're gathering evidence by the hour.

48
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,310
If you want to fess up, now's your last chance.

49
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,610
I killed all five of them.

50
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,470
Who should I start with?

51
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:09,090
There was Tabata, Haneda, Momoi, Shimano, and...

52
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:18,940
Aoki Sota. Now that was the unluckiest guy of the whole bunch.

53
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,850
I only wanted to keep Miyashita-san quiet.

54
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,940
But who was at her apartment instead? That guy.

55
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,140
He saw my face. I had no choice but to stab him.

56
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,050
"Help me."

57
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,190
 "I'm scared!" 

58
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,440
 He was crying like that. 

59
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,500
 I had to deal the final blow to keep his mouth shut. 

60
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,670
What's up?

61
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:07,550
Inaba fessed up to all his crimes.

62
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,040
I see.

63
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,330
 What? 

64
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:26,140
Chief Prosecutor Aoki drove off with him. We don't know where they went.

65
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,720
Where are you going?

66
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,680
Chief Prosecutor Aoki left with Inaba.

67
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,460
What?

68
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,110
Chief, taking the suspect without permission is...

69
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,810
Get out.

70
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,170
 Look familiar? 

71
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:18,570
This is where you killed my son. My innocent son.

72
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,100
"Innocent"? I disagree.

73
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,510
Say what?

74
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:29,140
Yes, your son may be innocent but not you.

75
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,570
What are you talking about?

76
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,650
Fourteen years ago...

77
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,640
You handled a case.

78
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,830
A case where a young girl was assaulted by a group of bastards.

79
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,850
Her name was Honda Kanade.

80
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,860
She's the victim of the case you covered up.

81
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,680
You abandoned Kanade.

82
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,290
You chose to protect those scumbags with their influential parents.

83
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,400
Sound familiar?

84
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,370
Let this anguish torment you, like it's tormented me.

85
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,530
- Sakura, check the room! 
 - Right!

86
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,440
Wait!

87
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,460
Isn't that stab wound fresh?

88
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,150
I reckon you shouldn't move around too much.

89
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,370
And I reckon those handcuffs aren't helping you either.

90
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,310
Inaba! Don't add anything else to your list of sins!

91
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,210
I've lost the one person who matters to me.

92
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:56,160
I have nothing left to lose!

93
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,910
I've... got you.

94
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,500
I've been thinking about my father's incident.

95
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,770
The one to blame is Prosecutor Aoki; for coaxing you into giving a testimony.

96
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,780
Your father saved my life.

97
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,060
He then dove back in, in an attempt to save my father.

98
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,890
I'm truly sorry for what happened.

99
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,620
My father was simply unlucky.

100
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,150
None of it was your fault, Tateishi-san.

101
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,900
Shall we have...

102
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,390
a fresh start from here now?

103
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,500
   
   

104
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,030
Welcome back.

105
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,590
I look forward to working with you from today.

106
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,670
Why did you decide to return as a prosecutor?

107
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,130
This matches me more.

108
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:32,820
First your lawyer, and now your prosecutor. It seems it was meant to be.

109
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,790
   

110
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,550
I'm glad your father was rightfully declared innocent.

111
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,180
As am I.

112
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,050
Have you been well?

113
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,150
As well as I look. And you, Umehara-san?

114
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,630
I'm doing okay.

115
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,120
So you're in a slump.

116
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,550
And you, Miyashita-san?

117
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,020
I'm working myself out of it.

118
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,520
Don't overthink it. Just be honest with yourself.

119
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,010
Is that what you've been doing?

120
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,680
Of course.

121
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:21,680
I've been so honest, I fell for the same individual all over again.

122
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,950
It's been tough, though.

123
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,180
Are you looking into that incident?

124
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,470
Chief Prosecutor Aoki was in charge of Honda Kanade-san's case,

125
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,180
but the perpetrator's parents were influential people.

126
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,390
He helped them cover up the case.

127
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:58,090
And Honda Kanade-san took her own life as a result of his actions.

128
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,510
Inaba was exacting revenge on all those involved in the cover up.

129
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,770
The accused, Inaba Takahiko, murdered five individuals; Tabata Masashi, Aoki Sota,

130
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:40,510
Haneda Ryujiro, Shimano Daisuke and Momoi Yuma.

131
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,180
Tabata, Haneda, Shimano, and Momoi

132
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:57,250
were accused of sexually assaulting Honda Kanade-san at around 5 p.m. on July 11, 2011.

133
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,850
Kanade-san was your childhood friend.

134
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,940
That is why you killed each and every person involved in this incident.

135
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,960
They brought this on themselves.

136
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:30,570
As a prosecutor, I would first like to apologize.

137
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,760
The prosecutor who was in charge of the case at the time covered up the incident.

138
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:44,240
And as a result of his actions, Kanade-san took her own life.

139
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,640
If the prosecutor handling her case had done his job properly,

140
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,980
you would not have found yourself here in court today.

141
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,450
- So what? 
 - You are entirely right.

142
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,130
The job ought to have been done long ago,

143
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,140
but there are things I can still do now.

144
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,780
I will take full responsibility and bring the truth of her tragedy to light.

145
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,060
So I ask you this.

146
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,390
I want you to come clean and repent for your crimes.

147
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:38,330
I imagine Kanade-san, your childhood friend, would hope you do the very same.

148
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:46,140
She would not wish to see you become a villain.

149
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,120
As if you could ever understand.

150
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,700
I want those I cherish to always be smiling

151
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:12,890
and to remain happy forever.

152
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,070
That is a feeling I understand all too well.

153
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:32,930
I believe she would only hope for your happiness as well.

154
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,900
Kanade...

 Thanks to all Other Language moderators

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,050
 We hoped you enjoyed the show! 

162
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,960
Great work today.

163
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,520
I'm beat.

164
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,350
Prosecuting with Haruto is so awkward.

165
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,690
But you looked awesome up there.

166
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,150
Of course! I'm the best prosecutor this district has.

167
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,720
- After this... 
 - What?

168
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,100
- What? 
 - Yes?

169
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,950
Want to grab a drink?

170
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,680
Together, for old times' sake.

171
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:28,110
Well, you do still owe me so...

172
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,440
Yes, let's go.

173
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,220
Great.

174
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,060
And we're getting the best sushi, okay?

175
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,030
- Of course. 
 - Are you paying today?

176
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,840
Sure.

177
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,120
It's all over now.

178
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,810
Yes.

179
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,110
Tateishi-san...

180
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,650
Haruto, I owe it to you.

181
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,970
No.

182
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,310
This was all you, Sakura.

183
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:10,070
 For some reason, he was always there to help me. 

184
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,830
 Our relationship was awful. 

185
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,770
 The absolute worst. 

186
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,140
 Or so it was supposed to be. 

187
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,480
 And yet, we met. 

188
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,820
 And for that, I'm truly grateful. 

189
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,200
-  I'm glad I met you. 
 - And I'm glad I met you, too. 

190
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,180
♫  The color of my hair and my fashion  ♫

191
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,900
♫  I changed everything for you, to suit you  ♫

192
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,630
I want you to stay with me forever.

193
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,210
Be my partner, no matter what comes our way.

194
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,800
♫  Don't suit me  ♫

195
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,950
No matter what?

196
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,430
Right. And no matter how my years pass.

197
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,520
Okay.

198
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,450
Let's come to see these sakura blossoms again next year.

199
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,180
Coming to see the sakura, with Sakura?

200
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,530
♫  The cheesy lines like a drama  ♫

201
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:15,790
♫  Don't suit me. But don't laugh at me even if I try to act like a grown-up  ♫

202
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,330
♫  All I wanna do is kiss your heart  ♫

203
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:24,270
♫  I want you more  ♫

204
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,100
♫  But you seem close and yet far away  ♫

205
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:38,090


206
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,050
