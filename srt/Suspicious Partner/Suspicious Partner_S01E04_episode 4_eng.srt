1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940


2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,140
The culprit came.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,800
The one who murdered Sota.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,310
Say what?

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,770
They're... still here.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,790
Wait!

7
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,530
Are you all right?

8
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,040
They got away.

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,160
Frustrating...

10
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,020
I told you to stay out of harm's way.

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,960
Don't do something as dangerous as chasing the culprit.

12
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,830
I won't.

13
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,250
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

14
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,530
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

15
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,050
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

16
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,300
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

17
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:55,740
♫  Here's the love that I long for  ♫

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,240
   

19
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,210
Goosebumps racked my whole body.

20
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,700
I could sense someone else was in the room.

21
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,740
Suddenly, that very presence ran out the door.

22
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,610
I overcame my fear and chased after the culprit, only to lose them.

23
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,380
Why do you sound like you're enjoying this?

24
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,280
I am not.

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,960
Oh, okay.

26
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,590
Are you worried about me again?

27
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,030
Don't misunderstand. I would even worry about a passerby, given the situation.

28
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,050
 The panic of this whole debacle almost made me forget. 

29
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,840
 I tried to end my one-sided crush on him. 

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,080
Why are you so reckless anyway?

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,960
You could've been killed.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,370
With my circumstances, I'll probably starve to death first.

33
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,310
I'll be closing my firm soon.

34
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,380
Why?

35
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,530
It doesn't matter. No other law firms want me.

36
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,210
I'm known in legal circles as the nuisance who killed the Chief Prosecutor's son.

37
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,090
- Point taken. 
 - See?

38
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,630
To clear your name, we'll have to catch the culprit.

39
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,420
- Right. 
 - Together.

40
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,300
Right.

41
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,570
In any case, you're in danger here.

42
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,250
Right.

43
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,250
- What? 
 - What

44
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,350
- What? 
 - What?

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,390
I put myself under a restraining order.

46
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,970
But considering this situation, I have no choice, right?

47
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,300
Of course.

48
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,590
It's more dangerous to be alone.

49
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,000
What're you mumbling about?

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,490
- Get in. 
 - Thank you.

51
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,310
   

52
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,810
I see nothing has changed since two years ago.

53
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,550
The sofa, the cabinet... everything is the same as that night.

54
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,380
Remember? We got drunk, and...

55
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,210
Back then, did we...

56
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,880
What?

57
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,790
Did we do it?

58
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,630
Never mind.

59
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,740
Get up. It's morning.

60
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,380
You'll be late.

61
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,780
How long have you been staring?

62
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,210
 Oh, this is so embarrassing! 

63
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,880
I'm sorry. I'm just talking to myself.

64
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,180
So did you not see the intruder's face, Ma'am?

65
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,030
Unfortunately, not.

66
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,280
That's a real shame.

67
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,670
Shall I help?

68
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,510
No need.

69
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,170
But could I have some water?

70
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,860
Of course.

71
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,980
- Did you find something? 
 - Not yet.

72
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,200
Thank you for the water.

73
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,990
Apologies for the intrusion.

74
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,380
What do you want?

75
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,630
I met with Miyashita Sakura.

76
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,640
And?

77
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,350
There was a car parked outside her office.

78
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,320
It was yours, Sir.

79
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,550
I'm keeping an eye on the woman who murdered my son.

80
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,150
What, did you come to complain?

81
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,840
No, Sir.

82
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,540
I came to ask for a favor.

83
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,480
Does your vehicle have a dash cam by any chance?

84
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:28,900
Your car was the only vehicle parked in the area, Sir.

85
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,310
Unfortunately, that car has no camera installed in it.

86
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,840
What is it you're looking for?

87
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,190
Don't tell me it's the "culprit" that woman is insistent about?

88
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,990
That's exactly it, Sir.

89
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,900
Why do you believe that woman?

90
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,760
What I believe are the circumstances and evidence we have.

91
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,310
If she is innocent,

92
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,720
we must atone.

93
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,040
Myself, for what I've done...

94
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:10,800
And you, Sir, for forging evidence and for placing the blame on her.

95
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,100
I heard the news.

96
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,180
You picked another fight with the Chief Prosecutor?

97
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,630
How long will you continue to obsess over that case?

98
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,470
The case is my responsibility as well.

99
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,220
- Are you doing this for Miyashita-san? 
 - No.

100
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,720
She put a wrench in my life. I don't want anything to do with her.

101
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,630
 The two years I spent without her... 

102
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,580
 were nothing but peace and quiet. 

103
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,300
 Yesterday became today, today became tomorrow, 

104
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,100
 and the days started to blend together. 

105
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,700
 Every day that passed was a repeat of the usual routine. 

106
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,710
 No one was there to bother me. 

107
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,180
 This was the quiet life I always wanted. 

108
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,400
 But when Miyashita Sakura tumbled in again, 

109
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,320
 everything started to crumble. 

110
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,350
 My days of peace came to an end. 

111
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,870
 The risk of danger every day is exhausting. 

112
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,390
He said I could stay until forensics gave me a report.

113
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,030
But maybe I'd be overstaying my welcome?

114
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,880
I can't go home, though.

115
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,360
 Still, there's never a dull day with her. 

116
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,980
Tateishi-san, could I stay at your place a bit longer?

117
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,410
They stopped my water and electricity. My gas, too.

118
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,400
- That explains it. 
 - Woah! Ouch!

119
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,540
Are you all right?

120
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,190
Don't scare me like that.

121
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,190
It hurts.

122
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,700
My bad.

123
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,430
Ouch...

124
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,060
- Let's go to the hospital. 
 - You're overreacting.

125
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,480
Ouch.

126
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,640
Are... you okay?

127
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,180
I'm fine.

128
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,640
 Dad! 

129
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,630
-  Dad! 
- Haruto! 

130
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,660
 Haruto! 

131
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,480
-  Haruto! 
 - Dad! 

132
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,990
I can't freeload there forever.

133
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:08,030
Especially because staying there is... 
    

134
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,490
It's way too stimulating.

135
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,030
Sorry, was the coffee bitter?

136
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,700
No, it's perfect.

137
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,050
- Could I have another cup? 
 - Sure thing.

138
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,900
Wait right there.

139
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,150
What?

140
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,820
I said, wait.

141
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,470
Let go!

142
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,010
Ouch.

143
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,950
Ow...

144
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,320
You're a prosecutor?

145
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,990
I'm an attorney.

146
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,650
Happy to meet a fellow lawyer.

147
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,090
Same here.

148
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,080
You don't have to treat injuries, though.

149
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,990
You need to stabilize twisted ankles.

150
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,110
Thank you, but it's only a light sprain.

151
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,360
- There. 
 - Thank you so much.

152
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,300
Oh, right!

153
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,600
Perhaps we'll meet again somewhere.

154
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,070
Yes, I suppose we might.

155
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,560
   

156
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,440
Thanks.

157
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,540
Until we meet again.

158
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,960
And don't strain your ankle too much.

159
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,730
Thank you. Let's definitely meet again.

160
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,100
Yes, let's.

161
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,420
Wow, she's so cool...

162
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,800
Your ankle... hasn't it gotten worse?

163
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,450
I suppose it has.

164
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,630
But I have a good reason for...

165
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,060
Hey, I'll be fine!

166
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,690
You shouldn't strain your ankle any more than you need to.

167
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,800
Well... if you insist.

168
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,520
There.

169
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,910
Can I get you anything?

170
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,930
- Then a glass of water, please. 
 - Sure.

171
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,420
Could you grab one of the snacks over there as well?

172
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,460
- Which flavor? 
 - Strawberry, please.

173
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,530
I changed my mind, I want something warm to drink.

174
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,630
Sure thing.

175
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,040
That tea is bitter. Could you get a different one?

176
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,210
Okay.

177
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,450
   

178
00:15:52,340 --> 00:16:00,220
Don't you  think the local prosecutors are especially harsh on the folks from our firm?

179
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,890
That's because a certain someone pissed off the Chief Prosecutor.

180
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,970
Don't blame your incompetence on me.

181
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,050
Haruto, I wasn't blaming you–

182
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,850
Don't "Haruto" me. We're not friends.

183
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,840
All right, you two.

184
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,620
- Go get drinks together. 
 - No thank you, Sir.

185
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,160
That's an order.

186
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,710
And don't forget the itemized receipt.

187
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,580
Yes, Sir.

188
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,010
I have a fever.

189
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,270
Sorry, my ears are stuffed today.

190
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,820
- I have a– 
 - We're off, Sir!

191
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,110
Cheers!

192
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,990
We're drinking until morning today.

193
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:06,380
- All right, job's over. 
 - Hey, we're just getting started, though.

194
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,300
What a wonderful store.

195
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,680
I'm a regular here.

196
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,570
What now?

197
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,680
You're much more flattering than those newspaper pictures make you seem.

198
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,640
You're a true beauty, that's for sure.

199
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,050
- Here is my resume. 
 - Oh, no need for that.

200
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,340
Let's get to know one another over drinks, yeah?

201
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,640
Say, could you stand for us?

202
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,630
- Go ahead. 
 - Yes, Sir.

203
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,100
Yes, a shorter skirt would probably do.

204
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,960
Think she's job hunting?

205
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Like I'd know.

206
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,690
Excuse me, could I get another beer?

207
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,650
Yes, Sir.

208
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,480
Weren't you heading home?

209
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,900
I suddenly feel like drinking another glass.

210
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,040
   

211
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,190
Who are those people?

212
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,040
They're from a law firm. I'm applying to join them.

213
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,750
Who interviews at a bar? They lack common sense.

214
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,610
I don't care.

215
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm grasping at straws at this point.

216
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,780
That's no reason to entertain those sleaze bags.

217
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,550
Sleaze bag or not, they are the only straw that I can grasp at.

218
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,430
Take your time and find a better job.

219
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,830
I don't have that sort of time.

220
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,630
I can't trouble you as a freeloader any more than I already have.

221
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,670
Miyashita-san, you're hired. Come to our office next week.

222
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,980
Really? Thank you so much.

223
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,040
You'd be the perfect visiting attorney.

224
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,530
Visiting attorney?

225
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,910
You'll visit clients in prison, and listen to their woes.

226
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:20,220
Just give them a bit of your pity, you know?

227
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,320
- Well...
- And here's the thing.

228
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,860
You need to up the sex appeal.

229
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,710
Our clients love short skirts and skimpy shirts, after all.

230
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,050
We're glad to have you. Let's drink till morning!

231
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,930
Sure, let's drink!

232
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,680
Don't ridicule me.

233
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,140
Don't entertain these swines.

234
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,640
It wastes the good alcohol.

235
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,330
- Let's go. 
 - Right.

236
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,830
Was that a highball?

237
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,180
Yes, a strong one.

238
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,420
Damn it...

239
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,170
I'm sorry I caused you more trouble.

240
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,420
I promise to be out of your place by next week.

241
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,700
You're... no trouble.

242
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,640
Let me hire you.

243
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,410
Agh, my head...

244
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,510
♫  I do things like listening to your favorite songs like you do  ♫

245
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:08,830
♫  Or tucking a bookmark into a novel that I don't usually read  ♫

246
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:14,130
♫  The color of my hair and my fashion  ♫

247
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:19,660
♫  I changed everything for you, to suit you  ♫

248
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,820
♫  The cheesy lines like a drama  ♫

249
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,900
♫  Don't suit me, but don't laugh at me even if I try to act like a grown  ♫

250
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,310
♫  All I wanna do is kiss your heart  ♫

251
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,700
- Finally awake? 
 - Whoa!

252
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,440
♫  But you seem close and yet far away  ♫

253
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,570


254
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,870
Wh-Why are you acting so shy?

255
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,290
I don't know why.

256
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:59,110
Quit it. You're not making sense.

257
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,020
Don't tell me. Last night, did we...

258
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,420
No, of course not.

259
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,680
- Well... 
 - "Well"? I'd appreciate a solid answer.

260
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,810
Well...

261
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,190
What have I done...

262
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,660
♫  How far shall I fly?  ♫

263
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,760
♫  I'm sure the world without you  ♫

264
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,410
♫  Is like a fleeting moment  ♫

265
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,100
Yes?

266
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,530
Haruto.

267
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,720
Long time no see.

268
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,150
 Insensitive as I may be, a glance was all I needed to connect the dots. 

269
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,680
 She was the one who betrayed him. 
   

270
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,750
   
 A letter of resignation? 

271
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,790
 I'm sure this is Haruto's own way of taking responsibility. 

272
00:23:54,790 --> 00:24:00,210
 You're brazen. But that's another charm of yours. 

273
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,120
 Haruto, I want to help you. 

274
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,040
 This is my last day here, in this home.
