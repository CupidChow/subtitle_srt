1
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,119
Where are you going?

2
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,390
You can't be going
to work on a weekend.

3
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,820
You don't need to know.

4
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,700
- Where are you off to?
- Well,

5
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,739
I need to go to my office
to take care of...

6
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,510
The guy from the forensic
center called me.

7
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,670
The results must be out.

8
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:16,379
Yes, Ms. Eun.

9
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,980
I didn't find anything useful.

10
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,700
Yes. Would it be possible
to hear the result in person?

11
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,599
Okay.

12
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,799
It's not him.

13
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,140
I'll go see you right now.

14
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,909
Okay.

15
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:44,109
Please tell me your location.

16
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,319
Hi.

17
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,379
It's been a while.

18
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,500
I realized it at once.

19
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,710
She is his ex-girlfriend.

20
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,009
When this kind of thing happens
to people, they are mistaken.

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,750
They think if it's something
they did or a mistake they made.

22
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,349
They think they've become lousy
or boring.

23
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,250
That's not it.
We didn't do anything wrong.

24
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:30,020
This is the fault of the ones
who betrayed us.

25
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,129
She's a woman
who betrayed and left him.

26
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,870
Have you been well?

27
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,710
Aren't you going to ask...

28
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,349
why I'm here?

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,250
No.

30
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,490
I'm...

31
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,020
not really curious.

32
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,490
Do you want to yell at me?

33
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,759
You can swear at me
and tell me I'm brazen.

34
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,569
You can do whatever you want.

35
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:14,729
I'll take the blame.

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
No.

37
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,639
There's no reason for me to do that,
and I don't even want to.

38
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,740
Just tell me what you're here for
quickly.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,169
We never needed any kind of
business to see each other.

40
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,580
I don't know. I'm not interested
in talking about the past.

41
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,110
You're really cold, Ji Wook.

42
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,650
What else do you think
is left between us, Yoo Jung?

43
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,330
Don't do this, Ji Wook.

44
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Let's...

45
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:47,129
You and I...

46
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,800
We can't forget each other and move
on like this so easily.

47
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,500
Don't be mistaken, Yoo Jung.

48
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,039
To me,

49
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,939
you mean nothing already.

50
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,349
Ji Wook.

51
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,349
What should I do?

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,020
I know that you're
going to end up feeling sorry...

53
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,819
after treating me so coldly
like this.

54
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:09,889
Hey, Yoo Jung.

55
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,689
Honey.

56
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,930
I waited ages for you,
but you didn't come.

57
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,800
Who...

58
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,699
I'm his present.

59
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:24,769
His present girlfriend.

60
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,199
You're his girlfriend?

61
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
What...

62
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,709
We've met before, haven't we?

63
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,279
My goodness, you're right.
We've met.

64
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,189
You guys know each other?

65
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,420
Yes.

66
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,490
Yes, honey.

67
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:50,899
Anyway,

68
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,660
you should go, Yoo Jung.

69
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,730
Bong Hee, come here.

70
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,730
Is she...

71
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,040
really your girlfriend,

72
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,199
Ji Wook?

73
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,639
That's none of your business.

74
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,980
I suddenly got dizzy.

75
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,149
I guess it's because...

76
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:13,050
we spent such a
crazy night yesterday.

77
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,519
I guess we took it too far.
I'm so dizzy.

78
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,050
Bong Hee, what were you thinking?

79
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,879
Why did you hold my arm
and act like my girlfriend?

80
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,350
And what "crazy night"?

81
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,420
My gosh, Bong Hee.

82
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,459
Mr. No. Wait, Mr. No.

83
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,930
I was only trying to
repay your kindness.

84
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,439
What?

85
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,670
Don't you remember?

86
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,870
You did the same thing
when I was in the same situation.

87
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:09,939
I did?

88
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,509
When did I...

89
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,350
Bong Hee, you are so...

90
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,750
dirty,

91
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,120
but you're also pretty.

92
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,850
You're dirty...

93
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,350
and very pretty.

94
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:28,689
Give me some wet wipes.

95
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,230
My hands suddenly feel dirty.

96
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,000
- What? Wet wipes?
- Yes.

97
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,529
You remembered it.

98
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,199
You wiped your hands
back then too.

99
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,670
That's right, I did.

100
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,170
I remember very clearly.

101
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,180
Me too.

102
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,579
You saved my face...

103
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,180
in front of my ex-boyfriend
who betrayed me.

104
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,379
I'll never forget that.

105
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:50,649
- Forget it.
- No.

106
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:52,449
- I said forget it.
- It's my memory and my choice.

107
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,850
I don't want to be a part of
your memory.

108
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,019
Don't ever repay me
by doing this again.

109
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
- Why not?
- You don't know?

110
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,730
If you keep doing this,
I'm scared that you might say...

111
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,160
That I'm your wife?

112
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,930
Yes.

113
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,899
I could say that you're
the father of my kids.

114
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,269
You better not say that.

115
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,730
I'll see.

116
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,740
(Humans become hostages.)

117
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,820
- Ji Wook.
- Hey, you're here.

118
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,820
Yes.

119
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,190
Were you reading?

120
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,879
I need to get off...

121
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,549
here.

122
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:36,480
Bong Hee, why are you here?

123
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,149
Did you follow me here?

124
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,149
Exactly.

125
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:42,389
Why in the world am I here?

126
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,659
I know.

127
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,169
Ms. Eun.

128
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,570
Mr. Ji?

129
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,710
What are you doing here?

130
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,309
Did you come here to see me?

131
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:09,110
Am I not allowed to be here?
Is this a private land or what?

132
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,450
Why is everyone asking me
why I'm here?

133
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,480
It's not like I came here
because I wanted to. Gosh.

134
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:17,419
My gosh.

135
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,019
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,429
I shouldn't have taken
my anger out on you.

137
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:23,559
I'm relieved.

138
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,700
About what?

139
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,059
Because I'm not the one
you're angry at.

140
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,529
You're always welcome to let
your anger out on me.

141
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,200
I have a lot of experience
in that field.

142
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,940
I'll keep using you then.

143
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,570
Bye.

144
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,279
I'm...

145
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,389
the head lawyer of this firm.

146
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,059
But these jerks keep excluding me
from every meeting.

147
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,059
They say they're trying
to be considerate.

148
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:57,700
But do they think
I'm stupid or what?

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,129
They're looking down on me
because I've gotten old.

150
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,629
Hey.

151
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,669
Am I playing squash or something?
Am I talking against a wall?

152
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:08,309
- Yes.
- "Yes"?

153
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,879
- No.
- My goodness.

154
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:14,149
My gosh, did Ji Wook
make you mad again,

155
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,250
Chairman Byun?

156
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,649
Shall I scold him for you?

157
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:17,779
Let me scold you first.

158
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,720
Why did you get here so late?

159
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,750
Ji Wook, your glass is empty.

160
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,690
Why do you look so sad?

161
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,460
Are you at my funeral?

162
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,360
This is my birthday party.

163
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:33,659
It's my birthday.

164
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:37,970
Here you go.
This is your birthday present.

165
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,470
It's your favorite wine.

166
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,470
Really?

167
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,769
This is nice. All right.

168
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,179
What about you?

169
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,580
Did you bring nothing?

170
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,950
No, of course not.

171
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:53,379
Happy birthday.

172
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,590
My goodness, Ji Wook.

173
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,860
You even wrote me a letter?

174
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,389
How surprising.

175
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,059
Wait a second. My eyesight
has gotten worse these days.

176
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,059
You wrote me a letter?

177
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,769
(Resignation Letter)

178
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,200
A resignation letter?

179
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,269
My goodness,
you wrote a resignation letter?

180
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,139
Thank you for tonight.

181
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,440
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

182
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,179
- Bye.
- Goodbye, sir.

183
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,179
Thank you.

184
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
Okay, let's go.

185
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,090
Did you call a chauffeur service?

186
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,230
Yes.

187
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,289
Why did you suddenly write
a resignation letter?

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,169
Hey, do I need to tell you
every little thing?

189
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,850

(Cha Yoo Jung)

192
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
You're back.

193
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,070
- Ji Hye.
- Yes.

194
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,080
By any chance, do you know
an attorney named Eun Bong Hee?

195
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,279
Attorney, my foot.
She's the disgrace of this field.

196
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,220
She's a crazy murder suspect.

197
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,620
Eat first. I have no idea
what you're saying.

198
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:35,090
Just a second.

199
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,389
She's the prime suspect
for the District Attorney's son,

200
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:42,730
Hee Jun's murder.

201
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:44,960

("A Judicial Apprentice Who
Killed Her Ex-Boyfriend")

That was Attorney Eun Bong Hee?

204
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:52,669
Yes.

205
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,309
She looks so different in person.

206
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,509
This is who she really is.

207
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,149
I really liked her.

208
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,220
Why do I keep running into her
in unfavorable situations?

209
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,220
My goodness. You liked her?

210
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,230
You sure aren't
a good judge of character.

211
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,600
She's his girlfriend?

212
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,559
Girlfriend? Who? Her?

213
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,269
Does she have a boyfriend?

214
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:26,340
Gosh, for goodness' sake.

215
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,710
What kind of idiot
is going out with her?

I've sent my resume to so many
places but haven't heard a word.

218

Don't worry. Everything
will be fine. Best of luck!

221
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,269
Okay, good night.

222
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,200
I've listened to a lot of music
in the last two years...

223
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,009
in order to find
the culprit's melody.

224
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,309
But this music I'm hearing now...

225
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:41,179
sounds like the saddest music
in the whole world.

226
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
What's up?

227
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,870
Are you hungry?

228
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,669
- Sorry?
- Shall I make you something?

229
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,470
Sure.

230
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,570
By the way, Bong Hee.

231
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:37,230
Why am I doing this now?

232
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:39,169
- Pardon?
- Why am I...

233
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:41,110
always making food for you?

234
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,470
Well...

235
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,340
Because you're
a better cook than me.

236
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:03,659
Don't ask.

237
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,359
I didn't say anything.

238
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,369
You're asking me with your eyes now.

239
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:13,740
Then I'll ask with my mouth.

240
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:15,569
Why...

241
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,940
did you two break up?

242
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,529
One day,

243
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,859
I went to Yoo Jung's...

244
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,829
I went over to her place.

245
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:42,869
And...

246
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,569
I saw her with another man.

247
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,410
- That's all.
- What a wench.

248
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,650
I knew it.

249
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,619
Those who do that with someone else
when they're in a relationship...

250
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,430
should be swept into one place
and beaten up to a pulp.

251
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,029
Gosh, they're total pieces of trash.

252
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:21,039
This must be why people vent
to others.

253
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,609
To have someone side with me.

254
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,579
Shall I curse at them more?

255
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,049
Those worthless pieces of...

256
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,009
Enough. It doesn't suit you.

You can use me whenever you want
to swear at someone.

become famous through a TV show...

at his house.

a murder incident, the police are...

266

investigating people around him and
analyzing CCTV footages...

267

- in order to track down a suspect.
- Were you there by any chance?

What do you mean?

270
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,180

00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:43,589
What do you think the reason is?

274
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:47,160
Why would someone kill a person?

I'm not sure. Well...

276
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,359
I guess everybody has their
own situation and reason.

277
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,230
What kind of situation
can justify a murder?

278
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,869
I'll try to be understanding and say
that there can be a situation.

279
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,440
Then would the killer
who murdered Hee Jun...

280
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,069
and turned me into a suspect
also have had a reason for doing so?

281
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,910
I can't answer that.

282
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:06,980
Oh, you're right.

283
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,480

We've found nothing from the shoes
or anything else.

285

He even left me a message
as a warning.

286
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,190
I'm sure he'll reveal himself
eventually.

287

I'll be sure to catch him
no matter how long it takes.

You're fearless.

291
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,470
What I fear more is not being able
to catch the culprit...

292
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,980
and living as a key suspect
for the rest of my life.

Why are you here?

302
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,170
Mr. Bang told me you'd be here.

303

00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,269
- Why did you go alone?
- Sorry?

the killer together.

Hello.

307
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,009
I heard no fingerprints
nor DNA was found.

308
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,089
That means the culprit is
someone who's pretty meticulous...

309
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:59,319
and who has a good level
of knowledge in forensic science...

being nice to me in a subtle way?

- Why?
- Is that a problem?

316

Well,
I just want to know the reason.

- Hey, kid.

to the mankind.

to the mankind too.

00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,279
What are you looking at?

332
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,309
It's disappointing that you guys
belong to the mankind too.

333
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,880
That's what I think
when I look at you.

334
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
What do you mean?

335
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,420
Are you implying that we don't
even deserve to be humans?

336
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,819
This shows how words aren't
important in understanding others.

337
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,259
Hey, Bong Hee. You are...

338
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:43,559
What? What is it? What?

339
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,269
We were just talking about you.

340
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,470
Funny how we ran into you.

341
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,569
We call this "synchronism".
It's a big word.

342

To simplify, I said,
"Speak of the devil."

behind someone's back.

We were just sharing facts.

345
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,880
That's right. Facts.

346
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,980
The job interview
you and Mr. No messed up.

347
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,819
Why are you bringing
Mr. No into this?

348
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:08,849
Hey. Hey.

349
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,019
Besides, it's you guys who messed
things up, not me.

350
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:14,490
Hold on. Can we talk without
you grabbing us by the collar?

- My goodness.

352

Hey, Ji Wook. I heard you are
going to quit.

353
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,930
You're awesome.

354
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,470
You know you won't be kept on.
You beat him to it!

355
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,740
Let's go. Gosh.

356
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,269
What is it?

357
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,910
You know I'm quite well-informed.

358
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,450
I heard you guys are close
to getting sacked too.

359
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,319
The number of lawyers reached
20,000 long ago.

360
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,019
You sound confident, worrying
about other people.

361
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,390
You should worry about yourselves.

362
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,720
You're on the verge
of losing your jobs.

363

Hey.

364
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,660
- Hey.
- That jerk.

365
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,230
I heard Mr. No isn't respected
in his firm at all.

366
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:30,970
That was bound to happen.

367
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,670
He released the suspect who killed
the son of the District Attorney.

368
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,970
On top of that, he had an argument
with the DA.

369
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,539
He's an enemy of the prosecution.

370
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,910
There's a rumor that he submitted
a letter of resignation.

371
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:43,809
He did it to save his face. He was
going to get fired anyway.

372
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,930
If Ji Wook opens his own practice,
he will go bankrupt.

373
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,160
You're wishing him the worst
scenario possible.

374
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,130
I'm just worried about him.

375
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,269
Bok Ja, you have to stop him
from resigning.

376
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:05,769
I won't ever do a thing
to stand in my son's way.

377
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:08,309
He's smart and distinguished.

378
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,970
I'm sure he can manage everything
on his own.

379
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,039
He can't.

380
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,039
You're too loud.

381
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,210
Don't try to stop him.

382
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,210
Instead, try to support him.

383

with all of your money?

you eat another box...

such a low price?

He said that he was planning to
hire a few more attorneys.

489
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:26,119
I heard he's going to recruit
someone today.

490
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,960
- Really?
- Yes.

491
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,929
(Lee Ho Taekwondo Studio)

492
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:36,900
Attention.

493
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,099
Today, we will practice
for the sixth belt.

494
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:41,840
Jae Won, I want you to give a
shout.

495
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,309
Here we go. Get ready.

496
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,510
One.

497
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,579
Two.

498
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,719
One.

499
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:55,920
Two.

500
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,190
One.

501
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,460
Two.

502
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,489
One.

503
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:04,659
Two.

504
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,699
- I see.
- Oh, my!

505
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:15,500
- Goodness.
- Hey, hey!

506
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:18,039
- Are you all right?
- You startled me!

507
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:20,079
I didn't know you were going
to be startled this bad.

508
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,480
- Shoot.
- Are you sure you're okay?

509
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,750
You did get hurt, didn't you?

510
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,010
Oh, no. What shall we do?

511
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,250
That's all right. I'm fine.

512
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,019
- Are you sure you're fine?
- Yes.

513
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,019
By the way, I'm drunk.

514
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:31,389
- Sorry?
- I said I'm drunk.

515
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,159
Wait.

516
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,360
Excuse me for a minute.

517
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,500
I'll give you a piggyback ride.

518
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,869
- Get on.
- You can do that?

519
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:48,900
Of course.

520
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,320
- Hey, Bong Hee!
- Mr. No.

521
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,360
Are you all right?

522
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:09,960
Are you all right? Are you okay?

523
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
One.

524
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:23,739
I'm asking if you are all right.

525
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,179
Hey, Bong Hee.

526
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,360
Bong Hee. Are you really going
to quit?

527
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,019
Your part-timer didn't even come.

528
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,230
It will be great for me if you help
me until my delivery.

529
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:46,099
But are you seriously going
to be okay with this?

530
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,429
Should I continue even if
it only increases my debts?

531
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,199
I have to retreat for now.

532
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:53,000
See? Getting that instructor license
came in quite handy.

533
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,840
Right? Don't you agree with me?

534
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:00,480
Hey. Do something
about that glasses.

535
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,179
I'm out of contact lenses.

536
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,820
My cosmetics and shampoo
are running out as well.

537
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,090
I ran out of pads that I bought
in bulk when they were on sale.

538
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,289
It seems everything runs out
at the same time.

539
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,760
Hey, I think a parent is here
for a consultation.

540
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:21,860
- Over there.
- What?

541
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:25,030
I see. Hello.

542
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:28,170
You are too young to be a parent.

543
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,440
Are you here for yourself?

544
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,639
No, I would like to consult...

545
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,539
with that instructor over there.

546
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:36,949
Sorry?

547
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,260
So are you done being an attorney
now?

548
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,869
Only temporarily.

549
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:02,710
Don't you think you're giving
up too easily?

550
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,809
It wasn't easy at all.

551
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,710
It's hard to give up on anything,
whether it's work or a relationship.

552
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,780
I don't get it. Even if it was
easy to give up, you shouldn't.

553
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,349
Why are you giving up
if it was a hard decision to make?

554
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,119
It's time for me to compromise.

555
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,960
Then are you rejecting my proposal?

556
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,500
- Sorry?
- Are you dumping me?

557
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,469
- Sorry?
- I told you before.

558
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:34,369
I wanted you to come back
and work for me.

559
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,139
Come back to me.

560
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,469
Come work for me.

561
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,909
I don't understand what you...

562
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,980
Wasn't that a part of your drunk
act?

563
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,320
- It wasn't.
- Did you mean it?

564
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,050
- Yes, I did.
- You're not playing with me, right?

565
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,090
No, I'm not.

566
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:54,320
What are you doing?

567
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,460
Since I can't read your face,
I can't figure out...

568
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,789
if this is a joke or not.

569
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,369
This isn't a joke.

570
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:14,309
Anyway, I will pay you in advance.
So let's go buy contact lenses.

571
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:15,739
You remembered.

572
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,480
I thought you wouldn't remember
because you were drunk.

573
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,219
Then do you remember
what happened next?

574
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,500
What happened next...

575
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500
I don't remember that.

576
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,199
I see. You don't.

577
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,610
Hey, don't act shy.

578
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,409
- Yes, sir.
- Get your things too.

579
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,280
I appreciate your offer,

580
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,079
but I won't accept it.

581
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,949
- What?
- It..

582
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,579
took me a lot of courage to give up.

583
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:59,019
If I have to give up again
after going back to you,

584
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,289
then it would be really hard for me.

585
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,530
Most importantly,

586
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,429
if I go there,
it'll be such a hassle for you.

587
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,730
It'll only make me look shameless.

588
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:19,510
Thank you for coming to see me.

589
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,309
Bong Hee.

590
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,730
You're unique because
you're shameless.

591
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,000
But if you decide
not to be shameless,

592
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,559
how different will you be
from others?

593
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,099
You should think about that.

594
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,079
That was a bit...

595
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:54,710
too cool.

596
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:18,030
I barely mustered up my courage.

597
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:20,739
It was so hard for me...

598
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,710
to give up on both work and Ji Wook.

599
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:05,179
That was quicker than expected.
It took you exactly seven minutes.

600
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,789
Those seven minutes
were very long.

601
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:16,389
Get in.

602
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,269
I forgot to tell you this.

603
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,670
Bong Hee, you do tend to be
a hassle at times.

604
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,739
But that's not all.

605
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,440
Hostage. You're also a hostage.

606
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,909
In order for me to
catch the culprit,

607
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,420
you need to be by my side.

608
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:43,989
A hostage.

609
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,670
Aren't you coming?

610
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,570
I'm coming.

611
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,010
- Exactly.
- I know.

612
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,380
Hey, you're here.

613
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,019
What are you guys doing here
without my permission?

614
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:14,780
- What are you doing?
- Hello.

615
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,389
- Mr. Ji?
- Hi, Ms. Eun.

616
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:18,519
Hey, I haven't seen you wear
those glasses in a while.

617
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,789
I think I've seen you somewhere.

618
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:22,929
I guess Ms. Eun was the attorney
he was planning to recruit.

619
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,059
We're doomed.

620
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,199
What? I'm going to do my best.

621
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:27,659
Bong Hee, this is your seat.

622
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:29,670
- Yes, sir.
- Where did I see you?

623
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,329
I can't seem to remember.
Who is she?

624
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,369
Hello, let me introduce myself.

625
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:34,869
No, don't tell me.

626
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,940
I know you. You're that murderer.

627
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:38,570
She got released due to
lack of evidence.

628
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,980
She's the one who killed
Moo Young's son, right?

629
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,679
Who is that man?

630
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:46,079
- Who is he to slander me like that?
- I don't know.

631
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,880
He's the chairman of
Byun and Partners.

632
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:49,619
No, he used to be.

633
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:52,219
But he doesn't even seem to know
the presumption of innocence.

634
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:53,219
Exactly.

635
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:54,289
That's enough.

636
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,760
Hey, what is she doing here?

637
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,130
Mr. No came to recruit me himself.

638
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,900
Why would you tell him that?

639
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,800
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not crazy.

640
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,199
We'll go out of business
if she works here.

641
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,400
That's a big possibility.

642
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,469
- What's he thinking?
- Mr. Bang.

643
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:11,039
Don't worry, sir. I'll be earning.

644
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,610
Whatever! You guys are so loud!

645
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,739
Everyone, get out of here!

646
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:15,909
I just made up my mind.
I'm going to work on my own.

647
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:16,909
I'm not going to work with
any of you.

648
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:17,980
Do you want me to go?

649
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,150
- No, stay.
- I'm going to stay too.

650
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:22,619
Why are you guys being so loud?

651
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:24,889
My gosh. Don't worry, Ji Wook.
I'll help you.

652
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:25,889
I love you, Ji Wook.

653
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:27,960
Hey, Ji Wook. Wait. Stop.

654
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,400
I didn't get hurt. Don't worry.

655
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,730
Everything will work out well.
I liked Ms. Eun's seat.

656
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:49,139
- A hostage.
- A hostage.

657
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:50,710
You're also a hostage.

658
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,949
I didn't know the word "hostage"
could sound so romantic and sexy.

659
00:46:57,989 --> 00:46:59,489
From a mankind to hostage.

660
00:46:59,489 --> 00:47:02,489
I got upgraded! I got upgraded!

661
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,360
He said I'm a hostage.

662
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,829
My gosh, what should I do?

663
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,429
I'm a hostage.

664
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,570
He's so cool.

665
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,670
My gosh.

666
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,579
Why? Are you hungry again?

667
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,309
No. I got bored, so I was wondering
if there was anything to eat.

668
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:26,349
- Doesn't that mean you're hungry?
- No.

669
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:27,849
There's bread and fruits.

670
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,650
By the way, is Mr. Bang
working with...

671
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,659
That chairman is also
going to work with us, right?

672
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,929
- Probably.
- Gosh.

673
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,000
What about Mr. Ji?

674
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,500
There's ice cream in the fridge.

675
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,289
- Let's talk.
- Get out of my way.

676
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,289
Please spare me some time.

677
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:08,289
No.

678
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,559
I'd like to explain myself.

679
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:12,590
It's too late.

680
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,900
Please listen to me.

681
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:24,440
Do you remember...

682
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,739
burying a time capsule
when we were young?

683
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:29,340
We were immature.

684
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:32,110
Ji Wook.

685
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,349
Let's open that time capsule.

686
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:37,820
Stop speaking metaphorically
and get to the point.

687
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,760
You won't ever get
a chance like this again.

688
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:42,659
Okay.

689
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,960
Let me explain why...

690
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,869
Hey, guys.

691
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:52,969
Hey.

692
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,710
You guys are too young to be
smoking in the first place.

693
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:01,280
But how dare you to throw a lit
cigarette butt in front of adults?

694
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,809
Hey, you jerks.

695
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:05,409
What if this hit his face?

696
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,420
You'll get charged of injuring
someone. Do you know that?

697
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,789
What? I've heard his voice before.

698
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,789
Hey, long time no see.

699
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,019
How's your mom doing?

700
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:15,119
Hey, I told you about...

701
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,590
that stuck up lawyer, didn't I?

702
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,630
- You little...
- Hey, you punk!

703
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:21,960
How dare you.

704
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,099
He's tall.

705
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:28,139
Hey, guys.

706
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,869
There must be a misunderstanding.

707
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:33,139
We were just passing by.

708
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:35,980
We had no intentions of
bothering you.

709
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,510
- Right?
- That's right.

710
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:39,780
You guys should quit smoking.

711
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,719
- You'd be a great shot putter.
- You punks.

712
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:43,050
Hey, stop them.

713
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,190
If we raise our fists first,
we'll get charged too.

714
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,829
That's right. In order to
plead self-defense...

715
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:52,190
They need to hit us first. We also
can't hit them as much as they do.

716
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,260
They shouldn't get hospitalized
for more than three weeks.

717
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,460
Don't hit them too much.

718
00:49:56,769 --> 00:49:59,369
But there's no CCTV
to prove any of that.

719
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:00,570
Then we just have to...

720
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,039
Either fight high school students
and get charged equally or...

721
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:05,440
Be fair and square.

722
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,610
Catch them!

723
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,980
Catch them!

724
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,309
Don't let them go!

725
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:18,619
Beat them up!

726
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:32,369
You little...

727
00:50:32,369 --> 00:50:33,469
Get over here.

728
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,199
Grab his legs. Grab his legs.

729
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,409
Hey, hey!

730
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,619
- You little...
- Gosh, my hair!

731
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,119
Hey!

732
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,360
Hey, cut it out.

733
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,800
Why are you doing that?

734
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,199
Hey, that doesn't hurt.
That does hurt!

735
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:05,630
Hey, stop pinching me!

736
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,579
You jerks.

737
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,219
Are you okay, Ji Wook?

738
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,719
Ji Wook!

739
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,889
Hey, hey.

740
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:27,159
- Hey, I'm older than you.
- Don't pinch me.

741
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,809
All I can say...

742
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,079
is this.

743
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:53,719
I liked her first.

744
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:54,719
Hey, Yoo Jung.

745
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,519
I found this on my way here.
You're...

746
00:51:58,019 --> 00:51:59,090
in my heart.

747
00:52:02,889 --> 00:52:03,960
Ji Wook.

748
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,400
To me, you're more
than just a friend.

749
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,070
What will you do?

750
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:14,369
Will you go out with me?

751
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:16,670
Or do you never want
to see me again?

752
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,679
Well...

753
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,949
Let's... Let's date.

754
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,329
The rest of the story
is really obvious.

755
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,380
I thought...

756
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,909
I could give up my feelings for her.

757
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,860
- Have you eaten yet?
- No, I haven't.

758
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
- Shall we eat?
- I haven't either.

759
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,989
- Let's go eat something.
- Sure, I'd love that.

760
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:12,090
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

761
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,900
- Do you want to come too?
- It's okay.

762
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:21,039
I thought I had given up
my feelings.

763
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:26,510
But...

764
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:29,010
I failed.

765
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:55,900
I couldn't give up,

766
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,210
and that's all there is to it.

767
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:07,880
I thought about it...

768
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:19,760
and realized I'm in no place
to give any excuses, Ji Wook.

769
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,309
I won't...

770
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,690
ever forgive you.

771
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,570
I know.

772
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,179
Despite everything
that has happened,

773
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,079
I can't cut ties with Eun Hyuk...

774
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:19,519
and...

775
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,989
completely hate Yoo Jung because...

776
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,030
Dad.

777
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,570
- I'm telling you.
- Seriously?

778
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:34,570
Of course.

779
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:36,769
- Hey!
- Hey, gosh...

780
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:39,440
Goodness, please don't do this
so early in the morning.

781
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,079
- Oh, my!
- Here, look at this.

782
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:43,010
- Hey, this is how you do it.
- My gosh.

783
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,449
- In the middle...
- You see this, right?

784
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:47,150
I'll give it a slap
and put it over here for now.

785
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,719
Let's start with beer.

786
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:50,019
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

787
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:51,349
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

788
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:52,349
Gosh!

789
00:55:52,989 --> 00:55:55,190
Ji Wook lost.

790
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:57,190
- All right.
- I'm going to drink this.

791
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,230
- Okay, guys. 1, 2, 3. Cheers!
- Cheers!

792
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,230
It's because they mean...

793
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:05,369
everything to me.

794
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:09,539
Because they were my only friends.

795
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:13,010
- You're back.
- Yes.

796
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,679
Let me see your face.

797
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,840
No, it's okay. Go away.

798
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,550
I've been staying up until now
to see your face.

799
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,119
You have to show me...

800
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,480
Got you!

801
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:34,929
The score was about 30 to 2?

802
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:37,900
It was a very fierce fight. They hit
us 30 times when I hit them twice.

803
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,380
Gosh, what kind of scums
did this to you?

804
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,119
You don't need to know.
They're just jerks.

805
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,250
Call me next time. You know I'm
a fourth-degree taekwondo master.

806
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:05,260
It must sting.

807
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:06,530
Just a little more.

808
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,360
Be gentle.

809
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:11,269
Just a bit more.

810
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:14,739
The other side too.

811

Sometimes, it doesn't look
like he suffers from insomnia.

812
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,960
I'll cause a big scene
and lie down on the floor.

813
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,300
You should just flip the desk.

814
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:45,429
Please don't worry.

815
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:48,070
See how the situation unfolds
and lie on the floor if you have to.

816
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,309
I almost got into the drama
department back in college.

817
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:51,539
Oh, is that so?

818
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,280
I'm glad you didn't go that route.

819
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:04,389
Hey, you. You better hire Eun Hyuk!

820
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:10,789
Hey, create a position for him
right away.

821
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:14,300
If you don't, your business will
go bust. Can't you hear me?

822
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:16,530
Hire Eun Hyuk!

823
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,670
- You little...
- Up to you.

824
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,369
What?

825
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:25,309
That brat...

826
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:26,409
Next news.

827
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:28,780
The culprit for the famous chef
Yang Jin Woo's murder...

828
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,550
hasn't been caught yet.

829
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:34,320
The police sent fingerprints
and footprints from the scene...

830
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,750
to National Forensic Service
for analyses...

831
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,889
and plan to narrow down
the suspects as soon as possible.

832
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:40,090
Recently rising to stardom
as a good-looking chef,

833
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:42,489
- I was a fan of his too.
- the news is shocking many fans.

834
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,130
Why?

835
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,429
He's handsome, you know.

836
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,699
- Who?
- Why do you think that?

837
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,630
His acquaintances continue to
give testimonies...

838
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:53,170
Gosh, you have such low standards.

839
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,900
That's what I'm saying.
I can't figure women out.

Has Left Everyone in a Big Shock")

841
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,559
A little while after that,

842
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,360
a suspect for the murder of
Yang Jin Woo got caught.

843
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:26,230
Mr. Jung Hyun Soo.

844
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:30,099
You're under arrest
for the murder of Yang Jin Woo.

845
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:32,570
You have the right to an attorney...

846
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,840
and to resist
an unlawful apprehension.

847
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:36,639
Do you have anything to say?

848
00:59:38,349 --> 00:59:41,880
He could be another wrongly
accused suspect like me.

849
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:46,820
He's our first client.

(Love in Trouble)

852
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,480
This is the definition
of the word "beginning".

853
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,920
The first step
of an act or a circumstance.

854
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,019
Or the first step of an emotion.

855
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,090
Make sure you lock your door.
I might accidentally go in.

856
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,329
I'll prosecute you
for robbery and homicide.

857
01:00:24,389 --> 01:00:28,900
Will anyone be able to really
understand and believe me?

858
01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:30,730
How have you been, Ms. Cha?

859
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:33,070
Let me cut to the chase. Are you two
really seeing each other?

860
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,500
Yes, we are.

861
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:37,440
I knew it. With me around,
Ji Wook would never...

862
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,570
Right, you are around,

863
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:40,840
but I chose her.

864
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,980
The suspect wants me
to take on the case?

865
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,150
Why did you choose me?

866
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:49,949
I thought you might be
my only ray of hope.

867
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:51,389
How dare you smile?

868
01:00:51,389 --> 01:00:54,760
Do you know what day today is? How
could you laugh and smile like that?

869
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,289
Sir, that's...

870
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,730
You can accuse me all you want,

871
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:01,460
but I can't admit
to what I never did, sir.

872
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,199
What happened?
It's okay. You can tell me.

873
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:05,599
I don't want to talk about it.

874
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,139
Will you be okay? All right, then.
