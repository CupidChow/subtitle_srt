1
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,719
What are you about to do, Bong Hee?

2
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,469
Sentencing.

3
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,969
Let's...

4
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,810
break up.

5
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:03,129
When...

6
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,069
did you find out?

7
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,210
How about you, Mr. No?
When did you find out...

8
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,039
about my dad?

9
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,879
Recently.

10
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,550
Then why didn't you tell me?

11
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,819
Why did you suffer all alone?

12
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,319
Because it doesn't matter to me.

13
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,620
What doesn't matter to you?

14
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,219
Nothing matters to me.

15
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,889
To me, it's not important
what kind of person...

16
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,099
- your dad was.
- What if it's important to me?

17
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,629
I'm asking you a question.

18
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,969
What if it matters to me?

19
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,469
All right. Let's hear
it out then. Tell me.

20
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:50,280
I want to know
what matters to you...

21
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,879
and what difference
it's going to make.

22
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,319
It's painful.

23
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,750
What is?

24
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,460
Seeing you suffer because of me...

25
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,189
is hard for me.

26
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,229
Fine. I won't suffer then.

27
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
What else?

28
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:18,039
My dad isn't the kind of a man
you think he is,

29
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,370
but I can't even make that claim.

30
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,750
Okay. Let's think about that.

31
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,419
And what else?

32
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,699
I just don't like this whole
situation we are in.

33
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,400
Don't you get what I'm saying?
I want to break up with you.

34
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't try to change
my mind, and just let me go.

35
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,539
I don't like it too.

36
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,740
I don't understand
what you are talking about now.

37
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,550
No matter what you tell me,

38
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,080
I won't ever let you go.

39
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,780
I don't want to.

40
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,490
It won't work even
if you try to stop me.

41
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,800
No matter how hard you try to
stop me, I'm going to leave.

42
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:02,269
I did well. I did the right thing.

43
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,610
What if I made...

44
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,920
No.

45
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:15,290
I did the right thing.

46
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,399
Where should I head to?

47
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,189
Who is it?

48
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,290
Who is it?

49
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
What's this?

50
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,870
What are you doing here?

51
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,339
Can I sleep over at your house?

52
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,439
Hey.

53
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,949
Hey, what are you doing?

54
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:25,850
How did you know where I live?

55
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:29,089
It's not difficult to find out
someone's home address.

56
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,889
Gosh, I did hear that you
recently moved.

57
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,889
Your place is great.

58
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,300
Let me stay here for a
couple of days.

59
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:42,329
What are you saying?

60
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,370
What's your problem?

61
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,100
This is breaking and entering.

62
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,910
I know that.

63
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,310
But because of a personal issue,

64
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,379
I don't really have a place to stay.

65
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:57,050
There's only one room at
my mom's place.

66
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,819
And I've already started to live
independently,

67
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,189
so I can't exactly move back into
her house.

68
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,850
I'm too old to do that, don't you
think?

69
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Yes, you're right.

70
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,160
- No. But...
- See?

71
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,290
But why do you have to stay at
my place?

72
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,399
Hey, this is all I need.

73
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,829
You can sleep in your own bed.

74
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:16,829
Listen to me. The bed was mine
to begin with,

75
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,439
and this sofa's mine too.

76
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,910
My gosh, this is nice.

77
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,180
Hey.

78
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,139
You...

79
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,410
hate me, don't you?

80
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,980
Yes, I hate you a lot.

81
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,379
The same goes for me.
I really hate you.

82
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,350
Yes, I know that.

83
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,220
But why do you want to stay
at my house?

84
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,220
Go and stay with someone you like.

85
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,830
If I go to someone I like and ask
them if I can stay at their place,

86
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,330
that would be very ill-mannered.
Don't you think so?

87
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,370
I'm glad you know.
It's totally ill-mannered.

88
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,840
Then why do you think I chose to
stay at your place when I hate you?

89
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
What?

90
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,480
Hey, are you trying to get revenge?

91
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:00,509
This is my revenge and
your punishment.

92
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,580
You owe me a lot.

93
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,250
- Hey!
- Shall I list...

94
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,750
all the evil things you did to me?

95
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,950
No.

96
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,470
But you're really useful.

97
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,799
I was very miserable...

98
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,940
and distressed.

99
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,139
After I hurt him,

100
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,210
I was wondering all day...

101
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,250
if I had done the right thing
or not.

102
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,990
I couldn't tell if I was sane
or crazy.

103
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,559
I just really...

104
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,899
wanted to die.

105
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,769
But after seeing you,

106
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:58,070
I really want to start living again.

107
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,340
It's sort of like a will to fight.

108
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,980
"Even she's still alive, so I should
continue to live as well."

109
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,009
- Hey!
- Don't yell at me.

110
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,649
I'm really sad right now.

111
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,629
This is crazy.

112
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,190
Let's...

113
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,899
never break up, Bong Hee.

114
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,600
Even if I tell you to leave me,

115
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:37,940
don't leave.

116
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:11,970
(The Discovery of a Memory)

117
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,370
(The Discovery of a Memory)

118
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:33,590
Hey.

119
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,190
My gosh, you startled me.

120
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,360
Can you put your hand on top of my
forehead and see if I have a fever?

121
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,799
You see, I rarely...

122
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,100
get sick.

123
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,299
But I think I have a fever.

124
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,970
Hang on.

125
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Here.

126
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,149
By the way, Prosecutor Na.

127
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,159
Do you have a car?

128
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Why?

129
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,830
Don't you need a personal driver?

130
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,929
I'm an expert at parking.
I drive really well.

131
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,100
I don't need a driver.

132
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,539
Hey, it says I'm 37°C.
Is this normal?

133
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,340
You're making such a big fuss.
That's pretty normal.

134
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,210
It's only a mild fever.

135
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,580
Really?

136
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,379
Are you sure?

137
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,679
I don't think so.

138
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,620
The meeting time has been
rescheduled to 10:30am.

139
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,889
He wants me to attend the meeting.

140
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,330
So?

141
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,230
He's telling me to come to work...

142
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,299
after all that fuss.

143
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,769
That's good news.

144
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,799
It makes no sense.

145
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,769
How can I go to work like this?

146
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,809
You're really bold...

147
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,549
for someone who has nothing.

148
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,350
- What?
- Don't you get it?

149
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,850
Do you think you'll be able to get
a job at any other companies...

150
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,559
other than that weird and
crazy law firm?

151
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,590
In your dreams.

152
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:16,289
Just forget about your pride
and go to work.

153
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,360
I don't care about your love life
nor am I interested,

154
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,700
but you'll need money to date anyone
in the first place.

155
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,740
Are you going to continue living
your life...

156
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,169
by relying on other people?

157
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,539
You're like a crazy bedbug. My gosh.

158
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
See you.

159
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,879
My gosh.

160
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:01,429
Follow me.

161
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:11,879
Did everyone else go somewhere?

162
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,419
Yes.

163
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,600
I came to give you this.

164
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:36,700
(Letter of Resignation)

165
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,440
To be honest, I was so torn...

166
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,879
about whether I should
submit it or not.

167
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:51,980
But...

168
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
But?

169
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,990
This is the conclusion
I've arrived at.

170
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,019
I apologize.

171
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,529
And thank you for everything.

172
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,130
Agonizing over it
was a total waste of your time.

173
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:10,069
This is your contract.
It clearly states that...

174
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,099
your contract term is two years.

175
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,440
If you want to leave, you can do so
after the end of your contract.

176
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,569
- But...
- I thought you'd at least know...

177
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,079
to separate personal feelings from
work. Was I expecting too much?

178
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,210
Mr. No.

179
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,779
Let's only talk about work today.

180
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,619
I'm not ready to talk
about what happened between us.

181
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,960
Ms. Eun, do you think this job
is like a joke?

182
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,829
No, not at all.
But the situation is...

183
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:44,970
I told you to draw the line between
work and personal feelings.

184
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,970
Don't...

185
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,809
give up work so easily.

186
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:54,650
Your desk over there.

187
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,910
Don't think it's easy
to get that spot.

188
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:00,349
Don't betray those whom you trust...

189
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,089
and those who have trusted you.

190
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:04,019
Work-wise,

191
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,119
I'm really sorry.

192
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,829
But it's not easy to go on
with work as if nothing happened...

193
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:15,569
in a situation like this.

194
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,069
It won't be easy for you either.

195
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,480
Every time you see me,
you'll think about your father.

196
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,740
And every time that happens, you'll
feel guilty toward him and me.

197
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,150
It'll cause you pain.

198
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,220
- So?
- So...

199
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,759
I'm telling you that is the reason
I'm quitting.

200
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,160
No, you're overstepping
your boundaries right now.

201
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,000
That's my problem, and I'll figure
out what to do. So you should...

202
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,470
only worry...

203
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:51,700
about your problem.

204
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,440
All right, let's do this.
I'll let you go on vacation.

205
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,309
Try to think rationally while
you're taking some time off.

206
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,579
I'll do some thinking too.

207
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:07,019
That's the most compromise
I can make.

208
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,289
What's your answer?

209
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:14,460
Yes, sir.

210
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,559
Good.

211
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,430
Get going, then.

212
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,519
(Letter of Resignation)

213
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,460
(Sunho District Prosecutor's Office)

214
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:04,470
I came to see you because
there's something I want to know...

215
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
about the arson case
that killed my parents.

216
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,619
I saw that you were the prosecutor
in charge of the case.

217
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,089
Yes, I was.

218
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,759
I wanted to figure it out on my own,
but it happened a long time ago.

219
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:25,029
And most of the records
have been lost as well,

220
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:28,069
so I thought I should
come and see you in person.

221
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,099
What is it that you want to ask me?

222
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,539
I'll be straightforward with you.

223
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,039
Why were my parents...

224
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,109
murdered?

225
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,579
I thought you'd know that much.

226
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,119
It was a revenge murder to retaliate
for getting prosecuted.

227
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,759
Right, but I really don't understand
that part.

228
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,730
At the time, the suspect,
Eun Man Soo,

229
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,789
was only involved
in a small assault case.

230
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:00,930
Logically, I cannot understand
why he had to get back...

231
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,900
at the prosecutor for being charged.

232
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,000
How would I know the reason?

233
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:12,140
What I know is the fact that he kept
complaining to the prosecution.

234
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:17,049
Then one day, he was found
as a dead body at the arson scene.

235
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,119
If that was the case,

236
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:27,789
how could you conclude
that he was the culprit?

237
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:31,130
Were there any additional
clues or pieces of evidence?

238
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,299
It was because of you.

239
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,470
Pardon me?

240
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,869
Can you recognize him?

241
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,710
This man is the one who...

242
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,809
killed your mom and dad. Okay?

243
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,619
You pegged him as the culprit.

244
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,690
You said yourself
that he started the fire...

245
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,529
and that he killed your parents.

246
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,500
I...

247
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,809
I said that?

248
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,839
Has your curiosity been answered?

249
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,309
It was because of you.

250
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,140
You pegged him as the culprit.

251
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:57,779
What on earth...

252
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,579
did I see?

253
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,960
Gosh, you scared me.

254
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,230
Hey!

255
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,539
Shall I watch it just once?

256
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,390
Why isn't it working?

257
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,559
Bong Hee, you're taking
a video right now.

258
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,529
Oh, really?

259
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:52,599
Look at that face. That was funny.

260
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,069
Why isn't it working?

261
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,910
Bong Hee, you're taking
a video right now.

262
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:05,710
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

263
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:10,910
Just once more.

264
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,059
Bong Hee, you're taking
a video right now.

265
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:21,789
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

266
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,549
Where are we with the divorce suit
of Kim Young Eun?

267
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,250
Well, we can't seem
to come to an agreement.

268
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,390
This week, we are going to ask for a
settlement and property division.

269
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,890
- Next...
- Did you two...

270
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,329
fight?

271
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,630
Did you guys break up?

272
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:07,069
Gosh, I'm not sure if he can
ever take a hint or not.

273
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:08,470
He probably can't.

274
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,180
I mean...

275
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,009
It's not likely...

276
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:17,579
that Ms. Lack of Evidence would
go on vacation by herself.

277
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,420
- Aren't I right?
- You are right.

278
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,750
So I'd like you to go
on vacation too.

279
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:24,650
Please use your vacation days.

280
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,789
It'd be better if your leave
of absence is long.

281
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,059
What do you think?

282
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:30,990
I'll stop talking.

283
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,630
I have no place to go.

284
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:42,670
We should use repeated assaults
in terms of the labor law.

285
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,940
That's right. I agree too.

286
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:47,740
What about Jung Hyun Soo?

287
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:49,279
Is he getting better?

288
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,109
I visited him yesterday,
but he's not getting any better.

289
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,650
The doctor didn't say much either.

290
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,819
- I see.
- You are not going to...

291
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,289
make up with Ms. Lack of Evidence?

292
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:02,789
How pathetic.

293
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,700
I raised you wrong.

294
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:08,200
Darn it.

295
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,779
I'll make sure he uses
his vacation days.

296
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,650
Please.

297
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:23,849
For his long leave of absence.

298
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:43,869
It's 37°C.

299
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,309
This falls in the normal range.

300
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,519
Hey, Bong Hee.

301
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,849
Are you going to sleep all day long?

302
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,289
Wake up. Or I'll kick you out.

303
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,190
Hey.

304
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:09,890
Hey, dummy.

305
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:13,259
Hey.

306
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,470
What?

307
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,410
What's happening?

308
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,049
Was this broken?

309
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Hey, Bong Hee.

310
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,019
Hey, hey. Wake up.

311
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,890
Hey.

312
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,150
Hey.

313
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,119
Bong Hee.

314
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:45,829
Prosecutor Na.

315
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,400
Hey.

316
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,900
How's Ms. Eun?

317
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,670
Over there. Her temperature
hiked up as high as 40°C.

318
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,990
Bong Hee.

319
00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:01,269
I wish this wasn't a dream.

320
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,339
No, it's not a dream.

321
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,059
Does it not suit your taste?

322
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,420
Well...

323
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,559
It's not bad, but...

324
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,960
The owner of this restaurant
is known to be a great cook.

325
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,230
Everyone has a different taste,
you know.

326
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,900
For goodness' sake.

327
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:10,509
How can your son
be nothing like you?

328
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,039
What are you talking about?

329
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,880
When he was a kid,
people used to tell me...

330
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,180
that he and I look exactly the same.
Whenever I went out with him,

331
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,549
more than a dozen people
said that to me.

332
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:21,920
Please only speak the truth.
You went too far with that one.

333
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,950
From his looks to his personality,

334
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,890
I don't know how you can have
a son like him.

335
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,289
Gosh, did you find him
on the streets somewhere or what?

336
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:36,970
No, I didn't.

337
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,769
I'm not his birth mom,
but I raised him with my heart.

338
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,109
Are we good now?

339
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:50,480
I'm really sorry.
I was just kidding.

340
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,319
My mouth got the best of me.

341
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,319
I sincerely apologize.

342
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,859
Gosh, I wish you didn't apologize.

343
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,259
I can't even get mad at you now.

344
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:09,869
Whether you're his birth mother
or not...

345
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:11,700
doesn't change anything.

346
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,170
Every mother cherishes her child...

347
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,740
equally.

348
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,839
Of course.

349
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,779
Do you drink soju?

350
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,950
I usually drink wine.

351
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,660
I'm trying my best
to become friends with her,

352
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,089
but we're so different.

353
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,259
I know, right?

354
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,799
But I do feel bad for her
at the same time.

355
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,829
She's actually tender-hearted.

356
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:49,069
As your future mother-in-law,
she's...

357
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,740
not too bad.

358
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,940
Goodness.

359
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,740
Mom, what are you talking about?

360
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,380
Don't you worry.

361
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,779
I'll be sure to train her,
so you should...

362
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,349
just keep your grip on Mr. No.

363
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:09,160
Mom, the thing is...

364
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,359
Actually...

365
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,359
What is it?

366
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:19,369
Just a second.

367
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,470
Hello?

368
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,609
Sorry? A police station?

369
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,349
She's an attorney.

370
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:37,819
Me?

371
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,890
Hello.

372
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:49,170
He said his taekwondo instructor
is an attorney. It was true.

373
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,170
Yes.

374
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:53,269
So to summarize it,

375
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:55,940
he witnessed a murder incident,
and he is...

376
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,910
the only witness.
That's what you're saying, right?

377
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,680
Show her the CCTV footage.

378
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,910
Yes, sir.

379
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,960
I'll have a look.

380
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,349
You saw the murderer's
whole face, didn't you?

381
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,619
But why won't you tell us?

382
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:44,449
It's all right. You can tell them.

383
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,889
He said he's pleading the Fifth.

384
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,030
Hey, you. Stop watching TV.

385
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,900
It's not that. I really don't
remember his face.

386
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,070
Ms. Eun.

387
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:03,940
Ms. Eun!

388
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:07,409
Hey, you!

389
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:10,679
You, Ms. Lack of Evidence.

390
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:13,679
Who told you that you can
take a leave of absence?

391
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,150
I'm sorry.

392
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,559
But who is the kid?

393
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,630
Is he a kid?

394
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,599
Come on. Everyone can
see he's a kid.

395
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,300
Whose kid is he?

396
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,070
Who are you?

397
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,800
Well, he is...

398
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
Mom.

399
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:36,909
"Mom"?

400
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,519
My dad passed away.

401
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,019
I live with an ugly aunt and uncle.

402
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:53,489
I'm a poor kid
just like Harry Potter.

403
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,389
Why don't you tell
them your name first?

404
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,329
My name is Kim Jae Hong.

405
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,590
Hi, Jae Hong.

406
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:00,800
She's my attorney.

407
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:07,239
Well, that's...
It sort of just happened.

408
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,690
He witnessed a murder?

409
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,829
This is what happened.

410
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,469
How dare you lie to us?
You're too young for that.

411
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:48,239
I don't like him.

412
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,780
But I can understand you.

413
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:59,849
Hey, you. Take your leave
of absence again. Go!

414
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,289
Mr. Byun, you should be the
one taking the leave of absence.

415
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:37,420
Jae Hong asked if there were snacks,

416
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:39,690
ice cream, or anything to eat.

417
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,289
He's just like someone I know.

418
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,829
It's been a while, right?

419
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,400
Has it been a while?

420
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:57,309
Have you been well?

421
00:38:58,539 --> 00:38:59,610
Yes.

422
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,579
Are you really all right?

423
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,449
Of course.

424
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,989
It was nothing to me. You know
how healthy I am.

425
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,170
Right.

426
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,010
Thank you.

427
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,360
I see. Yes.

428
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,889
Then we will take care
of him for a while.

429
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,000
No, we will visit you.

430
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,329
Okay. Bye.

431
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,340
I told you so. My aunt doesn't
care about me.

432
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:13,449
Then he can stay with me
until we take care of his statement.

433
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,590
Oh, right.

434
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:22,929
You should just stay
at your aunt's house.

435
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:27,929
I'm living off someone for now. I do
not think I can take you. I'm sorry.

436
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,230
What about Mr. Byun or Mr. Ji?

437
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:32,940
Mr. Byun went golfing
and Mr. Ji has a trial.

438
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,070
Gosh.

439
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,070
I can't leave this little kid alone
since he's a witness.

440
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,639
I am not little.

441
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,710
Whom are you trying to fool?
Just have your snacks.

442
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,019
What should we do?

443
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,219
Let's do this.

444
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,559
Let's send him to either
Mr. Byun or Mr. Ji's house.

445
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,590
He's too little to...

446
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Leave already.

447
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,599
Go.

448
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,920
Hey.

449
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,050
Listen carefully.

450
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,389
We are on the 1st floor, and the
floor above here is the 2nd floor.

451
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,230
You can't ever set foot
on the second floor.

452
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:33,559
Don't come upstairs or talk to me.

453
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:36,130
Don't ask me to do stuff
for you or walk around on your own.

454
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,239
Just don't do anything.
You should just think...

455
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,969
and stay by yourself.

456
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,909
Make your statement and
leave as fast as you can.

457
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:46,639
Okay?

458
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:54,679
Aren't you thankful that
I'm giving you a ride?

459
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,690
I'm thankful, and I like it.

460
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,500
Look at you. You look great now
that you're smiling and not sick.

461
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,599
I rarely get sick though.

462
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:13,500
You rarely get sick, yet your
temperature was as high as 40°C?

463
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:16,070
Oh, no. You are right.

464
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,510
How did you know that?

465
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,840
I was at the hospital.

466
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:25,079
Wait. I don't remember seeing you.

467
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:28,349
I guess you don't remember
as your temperature soared.

468
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,050
I see. You came to the hospital.

469
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:34,090
Hold on.

470
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,260
Did he...

471
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,860
Yes, I went there with Ji Wook.

472
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,460
No way.

473
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,329
No. What?

474
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,630
What is it?

475
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,199
Unbelievable.

476
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:48,699
Why?

477
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,340
I had a dream.

478
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,050
Wait a second. This was a dream.

479
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:01,320
This has to be a dream.

480
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,570
Oh, no! That wasn't a dream.

481
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,539
Ms. Eun, what's wrong? What is it?

482
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:20,940
After that...

483
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,409
It's been a while, right?

484
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:28,239
Has it been a while?

485
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:31,079
Have you been well?

486
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:32,980
Oh, dear. I can't believe it.

487
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:35,849
What? What is so unbelievable?
I'm really curious.

488
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:40,090
After I dumped him,
I did that to him.

489
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,329
I even told him that I hadn't seen
him for a while so brazenly.

490
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:45,230
No.

491
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,429
I should just die. I should.

492
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,500
Ms. Eun, Ms. Eun!

493
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:56,840
I'm sorry.

494
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,880
If you are truly sorry, stop it.
We might end up in an accident.

495
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,050
Okay.

496
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:49,360
Hey!

497
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,429
Didn't I tell you not to come
upstairs?

498
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:54,059
Go back down.

499
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,639
What? What are you doing?
Don't come near me.

500
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:02,699
Hey, back off. Go away.

501
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,010
What?

502
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,219
Hey.

503
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:23,960
What did you see? Tell me.

504
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,269
What was it that made you...

505
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,130
come upstairs and into my room?

506
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:34,670
It's because...

507
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:36,610
I had a nightmare.

508
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:43,909
You're just a little kid.
You shouldn't be having...

509
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,349
nightmares already.

510
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,289
If I don't testify,

511
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:57,659
will it be impossible to catch
the culprit?

512
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,929
And if the culprit doesn't get
caught because I don't testify,

513
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,500
will that be my fault?

514
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:11,010
It's all your fault.

515
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,280
You need to testify in order for us
to find the culprit.

516
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,750
If the culprit doesn't get caught,

517
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:21,619
it's all your fault.

518
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,460
You just need to tell me what
you saw.

519
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,659
You already know what you saw.

520
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,260
Right?

521
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:39,969
Mister?

522
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:42,739
Yes.

523
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,250
No.

524
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:54,349
You don't need to testify.

525
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,719
Just do what you want.

526
00:46:58,219 --> 00:46:59,690
It doesn't matter whether you
testify or not.

527
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:01,860
Nothing will be your fault.

528
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,230
Okay?

529
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,239
Hey, Detective Park.

530
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,679
Jae Hong says he can't remember
anything,

531
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:24,849
so there's nothing much I can do.

532
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,849
Okay. I'll try talking to him.

533
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,989
But don't get your hopes up.

534
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:35,289
Okay. Okay, bye.

535
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,940
I told him to wait in front of the
school gate.

536
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,679
Hey, guys. Are you guys in
first grade?

537
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,050
Are you in the same class as
Jae Hong in class number three?

538
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:06,050
- No, we don't know him.
- We don't know him.

539
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,960
Okay, thanks.

540
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:14,630
Where is he?

541
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:38,349
What's wrong?

542
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:40,289
Is someone chasing after you?

543
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,360
Hey, Jae Hong!

544
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:48,059
I told you to wait for me in front
of the school gate. Where were you?

545
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:50,230
Come here. Did you get hurt?

546
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:55,869
Hello.

547
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:56,869
Hello.

548
00:48:56,869 --> 00:48:59,469
I just talked to Detective Park
just now.

549
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,179
Detective Park can be quite
stubborn.

550
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:04,380
Yes. Jae Hong can't remember
anything,

551
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,050
but he keeps forcing things,
which made me feel uneasy.

552
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,550
It's okay.

553
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:12,789
You don't need to testify
if it's too pressuring.

554
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:14,389
You know that, right?

555
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:16,860
I can't testify anyway because
I don't remember anything.

556
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,829
Are you okay?

557
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:09,380
By any chance,

558
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:12,579
are you...

559
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,219
and Ms. Eun...

560
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,619
Hey.

561
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:23,360
Don't laugh.

562
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:27,329
I said, don't laugh.

563
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,329
You little... Hey, what do you know?

564
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:32,369
Stop laughing.

565
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,739
Don't laugh.

566
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:36,969
I'm not kidding.

567
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,469
Don't laugh.

568
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:40,280
Are you going to keep laughing?

569
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:55,690
Why?

570
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,829
Did you have a nightmare again?

571
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,599
My gosh, it's okay.

572
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,940
It's okay.

573
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,610
It hurts.

574
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:13,880
Okay.

575
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:22,179
What if...

576
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,219
the culprit...

577
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,619
comes to kill me?

578
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:28,789
No, it won't happen.

579
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,289
That will never happen.

580
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,199
I don't know.

581
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,699
I don't know who the culprit is.

582
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,940
And I don't know if I should
testify...

583
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,969
or not.

584
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:48,679
I'll make sure...

585
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,550
you're safe regardless of whatever
choice you decide to make.

586
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:58,090
But there's one thing you need to
know.

587
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,360
If you just put a seal on this
problem without solving it,

588
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,989
these nightmares might...

589
00:52:04,929 --> 00:52:05,989
continue to haunt you...

590
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,760
even when you grow old and
become an adult.

591
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:30,789
I'm going to testify.

592
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:52,639
Hello.

593
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,179
Hey, did you remember anything?

594
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,579
Are you here to testify?

595
00:52:57,079 --> 00:52:59,150
Yes, apparently. What a good boy.

596
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:01,719
What a rude boy.

597
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:10,429
- At the supermarket...
- Yes?

598
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,869
Jae Hong, you're here to testify.
You can tell us what you saw.

599
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:21,000
It's okay.

600
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,780
It was him.

601
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,360
Me?

602
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:12,889
Why are you doing this to me?

603
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,260
Everyone knows my ringtone.
Stop joking around.

604
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:19,829
Those shoes.

605
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,170
There was blood on them.

606
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,599
I said, I didn't do it.
Why don't you believe me?

607
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,329
Hey, why are you doing this to me?

608
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:00,000
Let go. Gosh, I really didn't do it.

609
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,739
Now, we just have to organize
your statement.

610
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:07,980
You did well.

611
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,309
I'm not sure.

612
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:14,750
I don't remember who it was.

613
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,289
I don't know.

614
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,960
It was that man.

615
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,789
He's the culprit.

616
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:28,530
What are...

617
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:31,570
these two contrasting memories
that popped into my head?

618
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,199
Which one...

619
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,840
is the truth?

620
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,860
Well, Mr. Bang.
Something urgent has come up.

621
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,730
Please take care of the rest for me.

622
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,860
Sure, no problem.

623
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:05,869
Sorry. Don't be scared.
Mr. Bang is here with you.

624
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:07,440
Don't worry, okay?

625
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:09,440
- Please take good care of him.
- Okay.

626
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:18,250
Can you recognize him?

627
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,280
This man is the one who...

628
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,550
killed your mom and dad.

629
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,489
Okay?

630
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,489
This man is the one who
killed your mom and dad.

631
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,829
This man is the one who
killed your mom and dad.

632
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,530
He killed your mom.

633
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:36,699
He killed your mom.

634
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,400
I don't remember who it was.

635
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,800
I don't know.

636
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,179
Yes, Mr. Bang.

637
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,949
Yes, he's still the same.

638
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:05,150
The doctor said there's been
no improvement.

639
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,190
Right.

640
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:10,260
Yes, okay.

641
00:58:11,389 --> 00:58:12,389
All right.

642
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:21,559
(Love in Trouble)
