1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,570


2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,200
I love you.

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,590
I'm in love with you.

4
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,950
Don't...

5
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,030
Don't fall in love with me.

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,220
Why not?

7
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,010
I must ask you for a favor.

8
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,950
Please hug me,

9
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,720
and I'll give you up.

10
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,780
I'll never regret falling in love with you.

11
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,480
 But will I come to regret 

12
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,650
 the courage I lacked to start the relationship with her? 

13
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,800
 Will I regret it some day? 

14
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,210
They swelled because I overslept.

15
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,600
Cold spoons are the perfect remedy.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,760
A cold towel would do you better.

17
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,890
Stop that.

18
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,540
If I'm not allowed to love, then, please, don't be so kind.

19
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,040
Tateishi-san, I decided to heed your advice and give up.

20
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,290
But your kindness hurts me. It causes me to misunderstand.

21
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,410
I'll return to the way I was before I ever loved you.

22
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,810
I understand.

23
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,570
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

24
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,870
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

25
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,350
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

26
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,530
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

27
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,020
♫  Here's the love that I long for  ♫

28
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,520
   

29
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,880
What are you doing?

30
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,110
If I face forward, tears will stream down.

31
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,460
Did something happen between you and Haruto?

32
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,390
- Where are you headed? 
 - To investigate the crime scene.

33
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,210
I'll join you.

34
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,160
Then hurry.

35
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,430
Good luck.

36
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,220
Things often don't turn out the way you want.

37
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,930
Is this a photo stand?

38
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,340
Perhaps there was a picture here.

39
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,700
Why did they bother to take a photograph...

40
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,720
Actually what we are doing now is breaking and entering, right?

41
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,110
We'll be fine. No one visits at this hour.

42
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,860
And why are you two here?

43
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,930
We've come to investigate the crime scene for the accused as defense attorneys.

44
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,560
Without the proper permissions?

45
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,980
Haruto, let me speak with you for 10 minutes.

46
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,460
We're leaving.

47
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,550
I'll report her, and only her.

48
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,710
- Why me? 
 - Because it's up to me to decide!

49
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,160
Mean.

50
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,320
Just 10 minutes.

51
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,430
You get five.

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,770
Inaba has a criminal record.

53
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,350
He pummeled a man to the extent of breaking several ribs.

54
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,590
If no one was there to stop him, he would've killed the victim.

55
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,720
Will you defend a man like him?

56
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,650
You look great in navy.

57
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,600
Perhaps I'll get a navy tie myself when I get out of here.

58
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,220
Inaba-san.

59
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,010
You...

60
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,720
tried to kill a man.

61
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:25,930
Are you suggesting I murdered Haneda-san because I have a criminal record?

62
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,770
To have gone to such extremes requires motive.

63
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:38,210
A motive, and murderous intent.

64
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,220
Well yes, I had every intent to kill him.

65
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,720
Have you ever been unable to protect something or someone you desperately wanted to?

66
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:02,250
That bastard harmed a woman.

67
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,630
Without rhyme or reason.

68
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,780
I only did what I needed to.

69
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,620
Rather than saving anyone, you only imposed sanctions against him, right?

70
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,280
And what's so wrong about that?

71
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,550
I mean... sorry, Sir.

72
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:33,480
I admit, I had lost my cool at that time.

73
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,330
I had certainly gone overboard.

74
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,010
I apologize for lashing out,

75
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,410
but please believe me.

76
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,840
I did not murder Haneda-san.

77
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,920
I would not turn to violence without reason.

78
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,480
Again?

79
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,770
There.

80
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,020
 I learned something new from dining at Haneda's restaurant. 

81
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,040
So your frequent visits paid off.

82
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,630
Don't tell him.

83
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,460
What's your intel?

84
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,990
Haneda was a womanizing scumbag.

85
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,160
And every scumbag like him has a woman to clean up his mess.

86
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,790
The chef and his elder sister.

87
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,460
She was the one who found the body.

88
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,920
All right. Let's reassess Haneda's every action.

89
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,950
Yes, Sir.

90
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,420
I found something!

91
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,960
Tateishi-san, I found it!

92
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,760
Excellent. Great work.

93
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,760
Great work.

94
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,750
The button seen here proves the accused was at the scene of the crime.

95
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,110
Yes, he dropped this button.

96
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:16,050
However, I believe he dropped it the day before, when he made a delivery to the victim's home.

97
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,360
- That is only a speculation. 
 - As is your claim that he dropped it upon committing murder.

98
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:33,380
Haneda Ai-san. You discovered your younger brother's body at around 1 p.m. correct?

99
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,680
Yes, Sir.

100
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:41,410
And you are absolutely certain you visited the victim's home at 1 p.m.?

101
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Yes, Sir.

102
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,110
This is the security camera footage of the additional evidence we submitted.

103
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,280
The car initially went unnoticed, as it was parked behind the victim's home.

104
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,680
Ma'am. This is your vehicle, is it not?

105
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,770
Yes, Sir.

106
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,350
This footage is from 10:13 a.m.

107
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,150
Which is just about the estimated time of death.

108
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:20,250
Earlier, you claimed you arrived at the victim's home at 1 p.m.

109
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,250
So I will ask again. Did you arrive at 1 p.m. or at 10 a.m.?

110
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,050
I do not know.

111
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,900
You "don't know"?

112
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,130
Then allow me to rephrase the question.

113
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,100
Your brother, Ryujiro-san, played with the hearts of many women.

114
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,140
And cleaning up his mess always fell on your shoulders.

115
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:57,110
Fed up with his actions, you murdered your brother. Did you not?

116
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,960
- No, Iー 
 - Witness!

117
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,200
- Tell us the truth. 
 - Judge. He is interrogating her with baseless accusations.

118
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,270
His questions stem from rational doubt.

119
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,190
Continue.

120
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,610
Please, tell us the truth.

121
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,030
Sir, I am innocent!

122
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,420
I simply wished to keep my brother's truth...

123
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,860
His abhorrent actions from the public eye.

124
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,300
 When I arrived at his home... 

125
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,720
 my brother was already dead. 

126
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:54,630
 And on display was footage of my brother, violently assaulting a woman. 

127
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,850
 That is why I made it look like a robbery. 

128
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,210
I only wished to protect my family's reputation!

129
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,930
And who will protect the reputation of the woman he abused?

130
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,000
Of the falsely accused?

131
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,760
Tell me, who?

132
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,460
That is all.

133
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,350
There.

134
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,910
Don't get me wrong. I was only removing your tie.

135
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,680
Good night.

136
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,980
Just five minutes.

137
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,430
Could you stay by my side?

138
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,200
Good morning.

139
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,220
Morning.

140
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,620
- You can't. 
 - Why not?

141
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,780
No, you can't.

142
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,260
- Don't. 
 - Why?

143
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,430
- I said you can't! 
 - Why not?

144
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,250
- You can't! 
 - Quit pushing.

145
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:37,280
I declare the accused, not guilty.

146
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,700
Thank you.

147
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,320
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers!

148
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,040
Congratulations.

149
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,350
I owe it to you all. Thank you.

150
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,010
This is truly a relief.

151
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,310
Please, dig in.

152
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,570
- Yes. 
 - Sounds good.

153
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,420
- I'm starving. 
 - Go on.

154
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,090
Yes. Tateishi, speaking.

155
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,240
Yes, that case is already...

156
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,110
Are you allergy to shrimp?

157
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,460
- The size doesn't matter, right? 
 - Of course, not. Shrimp is shrimp.

158
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,040
- Even eating a small one causes symptoms. 
 - Right.

159
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,660
Understood. I'll be there right away.

160
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,050
This is delicious.

161
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,380
- This is so good, Sir! 
 - You're leaving?

162
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,350
It's urgent.

163
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,780
- Didn't we take a video, too? 
 - Yes.

164
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,340
May I see this video?

165
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,790
Of course.

166
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,990
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

167
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,870
 Everyone, say cheese! 

168
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,640
-  Oops, it was a video! 
 - Seriously? 

169
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:38,140
 When the incident occurred, I had been eating lunch at a cafe I frequent. 

170
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:42,800
 A couple was celebrating a birthday with friends behind me. 

171
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,110
 What if he came here to find the couple's photo 

172
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,630
 not on the day of the incident but after that? 

173
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:29,300
 What if his alibi was nothing but a lie? 

174
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,160
 I... 

175
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,140
 I may have let a criminal get off scot-free. 

176
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,340
Where are you headed?

177
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,900
Home.

178
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,180
Everyone else fell asleep.

179
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,020
How about another round, just the two of us?

180
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,390
- Family? 
 - Yes.

181
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,600
Unfortunately, I have none.

182
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,170
Both my parents have already passed.

183
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,960
And you, Tateishi-san?

184
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,600
Likewise. Do you have a lover?

185
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,730
No, I have no one special in my life.

186
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,380
Could you introduce me to someone?

187
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,410
I have no one to introduce.

188
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,760
♫  I changed everything for you, to suit you  ♫

189
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,220
Is Miyashita-san currently seeing anyone?

190
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,960
♫  Don't suit me  ♫

191
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,160
I'm not certain.

192
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,620
She's a wonderful individual.

193
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,510
How so?

194
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,340
I think I'll invite her out to dinner sometime.

195
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,350
♫  But you seem close and yet far away  ♫

196
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,780
Please look into it confidentially.

197
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,120
Yes, Sir. Leave Inaba-san's case to me.

198
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,520
Did something happen to Inaba-san?

199
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,150
It's nothing you need to know.

200
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,300
I still don't get it.

201
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,640
Does the culprit hate my guts or something?

202
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,210
You wish to know why?

203
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,620
It's because you were a witness.

204
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,570
 But by then, you had left your place. 

205
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,830
 You didn't even notice we crossed paths. 

206
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,020
 I've been watching you all this time. 

207
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,660
 I'm also the one who murdered Haneda. 

208
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:00,020
 So long as you never catch on to my identity, 

209
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,680
 I can remain a "good person." 

210
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,540
What do you think, Inaba-san?

211
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,850
I wonder.

212
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,110
You alone believed in my side of things, Miyashita-san.

213
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,720
I would like to thank you somehow.

214
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,880
You give me too much credit. I was only doing my job.

215
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,020
No, not at all.

216
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,370
You flatter me.

217
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,000
Yes? Oh, go ahead.

218
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,300
Would you like to grab a meal with me sometime?

219
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,880


220
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,940
 Why do you insist on protecting me? 
   

221
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,900
 Because something doesn't seem right. 

222
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,510
 I'll give you a hand. 

223
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,550
 Here, laugh. 

224
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,730
 What if something happens to you? 

225
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,930
 What happens to me? 

226
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,040
♫  Is kiss your heart  ♫
