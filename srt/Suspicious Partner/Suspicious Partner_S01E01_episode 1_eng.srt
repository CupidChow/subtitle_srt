1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480


2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,920
 For some reason, he was always there to help me. 

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,820
 For some reason, she always got me involved. 

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,300
 Perhaps everything from the moment we met was a mistake. 

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,570
 Perhaps we were better off as strangers. 

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,080
 And yet, we met. 

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,830
 Yes, we did. 

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,440
 I, with him. 

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,170
 And I, with her. 

10
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,550
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

11
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:01,040
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,450
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

13
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,720
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,370
♫  Here's the love that I long for  ♫

15
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,710
   

16
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:39,270
 The next stop is Jozai South Park. Jozai South Park. 

17
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,810
Excuse me.

18
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,110
You just groped me, didn't you?

19
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,770
Pardon?

20
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,420
I felt your right hand, right on my behind.

21
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,060
Yes, this hand exactly.

22
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,000
No, it wasn't me.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,430
Judging from where you were standingー

24
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,750
Molesting is punishable with six months of penal labor

25
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,960
or a fine of up to 2,000,000 yen.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,780
Not 2,000,000 yen.

27
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,920
500,000 yen.

28
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,590
- A repeat offender would know. 
 - No!

29
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,900
   

30
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,800
I'm telling you, it wasn't me.

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,790
If anything, I'll help catch this–

32
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,840
Excuse me. Could you report him for me?

33
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,700
Of course.

34
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,690
I'll be getting off here, too.

35
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,560
I'm innocent.

36
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,400
Excuse me, this is my stop as well.

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,510
 Sir, I did nothing. 

38
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,650
 I swear I'm innocent! 

39
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,960
 Hey. Hey, you! 

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,170
   
   

41
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,500
 An hour ago, I received an anonymous message. 

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,810
   

43
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,040
 It said my boyfriend would be at this hotel. 

44
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,090
My apologies, I was caught in some trouble.

45
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,180
What happened? That's unusual for you.

46
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,770
It was the absolute worst, Sir.

47
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,090
I was mistaken for a molester.

48
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,330
- A molester? 
 - I am innocent. It was a mistake.

49
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,150
- Be careful. 
 - Sir, it was a mistake.

50
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,410
Still.

51
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,480
How many times does this make it?

52
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,060
You're not fooling me anymore.

53
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,180
I'm not cheating on you.

54
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,240
Then explain the situation just now.

55
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,840
Men have their needs, you know?

56
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,570
- Who do you think you are? 
 - I admit I was wrong.

57
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,860
I won't do it again, all right?

58
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,710
Hey, wait.

59
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,070
Let's calm down and talk this out.

60
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,600
Fine. I'll follow your lead.

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,950
I'll cheat on you, and see if we should break up or not.

62
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,830
- What? 
 - I'm sleeping with the first person I bump into.

63
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,170
Okay. See you.

64
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,620
 Close call. 

65
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,410
 I look so pathetic. 

66
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,960
 Kill me now. 

67
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,300
Shall we go?

68
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,540
 What? 

69
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,410
 Wait a second. 

70
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,670
You're from the bus.

71
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,040
Yes, let's go.

72
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,050
Hey, wait!

73
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,200
Just letting you know, I am a third-degree black belt in karate.

74
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,840
And I'm no molester.

75
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,910
Says the man still touching me.

76
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,650
I'm innocent.

77
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:23,420
I can't really forgive rotten molesters either.

78
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,090
That's all.

79
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,660
One more thing.

80
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,550
You really shouldn't do that with anyone you bump into.

81
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,510
Make sure you treasure yourself.

82
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,570
That was a great one-liner, even for me.

83
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,310
What now?

84
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,610
Could you please play along, just a while longer?

85
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,230
Thank you for your assistance.

86
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,390
But could I say one thing?

87
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,270
I do not sleep with just–

88
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,030
I'll make do without the explanation.

89
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,150
I feel sorry for you so let me treat you to a drink.

90
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,870
No need.

91
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,000
 ­  

92
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,460
   

93
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,430
 No texts from anyone. 

94
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,300
I only came to return this.

95
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,930
 Oh? He's a good guy after all. 

96
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,180
Here. Cheers!

97
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,790
That's good.

98
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,020
I said, drink up. Come on!

99
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,530
Come on! Drink!

100
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,420
Don't throw with your food.

101
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,140
Hey, you're sort of good looking. Let's kiss.

102
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,420
- Pucker up! 
 - Too close, too close!

103
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,030
Where am I?

104
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,990
 ­This sucks! 

105
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,640
   

106
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,100
 Their "needs"? 

107
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,420
 Who do you think you are? 

108
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,500
 I admit I was wrong. 

109
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,180
 I won't do it again, all right? 

110
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,630
 I painfully understood exactly how she felt. 

111
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,390
I really didn't need to meddle.

112
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,710
   

113
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,110
 Let's start from a clean slate, where no one knows who I am. 

114
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,940
Excuse me.

115
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,680
   
   

116
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,780
My name is Miyashita Sakura. It's a pleasure to meet you.

117
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,050
I see our apprentice is full of energy. Wouldn't you agree?

118
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,360
N-Nice to meet you.

119
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,110
You look mighty familiar.

120
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,550
I have an average face.

121
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,380
Do you often ride the bus headed for Oyamadai?

122
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,280
No, I commute by bike.

123
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,900
Do you often visit the Kasugai Hotel?

124
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,370
No, I prefer traditional inns to hotels.

125
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,740
Are you a beer person?

126
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,300
I prefer wines.

127
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,590
Why did you leave without a word?

128
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,780
Did you want me to stay for breakfast?

129
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,570
I mean, what are you referring to?

130
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,720
You finally cracked.

131
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,130
Then may I ask one question?

132
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,070
Go ahead.

133
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,170
Not here.

134
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,070
Here is just fine. We have nothing to hide.

135
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:47,090
Did we perhaps... do... do it?

136
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,940
It's a war zone in there.

137
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,800
What's wrong, Yoneda-san?

138
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,780
Nothing. Just fine.

139
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,710
Ouch...

140
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,050
I'm so sorry! Are you all right?

141
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,120
No need to apologize to him.

142
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,040
Hi.

143
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,480
Sensei Umehara is forbidden from entering, right?

144
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,860
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Then please call security right away, Yoneda-san.

145
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:35,480
You're terrible. This is why you're called the "Dreadful Prosecutor."

146
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,920
The Dreadful Prosecutor?

147
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,520
He's known for his heinous, oppressive examinations in court.

148
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,080
At least, that's Prosecutor Tateishi's reputation among attorneys.

149
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,560
You got stuck with a tough cookie. My condolences.

150
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,740
More.

151
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,030
More.

152
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,850
I do this out of love. I want you to gain experience.

153
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,240
I appreciate it, Sir.

154
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,090
 What's so enjoyable about molesting someone? 

155
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,680
   

156
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,220
 Scumbag. 

157
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,780
Come in.

158
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,560
I've brought the suspect.

159
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,880
You look familiar.

160
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,140
 Excuse me. Could you report him for me? 

161
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,910
 Of course. 

162
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,390
It was you!

163
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,990
How dare you act all innocent?

164
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,280
Ugh...

165
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,480
Isn't that your ex-girlfriend?

166
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,190
My dark past. Come on, let's go.

167
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,100
♪ I am going to kill you, kill you ♪

168
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,150
♪ I am so going to kill you ♪

169
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,960
Quit it with that weird song.

170
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,640
Sorry, I'll get back right away.

171
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,740
No need to rush it.

172
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,260
You're always doing a fine job, after all.

173
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,850
Pardon?

174
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,940
Say, you're the man from the hotel.

175
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,370
I must truly thank you.

176
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,920
For what?

177
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,110
When I set eyes on her, it was love at first sight.

178
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,680
My life has become much more fulfilling since I've met her.

179
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,110
So I am truly grateful to you.

180
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,010
Thank you.

181
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,460
Why is your hair a mess?

182
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,730
Let's go.

183
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,000
What in the world am I doing?

184
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,990
Sir, what was that just now?

185
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,330
There are many ways to exact revenge.

186
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,640
One is to live happily, without a care for your ex.

187
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,470
In fact, that may be the best revenge of all.

188
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,760
Why are you so kind to me?

189
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,850
 When you've been betrayed by someone important to you, 

190
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,850
 your instinct is to blame yourself. 

191
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:19,680
 You wonder if you have any faults, or if you've done your partner wrong. 

192
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,980
 In other words, you take all the blame on yourself. 

193
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,140
 I would know; because I've gone through this as well. 

194
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,930
 Your partner's betrayal isn't your fault. 

195
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,540
 The fault lies solely on the one who betrayed. 

196
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,640
 None of this is your fault. 

197
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,500
   

198
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,260
He's annoying.

199
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,020
Incredibly so. And yet...

200
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,470
   

201
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:45,140
♫  I do things like listening to your favorite songs like you do  ♫

202
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,470
But I can't remember. Did we actually do anything that night?

203
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,480
♫  The color of my hair and my fashion, I changed everything for you,  ♫

204
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,850
I need fresh air.

205
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,820
 Every happening occurs for a certain reason. 

206
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,070
 However, sometimes that reason isn't all too clear.  

207
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,530
♫  don't suit me  ♫

208
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,260
♫  But don't laugh at me even if I try to act like a grown-up  ♫

209
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,390
 Trouble could be brewing under your nose, and you'd never know it. 

210
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,710
 That's exactly what happened to me back then. 

211
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,060
♫  But you seem close and yet far away  ♫

212
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,570
I'm craving beer.

213
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,720
It's all gone...

214
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,390
Sakura!

215
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,100
Sakura!

216
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:18,650


217
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,610
Good evening.

218
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,210
 Paying cash left no record. 

219
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,710
 The power outage stopped the cameras. 

220
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,110
 The part-timer didn't remember my face. 

221
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,550
 There was no evidence I left my home. 

222
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,970
Can't wait to crack open a cold one.

223
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,930
 That night... 

224
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,640
Ouch...

225
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,490
Sota?

226
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,910
What are you doing here?

227
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,100
Sota.

228
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,480
 I became accused of murder. 
   

229
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,460
   

230
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,760
 I'm innocent. 

231
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,040
 I leave this case to you. 

232
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,170
 Put that woman behind bars. 

233
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,610
 You're the only one who can save me, Tateishi-san. 

234
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,790
 I've been assigned as her defense attorney. 

235
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,740
 No matter how you look at it, we're tied by fate.
