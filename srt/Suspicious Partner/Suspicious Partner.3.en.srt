1
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,509
Some love begins...

2
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:40,710
without the owner of the heart
realizing that one's love has begun.

3
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,890
Just like the spring breeze
and moist rain drops,

4
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,960
our hearts slowly get soaked with
love whether we realize or not.

5
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,829
Love gets into our heart.

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,060
When I realized it, he took a corner
of my heart all of a sudden.

7
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,370
- Is this all true?
- Are you the murderer?

8
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,939
Do you admit the charge?

9
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,269
How do you feel now?

10
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,769
- Please give us a comment.
- Share a word.

11
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,840
- What was your motive?
- Please answer our questions.

12
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,420
Some say for one to fall in love,
0.2 second is more than enough.

13
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,819
The time I needed to fall in love...

14
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:24,959
It was only 0.2 second.

15
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,730
It's the love you fall in love
at first sight.

16
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:34,469
(Sunho District Prosecutor's Office)

17
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,469
This is why I'm going
to confess my love.

18
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,170
I'll confess that I love him.

19
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,310
You are the only present
I can move forward to,

20
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,510
my only love, and my destiny.

21
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:47,810
I think that we...

22
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,250
met by fate.

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,790
I also think you're my destiny...

24
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,790
An ill-fated encounter.

25
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,390
So...

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,060
let's never cross paths again.

27
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,150
Hey, Bong Hee.

28
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,789
I wanted to give you this.

29
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,689
What is this?

30
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,330
This tea is good for insomnia.

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,530
How did you know
that I have insomnia?

32
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,729
For about two months,
I used to work for you as...

33
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,099
your trainee prosecutor.
I was bound to find out.

34
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,610
Believe it or not,
I know you quite well.

35
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,979
I didn't delve into your private
life or pry on you. Don't worry.

36
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,120
By the way, considering how you
can't sleep, you don't look tired...

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,319
or have dark circles.
Did you know that?

38
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,990
At a glance, people might think
you sleep like a baby at night.

39
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,590
It makes me realize the importance
of skin once again,

40
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,490
and I'm rambling on, aren't I?

41
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,490
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

42
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,530
You must be, but go on...

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,770
whether you want to ramble on
or have something to say.

44
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,800
This will be the last time anyway.

45
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:19,169
Last time...

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,979
There are so many things
I'm sorry about.

47
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,280
I mistook you for a pervert before.

48
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,210
Because of me,

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,319
you were fired from your position.

50
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,120
I'm sorry for everything.

51
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:36,889
Okay.

52
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,919
And I'd like to thank you too.

53
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,289
To me, you are a hero,
Prosecutor No.

54
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,699
I won't swap you for Iron Man.

55
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,800
Really?

56
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,930
Yes.

57
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,129
And...

58
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:52,840
I like you.

59
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,669
And?

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,340
And... What was it?

61
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,810
Oh, right. The real culprit.

62
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,949
I think I ran into the real culprit.

63
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,319
What?

64
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,080
But you don't have to worry
about that.

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,090
From now on, I won't be bother
or harm you in any way.

66
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,389
I will take care of this on my own.

67
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:14,030
You lost your job because of me.

68
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,659
It doesn't matter
if I lost my job or not.

69
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,100
You should've told me
if you saw the real culprit.

70
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,199
Well... I wasn't completely certain.

71
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,399
What are you not certain about?

72
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,699
Well...

73
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,170
We sort of met through a song.

74
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,670
A song?

75
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,079
The sound of the whistle I heard
on the night of Hee Jun's murder.

76
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:36,050
I also heard it in court.

77
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,620
I believe that
the real culprit came to my trial.

78
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,060
The whistle...

79
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:46,720
What kind of song was it?

80
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,339
Gosh.

81
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,620
Is this music from an unknown
world?

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,990
How should I put it?
This is quite unique.

83
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,089
Repeat it again.

84
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:16,790
Again?

85
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,790
Yes.

86
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,089
Gosh, this is bitter.

87
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,850
Gosh, this isn't good.

88
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,490
This is bitter and not tasty.

89
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,399
Hey, stop it. That's enough.

90
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,399
Stop with this odd melody.

91
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,870
What does he look like? Did you see
his face? How old does he look?

92
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,079
- Well...
- Yes?

93
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,509
I won't accept your help again.

94
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,649
- What?
- You went through a lot for me.

95
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,949
I will take care of this on my own.

96
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,889
You don't have to worry about that.

97
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,990
I wasn't worried about you.

98
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,860
I was just curious.

99
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,930
Goodness. Bong Hee,
you don't know anything.

100
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:41,209
Seriously, this is so bitter.

101
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,990
You eat, sleep, and breathe...

102
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,490
in a place where my son was
murdered. You are alive and well.

103
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,659
How dare you be alive?

104
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,470
I'm also heartbroken...

105
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:53,200
about what happened to your son.

106
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:55,710
I really mean it.

107
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,679
However,

108
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,480
I really didn't do it.

109
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,710
I know that you don't believe me,

110
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:05,620
but that doesn't mean...

111
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,450
I can admit something I didn't do.

112
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,190
I didn't find any evidence that
proves you didn't murder my son.

113
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,860
With all due respect,

114
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,399
there is no evidence
that I murdered him.

115
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,559
There is.

116
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,399
Only if No Ji Wook didn't
mess up the trial,

117
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,070
you would have been in prison
serving time for your crime.

118
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,610
That evidence...

119
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,470
was fabricated.

120
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,480
What?

121
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,840
Please forgive me...

122
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:35,679
for saying this.

123
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,580
However,

124
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,450
the prosecution has
to prove my guilt.

125
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,019
According to presumption
of innocence, I'm innocent.

126
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,490
If you believe that I'm guilty,

127
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,830
the prosecution ought
to prove that.

128
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,230
There is no responsibility
on my side...

129
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,330
to prove that I'm innocent,

130
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,299
but...

131
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,870
I'm going to prove my innocence.

132
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,669
I'll do it for myself,

133
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,240
Prosecutor No,

134
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,879
and my mom.

135
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:09,509
I will...

136
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,679
catch the real culprit for you
and Hee Jun. I'll make sure...

137
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,039
I don't know
how you won my son's heart...

138
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,409
with what kind of means
or abilities.

139
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:39,580
I was wondering how you put
No Ji Wook under your spell...

140
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,809
to get you out and regain
your freedom so brazenly.

141
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,809
I get it now.

142
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,120
Now I know that
you aren't a typical girl.

143
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,149
- District Attorney.
- However,

144
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,490
you are going to regret
acquiring your freedom again.

145
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:57,330
I'm going to catch you
by all means.

146
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,100
I'm definitely going
to punish you.

147
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,230
As long as you and I are alive,

148
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,840
I'm going to make you suffer,

149
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,139
and I won't forget to punish you.

150
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,590
(Late No Young Suk)

151
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,019
Dad.

152
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,860
I resigned.

(Late No Young Suk)

154
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,899
Before I could even solve
the last case as a prosecutor,

155
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,970
I quit.

156
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,970
What? You want to be like me?

157
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,210
Yes, when I grow up,
I'm going to be just like you.

158
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,710
My goodness, what an honor.

159
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,879
There is no greater honor than a son
wishing to be just like his father.

160
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,690
I'm sorry that...

161
00:11:58,289 --> 00:11:59,519
I failed to become like you.

162
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,289
I'm sorry for...

163
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,330
not keeping my promise.

Welcome, No Ji Wook!

166
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,409
My gosh.

167
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,740
Why are you doing this to me?

168
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,350
I'm sincerely welcoming you
because I really like you.

169
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:03,289
Get lost.

170
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,389
No, wait.

171
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:08,090
What? Tell me anything you need.

172
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,799
I told someone that we have
an ill-fated relationship.

173
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,870
You did? To whom?

174
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,600
- Just listen.
- Okay, I will.

175
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,769
It's fine as long as
I'm not the one.

176
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:21,210
You're the worst one ever.
I already hate you.

177
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,240
My gosh.

178
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,580
Anyway, after I said we have
an ill-fated relationship,

179
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,610
I told that person to never show up
in front of me. But the thing is,

180
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,850
I need to ask that person something.

181
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,450
So if I contact that person first...

182
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,490
Come on. That'd be humiliating.

183
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,649
- Do you think so?
- Of course.

184
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,259
That'll make you seem very light.

185
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,159
But it'd be nice.

186
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,429
If it were me, I'd like it. I'd be
more touched and excited...

187
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,259
if someone called me after
saying that they won't.

188
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,629
That's how I felt when you
contacted me first.

189
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,600
The less you expect,
the bigger the surprise.

190
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,269
Get lost.

191
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,409
That's what I'm talking about.
You say that and then call me again.

192
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
It makes me have butterflies
in my stomach.

193
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:02,779
Hey.

194
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,679
Just because I act like
nothing happened,

195
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,049
don't get delusional and
actually think that way, Eun Hyuk.

196
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,789
Okay.

197
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,629
- Please disappear.
- But Ji Wook...

198
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,529
This is also my office.

199
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,970
This is your desk. That's my desk.

200
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:23,830
Where should I disappear to?

201
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,850
Bong Hee.

202
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,409
Do you want to eat lunch with us?

203
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,950
- Hey, stop it.
- Hey.

204
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,220
You can't ask her.

205
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,149
Let's go.

206
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,129
I decided to listen to all the music
in the world...

207
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,259
until I find the source of
that melody.

208
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,610
I even sent a message to
the culprit.

209
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,409
I let him know that
I was looking for him,

210
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:05,039
so he should come find me.

211
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:06,440
Hey, culprit.

212
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,250
Let's have a
head-to-head battle.

213
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,259
This is the only place the culprit
left a trace.

214
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,620
Where did the culprit go after that?

215
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,299
No way.

216
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,740
I heard culprits return to
the crime scene.

217
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:16,549
Bong Hee?

218
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,480
Mr. No?

219
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,919
You scared me. Why didn't you
tell me who you were?

220
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,620
You didn't ask me.

221
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,830
How could you not reveal yourself
at such a shady place like this?

222
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,860
Then am I supposed to
say my name out loud while I walk...

223
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,100
when nobody even asked me
who I am?

224
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,269
It's a shady place.

225
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,129
I mistook you as the culprit.

226
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,240
You're the one who came here
alone at this hour.

227
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,870
I was looking for criminal evidence.

228
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,539
Are you worrying about me?

229
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,120
No. Of course not.

230
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,080
Of course, you wouldn't.

231
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,910
My gosh.

232
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,000
Why did you come here, Mr. No?

233
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,940
The fact that a
competent prosecutor like me...

234
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:48,569
failed to solve his
last case felt...

235
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,109
How should I put it?

236
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:54,279
It hurt my pride and made
me feel uncomfortable.

237
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,180
I see.

238
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,079
I'll help you restore your pride by
finding the source of that melody...

239
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,390
Forget that. I'll give you the
CCTV footage of the court.

240
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,519
So check the culprit's face and...

241
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,819
I never saw his face.

242
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,400
You said you saw him.

243
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,329
I did, but I told you that...

244
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:16,400
I met him through a song.

245
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:19,400
He passed me by on a bicycle, and
in court, I only heard the melody.

246
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
What?

247
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,240
Don't ever say the
word "melody" again.

248
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,980
Why are you getting angry?

249
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,579
Okay, fine.
What did the bicycle look like?

250
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,549
What kind of bicycle was it?
What does it look like?

251
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:34,380
All bicycles look alike.
They have two wheels.

252
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,250
I didn't know that there was
a difference.

253
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,910
My goodness, I had no idea.

254
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,009
I thought you had a clue
or something.

255
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,279
I was so curious to know
what that was.

256
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,180
Because of that, my insomnia
got worse, and I couldn't work.

257
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,289
I even sacrificed my face
and came here.

258
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,890
My gosh, Bong Hee.

259
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,960
That's why I said
I'll solve this on my own.

260
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,930
How are you going to solve it?
Tell me how!

261
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,799
Coming here at this hour?

262
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,400
You're making me think that
you're worried about me.

263
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,470
You're right.

264
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,339
Does that mean you're not mad
at me anymore?

265
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:38,150
You told me to get lost and said
we have an ill-fated relationship.

266
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,279
So I thought I'd never get to
see you again.

267
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,289
That's true too.

268
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,019
Sorry?

269
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,259
As someone who was
your mentor and guardian...

270
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,289
for two months,

271
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,299
I did worry about you
quite a lot. But...

272
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,799
it ends here.

273
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,670
I'm not worried about you anymore.

274
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,470
So please don't cause trouble...

275
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,869
and live safely.

276
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,289
I'm really going to find a clue.
I'm going to find the culprit.

277
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,390
I might visit you after that.
That's okay, right?

278
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:24,059
I'm going to become successful,
and I'm going to repay you.

279
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,130
I'm going to change
our relationship...

280
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:32,400
from an ill-fated one to a good one.

281
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,069
(Interpretation of a Juristic Act)

282
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,009
I lived a diligent life.

283
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,029
And sometimes,
when I had a tough time...

284
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,099
I'm so happy.

285
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,369
Congratulations on getting
appointed. I'm so jealous.

286
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,740
Why are you jealous? I'm not
the only one who got appointed.

287
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:45,839
You all have been scouted
to a law firm too.

288
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,440
All of us did pretty well.

289
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,380
Except for someone.

290
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,789
From time to time when I felt
like life was suffocating me,

291
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,359
I took a little break...

292
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,369
by peeking at you.

293
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:19,809
Okay.

294
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,349
That way. Yes, good.
Pull it a bit more towards you.

295
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:24,380
Okay!

296
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,119
Let's secure it now.
Go ahead and secure it.

297
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,519
(Looking for a witness)

298
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,190
Okay, okay. I think it's good.

299
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,519
Thank you for your help.
I got it done easily thanks to you.

300
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,259
Are you the witness by any chance?

301
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Are you going to call the police?

302
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:42,529
Thanks anyway.

303
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:50,069
(Please call this number.)

304
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,039
(Add to contacts)

305
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,650
(Restraining Order)

306
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,250
Goodness, this is...

307
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,750
Well...

308
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,859
I get that the injured party
isn't budging about settling,

309
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:09,859
but you can't threaten him
like that.

310
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,230
A sincere apology and
self-reflection should come first.

311
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,130
Of course, he won't accept your
apology, but that doesn't mean...

312
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,599
We're a victim in this too,
Attorney No.

313
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,269
Think about it. Why are they
turning it into such a big deal?

314
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:21,140
He just punched him a couple
of times.

315
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,970
Why are they treating him
like a brutal criminal?

316
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,140
Don't make it sound like
they just tussled. Look at this.

317
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,140
He's been instigating the bullying.

318
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,579
He's in for confinement and group
assault as well.

319
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,579
The victim was released
from the ICU only recently.

320
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,750
He deserved to get beaten up.

321
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,750
Be quiet.

322
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,819
He's saying that guy deserved it.

323
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,220
He should've behaved himself
to begin with.

324
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,460
Everyone loses it
when someone gets on their nerves.

325
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,490
Aren't I right?

326
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,359
We're not asking him to settle
for free.

327
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,829
I offered to pay his hospital bill
and all. He said, "It's not enough."

328
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:47,200
They obviously want more money.

329
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,569
I get that they're poor,

330
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:51,569
but how can they try to make money
off of their injured son?

331
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:54,970
Anyway, my son's future
is in your hands.

332
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,210
Please make sure he gets suspension
of prosecution or sentence.

333
00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:00,539
Okay, let's say we can get out of
this. But what about the next time?

334
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,349
After his upcoming birthday, he'll
no longer be considered a minor.

335
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:04,609
What do you mean...

336
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:07,180
I'm a lot more experienced
than I seem.

337
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,349
I passed the exam very young.

338
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:12,660
I mean, I passed the bar exam
before I even graduated.

339
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,759
What a show-off.

340
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,289
Yes, I'm showing off.

341
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,400
Because I have a lot of experience
as a prosecutor, I've seen jerks...

342
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,859
I mean,
I've seen many boys like you.

343
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,170
Hey, isn't this your third case?

344
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,500
I see here that you almost raped
a girl and threatened her...

345
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,609
- with money to get out of it.
- That girl was a gold digger.

346
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:30,839
Right, of course. I'm sure
he's never done anything wrong.

347
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,809
- It must be everyone else's fault.
- Goodness.

348
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,380
You've been backing him up with your
money and connections all along,

349
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,450
and you'll continue to do so.

350
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,920
He's never had to reflect on
or think about what he's done wrong,

351
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,750
and it'll be the same in the future.
And your son will...

352
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:45,119
continue to commit bad deeds without
even realizing that they're crimes.

353
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,019
If he gets in huge trouble
that can't be sorted out,

354
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,759
you'll send him to a school abroad.
Then he'll get into drugs...

355
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,329
and won't even be able to graduate.
After that, he'll return to Korea...

356
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:56,000
and exercise violence against those
who are poorer and weaker than him.

357
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,230
Then he'll pay
his way out of it again.

358
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,369
Hey, everything will be okay. Your
mom will take care of everything.

359
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,740
Ma'am, you'll have to make sure you
live longer than your son does...

360
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,710
because you'll have to clean up
after his mess all your life.

361
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,779
For goodness' sake!

362
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,849
Money take cares of everything.
What an amazing world we live in.

363
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,259
Well, you know.

364
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:22,529
I'm just saying.

365
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,559
That's how the world is.

366
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,970
Shall we...

367
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,170
start over from the beginning...

368
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,369
with a refreshed mindset?

369
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:36,509
Let's start from "a sincere apology
and self-reflection".

370
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,009
Attorney No!

371
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,940
You're no longer a prosecutor.
You're an attorney now.

372
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,950
It's already been two years since
you gave up your prosecutor badge.

373
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,950
Why are you still
acting like a prosecutor?

374
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,190
Who are you to demand
self-reflection from your client?

375
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:57,059
Look at you. "I won't listen."

376
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,529
"You can talk all you want."
Is that what you're thinking now?

377
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,400
No, that's not really
what I'm thinking.

378
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,269
You should reflect on yourself.

379
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:08,410
Don't just demand it
from your client.

380
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:10,039
It looks like
you should do it first.

381
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,140
My life motto is,
"Don't ever regret."

382
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,349
But I'm starting to regret...

383
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:16,680
bringing you here.

384
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,319
Good grief.

Let's go for food.

392
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,829
I'm busy.

393
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,230
Let's eat. Come on.

394
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:11,329
(I'm busy.)

395
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,589
I think the food at Goyang Branch
of the District Court is the best.

396
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,359
Then you should eat there.

397
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,460
Why do you come here every day?

398
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,160
I can't go all the way to Ilsan
just to eat...

399
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,259
You have a lot of time on your hands
because you don't have much work.

400
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,630
Aren't I right, Prosecutor No?

401
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,869
I mean, Attorney No.

402
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:48,509
I heard you had a team dinner
two days ago.

403
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,039
Guys,

404
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,079
have you watched the move,
"The Devil's Advocate"?

405
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,049
In that movie,

406
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,089
an attorney...

407
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,859
sells his soul to a devil.

408
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,160
You see, it shows that some of us
are even willing...

409
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,730
to defend a devil
for wealth and fame.

410
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,269
How should I put this?
I think that movie...

411
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,569
captured the nature of attorneys
very precisely.

412
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,680
Anyway, I hate attorneys so much.

413
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,450
Even devils have the right
to be defended.

414
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,660
All of us here, including me,
are attorneys.

415
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:43,859
Mr. No. We rarely get to have
everyone gathered like this...

416
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:45,930
for a company dinner.

417
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:50,069
Ji Wook made the rare
company dinner even more special.

418
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,839
Hey, you're really...

419
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,670
Don't be ridiculous.

420
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,670
Let go, you punk.

421
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,009
Why are there so many
attorneys in this world?

422
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,849
You used to criticize prosecutors
so much when you were a prosecutor.

423
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,049
Now that you're an attorney, you
talk ill of attorneys all the time.

424
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,750
I bet there are countless ridiculous
stories you can share with me.

425
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,450
Prosecutor No. I mean, Attorney No.

426
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,089
Isn't this a bit too salty? I prefer
foods that are low in sodium.

427
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:15,930
Chameleons, lizards, and octopus.

428
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:20,000
Even those creatures change colors
to blend in with their surroundings.

429
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,869
You should at least be on par
with them if you can't surpass them.

430
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:23,970
For goodness' sake!

431
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,400
I'm really not cut out for it!

432
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:30,269
I like convicting criminals. I hate
having to defend people so much.

433
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,980
Gosh, I absolutely hate it.

434
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,150
When I was about 5 or 6 years old,

435
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,920
I realized, "I have to do things I
don't want to do at times in life."

436
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:44,250
That's when I learned it.

437
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,190
Goodness.
Don't worry so much, Mr. Bang.

438
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,660
You get hammered down
when you're prickly.

439
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,230
I'm trying to toughen him up.

440
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:54,329
Right?

441
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:59,099
But he'll never become rounded
no matter how much he gets beaten.

442
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,500
Don't you find his consistency
so charming?

443
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,039
I am very consistent.

444
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,569
I've been hating you
so much consistently.

445
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:06,640
Where are you going?

446
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,480
Isn't he so consistently mean?

447
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,720
Which one of you?

448
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,819
Gosh, you just hurt my feelings.

449
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,960
He's doing that a lot these days.

450
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,490
He's just lonely from
being an outcast for a long time.

451
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,660
He talks to the walls
because he has no one to talk to.

452
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,490
I never even run into the one
I miss so much,

453
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,829
but I keep bumping into my enemy
in this hallway.

454
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:00,329
What are you talking about?

455
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:03,500
You don't even get to come here
often because you have no work.

456
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,029
I'm saying I see you
every time I come here.

457
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,500
You have bad comprehension.

458
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,240
You're so...

459
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:10,140
You look so bad.

460
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,279
I get that you're broke, but you
should still try to be presentable.

461
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,640
You have horrible sense of fashion.

462
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,349
It's okay. My clothes are cheap,
but so what?

463
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:19,579
My soul and body are so classy.
They can make up for everything.

464
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,349
Your heels are about
to turn into flats.

465
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:26,160
I saw your heel dangling
when you were walking.

466
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,460
It's fixed.

467
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,759
Are we good now?

468
00:31:32,829 --> 00:31:35,099
We sure are.

469
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,200
The CCTV footage from the scene
which the prosecution submitted...

470
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:44,740
as evidence can't be used to confirm
the identity of the defendant...

471
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,180
Also, seeing that no crucial
evidence such as...

472
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,279
fingerprints or footprints
were found at the crime scene...

473
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:05,059
The defendant is guilty.

474
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,259
He is guilty, Your Honor.

475
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,970
You're saying that he's guilty?

476
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,339
Did I say that?
You must be mistaken.

477
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:18,680
The defendant is not guilty.
He's innocent.

478
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,920
Next.

479
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,319
Case number 2017-G-66390.

480
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,029
I'm so embarrassed.

481
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,400
The defendant admits to his mistake.

482
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,039
He's sincerely regretting
what he did wrong.

483
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,539
He also did his best to
settle things with the victim,

484
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:52,579
and they succeeded in reaching
an agreement.

485
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,809
He has a family to take care of...

486
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:59,720
and no previous criminal records
of the same... Okay.

487
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,519
I'm sorry.

488
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:02,750
He has no...

489
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:07,289
He has no previous criminal records.

490
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:10,430
Please take that into notice,
Your Honor.

491

(Attorney, Defendant)

492
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,029
Mr. Ji?

493
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:45,730
It's been so long.

494
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,730
Have you been doing well, Ms. Eun?

495
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,769
Thanks to you, I'm still alive.

496
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,000
How have you been doing?

497
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:55,339
I'm also still alive, thanks to you.

498
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:58,779
You must've been peeking at Ji Wook.

499
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,210
Peeking?

500
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:02,849
- I was just looking.
- Hey.

501
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,210
Ji Wook's coming out now.

502
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,289
I'll be right back.

503
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,559
Hi, Ji Wook.

504
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,800
Gosh, you can at least say hello.

505
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
No.

506
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,000
I love you nonetheless.

507
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,329
I love you,

508
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,699
Ji Wook.

509
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,639
How pretty.

510
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:37,210
(Shoe repair shop)

511
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,489
Hello, I'm Attorney Eun Bong Hee
who's always ready to...

512
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,889
go and meet you wherever you are.

513
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,030
Yes.

514
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,400
In 30 minutes?

515
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,860
Okay.

516
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,670
Okay. I'll see you in 30 minutes.

517
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,099
Sir, can I have my shoes back?

518
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:04,269
I just started repairing them.

519
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:06,179
Here.

520
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,139
My goodness.

521
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,650
What should I do?

522
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,809
Should I wear these?
No, I can't do that.

523
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,420
Okay.

524
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,500
Hey, Ji Hye.

525
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:28,429
Hey.

526
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:29,900
Where did she suddenly come from?

527
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,300
Don't come near me.

528
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,070
What are you doing?

529
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,769
How pretty. Your feet must be 240mm.

530
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:36,769
So?

531
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:40,510
- What?
- Here. Wear these. There you go.

532
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,409
Just think of this as a small
payment...

533
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:44,980
for always being...

534
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,219
so mean to me.

535
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:48,420
My shoes are over there.

536
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,420
Sir, give her the repaired shoes.

537
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,590
- Who's going to pay?
- She'll pay.

538
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,590
Hey, you crazy wench!

539
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,090
I hope this client is
a normal person.

540
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,730
I really hope so.
Please be a normal person.

541
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:04,269
Up until now,
90 percent of all my clients...

542
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,570
were not normal.

543
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,570
(Attorney Eun Bong Hee)

544
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,170
I want to...

545
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,210
kill my husband.

546
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:13,980
But I don't know how.

547
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,949
I heard that you succeeded in...

548
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,519
killing your boyfriend.

549
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,789
There's so much evidence saying that
you're the one who committed murder.

550
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:29,260
How am I supposed to
prove that you're innocent?

551
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,429
I know you have your ways.

552
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,130
You know how to get away
with murder.

553
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,599
I'm not a professional killer.

554
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,199
I met these kinds of people.

555
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:46,309
My gosh.

556
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,739
My goodness.

557
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,079
Let's put these away.

558
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
It's good, right?

559
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,500
So please let this one be
a normal client.

560
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,969
(Eun Bong Hee Law Firm)

561
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,079
Yes, come in.

562
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,289
I am...

563
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,460
a so-called stalker.

564
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,769
There was a woman I loved.

565
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:46,599
We both liked each other very much.

566
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,570
The story he told me from then on...

567
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,940
was very similar to mine.

568
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,610
Just like how I did,

569
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,349
he also fell in love at first sight.

570
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:09,630
Let's talk, Na Eun.

571
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,360
Don't ever show up again.

572
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,630
- Na Eun.
- Just like me,

573
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,900
- he also had to disappear.
- Hey!

574
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,809
But again, just like me,

575
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:33,050
he kept wandering around her,
and in the end...

576
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,320
I received a restraining order.

577
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:40,789
After that, I haven't seen her
for a year and a half.

578
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:42,889
Then suddenly, yesterday...

579
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,500
It was really a coincidence.

580
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,739
We both pretended like we were
strangers, but it was so awkward.

581
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:03,309
So I thought it'd be okay to say
hello.

582
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,820
Na Eun.

583
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,860
No.

584
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,159
It can't be a coincidence.

585
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,860
I'm sure...

586
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,699
it wasn't.

587
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,300
I admit that running into him
could've been a coincidence.

588
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,210
I made sure that he didn't know
my place nor contact number.

589
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:35,210
But the fact that he got on the bus
cannot be a coincidental happening.

590
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,610
I'm sure of it.

591
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,679
I'm sure he was trying to
stalk me...

592
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,019
in order to find out where I live...

593
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,250
and where I work.

594
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:55,130
(Currently under trial)

595
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,300
Case number 2017-GD-22520.

596
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Plaintiff, Jun Seong Ho.

597
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,239
Defendant, Lee Na Eun.

598
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,940
(Plaintiff, Defendant)

599
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:45,880
According to the medical report
that I've submitted,

600
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,219
Mr. Jun injured his wrist and needs
eight weeks of medical treatment.

601
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,889
He also injured his ankle which
requires four weeks of treatment.

602
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,329
He asks for a compensation
regarding his medical fees,

603
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,329
loss of earnings, and
psychological damage.

604
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:02,329
The plaintiff had received
a restraining order.

605
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:05,800
This happened in the process of his
disobeying of the given orders.

606
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,940
It means the plaintiff
was the cause of his own damage.

607
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,369
The defendant doesn't accept
the responsibility...

608
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,880
for the plaintiff's injury.

609
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,079
Ergo, I ask that you dismiss the
monetary demand of the plaintiff.

610
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,809
After the restraining order
was issued,

611
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,849
the plaintiff didn't stalk
the defendant even for a moment.

612
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,119
The incident happened on a bus
where they met coincidentally.

613
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,650
There is no evidence that
it was a coincidental encounter.

614
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,860
Even if they met out of a mere
chance, isn't approaching...

615
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,530
the defendant a violation
of the restraining order?

616
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,800
Even if the plaintiff approached
first, it doesn't change the fact...

617
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,829
that the defendant physically
harmed the plaintiff.

618
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:37,230
The defendant still doesn't have
the right to harm the plaintiff.

619
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,539
The defendant was
psychologically traumatized...

620
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,369
due to the constant stalking.

621
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:44,010
Your Honor, pushing the plaintiff...

622
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,840
can be seen as
a self-defense mechanism.

623
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,750
Your Honor, when the plaintiff
stalked the defendant,

624
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,179
there wasn't a single incident the
plaintiff caused any physical harm.

625
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,019
Physical harm isn't
the only type of abuse.

626
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,019
Stalking is the definition
of psychological and emotional...

627
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,559
stress and abuse.

628
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,460
The plaintiff only...

629
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,559
observed the defendant from afar.
Don't you think it's too much...

630
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:07,000
to condemn it as stalking?

631
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,130
Why is he looking at me?

632
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,969
Unwanted attention is also
a form of abuse.

633
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,340
When someone whom I don't like
observes and tails me from afar,

634
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,480
the feelings of fright, anxiety,

635
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,480
and unpleasantness can't be
understood...

636
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,550
by someone who hasn't had
the experience.

637
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:29,250
Is this meant for me?

638
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:33,059
Due to the stalking, the defendant
was forced to move constantly.

639
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,159
The defendant also had to cut off
all of her acquaintances.

640
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,199
She even had to give up her job
which she cared and loved the most.

641
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,300
Bingo. This is about me.

642
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,929
Everything was...

643
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,199
her desperate attempt to escape
from the plaintiff.

644
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,380
As I have mentioned before,
it was a coincidence...

645
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:04,789
I knew it.

646
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,860
You knew that I was stalking you,
didn't you?

647
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,829
Everything you say...

648
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,429
is aimed at me under the pretext
of a trial, isn't it?

649
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,469
Plaintiff's counsel.

650
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,239
I was asking you
if it would be possible...

651
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:28,110
for you to settle this incident.

652
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,380
It was the defendant
who refused to settle.

653
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:38,150
The plaintiff, Jun Seong Ho, is
willing to dismiss both criminal...

654
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:41,860
and civil cases if the defendant
makes a sincere apology.

655
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:46,159
The defendant has no intention to
face and apologize to the plaintiff.

656
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:48,000
With this opportunity,
the plaintiff might stalk...

657
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,099
You do not have to worry about that.

658
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:53,800
The plaintiff is currently preparing
to immigrate to another country.

659
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:58,369
If needed, I will submit additional
documents regarding this matter.

660
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:18,989
Good work.

661
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:26,699
Okay. Well, I will contact you
after I talk to my client.

662
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,869
All right. I'll get going.

663
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,539
The door is closing.

664
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:04,210
By the way, Prosecutor...

665
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,650
Hasn't it been so long
since we last met, Mr. No?

666
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,380
It hasn't been that long.

667
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,949
I saw you in court when you argued
that the defendant was guilty.

668
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,320
Oh, that. You saw that?

669
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,130
By the way, why are you being
so formal?

670
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:27,599
You used to call me by my name
and treat me causally.

671
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,170
You were my mentee at that time.

672
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:36,409
That only lasted 2 months,
and I haven't seen you for 2 years.

673
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:40,710
It'd be weirder if I treated you
casually due to those two months.

674
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:44,010
It's not weird. It feels distant.

675
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,679
Of course, you should feel distant.
We are meant to be distant.

676
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,489
Oh, I see.

677
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:51,949
The door is opening.

678
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:52,960
Bye.

679
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,630
That way.

680
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,570
Let me say this again.
After the settlement agreement,

681
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,809
you can't ever ask
Ms. Lee's contact...

682
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,809
or approach her.
Did you understand that?

683
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:19,519
Even after this settlement, the
restraining order and injunction...

684
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:20,880
are still valid.

685
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,489
Don't worry, I won't do anything
that Na Eun doesn't like.

686
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:26,289
But you stalked her.

687
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,000
I just know how she feels
when I look at her.

688
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:39,599
Her outfit, hair,
and the look on her face.

689
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:43,710
From the first day we met, I knew
everything by looking at those.

690
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:46,679
So you don't need to worry.

691
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:48,710
Okay.

692
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,199
With this, it is settled that the
plaintiff will drop the lawsuit...

693
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:11,869
and the defendant will not press
charges or file a lawsuit...

694
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:14,099
for the violation
of the restraining order.

695
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:15,869
Do both of you agree?

696
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:18,940
Yes.

697
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,619
Hey, I will call you later.

698
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,429
Are you going to be okay
on your own?

699
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:44,630
I will be. Thank you, Mr. No.

700
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,769
I'm sorry to leave first.

701
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,300
Don't be. Please go.

702
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:49,639
Thank you for your work.

703
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,210
Sure.

704
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,179
Bye.

705
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,860
He didn't even say goodbye.

706
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,730
Make a U-turn right now.

707
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,739
Mister, please hurry.

708
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,889
Thank you for your work.

709
00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:46,599
How can he smile?

710
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,070
This is the last time
he will see a girl he loves.

711
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:55,400
Even if it ended amicably,
how can he smile?

712
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:57,440
Can that be possible?

713
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,110
The melody.

714
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:11,389
(Attorney Eun Bong Hee)

715
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:17,860
The number you have dialed
is not available at this moment.

716
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:19,929
Please.

717
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:33,039
If you tell me the address,
I can go by myself.

718
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:34,039
How can I...

719
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:36,579
I don't trust
the plaintiff's counsel.

720
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:38,250
Okay, then. Excuse me.

721
00:50:11,179 --> 00:50:13,250
It's just a bad feeling I have.

722
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:14,719
It's highly likely to be nothing.

723
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:16,389
What is your bad feeling based on?

724
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:17,989
The look on Mr. Jun's face.

725
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,960
It wasn't a look someone would have
after letting his loved one go.

726
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,489
Also, small coincidences?

727
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,289
- Coincidences?
- For instance,

728
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,500
the melody before.

729
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,329
You are still obsessed
with the melody.

730
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,699
It's not that.
It's the ringtone of his cell phone.

731
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,570
It's still fresh in my mind.

732
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,840
The song that played on the very
first day I met Na Eun.

733
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,010
In my opinion, perhaps,

734
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,639
Mr. Jun Seong Ho
might be mistaken...

735
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,349
that Ms. Lee Na Eun wore
the same outfit for him...

736
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:47,219
and chose the ringtone.

737
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:49,619
He might be thinking that
these are her signals for him.

738
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:51,690
I think he might be deluded.

739
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,789
I hope you are right.

740
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,070
(Joongnam Apartment Building A)

741
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,769
I'll go in first.
What's the address?

742
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:22,380
Unit 308 in Building A.

743
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,579
Okay.

744
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,150
Hey, Bong Hee.

745
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:33,889
Do not get involved
even if anything happens. Got it?

746
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,190
Okay.

747
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:37,389
You just talked casually to me.

748
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,130
Hey, hey!

749
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,710
Na Eun.

750
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:14,059
I looked everywhere for you.

751
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:15,860
I missed you, Na Eun.

752
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,340
Na Eun, I know everything.

753
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,440
Come on out.

754
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,909
Na Eun, let's talk. Come out.

755
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:31,809
Open the door.

756
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,519
Na Eun.

757
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,280
Na Eun! Na Eun!

758
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,449
Lee Na Eun!

759
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,090
Na Eun.

760
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:42,690
Na Eun, open the door.

761
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:44,929
Come out, so that we can talk.
Na Eun!

762
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,730
Na Eun!

763
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,599
Mr. Jun!

764
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,670
What do you think you're doing?
Are you out of your mind?

765
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:52,670
You're...

766
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:54,340
Don't come closer.

767
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:56,639
Don't interfere, please.

768
00:53:57,309 --> 00:53:59,840
Please don't get in my way!

769
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:03,039
Hey, Bong Hee.

770
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,780
Hold on.

771
00:54:04,949 --> 00:54:05,949
Don't come closer.

772
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,280
Don't come.

773
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:08,719
I said, don't come closer!

774
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:29,599
An attorney...

775
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,639
shouldn't beat up her client.

776
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:36,280
There he is.

777
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,179
- Is he the stalker?
- I guess so.

778
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,679
Please step back.
Move out of the way, please.

779
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:41,880
He looks completely normal.

780
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,880
Go on.

781
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:58,869
Hey.

782
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:02,570
Did everything get sorted out
on the scene?

783
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:04,239
Yes, almost.

784
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,110
How's Ms. Lee? Is she okay?

785
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:07,409
She's okay.

786
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,880
She's actually relieved
that things turned out like this.

787
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:13,480
I'm glad to hear that.

788
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:16,690
Here.

789
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:19,590
Thank you.

790
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,960
I...

791
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,389
I never even thought
about the possibility.

792
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:27,199
Mr. Jun...

793
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,900
I mean, that scum. I can't believe
he's a complete psycho.

794
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:34,670
I thought he looked normal.

795
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,610
Don't beat yourself up too much.

796
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:40,909
You see,

797
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:44,579
those scums usually look
completely normal.

798
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,610
Still,
I can't help beating myself up.

799
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:49,349
We could prevent a big mishap
thanks to you.

800
00:55:50,989 --> 00:55:52,920
Thanks for saying that.

801
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,960
It's true.

802
00:55:57,659 --> 00:55:58,760
Let's get up.

803
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:00,230
You need to give a statement
as a witness.

804
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:02,059
Right.

805
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,969
By the way, do you realize that you
keep talking casually to me?

806
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,070
No.

807
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,469
Because you grabbed the bat,

808
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,579
- Ms. Lee...
- I told you I never hit her.

809
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,239
Why would I hit the woman I love?

810
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,679
- You kept banging on her door...
- Gosh.

811
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:19,579
I'm telling you I never did
such things.

812
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,119
- Why did you pick up the bat...
- Did you see it? Did you?

813
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:26,219
That's the statement we got. How
dare you raise your voice at me...

814
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:30,130
Not being loved back by the one
you love is like torture.

815
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:32,159
But in a way,

816
00:56:32,929 --> 00:56:35,829
being loved by someone
you don't want to be with...

817
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,070
and being forced to love
that person back...

818
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:40,239
could be a bigger torture.

819
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:43,570
How much of it can be called love?

820
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,510
Where does obsession begin?

821
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,210
And I...

822
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,179
- Why is the office in this area?
- At this moment,

823
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,719
whereabouts am I standing...

824
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,789
between love and obsession?

825
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,119
Physical harm isn't
the only type of abuse.

826
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,760
Stalking is the definition...

827
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,429
of psychological and emotional
stress and abuse.

828
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,659
Unwanted attention...

829
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:09,000
is also a form of abuse.

830
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,829
I would...

831
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:13,840
like to give myself
a restraining order.

832
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,070
Arrived at the destination.

833
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:17,769
Ending voice navigation.

834
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:20,380
This is the address according
to the navigation. Is this it?

835
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:21,610
Sorry? Oh...

836
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:24,050
Yes, this is it.

837
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:25,949
Thank you for the ride.

838
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:46,900
I just don't want you to worry.

839
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,769
Other than for work-related things
or bumping into you unexpectedly,

840
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:55,280
I'll stay at least 100m away
from you at all times.

841
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,719
What exactly do you mean by that?

842
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:02,980
I literally meant what I said.
And...

843
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:03,989
And?

844
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:06,889
I'm saying this
in case you got the wrong idea.

845
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,360
I don't like you.

846
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:13,900
I may have looked like I do because
I feel grateful and indebted to you,

847
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,599
but please don't worry
or get any wrong ideas.

848
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,400
I have no feelings for you
whatsoever.

849
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,130
Really. I'm serious.
Please believe me.

850
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,699
Drive safely.

851
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:22,199
Hey.

852
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,449
I couldn't even date him.

853
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,980
How many times do I have
these breakup-like situations?

854
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,000
(If you keep looking for me,
I'll find you first.)

855
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,239
"If you keep looking for me,
I'll find you first"?

856
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,840
(Looking for Witness)

857
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:09,880
(Please call this number.)

858
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,280
"If you keep looking for me,"

859
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,389
"I'll find you first."

860
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,670
(Love in Trouble)

861
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:38,840
Someone was here.

862
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
It's you, isn't it?

863
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,179
Are you worrying about me now?

864
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:46,610
I came because you kept asking, but
I'm not sure if we can do this...

865
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:49,449
No Ji Wook and Eun Bong Hee
were together?

866
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:52,650
I keep feeling that I should
protect Bong Hee. It's annoying me.

867
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,920
I'm going to go back
to my ex-boyfriend whom I betrayed.

868
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:57,760
Come back to me.

869
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,159
Come work with me,

870
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:00,800
Bong Hee.
