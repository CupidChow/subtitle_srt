1
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,159
Hello, I'd like fries and beer.

2
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,460
I had a drink by myself at a bar
that I visit sometimes.

3
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,829
I usually drink alone.

4
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,869
By the way, at the bar, a couple
had a birthday party on that day.

5
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:05,769
They brought a birthday cake
with the candles.

6
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:06,969
Great!

7
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,810
- Do you like the flowers?
- Yes.

8
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,859
There is a saying like this in
Latin.

9
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,670
"If it's false in something,
then it's false in everything."

10
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,169
Mr. Jung Hyun Soo,

11
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:14,509
who...

12
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,009
are you?

13
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,379
Mr. No.

14
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,219
Where are you going?

15
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,419
I thought you already left.

16
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:34,159
But I came back. You ought
to drink with me too.

17
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,060
I already drank a lot.

18
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,360
Just have one more drink. Let's go.

19
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,439
Gosh.

20
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,979
Goodness.

21
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,379
Gosh.

22
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,759
I...

23
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,830
I don't have a family.

24
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:12,300
Everyone in my family left
for some reason.

25
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,169
What about you, Mr. No?

26
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,569
Well, mine too.

27
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,199
Let's just say that something
similar happened to me. Okay?

28
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,210
Okay.

29
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,240
- Have a shot.
- Thank you.

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,139
Pour me one.

31
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,090
Oh, right. Do you have a girlfriend?

32
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,819
A girlfriend? I don't
have a girlfriend.

33
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,759
Why? Are you going to introduce
me a girl, Mr. No?

34
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,129
- No.
- I see.

35
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,259
The only girl I know is...

36
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,030
Ms. Eun here. So I don't think
I can introduce you a girl.

37
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,409
This is what I observed. When people
want to get closer to someone,

38
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:58,240
they ask this sort of private
questions.

39
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,939
- Oh, that was the point.
- Yes.

40
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,650
Do you have a girlfriend, Mr. No?

41
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:04,419
Goodness,

42
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,620
You totally got me
with that one.

43
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,389
You said people ask each other
questions to be closer.

44
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,159
- I want to be friends with you.
- Right, I said that.

45
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:18,100
I see you two playing truth or dare.

46
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,029
Let me in too.

47
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:23,430
I love playing truth or dare.

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,240
Wait, we played it
a little while ago though.

49
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,769
I like playing truth or dare too.

50
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,540
I love Ji Wook!

51
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,709
Beep. Truth.

52
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,649
What's going on?

53
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,879
Are you awake?

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,779
I sincerely apologize.
They're just...

55
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,819
all crazy. If you think of them
as crazy people,

56
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,350
- you'll feel a lot more at ease.
- No, it's fine.

57
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,860
I love it when people are having fun
like this. It's great. I'm serious.

58
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,629
It's very fun
and infuriating at the same time.

59
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,230
- I'll pour you one.
- Thank you.

60
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,500
- This is nice.
- Indeed.

61
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,449
(Untruthful Truth and Dare)

62
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,060
Water...

63
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,439
Water is here.

64
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,930
Water...

65
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,560
I need water again...

66
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,379
Am I...

67
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,009
dreaming right now?

68
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,379
My gosh!

69
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,490
I heard...

70
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,529
it's great for relieving hangovers.

71
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,430
Mr. Bang, I really... Mr. Bang!

72
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,470
You know that I'm very fond of you,
right? You need to know that.

73
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,939
What should I do now?

74
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,949
I said I can do anything
I set my mind to.

75
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,879
I told myself that I'd
give up my feelings for him.

76
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,759
I need to wake up.

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,230
Well, I just...

78
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,870
took water and medicine to her
because you asked me to.

79
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,740
She was disappointed to the point
that she was about to cry.

80
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,410
She really did that?

81
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:16,009
My gosh.

82
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,980
I'll scold her.

83
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,079
Just don't get scolded from her.

84
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,910
You can't scold her.

85
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,220
And it looks like
you got the wrong idea.

86
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,389
I'm not complaining
to you about Ms. Eun.

87
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,220
I'm complaining about Mr. No
who's right in front of me now.

88
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,819
Why... What do you mean?

89
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,889
I honestly have no idea what the two
of you are doing right now.

90
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,500
You said you have another
favor to ask.

91
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,800
Oh, right.

92
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,170
It's about Jung Hyun Soo.

93
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,370
Please see if you can
dig up anything on him.

94
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,779
You mean, our former client,
Jung Hyun Soo?

95
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,910
Yes.

96
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:53,540
Keep it strictly confidential.

97
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,180
Why are you trying to dig up
information on him confidentially?

98
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,550
Just to double-check.
You know how I am.

99
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,949
Gosh, I thought...

100
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,589
those days you used to think you're
still a prosecutor were over.

101
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,620
It wouldn't be a problem
if it was that easy.

102
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,990
Goodness,
you sure have a way with words.

103
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:11,259
Just think of it as conducting
a light background check.

104
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,170
All right. Got it.

105
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,370
Wait, Mr. Bang.

106
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,740
Well...

107
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,410
I'm grateful.

108
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,050
For what?

109
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,750
You know.

110
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,179
Everything.

111
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,090
You gave up being a civil servant
and joined my firm like this.

112
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,090
I'll be sure to pay you well enough.

113
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,029
Running the firm alone must be
financially challenging.

114
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,000
Mr. Byun is rich, you know.

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,559
It's not like he'll take
the money when he dies.

116
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,870
I'm very happy here.

117
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:52,240
I'm working with wonderful people
at a great firm.

118
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,370
I'm really content here.

119
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,269
What's the one thing...

120
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:59,480
you regret the most in your life?

121
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:02,710
Submitting my letter of resignation,
coming here, and meeting all of you.

122
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,850
- You should get back to work.
- All right.

123
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:12,820
Do you need me to check on Jung
Hyun Soo right away?

124
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,690
I'm the only paralegal here,
so I have so much work to do.

125
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,059
Right, you can do it
when your time allows.

126
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,600
I'll see what I can do.

127
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,730
My gosh.

128
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,509
What about Jung Hyun Soo?
What are you looking into?

129
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,980
Why don't you ask Mr. No directly?

130
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:46,090
What about Jung Hyun Soo?

131
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,559
What? Oh, it's...

132
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,029
- Jung Hyun Soo is...
- Yes.

133
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,769
Well...

134
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,570
Mr. No.

135
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:08,879
I'm over the moon.

136
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,720
I'm so thankful.

137
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,090
Whenever I saw Jung Hyun Soo,

138
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,690
I felt as if I was
looking at myself.

139
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,759
I was once pegged
as a murder suspect...

140
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,330
and was locked up, you know.

141
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,070
I felt as if I was looking
at myself from that time.

142
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,470
Thanks to that experience,
I could get him his freedom back.

143
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,379
I think it's so cool.

144
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,350
I also feel truly rewarded.

145
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:46,549
Gosh.

146
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,490
I'm so happy.

147
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,029
Mr. No.

148
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,960
What did you ask him to look into?

149
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,600
Well...

150
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,529
You don't need to know about it yet.

151
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,970
What is it? Why are you saying
I don't need to know it yet?

152
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:11,379
Well, if I tell you the reason,

153
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,809
it'll become something
you need to know.

154
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,009
He was my client too.

155
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,379
Why wouldn't you tell me?

156
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,149
Because I say so.
Because I don't want to tell you.

157
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,450
Because it's up to me.
Are we good now?

158
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,090
- No, we're not.
- Whatever.

159
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,990
Oh, right.

160
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,389
How's...

161
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,360
your hangover? Are you okay now?

162
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,460
I won't tell you.

163
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,159
How can you be so disrespectful
to your mentor?

164
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,100
Mentees take after their mentors.

165
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,669
I'm like this because
I learned from you.

166
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,600
That's not true.
You were always like this.

167
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,639
- I was?
- Yes.

168
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,200
- That was such nonsense.
- Darn it.

169
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,370
"Darn it"? You little...

170
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:10,230
These inquiries are
all from Mr. Ji's existing clients.

171
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,870
The two of you here...

172
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,070
should either defend for free...

173
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,580
or apply to become public defenders.

174
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:20,440
For the next little while, I'll use
my connections I built back in my...

175
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,509
Hey.

176
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,279
Are your stomachs all right?

177
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,649
The last thing we ate, the sausage
or whatever it was... Gosh.

178
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,220
That killed me.

179
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,190
It's coming up.
I can feel it coming up.

180
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,730
Gosh, you made me feel nauseous.

181
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,830
I feel like I'm about to throw up.

182
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,529
We should quit drinking.

183
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:39,399
- I agree.
- Me too.

184
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,870
If I drink ever again,

185
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,529
you can call me her son.

186
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,500
You'll have a son soon, Ms. Eun.

187
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't want a son like him.

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,440
What? Why not?

189
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,740
What's wrong with me?
I'm handsome...

190
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,809
and rich, you silly.

191
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:53,279
Oh, I just want his money.

192
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,350
Let's split it.

193
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,649
You little...

194
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,590
Can we please have a proper meeting
just once at least?

195
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,389
That's my earnest wish
at the moment, okay?

196
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,860
I'm back.

197
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,019
What now? What's wrong?

198
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,690
Did you guys upset Ji Wook again?

199
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,929
Did the trial go well?

200
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,529
Of course. You know me.

201
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,100
Oh, right. Make yourselves available
this evening.

202
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:15,429
I'll treat you all.

203
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,100
I got an exquisite bottle
of wine as a gift.

204
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:19,440
I have champagne too.

205
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,269
I'll prepare whatever you guys want
to have.

206
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,840
Everyone is available, right?

207
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,779
I need to use the washroom.

208
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:26,840
The meeting is over.

209
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,379
Over.

210
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,649
- Well...
- Goodness.

211
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:30,779
You're all in, right?

212
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:36,950
You must know why you're here now.

213
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,620
Yes.

214
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,090
For alleged destruction
of evidence and perjury.

215
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,100
I'm not sure if you're aware that
those are quite serious crimes.

216
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,299
Then shall we begin?

217
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:05,379
Just a second.

218
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,360
I can't help but think that...

219
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,389
something is strange.

220
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,200
Why did you hide...

221
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,100
the picture frame?

222
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:24,899
Something's in there, isn't it?

223
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,240
I think there is.

224
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,679
You can tell me that much,
can't you?

225
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,379
"But if a man..."

226
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,539
- "happens to meet a girl..."
- "Happens to meet a girl..."

227
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,710
"pledged to be married
and rapes her,"

228
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,179
"only the man who has
done this shall die."

229
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,799
The more I think about it,

230
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,830
the more I can't understand why.

231
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,470
Why did that culprit...

232
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,009
do such a terrible thing to
Hee Jun and me?

233
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,049
That's because...

234
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:34,200
you had witnessed something
you shouldn't have.

235
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,899
But unfortunately,
you weren't there.

236
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:48,009
And you couldn't recognize me
when you encountered me.

237
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,389
I'm going to continue to
keep my eyes on you.

238
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,369
If you never find out who I am,

239
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,910
I'll always be remembered
as a good person to you.

240
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:39,930
(Attorney Eun Bong Hee)

241
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,029
Hello?

242
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,440
Ms. Eun, it's me.

243
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:48,109
I was taking a walk in the park
by myself.

244
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,470
As I was freely walking around,

245
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,079
I suddenly felt sorry and thankful
towards you. That's why I called.

246
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,650
There's no need for you to
think that way.

247
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,819
Thanks to you, I finally feel like
I became a proper attorney.

248
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,589
It feels great.

249
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:05,089
- You startled me.
- Is it Jung Hyun Soo?

250
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,390
Yes.

251
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,490
Sure. Of course.
We should meet sometime.

252
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:13,829
Oh, really? Yes, okay.

253
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,869
Yes. Really?

254
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,509
Yes, I'm listening.

255
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:30,109
Yoo Jung, why are you crying
like a baby in the hallway?

256
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,319
Why are you shedding tears
in the hallway?

257
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,890
One day, I'm going to teach you
how to say things nicely, Ji Hye.

258
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,930
- Gosh.
- I see. Okay.

259
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,730
She seemed so cool
when I didn't know her that well.

260
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:50,900
Now that I do, she's quite
a disappointment.

261
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
I'm starting to lose
my respect for her.

262
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:56,339
Yes, okay.

263
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,009
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

264
00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,980
I was just curious. Why did he call?

265
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,079
He just called to thank me.

266
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,809
He wants to meet me
since he's thankful.

267
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,420
I also have all the right to hear
and gain his gratitude.

268
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,079
I really did my best in court.

269
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,349
So let's meet him together.

270
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,319
I'll tell Jung Hyun Soo to
personally give you a call.

271
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,890
I'll tell him to thank you.

272
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,359
So you're going to meet him
all by yourself?

273
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,859
- Can't I?
- You can't.

274
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,430
- Why not?
- We defended him together.

275
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,269
My gosh, I'm sorry.

276
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,490
Don't you think we should
meet him together?

277
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Together...

278
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,519
Why are you afraid to get on the
elevator?

279
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,980
Don't...

280
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,109
touch her.

281
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,519
What?

282
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,549
I understand.

283
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:23,190
I'm sure you need someone to hate.

284
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:25,160
You probably need someone to blame.

285
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,089
But you shouldn't cross the line.

286
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:30,529
If you ever try to hurt her again...

287
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:33,759
I'm not a lowly person like you are,

288
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,029
so I'm only going to use the law
to punish you. But sometimes,

289
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,369
I do tend to become a bit daring.

290
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:43,940
Are you threatening me again?

291
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,779
Yes. I'm threatening you.

292
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,549
So listen to me carefully.

293
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
If you ever hurt Bong Hee again,

294
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,220
I'm going to do the exact
same thing to you.

295
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:02,859
So...

296
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,730
don't touch her.

297
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,470
By the way,

298
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,509
you should take the elevator
for executives in the future.

299
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,309
You're only making your
employees feel uncomfortable.

300
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,109
Bong Hee, let me explain
what happened.

301
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:50,769
Don't ever meddle in
my business again.

302
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,380
How is that just your business?
It's mine too.

303
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,380
It's mine,

304
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:58,349
but it also became yours
because you decided to interfere.

305
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:01,349
So don't ever do that again.

306
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,049
- You're mistaken.
- No, I'm not.

307
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,259
You are.

308
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,799
Even if we didn't
know each other personally,

309
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:15,470
I still would've interfered
and tried to solve this problem.

310
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,329
You already suffered a loss
by doing that.

311
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,069
You lost your job as a prosecutor
and quit your job at the law firm.

312
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,210
What else are you expecting to
go through? Do you enjoy suffering?

313
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:32,349
You're right.

314
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,789
But regardless of what happened,

315
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,859
it was a choice I made for myself.
None of it was your fault.

316
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,599
Now that I think of it,
you might be right.

317
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,039
This really might be...

318
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,710
an ill-fated relationship.

319
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,839
- Bong Hee, I didn't mean...
- This is a warning.

320
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,210
I'm really angry.

321
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:05,549
Just like how I respect and
listen to what you say to me,

322
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,380
I ask that...

323
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,819
you respect and comply
with my wishes as well.

324
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,750
I can't stop having
feelings for him.

325
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,460
This is too difficult.

326
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,329
I'm not really fit for this.

327
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:17,250
All right. Why don't all of us go
home on time for once?

328
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,990
Just like I said before, I will
treat everyone dinner today.

329
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,289
No.

330
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:27,730
Everyone is still hung over,
and it's a mess.

331
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,170
Everyone isn't feeling well today.

332
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,109
I thought so.

333
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,089
You guys...

334
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,259
ate the whole cake
without asking me first.

335
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm going to catch you!

336
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:39,400
Happy birthday,

337
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,470
Eun Hyuk.

338
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,779
Let's see.

339
00:26:58,589 --> 00:26:59,589
Yoo Jung.

340
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,920
Happy birthday.

341
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,730
Three of us used to come here often.

342
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:12,170
So I accidentally stopped by here.

343
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,299
When I was passing by, I saw you
accidentally.

344
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:18,440
I'll just continue my way then.

345
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,150
Why don't I do this?

346
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,549
Can I sit here by any chance?

347
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,660
My legs hurt.

348
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,990
No.

349
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,460
I said you can't.

350
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,599
I got it.

351
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,759
Hey, Eun Hyuk,

352
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,559
happy birthday.

353
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,470
Mr. Ji,

354
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,180
happy birthday.

355
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,230
Goodness.

356
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,470
(H...)

357
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,799
Darn it.

358
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,500
- Sorry?
- What?

359
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,309
That wasn't directed at you,
Bong Hee.

360
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:58,440
I don't care even if it was
meant for me.

361
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:00,109
Hey...

362
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,380
(From Ji Wook)

363
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,750
(H...)

364
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,190
This is...

365
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,430
what I told Ji Wook.

366
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,559
I told him that I left...

367
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,359
because his love wasn't enough.

368
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,500
- What?
- I know.

369
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:26,000
I regret what I said.

370
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:29,569
There's no point in regretting it.

371
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:31,269
You already said it.

372
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,910
You can't take back what you said.

373
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:36,779
You're right. It was my fault.

374
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,880
But I wish you guys won't hate
me this much.

375
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,589
Do you hate me that much?

376
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,559
Yes.

377
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,960
Whom...

378
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,099
do you hate the most in this world?

379
00:29:57,869 --> 00:29:59,099
Is it among one of us?

380
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,009
I...

381
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,109
really hate this person.

382
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,509
I really do.

383
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,150
But despite my hatred,

384
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,690
I have a person...

385
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,230
whom I can't dislike nor hate.

386
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,099
I don't like you.

387
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,220
You jerk.

388
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,319
Happy birthday.

389
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,150
What are you doing?

390
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,380
Hey.

391
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,519
What happened?

392
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,160
You barely make mistakes.

393
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Why were there my footprints...

394
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,059
and a button which I didn't
even leave behind?

395
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:37,700
- Why?
- I don't know either.

396
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,740
I think I must have been flustered
and made a mistake.

397
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,309
A mistake?

398
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:47,579
A mistake?

399
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,849
I get it. Anyone can make a mistake.

400
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,180
Hey.

401
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:56,849
Just once.

402
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:59,190
- They can make only one mistake.
- But...

403
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,460
But what? What is it?

404
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,589
It's nothing.

405
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,890
It's nothing?

406
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,859
Yes, it's nothing.

407
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,200
If this ever happens again,
it won't be considered as a mistake.

408
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,069
I'll consider it as your
intention to betray,

409
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:13,900
fool, and stab me in the back.

410
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:17,339
Then what should I do now?

411
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Hey.

412
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:21,809
Hey, look at me.

413
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:24,549
Look at me.

414
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,990
We need to continue
what we've been doing.

415
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,890
Right?

416
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,160
Three people have disappeared,

417
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,069
and four people will disappear.

418
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,970
Help me out until then.

419
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,170
That's the only way you'll pay for
your mistake, Chan Ho. Right?

420
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:52,380
Do you agree with me or not? What...

421
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,549
What was that, you punk?

422
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,079
My gosh.

423
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,720
Get going. Bye.

424
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,900
I guess he can't fall asleep again.

425
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,039
Mr. Bang, can I have the files?

426
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:27,670
You mean these files?

427
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,670
Thank you.

428
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:33,280
(Attorney No Ji Wook)

429
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,639
I think staying as it is now
isn't that bad.

430
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,179
I've gotten used to seeing him
as only my boss.

431
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,250
I'm glad.

432
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,380
I ended my one-sided love as well.

433
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,550
- You ended it?
- Yes.

434
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,489
I won't like him anymore.
I will just be his fan.

435
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:21,489
You know how the celebrities
have a fan club?

436
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,389
It's similar to that.
I will like him as a fan.

437
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,389
How is that different
from having a crush?

438
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,099
It's different. I don't have
any expectation.

439
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,329
No, as a fan, I can't expect
anything from him.

440
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,699
I just admire him.

441
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,110
Well, I can understand that.

442
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,139
I'm not joking. I think
I really have put an end...

443
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,909
to loving him as a woman.

444
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,719
I am...

445
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,090
about 98 percent over him.

446
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,889
I think I'll love him...

447
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:55,460
until the day I die.

448
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,130
If that's the case,

449
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,599
shall I help you?

450
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,199
Help me what?

451
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,039
There's no one who knows better...

452
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:14,309
how it feels to just admire
someone than I do.

453
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,349
That's a bit sad.

454
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,809
Isn't it?

455
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
Then...

456
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,219
come a little closer.

457
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:26,519
Sorry?

458
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,789
Then start laughing.

459
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,159
- Laugh?
- Yes.

460
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,099
There's a reason for it. Hurry.

461
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:37,030
Laugh.

462
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:39,500
What is this? Should I laugh
just like this?

463
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
What about you?

464
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,210
- Come closer.
- This is a bit weird.

465
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Laugh.

466
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,090
Good job. You ought
to act your age now.

467
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,500
What on earth is this?

468
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,070
Darn it.

469
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,420
Hey! Hey, you jerks.

470
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,559
Why am I washing dishes here
day in day out?

471
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,860
You should win the game then.

472
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:39,400
I won't ever play that game
anymore. You got that, punks?

473
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,260
Where are you meeting Jung Hyun Soo?

474
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:43,300
I'm going to meet him
in his neighborhood.

475
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,409
I couldn't find anything.

476
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:52,980
Just like he said, he doesn't
have a family.

477
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,309
He doesn't have
any acquaintances either.

478
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:59,380
Then can you check if anyone
from his deceased...

479
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,179
family members or acquaintances
was a victim of a crime?

480
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:03,920
Yes, sir.

481
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:33,679
You quit your job?

482
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,780
Yes.

483
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:38,190
I was on a contract anyway,

484
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,789
and I was held
in the detention center too.

485
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,329
I understand what you went through
and how you must have felt.

486
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:46,929
I think I could be of help to you.

487
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,469
No, that's all right. I can't be
a hassle to you anymore.

488
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,670
I didn't get to pay you a lot
for the legal fee.

489
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,900
But I'll make up for that by buying
you meals from time to time.

490
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:57,670
All right then. I will let you
buy me meals from time to time.

491
00:38:58,409 --> 00:38:59,780
I will buy you meals too.

492
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:11,489
Mr. No.

493
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:16,260
Oh, my. Goodness.

494
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,230
How can this...

495
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:23,599
What are the chances
of meeting you here?

496
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,309
Call me if you need help anytime.

497
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:33,409
Then I'm really going to call you.

498
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:35,409
Please do. Don't be a stranger.

499
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,579
- I'll get going then.
- Bye.

500
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:39,579
Take care now.

501
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:45,050
Mr. No,

502
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,389
what are you trying to pull?

503
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,860
What do you mean? What?

504
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,159
This is all but a coincidence.

505
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,159
As if.

506
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,400
All right. I followed you here.
So what?

507
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,739
- Why did you follow me?
- It's because...

508
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,170
I just wanted to.

509
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,980
Tell me what you are not telling me.

510
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,110
Tell me what you and Mr. Bang
are keeping from me...

511
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,480
and what is wrong with Jung Hyun
Soo.

512
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,420
What are your suspicions?

513
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,659
I...

514
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,760
I don't have a family.

515
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,400
Everyone in my family left
for some reason.

516
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,329
Oh, right. Do you have a girlfriend?

517
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:34,139
A girlfriend? I don't
have a girlfriend.

518
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,300
- I see.
- Why?

519
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,809
Are you going to
introduce me a girl, Mr. No?

520
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,210
This is what I observed.

521
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:41,940
When people want
to get closer to someone,

522
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,820
they ask this sort of private
questions.

523
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,320
How can this...

524
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,719
What are the chances
of meeting you here?

525
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:21,719
Mr. No?

526
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:24,219
Yes.

527
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,619
So...

528
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,329
it's only a bad hunch now.

529
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,559
On what grounds?

530
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,360
His alibi is...

531
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Answer it.

532
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,239
I'm sorry.

533
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,170
Yes, Mom.

534
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,340
I'm going now.

535
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,010
Okay. I got it.

536
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:55,119
I had plans with my Mom.
You said something about his alibi.

537
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,619
No, it's all right. Let's talk
when you get back.

538
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:00,260
Let's do that then.

539
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:02,190
I'll get going now.

540
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:12,269
Come on.

541
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:24,250
My firm's CEO?

542
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,280
He's awesome.

543
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,880
Is he handsome? Is he single?

544
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,219
Does he have a girlfriend?

545
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,789
- He's handsome.
- Really?

546
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:36,829
He has broad shoulders,
and he is very understanding.

547
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,329
His eyes gleam like stars.

548
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,400
On the back of his head,
there's a light bulb.

549
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,559
A light bulb?

550
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,769
A halo. Like a light.

551
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,269
It shines like this.

552
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:48,969
Goodness, you are giving
me goosebumps.

553
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:51,010
You are being so childish now.
It's too much.

554
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,610
Gosh, she's making me want to vomit.

555
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,980
I think he was born to give
me a heart attack.

556
00:42:57,579 --> 00:42:58,579
Bong Hee.

557
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,280
He makes my heart have irregular
beats every single time.

558
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:04,449
I turn into a little girl every
single time.

559
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,190
But he rejected me.

560
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,900
Why?

561
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,900
That's just how it ended.

562
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,170
So are you going to give up?

563
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,710
Do you think you'll be able
to meet someone...

564
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,010
whom you can like that much
again in your life?

565
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,610
You don't think I can?

566
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,449
She's head over heels for him.

567
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:41,360
A guy like that doesn't exist.

568
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,690
Except for my son.

569
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,260
Son!

570
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:54,699
Son!

571
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,579
I could've met you inside.
Why did you want to meet here?

572
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,880
There are some weird women inside.

573
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,380
Even just one of them scares me
enough. When they're together,

574
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,579
they really scare me.

575
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,849
What kind of women are they?

576
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:11,190
I was getting a bit of cabin fever
inside.

577
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:14,820
I get to lock arms with you
and see your face like this.

578
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,820
It's so nice.

579
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,460
My goodness.

580
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:21,530
You've lost weight.

581
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,300
Did something happen?

582
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:24,500
Has work been very stressful?

583
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,969
No, I'm fine.

584
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,869
I rarely get to see you these days.

585
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:34,780
I'm sorry I haven't been
able to visit you often.

586
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,780
I'm so fascinated from time to time.

587
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,349
When did you grow up like this?

588
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,489
I know, right?

589
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:46,760
It seems like only yesterday
that you were crying in my arms...

590
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,260
because you couldn't fall asleep.

591
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,760
It's okay.

592
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,929
It's all right, Ji Wook.

593
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,599
I won't go anywhere.

594
00:44:58,599 --> 00:44:59,800
I'm right here for you.

595
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:01,869
I'll never leave you.

596
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:05,340
I'll never disappear.

597
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,880
I'll always stay right by your side.

598
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,019
Sleep, sleep

599
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:16,289
Sleep, sleep

600
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:18,820
You've grown so much, Son.

601
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:21,159
No.

602
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:23,789
I don't feel like I've grown at all.

603
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:25,190
Why not?

604
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,000
Just because.

605
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,329
I'm a coward.

606
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,869
Gosh, no way.

607
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,769
You should get back to work.

608
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,170
I guess you're busy.

609
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,639
All right. See you.

610
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:41,110
Let's eat something together
next time.

611
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,150
Promise!

612
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,130
(Attorney No Ji Wook)

613
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,409
It must be...

614
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:18,179
related in some way.

615
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:35,460
There's no evidence to prove that
the defendant committed the murder.

616
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,500
Therefore, the defendant
also can't be accused of murder.

617
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:40,539
That is all, Your Honor.

618
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:13,869
Oh, hello.

619
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,409
What brings you here?

620
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:20,210
Are you here to ask me
for another personal favor?

621
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,710
No, I'm just... Well...

622
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,679
There's something I'm curious about.

623
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,719
What is it?

624
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:28,880
By any chance,

625
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:31,619
do you know Chef Yang Jin Woo
personally?

626
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,960
- No.
- Then you must know Jung Hyun Soo.

627
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,500
No, I don't.

628
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,099
Then why did you attend
every trial of his?

629
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:47,400
I had to attend another trial
in court as a witness.

630
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:48,969
It happens to me occasionally
as I inspect the scenes.

631
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:50,469
I can just do a quick check...

632
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,409
to find out whether
that's true or not.

633
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,110
At first, I just wondered
if you know Jung Hyun Soo...

634
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:01,219
or Yang Jin Woo personally.

635
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:02,349
I was hoping...

636
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:06,050
that you'd just be
an acquaintance of one of them.

But now I'm certain
that there's something.

639
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:18,369
Call me anytime.

640
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,900
I'll help you if there's anything...

641
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,340
I can do for you.

642
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,369
I'll wait for your call.

If Jung Hyun Soo...

647
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,159
really killed Yang Jin Woo,

648
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:16,860
there has to be a motive.

Yes, No Ji Wook speaking.

650

It's me.

I'm calling for that thing
you've been looking for.

The frame that was missing
from Chef Yang's house.

653
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,610
We found it.

654
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:41,849

Do you want to come and see it?

656
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,960
Can you...

657
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:50,230
send it to me?

658
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,460
You know that it can't get out.

659
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,559
It's evidence.

660
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,730
Come and see it if you still need
to.

661
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,099
I'll be there in a bit.

Hey, you came.

664
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:39,739
Yes.

665
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,480
Let me see the photo first.

666
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,010
Okay.

667
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,119
It's a verse from the bible.

668
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:00,929

This is...

671
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,610
Was it an act of revenge, then?

672
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:11,940
Probably.

673
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,679
Hello, it's been a long time.

674
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:49,210
There's something
I need to tell you.

675
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,349
Me?

676
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,420
By any chance, have you
found out something?

677
00:51:56,519 --> 00:51:57,489
Yes.

678
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,050
Really? What is it?

679
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:02,219
I know...

680
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:06,090
who bought the shoes.

681
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,760
Who is it?

682
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,139
Okay. I'll leave right now.

Where are you, Chan Ho?

697
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,090
Well, I came outside for a bit.

698
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,760
I see.

699
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,460
This place is so huge and dark.

700
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,130
I called because I had trouble
finding you.

701
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,099
I think I found you now.

There you are.

My gosh.

You startled me.

I thought I was going to have
a heart attack.

I'm the one who should be
saying that.

Bong Hee, are you out of your mind?

709
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:41,400
How could you think of coming to
a place like this by yourself?

710
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:45,369
Even if you could be thoughtless
at times, this is just too much.

711
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,909
You should know better after
going through so much.

712

713

What if something happened to you?
What were you going to do?

You're a nuisance. Do you know that?

720
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:19,969
Then what was I supposed to do?

721

you weren't picking up your phone.

I did wait for you.
I was going to go by myself,

00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:36,019
It felt like something could happen,
and I thought you might scold me.

726

Most of all,

727
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:41,199
I was scared.

728
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:44,329
So I walked back here
on my way inside the park.

729
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,699
I came back and waited for you here.

730

I'm sorry.

Yes, I do.

the truth.
