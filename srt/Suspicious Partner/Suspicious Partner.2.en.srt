1
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,710
To Prosecutor No Ji Wook.

2
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,450
For the last three months, I have
learned a lot from you.

3
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,020
I learned the living spirit
of the law.

4
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,119
You gave me the courage
and practical wisdom to fulfill...

5
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,289
the spirit of the law...

6
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,789
Who am I trying to kid?

7
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,560
There's a limit
to how far I can lie.

8
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,960
This is beyond the limit.
I went too far.

9
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,409
(No Ji Wook)

10
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,549
(No Ji Wook was annoying today
as always.)

11
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,420
That's right. He is annoying.

12
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,489
He's incredibly annoying.

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,090
Singing a song of curse isn't how
you take your revenge on your ex.

14
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:31,959
Just ignore him.

15
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,030
Be cool and live a good life.

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,900
But he is cool.

17
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,310
(But he is cool.)

18
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:47,909
Oh, my goodness.
I must have gone insane.

19
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,549
I wrote that he's cool.

20
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,919
What is this? Why can't I remember
what happened next?

21
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,330
Why can't I remember the rest?

22
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,430
Gosh, it's hot. It's hot in here.

23
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,770
I'm getting hot.

24
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,240
There is always a cause and effect
in every event.

25
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,240
It's a known truth to everyone,
but the problem is...

26
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,120
I'm hot.

27
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,719
Gosh, this is refreshing.

28
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,919
This is where the problem begins.

29
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,960
Sometimes we can't find the cause.

30
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:32,180
Something is definitely happening,

31
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:39,289
but we can't ever find out
the reason why this is happening...

32
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,139
just like how I can't find out now.

33
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,789
Is she sleeping already?

34
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,029
I knew it, Bong Hee. You didn't even
change the passcode.

35
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,930
You may deny your feelings, but your
subconscious is waiting for me.

36
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,600
Come on, baby.

37
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,399
Beer, beer.

38
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,209
Gosh!

39
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,480
An effect that approached me
which I don't know the cause for.

40
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:28,160
It's an unlucky, harsh,
and sudden accident.

41
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,560
Let go of him!

42
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,769
- I told you to stop!
- Like the wind

43
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,329
You are going to regret this.

44
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,399
All right. Ms. Eun Bong Hee,
let's go over this.

45
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,740
Even if it was really dark
because of the blackout,

46
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,540
you still went to the store
to buy beer.

47
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,379
If you don't pull yourself together
now, you might be in trouble.

48
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,990
If there was an accident,
clean up afterwards.

49
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,819
The initial response is important.

50
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,829
Get a grip.

51
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:10,870
Hey.

52
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:20,209
I am a suspect, not a witness
right now, aren't I?

53
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,819
Right. So let's investigate
without any presumptions.

54
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,279
I don't want to draw a line now.

55
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,250
I understand, detectives.

56
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,259
Usually, the suspect is
someone close to the victim...

57
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,560
or the first person
who discovered the body.

58
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,360
Plus the place where it happened
and the condition I am in now.

59
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,060
It's possible
I might look like a suspect.

60
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,129
You just admitted.

61
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,129
I said it's possible,
not that I am one.

62
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:46,139
Please listen to me carefully.

63
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,639
If you pinpoint an innocent
person as the suspect,

64
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,170
the initial investigation will
be a total mess.

65
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,439
The real suspect is someone else
and you have to find that person,

66
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,750
but if you hold on to
an innocent person like me,

67
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,379
what will happen
to the real suspect?

68
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,490
The suspect will disappear. You will
lose the evidence and witnesses.

69
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,019
Let go. Move aside.

70
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,920
You have finally done it.

71
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,259
Who are you? Who...

72
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,930
Are you the last person
who talked to Mr. Jang Hee Jun?

73
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,930
Why did you kill him?

74
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,600
Hey, I didn't.

75
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,040
All right. Hee Jun did dump you.

76
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,670
- Is that something to kill him for?
- It wasn't me.

77
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,079
You kept singing
that you will kill him.

78
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,680
There are so many witnesses.
Should I call all our classmates?

79
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,019
I only said it.
I didn't mean any of it.

80
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,220
Stop fooling yourself.
Bring back Hee Jun.

81
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,019
Bring back Hee Jun, you witch!

82
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,190
Don't do this.

83
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:37,389
- Let go of me.
- Let her go.

84
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,919
I'm going to kill her.

85
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,789
I'll kill her!

86
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,960
I... I really didn't do it.

87
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,570
- Let go!
- It's really not me.

88
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,240
- I didn't do it. Please believe me.
- I'm going to kill you!

89
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,769
If...

90
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,279
I can give a spoiler about my life
to myself in the past,

91
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,840
I'll tell her this.

92
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,480
"Bong Hee, be careful with men."

93
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,279
"Men bring nothing but trouble
into your life."

94
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,519
What do I have to be careful with?

95
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,590
Women.

96
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,059
When a man meets the wrong woman
and vice versa,

97
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,389
his life can be doomed in one blow.

98
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,129
But from what I can see,

99
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:21,370
there's one person like that
in your fate.

100
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,000
You'll get in huge trouble
if you cross paths with her.

101
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,539
That woman will completely destroy
your life.

102
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,139
Who's that woman?

103
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,279
You had your eyes closed
for just 17 minutes.

104
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,190
You're fighting a war against
your insomnia, not against crimes.

105
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,720
If someone can help me
get a sound sleep,

106
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,559
I'd be willing to give my body
and soul to that person.

107
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,759
I heard you can get insomnia
when your bed is too big.

108
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,000
You might sleep like a baby
when you meet a nice woman.

109
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,539
Don't even. I had a dream about a
woman I shouldn't cross paths with.

110
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,210
A woman you shouldn't
cross paths with?

111
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:02,409
Yes.

112
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,639
When I was a kid, there was
a fake monk in my neighborhood.

113
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,409
He told me something
ridiculous at the time.

114
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,350
I had forgotten all about it,
but he showed up in my dream.

115
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,090
What did he say? It was something
about a woman I shouldn't meet...

116
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,559
(Eun Bong Hee)

117
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,389
- Bong Hee?
- Bong Hee is the woman?

118
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,990
Did he predict it
when you were a kid?

119
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,889
Why is she calling at this hour?

120
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,429
(Prosecutor No Ji Wook)

121
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:27,429
Hey.

122
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,110
Well... Mr. No.

123
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:36,409
What is it? Make it quick.
Just get to the point.

124
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,610
I've been arrested
without a warrant.

125
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,779
You've been arrested?

126
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:43,850
How much did you drink?

127
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,149
I didn't drink at all.

128
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,080
And you got arrested
without a warrant?

129
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,289
What did you do? Assault?

130
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:49,519
- No.
- Theft?

131
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,090
- No way.
- Public lewdness?

132
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,620
- Of course not.
- Then what on earth is it?

133
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:57,899
It's murder.

134
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,210
Goodness.

135
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,379
Murder...

136
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,299
What should I do?

137
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,370
Isn't he District Attorney
Jang Moo Young?

138
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,210
- Pardon?
- The district attorney of Sunho.

139
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,909
I heard they've arrested a suspect.

140
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:22,909
Hey, Bong Hee. You're really...

141
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,080
What on earth were you thinking...

142
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,389
Come here. Hey!

143
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,820
You're so dead. You little...

144
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,159
I think...

145
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,299
I got myself in trouble, but...

146
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:43,230
You think?
You think you did something?

147
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:48,110
Something must've gone wrong.
I know that much,

148
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:50,370
but I don't know what I did wrong.

149
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,110
I really have no idea.

150
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:53,779
Look up.

151
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,549
I don't want to. Why should I?

152
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:57,850
Let me see your shameless face.
Look at me.

153
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,470
Even though I never intended it
to happen,

154
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,570
it did happen.

155
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:18,740
So let's say that much is my fault.

156
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,570
However, all I did was step out
to pick up beer as I was thirsty.

157
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,610
When I got back, everything
had already happened.

158
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:30,710
I have no idea why something
like that had to happen.

159
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,519
I can't believe it,
and I'm terrified.

160
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,750
But you're the only person
I can count on.

161
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,259
Why would you count on me? Don't.

162
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:39,289
I will.

163
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,690
I will count on you.

164
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,600
You're the only person...

165
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,029
around me who knows the law
and has power.

166
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,070
Hey, take those clothes off first.

167
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,370
Pardon me?

168
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,679
I'm saying you should wash up.

169
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,379
Those clothes should be submitted
as evidence.

170
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,919
Mr. Bang will bring you
a change of clothes.

171
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,190
Just wash that off yourself first.

172
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,519
That's when it finally hit me.

173
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,190
Hee Jun is dead.

174
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,009
Yes, I liked you a lot.

175
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,019
Even though you betrayed me,

176
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,350
dumped me, and hurt me,

177
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,919
I never actually wished you wrong.

178
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:20,889
Please...

179
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,730
rest in peace.

180
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:25,429
I'll sincerely pray for you.

181
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:29,570
Praying is one thing,

182
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,769
but why did you have to die
at my place?

183
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,769
Out of all the places
in this whole wide world,

184
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,909
why did you have to die at my place?

185
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,210
Were you that determined
to mess up my life?

186
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:42,980
What have I done to you
to deserve this? You jerk.

187
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:45,549
I'm sorry I swore at you.

188
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,519
Why did you...

189
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,629
You shouldn't have died.

190
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,360
Why did you die?

191
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:04,539
I really wish you didn't die...

192
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,269
Next news. Everyone is shocked
by the murder of a trainee...

193
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:13,179
from the Judicial
Research and Training Institute.

194
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:16,379
The fact that the victim is the
current district attorney's son...

195
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:17,879
has caused a big stir...

196
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,389
The prime suspect, Ms. Eun,
who has been arrested...

197
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:24,659
could not accept the fact
that the victim broke up with her.

198
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:27,259
She's been stalking and threatening
him on a daily basis. The victim...

199
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:32,629
This is the prosecutors' office.

200
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,769
Pardon me?

201
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The DA's office?

202
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,340
Ominous premonitions
are usually right.

203
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,610
The fact that attorneys named him
as the worst prosecutor...

204
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:48,379
means that suspects and their
counsels hate him.

205
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:51,980
In other words, he's always
in support of the victims.

206
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:53,879
Yes, that's right.

207
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,820
When it comes to criminal cases,
Mr. No is the best prosecutor.

208
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,159
He's excellent
at dragging out confessions,

209
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,559
and he has the highest
conviction rate.

210
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,829
Please investigate fairly...

211
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,029
and prove that justice
is still alive.

212
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,569
This is the worst possible
situation...

213
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:12,339
I could imagine.

214
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,109
- There she is.
- She's coming out.

215
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,009
- She's getting off.
- Take photos.

216
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,150
- She's coming out.
- There she is.

217
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,650
- She's getting off now!
- Take photos!

218
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:28,190
- She's out.
- Why did you kill him?

219
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,089
Was it planned or done
on the spur of the moment?

220
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,660
Do you admit it?
Please say a few words.

221
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,990
You should at least say
whether you killed him or not!

222
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,890
Did you really kill him
because he broke up with you?

223
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,430
Please move your hair
out of your face.

224
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:42,829
- We can see her face now!
- Take off your mask!

225
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,099
Take it off!

226
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,599
Please say a few words!

227
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,009
- Did you kill him or not?
- Hey, take photos now!

228
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,240
I'm pretty sure I told you...

229
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,309
not to show up before me
as a suspect.

230
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,410
I...

231
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:26,109
I'm a ruthless prosecutor.

232
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:30,680
Let's get started.

233
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,549
You're currently being investigated
for the murder of Jang Hee Jun.

234
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,819
You have the right
to remain silent...

235
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,519
to any question that might be
disadvantageous to you.

236
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,029
Get her to confess and charge her
with murder as soon as possible.

237
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,000
If you fail to charge her
and get the maximum penalty,

238
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:50,000
you'll be fired. You won't
even be able to work as an attorney.

239
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:53,470
If you get lucky, you'll be able to
work in a countryside far away.

240
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,470
Do you understand?

241
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,640
Do you admit that the current
situation is forcing us to...

242
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,779
think of you as the culprit?

243
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,890
This is the statement of the
part-timer at the convenience store.

244
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:15,329
He remembers a customer coming
into the store that night,

245
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:19,230
but he can't remember that person's
face. He doesn't remember you.

246
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,259
Excuse me.

247
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,170
I can't hear you well.

248
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,940
There was a black out that night.
The CCTV was also out of order.

249
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,640
That means nothing can prove
you were outside for a while...

250
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,410
in the middle of the night.

251
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,279
Can you still not hear me?

252
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,079
To be exact, I can't see you.

253
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,180
What?

254
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,059
They won't let me wear
contact lenses, and some jerk...

255
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,630
Some journalist broke my glasses
a while ago.

256
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,690
So I can't really see properly.

257
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,660
It's weird, but when I can't see,

258
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,769
I can't hear properly either.

259
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,170
I can't see your facial expression.

260
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:01,569
It makes it hard for me to
figure out how you're feeling...

261
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,140
- or what you're thinking.
- So what?

262
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,450
You see, I can totally understand
your situation right now.

263
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,920
I also know that Jang Hee Jun
was the one who cheated on you.

264
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,690
I totally understand how devastated
you must have felt that night.

265
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:26,259
- So...
- It's not going to work on me.

266
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,630
I've seen you interrogate people
many times.

267
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,470
You're trying to appease me
by sweet talking to me.

268
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Other than the police and
paramedics who were at the site,

269
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,180
we couldn't find any
other person's DNA at your house.

270
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,880
There were only yours and Jang
Hee Jun's.

271
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,279
That was all.

272
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,390
Are you still going to deny it?

273
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:50,390
This won't work on me either.

274
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,220
Exactly. It's not working at all.
Darn it.

275
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,190
You're going to get charged anyway.

276
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,599
The motive is clear,
and you have no alibi.

277
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,099
He got killed at your house,
and there's no other suspect.

278
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,329
Don't you think that's enough to
charge you?

279
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:05,099
But I really didn't kill him.

280
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,140
- That doesn't even matter.
- Pardon?

281
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,309
Whether you're guilty or not,
you're going to end up...

282
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:11,509
getting the maximum sentence
allowed by law.

283
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,779
That's the only way I can save
my career.

284
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,849
You believe me, don't you?

285
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,250
I trust that you believe me.

286
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,950
I trust that you're on my side.
You're the only hope...

287
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,019
I have right now.

288
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,230
But from what I can see, there's
one person like that in your fate.

289
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,859
You'll get in huge trouble
if you cross paths with her.

290
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,470
That woman will completely destroy
your life.

291
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,970
- I've become uncivilized.
- Sorry?

292
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,970
I said I've become uncivilized.

293
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:47,079
Because of you, I'm this close to
believing what that fake monk said.

294
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,579
Who's that woman?

295
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,750
You'll find out who she is
once you see her.

296
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,119
"This must be that woman."

297
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,579
He said I'll find out
once I see that woman.

298
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,619
Now I know who that is.

299
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:00,319
It's...

300
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,930
you, Bong Hee.

301
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,940
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere.

302
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,279
I've seen her in real life.

303
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,980
She looks extremely intimidating.

304
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,880
Really?

305
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,049
Yes. She's really something.

306
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,720
I wonder if she hired an attorney.

307
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,519
The victim is the son of
District Attorney Jang.

308
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,059
Who would want to defend her?

309
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,890
That'll only make them get on
the bad side of the prosecution.

310
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,130
I guess they'll use
a public defender.

311
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,930
They'll probably get her
one of the most incompetent...

312
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,970
public defenders in this country.

313
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
What's wrong?

314
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,170
Ji Wook...

315
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,240
Did something happen? What's up?

316
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,170
He's calling me.

317
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,279
(My Ji Wook)

318
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,839
So?

319
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,349
Ji Wook's calling me.
It's been ages since he called me.

320
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,049
Wait.

321
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,359
Hello? Hey, Ji Wook.

322
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,990
Yes.

323
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:10,460
Please do me a favor. Okay.

324
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:17,900
I can't believe you called Mr. Ji
when you hate him so much.

325
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:20,640
My gosh! Bugs!

326
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,109
I feel like...

327
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:24,470
there are bugs crawling on my body.

328
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,950
Let's go.

329
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:38,619
(2Ha16)

330
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,730
Thank goodness, I didn't
throw these glasses away.

331
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,130
How did you find them?

332
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,329
It's not like they have legs.
I found them after a while.

333
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,569
I should've gotten you new glasses
that are pretty.

334
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,099
I'm only going to use them for
a while. It would've been a waste.

335
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,839
Of course. You're going to
get out of there soon.

336
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,109
Goodness.

337
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:05,980
By the way, these glasses
remind me of the past.

338
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,349
You studied so hard
with those glasses.

339
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:14,589
And you supported me throughout
the whole journey.

340
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:23,069
Don't you worry about me.

341
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,369
It's not even my first time.
Back when your dad...

342
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:31,240
How's the meal? Does it taste good?

343
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,910
Giving massages is tiring, isn't it?

344
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,079
Nonsense. Everyone lives a
tough life like I do.

345
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:46,559
Relief patches don't cost that much.
Why do you split them like that?

346
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,930
I can use them on different spots
by splitting them like this.

347
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,700
By the way, how are your cellmates?
Are they nice?

348
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,970
Are there any bullies?

349
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,769
What are you talking about?
I'm the head of the cell.

350
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:03,769
- Really?
- Yes.

351
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,880
I'm the only one who got
charged with murder.

352
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,279
Everyone else got charged with
theft, embezzlement,

353
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,109
fraud, and gambling.

354
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,519
But I got charged with murder,
so they're all scared of me.

355
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,849
That's great.

356
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:18,759
Your time's up.

357
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,099
Why does time fly so fast?

358
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,630
Mom, you don't need to
come tomorrow. Okay?

359
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,170
Don't worry about me,
and keep your head up high.

360
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,200
You can do it, Bong Hee.

361
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,109
I can do it. I'll be off then.

362
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,779
You should go.

363
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:44,410
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom.

364
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,940
Why isn't she here yet?

365
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,279
My goodness. My gosh.

366
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:15,309
Are you okay?

367
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,349
You hit me again.

368
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,519
I'm really sorry.

369
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,829
I'm really smart, so it's okay
if my brain cells die a little bit.

370
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,170
I see. Okay.

371
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:43,440
I got admitted as your attorney,

372
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,509
so the process of admitting a public
defender will get canceled.

373
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,109
I'm sorry.

374
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,819
How... How did this happen?

375
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:57,690
Your glasses...

376
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,819
I'm not saying they look funny.

377
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,730
But they do seem to neutralize
your intimidating face.

378
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,329
It's great. It's a great tactic.

379
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,670
- Thank you.
- I should thank you.

380
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,940
Why would you thank me?

381
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,269
Thanks to you, Ji Wook called me.

382
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:15,769
Sorry?

383
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,609
What kind of relationship
do you have with Ji Wook?

384
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,240
He was my mentor, and now he's the
prosecutor in charge of this case.

385
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,750
No, not that. Is there anything
else in your relationship?

386
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,849
Sir, don't you have any
questions for me?

387
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:27,849
I do.

388
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:30,190
Did you kill Jang Hee Jun?

389
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,650
No.

390
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,759
I know everything now.

391
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,130
The CCTV's broken.

392
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,339
This place is under reconstruction,
so there are a lot of empty houses.

393
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,339
On top of that, there was
a black out that night.

394
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:55,910
I'm sorry, but this looks like
a great place to commit murder.

395
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,579
I don't know about that.

396
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,890
But this place does seem
suitable for Bong Hee.

397
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,720
How's the weapon search going?

398
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:07,920
They searched the whole place,
but they haven't found anything yet.

399
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,690
What about the other jurisdictions?

400
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,059
I've called every police station
in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

401
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,130
I asked them to report to us if they
find a weapon that's...

402
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,369
13cm in length and 3.5cm in width.

403
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:18,400
- Okay, you did a good job.
- I did, right?

404
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:21,470
But why are you trying so hard?

405
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,509
I'm just open to possibilities.

406
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:27,279
Like Bong Hee said, someone else
could actually be the culprit.

407
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,680
Of course, that's not
for certain either.

408
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,480
It'd be great if that was true.

409
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:12,660
Was it around 12:30am?

410
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,660
I looked out the window
because I was feeling a bit hot.

411
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,930
I couldn't see anything
because I wasn't wearing my glasses.

412
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,529
I just felt the cool breeze,
and that was it.

413
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,369
If she witnessed something,

414
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:26,369
but doesn't know...

415
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,940
what she saw...

416
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,710
That's why...

417
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,150
the witness...

418
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:42,349
This can't be.

419
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,720
Mr. Bang, you checked all the
incidents that occurred...

420
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,029
around this neighborhood
on that night, right?

421
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:51,029
Of course.

422
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:54,529
I looked into all the sex offenders
and ex-convicts around here.

423
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,269
But I couldn't find anything.

424
00:29:57,369 --> 00:30:01,869
Can you check the residents'
whereabouts once more just in case?

425
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,140
Yes, sir.

426
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,730
Whoever the killer is,

427
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:31,329
he or she definitely entered
the house and stabbed the victim.

428
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
I think I might have seen her
from somewhere.

429
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:08,299
She has a typical face.

430
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,740
But this feels a bit uncomfortable.

431
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:13,740
Inspecting the house of someone
we know as a crime scene...

432
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:16,210
makes me feel like
I'm prying on her.

433
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,720
(No Ji Wook)

434
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:21,920
(No Ji Wook was annoying today
as always.)

435
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,250
What is that?

436
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,490
It's nothing.

437
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:32,029
Why are we shaking hands?
We can do this!

438
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,839
(I can do it!)

439
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,579
(No Ji Wook was annoying today
as always.)

440
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,250
When you read this,

441
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:55,319
it makes you think she might have
wanted to kill you, not Mr. Jang.

442
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,430
Hello?

443
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,759
Yes, this is he.

444
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:10,769
Please go on.

445
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,099
Okay.

446
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,119
The murder weapon has been found.

447
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,750
It was found in a place that is
7km far from here.

448
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,059
A passerby who was taking a walk
found it and reported.

449
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,230
What is this?

450
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,759
The length is 13cm
and the width is 3.5cm.

451
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:41,930
The weapon fits the size
of the stab wound on Jang Hee Jun.

452
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:47,440
It must look something like this.

453
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,109
That's...

454
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:54,309
Why isn't she indicted yet?

455
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,380
A further investigation
is necessary.

456
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,190
We currently have no direct evidence
like the murder weapon or witnesses.

457
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,960
And she hasn't
admitted to it yet either.

458
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,460
The murder weapon...

459
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,329
You might find it soon.

460
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,059
What needs to turn up always
turns up.

461
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:19,339
As both of us know, what's important
is that Eun Bong Hee is the culprit.

462
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,000
Am I wrong?

463
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:26,710
You said this place has been
searched multiple times, right?

464
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:28,640
We searched here so many times.

465
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,009
You have no idea how many times
we did it to find the murder weapon.

466
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,519
And you still found nothing,
yet this ended up in my hand.

467
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,519
Plus, we might have found two.

468
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:40,859
Well, the other one...

469
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,430
Gosh, I have no idea
what's happening right now.

470
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,160
Let's go to the Forensic Center.

471
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,700
(Forensic Center: Collects and
analyzes crime related information.)

472
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,660
I need to find out whether the blood
on these are Jang Hee Jun's.

473
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,069
Please run an analysis as soon as
possible. And keep it confidential.

474
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,940
- Confidential?
- Yes.

475
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,609
This was found on the scene, so
it doesn't have to be confidential.

476
00:33:58,609 --> 00:33:59,609
But this one over here.

477
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,009
It was found elsewhere,
so it must be kept confidential.

478
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,619
Mr. Ji, what's your IQ?

479
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,690
143. It's quite high.

480
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Right.

481
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,590
- Aren't you going to ask me?
- Sorry?

482
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,059
People usually reciprocate.

483
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,559
When someone says hello,
most people say it back.

484
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,599
Oh, right.

485
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,500
All right. My IQ is 143.
What's yours?

486
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,539
It's 101.

487
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:32,639
I passed the bar exam
with that IQ. Isn't it impressive?

488
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,239
Also, I used to be
an aspiring athlete.

489
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,780
How much effort do you think
I had to make to pass the bar exam?

490
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,090
I asked myself every single day.
"Should I just quit everything..."

491
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,519
"and earn money
so that I can help my family?"

492
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,690
I mean, I wasn't even confident
that I'd pass it.

493
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:52,760
Studying was hard,

494
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,000
but watching my mom having
to support me was even harder.

495
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,500
That's how I came this far,

496
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,239
but all the time and effort...

497
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,579
are about to go down the drain.

498
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,250
So please don't think
of defending me as a joke.

499
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,179
"I pity her,
so I should help her a little."

500
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,550
I don't want that mindset either.

501
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,559
My life depends on this,

502
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:23,059
and my family is also at stake.

503
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:28,800
Do we have to see each other?

504
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,269
Ji Wook?

505
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:35,070
How's Bong Hee? Have you met her?

506
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:36,570
I have.

507
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:42,210
Oh, and... The reason I asked you
to be her attorney is...

508
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,650
It was because her right
to consult with an attorney...

509
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,489
wasn't respected. That was why.

510
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:52,719
I know. I bet no attorney
wanted to help her.

511
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,119
You know that I'm only doing it
because you asked, right?

512
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,929
Do you have to emphasize
that you're doing me a favor?

513
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,460
I'll do my very best as her
attorney.

514
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,469
I never told you not to.

515
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:04,170
I'm saying I'll beat you,
Prosecutor No.

516
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,230
Try all you want to beat me.

517
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,239
You're not going to give in? You
want to convict her and lock her up?

518
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,239
What prosecutor prosecutes
a case to give in and lose?

519
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:12,909
I see.

520
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,210
I'm going if you're done talking.

521
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:19,119
Hey, wait. Ji Wook, Ji Wook!

522
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,880
Hey, just a second. Hey!

523
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,590
Hey, you're not going
to stay for coffee?

524
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,050
I guess you've forgotten.

525
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,059
I can't stand the sight of you
even for a second. You know that?

526
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,030
You still can't forgive me?

527
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,860
Darn it.
That's right. It's too hard.

528
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,030
Then I'll beg you for forgiveness.
I'll keep begging.

529
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,699
I can't give up on you. You're
the most precious person in my life.

530
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:41,000
Ji Wook, you'll be at the trial,
right? Then I'll see you in court.

531
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,840
See you again soon.
Ji Wook, I love you!

532
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:54,480
Goodness gracious.

533
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,050
Hey, Bong Hee.
Because of you, I had to...

534
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,920
I had to meet someone whom I never
even wanted to talk to again!

535
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,929
Did I do something wrong again?

536
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:06,260
Everything you do is wrong.
You're the epitome of wrongness.

537
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,559
I don't know what it's about,

538
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,869
but if I did something wrong
or made another mistake...

539
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:11,000
Everything you do is a mistake.

540
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,300
Your existence itself is a mistake!

541
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:26,019
What?

542
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,849
Is there any progress?

543
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,059
Not really.

544
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:35,559
We haven't eaten yet,
so we were deciding on a menu.

545
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,170
Okay. So what did you choose to eat?

546
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,230
Jjajangmyeon.

547
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,469
Jjajangmyeon.

548
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:07,460
If both knives have Jang Hee Jun's
blood on them...

549
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,559
Yes?

550
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,000
That means...

551
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:17,429
Bong Hee is not the culprit.

552
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,239
This will be the last time...

553
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,539
I interrogate you as the suspect.

554
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,989
That means you'll soon become
the defendant.

555
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,690
I trust you.

556
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,360
I trust that you believe me.

557
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:51,630
I really trust you.

558
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,039
That's the only choice
I have right now.

559
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:01,739
(Defendant, 2Ha16)

560
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,340
I'm so nervous. What should I do?

561
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:39,750
Defendant Eun Bong Hee planned to
murder her ex-boyfriend,

562
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,150
Jang Hee Jun,
after he cheated on her.

563
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:48,219
On May 11, 2015, she lured the
victim, Jang Hee Jun, to her place.

564
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:51,530
Then she brutally murdered him
with a sharp knife.

565
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:55,230
For this, I indict defendant
Eun Bong Hee for murder...

566
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:57,170
with Article 250
of the Criminal Law.

567
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,570
Attorney Ji, do you admit to
the charge made by the prosecutor?

568
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,940
(Attorney, Defendant)

569
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:08,210
No, I do not, Your Honor.

570
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:12,050
Defendant Eun Bong Hee
protests her innocence.

571
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,090
Have you witnessed the defendant,
Eun Bong Hee,

572
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,320
threatening the victim, Jang Hee
Jun, that she'll kill him?

573
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,489
Yes.

574
00:40:21,789 --> 00:40:26,199
I've numerously witnessed her doing
that with my own eyes and ears.

575
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,199
In addition, many classmates have
also witnessed her threatening him.

576
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,039
That scumbag. That jerk.
I was going to dump him first.

577
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm going to kill you, Hee Jun.

578
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,710
My gosh.

579
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,150
- It's delicious.
- Yes, it is.

580
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:01,230
"I could die of hunger.
I'm so upset that I could die."

581
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,030
People easily say
those kinds of things.

582
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:06,199
Do you think everyone
who used that word actually died?

583
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,699
That goes the same for...

584
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,840
"I'm going to kill you."

585
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,179
Bong Hee meant every single word
she said.

586
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,150
She wasn't just joking around.

587
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,849
In my opinion,
she became a potential murderer...

588
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,719
as soon as she said those threats.

589
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,360
I heard that you also said the
same thing at the police station.

590
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,760
Sorry?

591
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,829
Let go!

592
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:37,400
I'm going to kill her.

593
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,940
I'm going to kill her!

594
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:43,039
- That was...
- You meant what you said.

595
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,340
It also wasn't a joke, was it?

596
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,250
Then does that also make you
a potential murderer?

597
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,949
She always sang a weird song
that showed...

598
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:58,019
a lot of hate and resentment.

599
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,320
She would sometimes even
change the lyrics.

600
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,429
Could you give us an example?

601
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,690
Right now?

602
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:06,500
I'll give it a try.

603
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,599
In 5, 6, 7, 8.

604
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:12,469
Watch me cursing you

605
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,969
You'd better remember

606
00:42:14,969 --> 00:42:17,570
Because I'll be sure to kill you

607
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,639
That's all.

608
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,480
As soon as Eun Bong Hee
and Jang Hee Jun broke up,

609
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,119
I heard that
you asked Eun Bong Hee out.

610
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,489
Well, that was just a joke.

611
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,989
Bong Hee, shall I go out with you?
What do you say?

612
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,460
In total, you asked her out
three times,

613
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,070
and you got rejected
every single time.

614
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:45,570
Yes. That's true, but...

615
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:49,539
If you actually thought that she was
cruel enough to kill someone,

616
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:51,510
do you think you would've
asked her out?

617
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:57,909
By any chance, are you giving us
a false testimony...

618
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,849
because you have a grudge
against her?

619
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:00,880
No...

620
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,190
Can you assure my protection?

621
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:11,460
(Witness, 2Ha16)

622
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:16,400
It is true that I sometimes
cursed and threatened the victim,

623
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:20,400
Jang Hee Jun, that I'd kill him.

624
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:25,769
But I only said those things
momentarily out of anger.

625
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:27,840
I never really thought of
killing him.

626
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:31,849
If I had really planned
to murder him,

627
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,320
I wouldn't have told the whole world
about my plan, don't you think?

628
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,519
People don't put everything
in their mind to action.

629
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,260
To be honest, I'm pretty sure
a lot of women have wanted to...

630
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,099
kill their boyfriends and husbands
at a certain time in their lives.

631
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,570
What?

632

- What a wench.
- Tell us.

640
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:35,780
What did she say
to cause such controversy?

641

"To be honest, I'm pretty sure
a lot of women have wanted to..."

at a certain time in their lives."

643
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,719
She sounded like a psychopath.

00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,260
What a brazen woman.

645
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,320
My gosh. Every man
in this country...

646
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:53,000
better behave when they're around
their wives and girlfriends.

Yes. Here are the results for the
murder weapon.

- How do you feel right now?

Your Honor.

667
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:20,650
I'd like to turn in
some extra evidence.

668
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
I don't understand why he would
submit extra evidence...

669
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,360
when he already completed
interrogating her.

670
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,889
This evidence was found
at the defendant's house...

671
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,360
at 3pm on May 15.

672
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:38,900
It's just that...

673
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:42,469
we needed to fully confirm
whether or not this knife...

674
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,010
was the knife she used to stab
the victim, Jang Hee Jun.

675
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,840
We were able to receive
the results last night.

676
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,849
Please understand that we couldn't
hand it in any earlier.

677
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,880
Your Honor, according to the
investigation reports,

678
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,619
the defendant's house was searched
numerous times.

679
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:58,550
However, they failed to find
any lethal weapons at her place.

680
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,559
Therefore, it's very hard to accept
that a weapon suddenly showed up...

681
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:03,260
days after they searched her house.

682
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,630
Please postpone accepting it
as evidence.

683
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:08,559
First, let's take it in as evidence.

684
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:11,500
However, I'd also like to hear the
opinion of a forensic doctor.

685
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:16,969
You are claiming that the stab wound
found on the victim's body...

686
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:19,940
and the shape of the weapon
match perfectly. Is this right?

687
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,679
Yes, by examining the length
of the stab wound,

688
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:25,179
I can roughly find out the shape
of the murder weapon.

689
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:28,019
The shape of the submitted weapon
as evidence is almost identical.

690
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,889
It's not like this was their first
time inspecting the crime scene,

691
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,250
but one day, the murder weapon...

692
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,159
which they couldn't find before,
appears out of nowhere.

693
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,460
Isn't this a bit suspicious?

694
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:39,460
All right, this is
a mere possibility.

695
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,400
Is it possible the victim's DNA on
the weapon could've been fabricated?

696
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:46,869
For example, someone could've gotten
the blood from the victim's...

697
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:49,570
clothes or belongings
and put it on the weapon.

698
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:52,670
I can't say that your claim
is scientifically impossible,

699
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:55,380
but at the same time, you can't
prove your claim is possible.

700
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,750
But it is still possible though.

701
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:01,679
That's all.

702
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,320
Prosecutor, you may deliver
your closing argument.

703
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:16,230
Yes, Your Honor.

704
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:26,110
The defendant, Eun Bong Hee, is
charged with first-degree murder...

705
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:28,440
after luring the victim,
Jang Hee Jun...

706
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:31,050
to her apartment located...

707
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,079
in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province
on May 11, 2015.

708
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,619
My dad said
he lost his only sister...

709
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:39,659
to a criminal.

710
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:41,090
You punk.

711
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:44,429
Who told you that you could
wear my robe without my permission?

712
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,260
- Put your hands in the air.
- Thus,

713
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,099
my dad became a prosecutor
as a duck takes to water.

714
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:53,400
He distanced himself from political
and corrupted prosecutors.

715
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,570
Do you know what this robe means?

716
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,570
He only took criminal cases
and fought against crime.

717
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,940
My dad...

718
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,110
was my hero.

719
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:12,349
Just like his sister, my dad
became a victim of a crime.

720
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:14,920
I wanted to fulfill
my dad's dream...

721
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,230
he couldn't fulfill himself.

722
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:20,059
I...

723
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,730
wanted to be just like my dad.

724
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:27,900
I wanted to fight against crime
just like my dad did,

725
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:30,469
catch as many criminals as I can,

726
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:32,840
and one day,

727
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,409
die as a prosecutor.

728
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:37,750
However...

729
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:41,179
Hence, I demand a penalty.

730
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:45,019
She premeditated the murder,

731
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,519
she didn't repent her crime
as she lied during the whole trial,

732
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,190
and the victim's family is asking
for a serious punishment.

733
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,190
Taking these into account,

734
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,500
according to Article 250
of the Criminal Code,

735
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:02,099
I ask that she be sentenced
to 15 years in prison...

736
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,409
for the first-degree murder.

737
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,320
Get her to confess and charge her
with murder as soon as possible.

738
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,260
If you fail to charge her
and get the maximum penalty,

739
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,389
you'll be fired.

740
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,260
You believe me, don't you?

741
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:30,800
I trust that you believe me.

742
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:34,340
You are the only hope
I have right now.

743
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,809
The prosecution's argument that the
defendant killed the victim...

744
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:43,349
is based on circumstantial evidence
and reasonable doubts...

745
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:49,019
Prosecutor.

746
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:52,650
Are you aware that the attorney is
delivering his closing argument?

747
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:54,590
- Why are you...
- Your Honor.

748
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:01,699
I'd like to...

749
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,099
submit additional evidence.

750
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:07,139
Did you say you want
to submit additional evidence?

751
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:08,639
Yes, Your Honor.

752
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:12,210
The truth is...

753
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,309
there was one more weapon...

754
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:18,349
that was discovered.

755
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:31,530
These two weapons were found
on the same day at different places.

756
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:37,869
(Stenographer)

757
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:42,539
Jang Hee Jun, the victim's blood
was on both of these weapons.

758
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,139
If you look at this slide,

759
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:49,710
there is a map where the other
weapon was found.

760
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,679
It's about 7km far
from the crime scene.

761
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,889
Considering the time of death and
the response time of the ambulance,

762
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:01,059
it's impossible for the accused
to travel this far...

763
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:04,860
after killing the victim in order to
conceal the murder weapon.

764
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:10,929
Either she has an accomplice who
could have disposed the weapon,

765
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:14,199
or unless she is a super human
who can teleport,

766
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,739
this is impossible.

767
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:17,769
(Defendant)

768
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:20,579
Then why are you submitting...

769
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,909
this piece of evidence just now?

770
00:52:33,389 --> 00:52:35,119
I excluded this evidence on purpose.

771
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,159
Going forward with the trial...

772
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:42,429
was more important
than the truth to me.

773
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:47,099
If there are two murder weapons,

774
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,369
it means one of them is fabricated.

775
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:54,340
Which means the weapons
are not admissible evidence.

776
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,849
Ergo,

777
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,280
according to Article 255
of the Criminal Procedure Law,

778
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:06,050
the prosecution moves
to dismiss the charge.

779
00:53:21,469 --> 00:53:24,940
I can't understand a thing.
What's going to happen to Bong Hee?

780
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:28,110
What is he saying?
What does that mean?

781
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:31,409
The prosecutor dug up
his own grave,

782
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,079
and he will release the defendant.

783
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:36,219
Really?

784
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,420
The prosecutor ended the case
with his own hands.

785
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:43,989
The defendant, Eun Bong Hee,
will be released.

786
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:47,400
So it means she can go home.

787
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:49,760
Sir. My goodness. Thank you, sir.

788
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,429
You don't have to thank me.

789
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,630
Oh, right.

790
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:12,489
- He's coming.
- There he is.

791
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:13,489
He's coming out now.

792
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:16,260
Isn't this an unprecedented case
where prosecution drops the charges?

793
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,429
Did you obtain
the approval beforehand?

794
00:54:17,429 --> 00:54:18,559
Did you run it by the DA?

795
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,530
- Isn't this act of rebellion?
- Was this settled in advance?

796
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,300
- Please share a few words.
- She's here!

797
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,329
- She's coming out.
- Here she is.

798
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:25,030
- How do you feel?
- How do you feel?

799
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,599
- We'll hold an interview later.
- Getting your case dismissed...

800
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,099
- isn't the end, don't you think?
- What are your thoughts on this?

801
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:30,010
- Share a word with us, please.
- I'm sorry. Please move aside.

802
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,170
- Tell us how you feel.
- Please share a few words.

803
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,840
- Did you expect this to happen?
- Were you aware of the evidence?

804
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:35,880
- How do you feel now?
- Hold on a second.

805
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,150
- I'm sorry.
- Please tell us what you think.

806

What are your thoughts on the
result?

807
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:40,349
Tell us your thought
about the result.

808
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:07,380
Bong Hee, let's get going.

809
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,440
Let us know what you think
about the result.

810
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,780
- Please answer a question.
- Tell us!

811
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,250
- Tell us your thoughts!
- Please!

812
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:13,010
Isn't this unprecedented?

813
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,530
I'm fine.

814
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:23,119
You didn't have to do that.

815
00:56:23,949 --> 00:56:24,949
I guess.

816
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,389
You did that in case...

817
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:29,159
the prosecution files
an appeal even if she's acquitted.

818
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,429
I don't know.

819
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:38,429
The prosecution won't appeal?

820
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,800
When a prosecutor drops the charges,
they can't prosecute me again...

821
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:45,409
unless they find another
piece of evidence...

822
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:47,110
that proves me guilty.

823
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:48,909
Put it in layman's terms.

824
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:51,380
So it means...

825
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,519
the prosecution can arrest me again
only when they find...

826
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,119
a crucial piece of evidence
that points me as a murderer.

827
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,960
I'm so relieved.

828
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:04,960
That sounds about right.

829
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:16,599
The prosecutor made
a big sacrifice for me, Mom.

830
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,650
What's your relationship with her?
Why did you do that for her?

831
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,420
It's fate.

832
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,119
Fate?

833
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,889
(Likewise)

834
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,889
(Likewise)

835
00:58:54,099 --> 00:58:56,000
Your conscience disappointed me.

836
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:00,139
I thought it'd be easy for you
to disregard the truth.

837
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,150
I'm sure I'm more disappointed
than you are.

843

Burnt and hurt by men,

844
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:49,019
I thought I'd never be able
to fully trust anyone again.

But I've come to trust
and like someone again.

I think that we...

01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,090
met by fate.

the prosecutor's badge.

I couldn't become like you.

to repay your kindness too!
