1
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,750
Mr. Bang, wake up! Please, Mr. Bang!

2
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,010
Mr. Bang!

3
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:27,949
Ms. Eun!

4
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,300
Ji Wook already notified the police
and called the ambulance.

5
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,629
They're probably on their way to
the hospital right now.

6
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,340
He'll be okay, right?

7
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,939
He'll be fine, right?

8
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:55,949
Of course.

9
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
He'll be fine.

10
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,870
My goodness.

11
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,879
Try going a little faster, Mr. Ham.

12
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,139
Yes, I'm trying.

13
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,050
I get that you're trying.

14
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,620
But speed up a bit more.

15
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,990
I'm very impatient right now.

16

(Prosecutor Cha Yoo Jung)

(Eun Hyuk)

18
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,460
Hey, Eun Hyuk.

19
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
What?

20
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,039
Okay, I'll be right there.

Eun Ho.

22
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,840
I'm sorry, Eun Ho.

23
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,180
What a useless apology.

24
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:03,819
If...

25
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:07,150
If only I had come a little
earlier...

26
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,419
I...

27
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,590
I should've gotten there
a bit faster.

28
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,589
What a useless regret.

29
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,060
Please don't die.

30
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,629

You're... You're here.

50
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,779
Did... Did you contact
Prosecutor Cha?

51
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,980
She'll be here soon.

52
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,550
Okay.

53
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,449
What happened?

54
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,019
Why did Mr. Bang get attacked?

55
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:58,490
It's being investigated by the
police, but don't rely on them.

56
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,290
I'd like you to take charge and
directly investigate what happened.

57
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,560
(Direct investigation: A direct
involvement of the prosecution)

58
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,360
As you may already know,
the key suspect is...

59
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,399
Jung Hyun Soo.
But he's not an easy fellow.

60
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,800
It won't be easy to find evidence.

61
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,470
He used Ko Chan Ho and forensics
to get away...

62
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:18,610
with his murders. So I'm sure
he's well informed about...

63
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,610
forensic science. Therefore,

64
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,350
he probably already prepared
an alibi.

65
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,379
But he still might have missed
something.

66
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,750
So it's important to do a proper...

67
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,160
preliminary investigation.

68
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,819
What could there be?

69
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:36,930
We can start from the crime site
and go through all the CCTVs nearby.

70
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,930
We also need...

71
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,170
an eyewitness testimony,

72
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,839
and we need to check
Jung Hyun Soo's...

73
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,639
- whereabouts.
- Just...

74
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,870
Just leave everything to me,
Ji Wook.

75
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:50,509
She's right.

76
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,709
Let's leave the investigation to
Prosecutor Cha.

77
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,050
We should worry about Mr. Bang's
surgery.

78
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:01,889
Okay.

79
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,629
There are CCTVs nearby, right?

80
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,429
Please collect every single one.

81
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,049
(Under operation)

82
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,919
The internal bleeding was severe
because he had injured his spleen.

83
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,889
But luckily, we managed to stop the
bleeding before he fell into shock.

84
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,330
So the worst part is over now.

85
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,029
However...

86
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:57,539
What? "However"? What else is wrong?

87
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:00,440
Due to excessive bleeding, his brain
didn't get enough blood flow.

88
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,139
So there's a possibility
of brain damage.

89
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,240
Then that means it's not
for certain, right?

90
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,179
Yes, but I'm just letting you know
of all the possibilities.

91
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:10,110
Then you're also saying that...

92
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:13,549
he could wake up without
having any problems at all, right?

93
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,250
Yes. We'll need to wait and see.
I'll get going.

94
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,929
Don't worry. Don't worry.

95
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:28,299
Mr. Bang is a strong man.
He'll wake up soon.

96
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,039
Trust me. He'll be okay.

97
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:34,269
My goodness.

98
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,169
Did you do everything I told you to?

99
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Yes.

100
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,740
It must've been tiring.

101
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,080
It's simple, but let me tell you
again just in case you might forget.

102
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,580
First, wear this jacket
and the helmet.

103
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,149
Don't ever take off the helmet.
I already told you earlier, right?

104
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:25,519
Then you just need to deliver these
to the right person.

105
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,929
You're going to become me.

106
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,090
Here's the cell phone.

107
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,029
Once you arrive, please send a
text message with this cell phone.

108
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,230
You must use this cell phone, okay?

109
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,039
Don't worry.

110
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,539
Starting from this moment
until tonight,

111
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,940
you're going to be my perfect alibi.

112
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,779
Please take care of it well.

113
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,879
(Mr. No)

114
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,159
It's better if you get caught
on camera.

115
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,769
Don't ever take off that helmet,

116
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:10,870
and try not to talk if possible.

117
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,769
You just need to deliver these.

118
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,809
Your delivery is here.
I'm in front of the store.

119
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,379
You must remember every single
thing.

120
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:23,710
Please make sure to remember if
the receiver was a man or a woman.

121
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,720
Also, take note of that person's
age, appearance, clothing,

122
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,690
and characteristic. You need to
remember everything.

123
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,220
You also need to remember
the surrounding environment...

124
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:31,919
and any kind of sudden event.

125
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,159
There was a CCTV on top of the real
estate office that was next to...

126
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,960
a gimbap restaurant.

127
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,360
And...

128
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:42,730
a guy in a pink shirt
who came on a bike...

129
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,100
went into the shop...

130
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,870
and a girl in a white shirt...

131
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:50,509
was walking a brown poodle.

132
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,710
A brown poodle?

133
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,210
I see.

134
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,080
You have a very detailed
memory of the night.

135
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,190
You said if I miss a single thing,
you won't pay me.

136
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,860
I should give you your pay
for the night.

137
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,230
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

138
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,870
- Contact me if you need my service.
- Okay.

139
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,070
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.

140
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,909
- What is it?
- Nothing. Take care.

141
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,159
A brown poodle?

142
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,720
A pink shirt.

143
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:42,860
A CCTV camera.

144
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:51,559
I'm certain...

145
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,429
he will be okay.

146
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,669
Everything will be all right.

147
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,809
I thought he was going to die on me.

148
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,750
I could neither feel his pulse...

149
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,820
nor his breathing.

150
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:25,299
I really thought he wasn't
going to make it.

151
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,039
Nothing...

152
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,580
will happen to Mr. Bang.

153
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,580
Everything will be fine.

154
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,120
It must be.

155
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,850
It has to be, and it will be.

156
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,440
How is Mr. Bang?

157
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,179
Hopefully, he will recover soon.

158
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:13,840
How is the investigation going?

159
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:16,309
I have no grounds to summon
Jung Hyun Soo forcibly.

160
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,610
I thought so.

161
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,289
- But...
- But I still summoned him.

162
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,090
I have to see if Jung Hyun Soo
will comply with it or not.

163
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,230
He will definitely come.

164
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,230
By the way, it's about Ji Wook.

165
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,769
According to the police officers
who were dispatched to the scene,

166
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,610
they said the look
on Ji Wook's face was scary.

167
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,340
They said he looked
like he might do something.

168
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,019
Where are you going?

169
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,849
Hey, Ji Wook. No Ji Wook.

170
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,460
- Where are you going right now?
- Let me go.

171
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,589
Hey!

172
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:37,329
What can you do if you meet
Jung Hyun Soo right now?

173
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:38,700
That's none of your business.

174
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,200
Please get yourself together!
Come on, Ji Wook!

175
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,900
There is nothing
you can do right now.

176
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,700
Then do I have to just sit
and watch again?

177
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,970
Hey, you know what happened.
Mr. Bang has been stabbed.

178
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,680
Then I will have to lose someone.
Should I just watch that happen?

179
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,779
No, I can't do that.
I won't just watch him die!

180
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,509
So what is your plan?

181
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,380
- What can you do right now?
- I have to do something at least.

182
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,990
I'm going to pay back what
he did to me.

183
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:05,619
Jung Hyun Soo?

184
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,730
I'm going to make him regret
just like how I'm regretting now.

185
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:26,740
It doesn't feel so bad...

186
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,980
to come to the prosecutor's office
without a proper warrant.

187
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,019
Thank you for thinking that way.

188
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,660
I said it didn't feel so bad, but
I never said it felt good.

189
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:48,470
Since you are here,
I suggest that you cooperate.

190
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:50,269
Sure. I'll do that. Have a seat.

191
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,710
So what do you want to know from me?

192
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,450
I will be blunt. I want
to know about your alibi.

193
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,720
Well, don't take this the wrong way.

194
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,059
I'm asking the same question
to everyone who knew...

195
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,930
both Lee Jae Ho and Bang Eun Ho.

196
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,869
It's my business if I take it
the wrong way or not.

197
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,269
Well, even if I do take it the wrong
way, what can I do about it?

198
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:29,809
What did I do on that day?

199
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,980
What did I do?

200
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:38,220
I worked. I have to make a living.

201
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,420
We keep a thorough delivery record.
You can get it when you investigate.

202
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:46,119
You can ask the recipients of the
deliveries and go on from there.

203
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,789
Goodness, you sure have
a good memory.

204
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,960
You can present your alibi right
away when you are asked.

205
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:57,569
You know that time I was wrongfully
arrested for Chef Yang's murder?

206
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,410
I try to remember it all since I
don't want to be framed again.

207
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,740
I can't let the lack of prosecutors'
competency frame me again.

208
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,809
Don't you agree? You are
competent unlike others.

209
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,730
- Thank you for your time.
- Sure.

210
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,640
Are you going to just let
him walk, Yoo Jung?

211
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,410
What other choices do I have? All I
have is a hunch with no proof.

212
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,440
We have to find something.

213
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,549
We have to find whatever it is.

214
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:12,509
Hello?

215
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:14,880
Hey, Mr. Jung. It's me.

216
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,650
Oh, hello, Mr. No.

217
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,119
I'd like to meet you.

218
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,390
Well, it'd be better if we met
sooner.

219
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,089
Okay, I'll wait for you.

220
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,500
Hey, when did you get here?

221
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,059
Everyone, since last night,
I have been talking to you...

222
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,259
without resting even for a moment.

223
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,930
I'm an attorney.
After all, talking is my job,

224
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:12,500
but talking by myself is...

225
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:13,799
quite challenging.

226
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,640
It's also challenging for us
to just listen to you.

227
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,839
Do you think I'm talking
for your sake?

228
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,309
I'm talking so that Mr. Bang
can hear me.

229
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:25,819
- You're loud. He has to rest.
- You're the loud one.

230
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,450
My mom collapsed unconscious
at a late age.

231
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,390
She was a bedridden patient.

232
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,829
At that time,
my dad sat near her bed...

233
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:38,900
and talked to her all day long.

234
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,730
I'm telling you.

235
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,869
There are times that my father
don't even utter three words a day.

236
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,269
"Have you eaten?"

237
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:48,640
"You're awake?"

238
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,910
Things like that, you know.

239
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,940
My mother used to nag him
so much about it,

240
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,779
saying she doesn't even know her
husband's voice...

241
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,680
even though they lived together
for a long time.

242
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,650
My gosh. That quiet man...

243
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,160
became so chatty
after my mother collapsed.

244
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,160
Then one day...

245
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,559
What happened?

246
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,799
My mother regained
her consciousness...

247
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,099
and said this.

248
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,500
"I had to wake up because
that man was being so loud."

249
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,539
Goodness. Don't lie.

250
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,309
I'm dead serious.

251
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,809
Who knows?

252
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,710
Mr. Bang might wake up
because of my chatter.

253
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,450
Gosh, my throat is sore.

254
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,289
It must be the nurse.

255
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:42,230
She said she'd change the fluid.

256
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,190
Yes, come in...

257
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:48,369
Hello.

258
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,940
Our ex-client is here.

259
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,480
How did you know he was here?
We weren't expecting you.

260
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
I just...

261
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,349
wanted to visit as I was so worried
after hearing what happened to him.

262
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,130
I didn't know that you'd come
all the way here, Mr. Jung.

263
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,500
You told me to come. That's why...

264
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,140
Really? I'm pretty sure I never
asked you to meet me here.

265
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:31,269
It looks like I'm intruding again.
Aren't I?

266
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:32,309
Yes.

267
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,210
We'll need to talk outside.
You're okay with that, right?

268
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,349
Of course. It's fine.

269
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:37,779
Let's go, then.

270
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:43,349
Ms. Eun.

271
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,190
What was that about?

272
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,130
Where should we go?

273
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,170
We should find a quiet spot.

274
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,299
No, we should find a noisy spot.

275
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,309
All right, then.

276
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:04,670
Let's go.

277
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,750
I told you that I don't have a voice
recorder or anything like that.

278
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,289
Do we really have to talk at
a place that's this noisy, Mr. Jung?

279
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:21,990
Yes, we do have to talk in the
midst of noise like this, Mr. No.

280
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,329
I'm going to be honest with you and
tell you something very important.

281
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:28,299
All right. Go ahead.

282
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,799
I killed them all.

283
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,240
Those bodies
in the water tank and...

284
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,180
You know Ms. Eun's boyfriend, right?

285
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,779
That guy and...
Who was the other guy?

286
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,150
Right, Chef Yang too.

287
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,680
I killed all of them.

288
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,420
Well, you don't even seem surprised.

289
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,150
I already knew it was your doing.

290
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,460
Then why aren't you arresting me?

291
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,259
Arrest me. Here.

292
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,130
You just wait. I'll be sure
to get you arrested very soon.

293
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,200
My goodness...

294
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,279
Well, I suddenly remembered
that time.

295
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,809
I just thought about what happened
with the Chef Yang case.

296
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,950
I stabbed him and killed him,
you know. I was the culprit,

297
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,819
yet you defended me so passionately.

298
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:24,220
I thought you looked very cool
back then. What did you say?

299
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,920
What... Oh, you talked
about the fabricated...

300
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,390
Due to the fabricated pieces
of evidence,

301
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,630
an innocent man was unfairly
framed for murder.

302
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,400
Who will uphold his rights?

303
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,539
That was so cool. You rocked.

304
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,099
Right.

305
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:44,509
I'm deeply regretting
what I did back then.

306
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,710
Don't smirk, you scum.

307
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:49,650
Had I gotten to know you sooner...

308
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,579
Had I figured you out a little
sooner and not given you freedom,

309
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,289
neither Lee Jae Ho nor Ko Chan Ho
would have ended up like that.

310
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:57,450
And Mr. Bang...

311
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,789
You wouldn't have been able...

312
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,930
to harm him like that.

313
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,009
Are you now beginning
to understand how I feel?

314
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:20,440
Have you ever seen anyone
close to you getting hurt?

315
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:24,509
Think about those who mean
a lot to you.

316
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:26,680
If those people who are
so dear to you...

317
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,289
die or get hurt...

318
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,059
Do you now know how it feels?

319
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,359
If you do,

320
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,930
you should...

321
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:38,460
try to understand me.

322
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,730
Just leave me alone.
Don't meddle in my business, please.

323
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,500
Then I'll really leave you guys
alone too. I won't do anything.

324
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,940
I can promise you.

325
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,640
Let's promise. Deal? Yes?

326
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,509
I don't want to.

327
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,460
I guess you still don't really
understand how I feel.

328
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,960
I truly want to make you
feel this too.

329
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,200
What should I do?

330
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,569
I should just kill them all.

331
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,079
Ms. Eun, are you going somewhere?

332
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,579
I can't just wait here.
Something bad might happen to him.

333
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,150
- I should go and...
- Ji Wook...

334
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,950
told Jung Hyun Soo to come here
on purpose.

335
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:07,549
Pardon?

336
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:11,019
To give me time
to dig up things on him.

337
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:14,720
I hope he doesn't get hurt badly.

338
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,289
Sorry?

339
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:19,029
Hey, Jung Hyun Soo.

340
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,329
I was going to just let you go,

341
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:27,869
but I don't think I can
do that today, you scum.

342
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,279
Did you just punch me?

343
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,450
Come again.

344
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,079
Enough is enough.

345
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,490
Is this a joke or what?

346
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,250
Enough, my foot.

347
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,390
Gosh, this is crazy.

348
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,160
What? Bring it on.

349
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:52,859
Hey, come on.

350
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:16,490
Yes, hello?

351
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,190
Pardon me?

352
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:27,099
Are you two kids or what?
Look at your faces.

353
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:32,069
I'm truly embarrassed
as his attorney.

354
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:34,599
- You're an attorney?
- Yes.

355
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:36,869
Oh, me too.

356
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,849
Please help them resolve this soon.
They just need to settle,

357
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,150
but they're insisting that they
won't.

358
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,349
It's actually this guy who's
refusing to settle.

359
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,119
I'd like to settle, but... Sir.

360
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:55,589
Please look at this.

361
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,859
I can't settle because
this hurts so much.

362
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:01,730
- Then I won't settle either.
- Gosh, I don't have time for this.

363
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,400
Then I'll need to lock you guys up
in the holding cell.

364
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,059
Where are we going right now,
Mr. Ji?

365
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,269
- If my guess is right...
- I'm going to do something bad.

366
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:41,970
Will you join me or stay out of it?

367
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,180
Find it whatever it may be.

368
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,309
What if there's nothing?

369
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,720
You know how meticulous he is.

370
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:53,109
His house key is in the basket
where our belongings are.

371
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:56,109
It's a finger-sized smart key.

372
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,980
Okay.

373
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,329
I'm sorry.

374
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,829
I'll look through his desk.

375
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:17,829
Okay.

376
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,010
If...

377
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,480
If there is nothing,

378
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,110
we should plant...

379
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,679
a murder weapon that has...

380
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
his fingerprints.

381
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Mr. Ji.

382
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,050
I don't think there's anything
we can use here.

383
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:12,179
I agree.

384
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:16,389
But we should still look
for something.

385
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,190
Okay.

386
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:44,309
Hey, Mr. Bang.

387
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:49,019
Everyone is trying their best...

388
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,719
to find the culprit
who did this to you.

389
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,960
Please just wake up already. Okay?

390
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:58,559
Hey, I don't think I can...

391
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,130
take care of your urine anymore.

392
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,329
Wake up.

393
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:10,510
I think they might have found...

394
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,510
the culprit who stabbed you.

395
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,050
(Agreement)

396
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,690
(Victim: Jung Hyun Soo,
Assailant: No Ji Wook)

397
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,900
If you were going to settle, you
should've done it yesterday.

398
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,130
I agree. Goodness.

399
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,039
We're sorry. Can we go now?

400
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,500
Then do you plan on living here?

401
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,730
This is a weapon
with his fingerprints...

402
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:11,670
which I took from his house.

403
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,869
If we put Mr. Bang and
Lee Jae Ho's blood on it,

404
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,940
this will be the perfect piece of
evidence that makes him the killer.

405
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:20,440
That's right.

406
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,980
It won't be a problem since the size
is similar to the murder weapon.

407
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,320
I get that they are similar.

408
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,219
I brought it since you asked, but
are you really going to use this?

409
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,360
Maybe.

410
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,159
Let me say this. It might not sound
like something I usually say.

411
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,300
This is fabricating evidence.
This is an illegal activity.

412
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,570
I know. It's Clause 1, Article 155
of Criminal Law,

413
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,599
tampering with evidence.

414
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,199
"He or she may serve a maximum
of 5 years or pay 7,000 dollars."

415
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,340
That's not all.

416
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:50,139
Do you know that you will lose
your license to practice law?

417
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,110
- I know.
- And you will still do it?

418
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,210
Yes, I will.

419
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Hey, Ji Wook.

420
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,809
As he disclosed it himself,
he's the culprit,

421
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:59,019
but we have no legal pieces
of evidence. Then what should we do?

422
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:01,150
What should we do?
What am I supposed to do?

423
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,590
Should I just watch?

424
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:05,550
Should I watch him murdering
people as he pleases?

425
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:06,989
We should dig a bit more.

426
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:08,590
What if we still can't
find anything?

427
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,929
We'll worry about that later.

428
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,360
You're right.

429
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,730
This is like a leverage
we can use later.

430
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,500
This is our last card we will use...

431
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,269
after trying to do everything
in our power.

432
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,199
Fine.

433
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,070
Then I will do it.
You should stay out of it.

434
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,269
What?

435
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,610
If I fabricate a piece of evidence,
it fits my reputation,

436
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,739
but yours doesn't.

437
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,309
You used to be a righteous
prosecutor. Don't you remember?

438
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:35,280
I asked you to do this.

439
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:37,389
I'm going to do this.
You need to stay out of it.

440
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:38,989
Then...

441
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:41,090
I should do it.

442
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:48,599
I have experience of staying
in prison.

443
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,929
The number of times won't matter.

444
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,900
I'll do it.

445
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,710
I thought you were at the hospital.

446
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,510
I just got here.
Mr. Byun asked me to go home.

447
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,510
- Bong Hee, this is...
- If you need someone to do it,

448
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,349
I'll do it.

449
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,849
It's my fault.

450
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,250
From the beginning,

451
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,059
it has been my fault.

452
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,289
It's because I brought
Jung Hyun Soo into this.

453
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:25,500
Everyone...

454
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:28,199
has their own reasons
imputable to the incident.

455
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:39,619
- We will be back.
- Okay.

456
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,349
Please go home now. If you do this,
I'll ban you from working overtime.

457
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:45,550
I have to go soon. Mr. Byun
wants to have a drink with me.

458
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,690
You're drinking again?

459
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,690
I asked the same thing myself.

460
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:48,920
I'll see you tomorrow.

461
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,489
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Bang.

462
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:51,559
Goodbye.

463
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,139
(Mr. Byun Young Hee)

464
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,639
Yes, Mr. Byun. Where should I...

465
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:09,110
- I have to cancel our plan tonight.
- Pardon?

466
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,150
My doctor told me
not to drink. Darn it.

467
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,349
That's right. You ought
to listen to your doctor.

468
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:18,789
Okay. Goodbye then.

469
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:20,460
You should go home now.

470
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,860
I'm saved.

471
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,929
If I didn't...

472
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:34,599
cancel our plan on that night...

473
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,510
No.

474
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:42,440
It's my fault.

475
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,590
Yes. We have to find out
the identity of this person.

476
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:56,159
Yes. Gosh, I asked you
for so many favors. I'm sorry, sir.

477
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,260
Yes.

478
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,860
Mr. Bang, Ji Wook told you
to stop investigating on your own.

479
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,500
Okay. I see.

480
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,570
Suit yourself.

481
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
I see.

482
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,610
Yes. And then?

483
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,650
Hey, you are here.

484
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,019
Goodness.

485
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,110
If I stopped you that time...

486
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,309
Let's stop...

487
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,289
blaming ourselves or each other
for what happened.

488
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:09,159
Let's especially stop blaming
our own selves.

489
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,300
I thought I was the only one who was
full of regret.

490
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,469
I thought I was the only one who was
beating myself up.

491
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:00,659
Please help them resolve this soon.
They just need to settle,

492
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,869
but they're insisting that they
won't.

493
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:05,230
It's actually this guy who's
refusing to settle.

494
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:14,380
So that's why Mr. No did
what he did.

495
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,380
This is fun.

496
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:27,119
I checked Jung Hyun Soo's alibi
on the day Mr. Bang got attacked.

497
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:30,489
So are you saying that you
weren't able to...

498
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:33,400
see his face because
he kept his helmet on?

499
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,829
Yes, that's right.

500
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,269
I couldn't see his face because his
helmet was so dark,

501
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,730
and he didn't even say a word.

502
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:41,869
Sorry? He didn't say anything?

503
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,369
No.

504
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,880
Seeing that he never took his helmet
off and he never spoke out loud,

505
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,510
I think he used a substitute.

506
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:52,949
Even so, the CCTV footage and his
cell phone location show nothing.

507
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,949
It's a perfect alibi, even in a
scientific point of view.

508
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,349
That kind of assumption will get us
nowhere.

509
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:58,849
You're right.

510
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,159
What about the result of...

511
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:03,360
the autopsy of the second corpse
that came out of the water tank?

512
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:04,489
There wasn't anything much.

513
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,630
The body was severely damaged
to begin with,

514
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,500
and there was no evidence nor DNA
related to Jung Hyun Soo.

515
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:14,900
Nothing much was found
from Mr. Bang's clothes either.

516
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,409
I almost forgot.

517
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:22,110
I found this.

518
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:24,409
(Kim Sung Joon, Soosoo Studio,
67, Haetsal-gil, Mapo-gu, Seoul)

519
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,719
I found this on Mr. Bang's desk.

520
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,349
I looked into all the names
on this list.

521
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,260
And I found out that they have
something to do with Ko Chan Ho.

522
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:37,630
They either went to the same school
or lived in the same town as him.

523
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,230
Really? Let's look into this
together.

524
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:43,570
Don't do that. Just pass all the
information to me.

525
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:45,000
You're all civilians.

526
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:48,340
You're working with civilians
right now.

527
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:53,739
I wonder if we'll ever get any
solid evidence.

528
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,849
I wish a weapon or something would
suddenly appear.

529
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:25,940
(Unknown number)

530
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,360
My gosh.

531
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:48,500
Mr. No.

532
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,989
You're a lawyer.
Why are you always so violent?

533
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,360
Well, I just wanted to see you
from up close.

534
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,730
Let go.

535
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:18,289
Okay.

536
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:24,099
Hey.

537
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,099
Hey. Didn't we agree to mind
each other's own business?

538
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,110
- Didn't we?
- My gosh.

539
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:40,119
Is that why you came into my house
and went through my stuff?

540
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,820
Who? Me? When?

541
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:48,119
My gosh.

542
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:51,329
Hey.

543
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,829
I told you that I won't bother you
if you don't bother me first.

544
00:49:57,429 --> 00:50:00,639
I'm already so busy. Why do you keep
challenging me?

545
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:02,400
I wouldn't have come this far...

546
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,079
if people like you had done your job
properly in the first place.

547
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,210
I'm only becoming like this because
you guys keep...

548
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:14,219
locking up the innocent and letting
go of the ones who are truly guilty.

549
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,389
Mr. No.

550
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,000
I'm...

551
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,869
doing what's right.

552
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:33,500
Okay?

553
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,969
I'm only doing what I must do.

554
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,769
Don't you understand?

555
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,050
I only know him.
I don't know the others.

556
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,460
What about...

557
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:56,289
this guy?

558
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,599
To sum up,

559
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:08,500
Chef Yang went to study abroad
when he was in high school.

560
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:11,469
And he went there because he had
caused trouble here in Korea.

561
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,280
That's what the rumors said.

562
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,239
Do you remember what the
rumors were...

563
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:19,179
and exactly when it was that
he went abroad?

564
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:21,750
No, I don't know that much.

565
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,960
Do you really not know anyone?

566
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,599
No. It's been too long,
so I can't remember much,

567
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:39,699
whatever that may be.

568
00:51:40,769 --> 00:51:42,269
Thank you for your cooperation.

569
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,940
But what's going on? Why are you...

570
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,480
asking people about the past?

571
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:56,150
Well, it's just that I've also been
getting calls from Mr. Bang.

572
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:59,719
And now, I even got a visit from
a lawyer. So I was just curious.

573
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,170
That's right.
I fabricated the evidence.

574
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:20,480
I used tricks
in order to catch Eun Bong Hee.

575
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,349
You didn't do this to stop him.

576
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,960
You did this as a way
of punishing him.

577
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,960
Am I wrong?

578
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,460
What's wrong with that?

579
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:40,199
I'm...

580
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,030
doing what's right.

581
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,630
Okay?

582
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:48,369
I'm only doing what I must do.

583
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,550
I'll discard this.

584
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,599
So...

585
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,570
I'm saying...

586
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:20,639
we will never use this.

587
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:34,780
It'll be a bit frustrating, but we
should do it through the front door.

588
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,820
Otherwise, we'll become
just like them.

589
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,360
All right. Let's take our time.

590
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,989
I agree with you too.

591
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:47,230
Jung Hyun Soo must be planning
something else now.

592
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,599
We don't exactly know
whom his target is,

593
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,670
but we're certain that he's
getting his revenge, one at a time.

594
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:52,670
It means...

595
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,300
there was a case where the accuser
evaded law enforcement...

596
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,610
or received a light to non-existent
punishment for what he did.

597
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,940
That's right. Someone among those
whom Mr. Bang looked into...

598
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,650
keeps popping up in my mind.

599
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:05,409
Reach out to Prosecutor Cha
for cooperation.

600
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,480
What I'm trying to say is...

601
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,889
that we should remember
what happened to Mr. Bang...

602
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,190
and be careful. Got it?

603
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:16,389
Of course.

604
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:43,449
Well done.

605
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,860
You made the right decision, Mr. No.

606
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:50,730
I'm proud of you.

607
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,849
Chef Yang died,

608
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:19,050
and Chan Ho has gone missing.

609
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:22,960
Jae Ho died too.

610
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,360
What if...

611
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:29,760
Darn it.

612
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,449
I got a text message.

613
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:22,480
I'm certain that Jung Hyun Soo is
the culprit.

614
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,650
There is evidence.

615
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,690
So what?

616
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,090
Help me get a warrant issued.

617
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:27,820
We must search his place
to secure the evidence.

618
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,889
We can only get a search warrant
issued when there is evidence.

619
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,059
Chief.

620
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,500
Shall I resign if I'm wrong?

621
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:35,929
Will you approve it, then?

622
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:37,400
You'll resign?

623
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,670
You think your job
is a joke or something?

624
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:41,639
Do whatever you want! Goodness.

625
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:43,000
Sir, please.

626
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,019
(Cha Yoo Jung)

627
00:56:56,949 --> 00:56:57,949
Hey, Yoo Jung.

628
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:03,389
Wait, what are you talking about?

629
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:07,000
All right.

630
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:15,099
(Charge Sheet)

631
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:36,059
Darn it.

632
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,010
What brings you here,
Prosecutor Cha?

633
00:57:58,579 --> 00:57:59,650
I have a warrant.

634
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:02,150
You must've seen this in the news.

635
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,090
A search and seizure warrant.

636
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,989
What's the warrant for?

637
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:07,760
On what grounds?

638
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,860
- Let us in.
- Excuse me, Prosecutor Cha.

639
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:14,329
Wait, Prosecutor Cha.

640
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:18,469
Take your shoes off, Mister.
Do you think this is your...

641
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,000
This is crazy.

642
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:26,840
Hey, that's expensive!

643
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:29,710
Excuse me.

644
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,510
Does the warrant let you barge in
and go through my stuff like this?

645
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:02,739
I found it.

646
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:15,219
Gosh, No Ji Wook...

647
00:59:17,389 --> 00:59:18,460
Well, that's...

648
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:21,559
- Jung Hyun Soo!
- Stop right there!

649
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:29,739
Jung Hyun Soo!

650
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,429
Goodness, what's wrong with me?

651
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,769
Hey, Mr. Bang!

652
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,409
Hey, Mr. Bang! Mr. Bang!

653
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,329
(Kim Jong Wan's "The Memory of That
Day" is on music websites.)

654
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,079
How could you have let this happen?
You humiliated me!

655
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:28,320
Mr. Bang, Mr. Bang.

656
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:31,550
Mr. No, you've been through a lot.

657
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:33,550
Are you sleepy? Get some sleep.

658
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:45,699
