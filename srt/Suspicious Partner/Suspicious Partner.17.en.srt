1
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,039
I wanted to know more
about my parents' accident.

2
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,780
He's Ms. Eun's father,
isn't he? The suspect, Eun Man Soo.

3
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:41,509
Didn't we agree to mind
our own businesses?

4
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,020
I'm doing the right thing now.

5
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,649
The prime suspect is
Jung Hyun Soo as you know.

6
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,350
It's Jung Hyun Soo,
but it won't be easy.

7
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,820
Find it no matter what. If there's
nothing, we should plant one...

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,229
like a weapon
with his fingerprints.

9
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:55,359
This is a search warrant.

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,500
- I found it.
- Gosh, No Ji Wook.

11
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,270
Jung Hyun Soo!

12
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,069
I was going to make you pay
for what you have done.

13
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,079
You pegged him as the culprit.

14
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,780
You said yourself
that he killed your parents.

15
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,780
What on earth did I see?

16
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,920
How could I not have known?

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,549
The story of the victim's family
in my dad's article.

18
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,459
The anniversary date of
both our fathers' deaths.

19
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,890
When did you find out?

20
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,659
Then when did you find
out about my dad, Mr. No?

21
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:31,099
Let's break up.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,129
I came to give you this.
I apologize.

23
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:35,370
And thank you for everything.

24
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:38,069
I'm not sure.

25
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,510
I don't remember who it was.

26
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,579
I don't know.

27
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:44,909
It was that man.

28
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,310
He's the culprit.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,680
What are these two contrasting
memories that popped into my head?

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,049
Which one is the truth?

31
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,129
Can you recognize him?

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,129
This is the man who...

33
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,400
killed your mom and dad.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,400
Okay?

35
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,509
This is the man who
killed your mom and dad.

36
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:19,810
This is the man who
killed your mom and dad.

37
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,580
He killed your mom.

38
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,219
I don't remember who it was.

39
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,750
I don't know.

40
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,419
Yes, Mr. Bang.

41
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,159
Yes, he's still the same.

42
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,530
The doctor said there's been
no improvement.

43
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Right.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,530
Yes, okay.

45
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:17,699
All right.

46
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:51,870
Mr. Jung Hyun Soo.

47
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,139
You know who I am?

48
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,329
(Mr. Bang)

49
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,600
Yes, Mr. Bang.

50
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,670
Jung Hyun Soo has just woken up.

51
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,240
Pardon?

52
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,279
Okay. I'm on my way.

53
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,050
Yes, I got it.

54
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,379
I'll be there right away.

55
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:42,649
(Testing the Waters)

56
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,050
(Episode 33)

57
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,100
Are you okay?

58
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes, I'm okay.

59
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,670
Prosecutor Cha and police
officers just took Jung Hyun Soo.

60
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,209
They said they needed
to examine him.

61
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,879
Actually, I did see him
on my way here.

62
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,709
How did he look to you?

63
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,990
He seemed a bit strange to me.

64
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,990
Mr. Jung Hyun Soo.

65
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,629
You know who I am?

66
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,350
I came just in case you guys
wait endlessly.

67
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,319
The testing will take a long time.

68
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,790
Even if it ends early,
you can't see him today.

69
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,689
Well, I did predict we won't
be able to meet him today.

70
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,829
Call me as soon as we can see him.

71
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,160
Okay, I will.

72
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,060
- Let's go, Ms. Eun.
- Okay.

73
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:55,079
I'm going to go that way.

74
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,920
I'll drop you off.

75
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,889
No, that won't be necessary.
There are a lot of buses I can take.

76
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Bye.

77
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
It was this man.

78
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,600
He's the culprit.

79
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,939
Bong Hee.

80
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,720
Do you know which bus
you are supposed to take?

81
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,990
Yes, I do.

82
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,059
I have the bus route in my head.

83
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,759
Okay, bye.

84
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,639
There's no need to be so serious.

85
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:08,950
What's the big deal about a murderer
regaining his consciousness?

86
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:10,779
You're right. Don't worry.

87
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,750
I'm going to send Jung Hyun Soo
to prison no matter what.

88
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,549
He's already being held in custody,
Mr. Bang.

89
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,860
If his physical condition is fine,
he'll get arrested soon.

90
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,519
Prosecutor Cha will take care of it.

91
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:21,889
You're right.

92
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,399
Hey, why are you here?

93
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,840
He insists on meeting Mr. No
before he leaves.

94
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:33,769
Really?

95
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,370
Hey, kid. Hey!

96
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,840
I'm talking to you.

97
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,980
Are you deaf?

98
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:44,820
Mr. No.

99
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:49,350
He can obviously hear me, right?

100
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,990
Hey!

101
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,259
That little punk.

102
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,710
My goodness.

103
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,009
Hey!

104
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:18,519
You almost gave me a heart attack.

105
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,159
I already had one,
so I don't have a heart anymore.

106
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,559
What nonsense are you saying?

107
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:28,759
Are you a zombie?

108
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,309
Hey, Prosecutor Na.

109
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,080
Is it easy...

110
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,779
to get amnesia?

111
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:48,909
Is it a common illness?

112
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,419
How would I know?

113
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,220
What?

114
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,759
Did you make a stew?

115
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,289
Yes.

116
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,460
What's gotten into you?

117
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,919
Hey, what did you put in this?

118
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,320
What ingredient did you use to
make a stew taste so horrible?

119
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,149
My gosh.

120
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,220
You're completely useless.

121
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,970
What? Why?

122
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:50,509
It's not much.
Here's my living expense.

123
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,759
My gosh, you should give me more
if you have any conscience.

124
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:10,059
Ji Hye,

125
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:12,730
- I'm really...
- What? Are you sad?

126
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,830
Are you sad again?

127
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,970
You're not the only one who's sad.
I'm sad too.

128
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,639
But I'm really sad this time.

129
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,990
Can you recognize him?

130
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,559
This...

131
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,129
is the man...

132
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,330
who killed your mom and dad.

133
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:48,700
Okay?

134
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,690
(Prosecutor Reappointment
Application)

135
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,470
You are still here?

136
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:31,110
Are you...

137
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,549
trying to become a prosecutor again?

138
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,980
Why are you peeking at
other people's stuff?

139
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,360
I saw it by accident.

140
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,389
Don't be so harsh on me.

141
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:49,090
Does it not...

142
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,700
suit your taste to work as a lawyer?

143
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,039
I'm just really frustrated at the
fact that I can't do anything...

144
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,340
about criminals like Jung Hyun Soo.

145
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,409
I let Jung Hyun Soo free.

146
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,820
I really want to...

147
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,820
lock him up in prison.

148
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,720
But there's really nothing I can do.

149
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,090
I guess...

150
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,299
I enjoy exercising governmental
authority.

151
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,500
I...

152
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,970
didn't like it when you
used to be...

153
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:35,610
a prosecutor.

154
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,009
Why?

155
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:40,539
You always worked overtime
and couldn't sleep properly.

156
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,779
And you always had to deal with
brutal criminals.

157
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,820
Your job...

158
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,379
was always really tough.

159
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,490
I was worried that...

160
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,620
you might end up...

161
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,289
like your dad.

162
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:04,899
But...

163
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,470
if that's what you want to do,
I won't stop you.

164
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,110
I don't know.

165
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:14,549
I wonder if...

166
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,080
the DA will even allow me to get
hired.

167
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,820
We'll have to see what happens.

168
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,070
I'd like to know more specifically
about...

169
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,139
my parents' accident.

170
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,240
That's the only way
I'll be able to...

171
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:47,580
confidently go to him and ask him...

172
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,509
why he did such a thing.

173
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:55,950
I'll try to search the investigator
of that case.

174
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,919
I'm always really...

175
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,090
You're grateful, aren't you?

176
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,160
My gosh.

177
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,329
Well, just... Just a little.

178
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,900
Just a little.

179
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:13,539
I see.

180
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,210
No, a lot. I'm very grateful.

181
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,410
Let's cheer up.

182
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,150
Are you going to visit
Jung Hyun Soo?

183
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,819
Yes.

184
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,230
Prosecutor Cha.

185
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
You're here.

186
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,869
How's Jung Hyun Soo doing?

187
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,410
According to his MRI and brainwave
test results,

188
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,579
he doesn't show any signs of
abnormal symptoms.

189
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,609
That means there was no physical
harm done to his brain.

190
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,650
Wait. Then how does that explain
what I saw?

191
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,750
It definitely seemed like
he didn't recognize me.

192
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,019
Then that gives us two
possibilities.

193
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,259
He's either really suffering from
dissociative amnesia,

194
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
or...

195
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:12,930
he's actually lying to us.

196
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:15,670
I'm saying that he could be
acting as if...

197
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,170
he doesn't remember what happened...

198
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,069
and who I am.

199
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,309
If that's the case,
why would he even do that?

200
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,079
I don't know. Maybe he's trying to
use that to plead for mercy...

201
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,880
in court.

202
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,779
That could be the case.

203
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,910
Anyway, the doctor said...

204
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,680
he did suffer from cerebral
hemorrhage,

205
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,420
but there aren't any damages
done to his brain.

206
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,160
And his amnesia may be
a temporary symptom,

207
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,660
so we'll have to wait and see.

208
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,690
And if it's dissociative amnesia,

209
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,099
it may be caused by a trauma
or guilt.

210
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,569
Jung Hyun Soo isn't exactly the type
to feel a sense of guilt.

211
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,440
You're right.
I completely agree with you.

212
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,410
Help me out with your authority.

213
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,940
Let me see him, Prosecutor Cha.

214
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,309
I think I need to meet with him.

215
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,319
I can only give you five minutes.

216
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,329
My gosh.

217
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,710
I wasn't too sure, but you must be
the guy who knows me.

218
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,079
Do you...

219
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,079
remember me?

220
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,450
I ran into you in the hallway
yesterday.

221
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:45,990
You have such a good memory.

222
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,559
I guess I used to have
a good memory.

223
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,730
Yes.

224
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,759
A superb one.

225
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,059
Superb...

226
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,670
I see.

227
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,470
But I don't remember anything
at the moment.

228
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,680
By any chance, is there anything
you know about what I did?

229
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,049
If there is, please tell me.
I implore you.

230
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,779
Well, I must say, this is hard.

231
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,980
I'm not sure if I have the answer
you want.

232
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,589
Gosh, this is happening again.

233
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,200
For goodness' sake.

234
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,099
(Absolute rest recommended)

235
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,740
My apologies.

236
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,710
I'm frustrated because
no one is telling me anything.

237
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,119
People keep coming here...

238
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,490
and asking me what I remember.

239
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:54,119
I wouldn't have been diagnosed
with amnesia if I could remember.

240
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,160
Aren't I right?

241
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,759
Is it that difficult
to tell me what you know?

242
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,269
I opened my eyes,
but I couldn't remember anything.

243
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:04,869
This room was filled with cops,
and they didn't even let me move.

244
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:07,170
Then a female prosecutor showed up
to say whatever she had to say.

245
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,240
She didn't even answer
any of my questions.

246
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,109
I honestly feel like
I'm going crazy right now.

247
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:13,339
Do you happen to know
about what I did in the past?

248
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,309
No. First and foremost, who am I?

249
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:18,180
And who are you?

250
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:23,549
Even without your memory,
you sure are...

251
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,190
the Jung Hyun Soo I know.

252
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,420
What on earth does that mean?

253
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,130
First of all, I used to be...

254
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,730
your attorney.

255
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:42,609
Attorney... That means...

256
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:48,650
If you were my attorney,
that means you were on my side.

257
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:52,680
That's a relief.

258
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,849
I did have someone on my side.

259
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:56,420
Well...

260
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,660
Then why aren't you
telling me anything?

261
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,289
You said you're on my side.
Then why aren't you...

262
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,630
telling me anything?
You could tell me...

263
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,529
who I am and what I did.

264
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:07,660
It shouldn't be that hard.
Can't you just tell me?

265
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,099
- It's because...
- Yes?

266
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,400
You...

267
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:14,470
Time's up, Mr. No.

268
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,740
How merciless.

269
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,680
It was nice seeing you, Mr. Jung.

270
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,589
I'm not done here.

271
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,059
How was it? Do you think
he's putting on a show or not?

272
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,069
Well, I'm not sure yet.

273
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,869
I'd say the chances are half
and half. One thing I'm certain...

274
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,670
is that his personality
is the same...

275
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,779
even with the memory loss.

276
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:36,549
My gosh.

277
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,089
I apologize. Jae Hong, you little...

278
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:42,990
Hey, get back here.
Gosh, why are you running away?

279
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,400
Hey, come here.

280
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,759
I got you.

281
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:51,539
You are at his level.

282
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,069
That is not true.

283
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:58,579
You have to go to your aunt's place
straight from your taekwondo class.

284
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:00,109
Why do you keep coming here?

285
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:03,609
I get scared
when I'm at my aunt's place.

286
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,750
That bad cop won't be able
to get out of prison,

287
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:09,319
so you can put your worries
to rest now.

288
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,450
I keep having nightmares...

289
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,259
like Ji Wook does.

290
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:21,460
Just leave him be.
He can hang out here.

291
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,369
Ms. Lack of Evidence,
you should come back to work now.

292
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,240
Are you going to be on vacation
forever or what?

293
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,339
That's what I wanted to say.

294
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,319
He's very independent.

295
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,390
He reminds me of Ji Wook as a kid.

296
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,029
- Really?
- Yes.

297
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,559
Kids spill things
and make mistakes, you know.

298
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,630
But he's so self-reliant.

299
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,039
Kids have to be childish,

300
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,970
but he acts maturer than adults do.

301
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,240
You're the mature and old one,
not me.

302
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,579
And you're just as impudent
as Ji Wook is.

303
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,190
Mr. No!

304
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,359
Gosh, get off of me.
It's too hot for this.

305
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
You little bugger.

306
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,529
Let's go, Jae Hong.
I'll take you home.

307
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:26,559
Just a second.

308
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,930
Can we have a quick talk?

309
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,420
You should end your vacation now.

310
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:57,930
For personal matters,
I'll give you more time.

311
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,329
I have things to sort out too,
so let's have more time apart.

312
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:07,069
But it's time
for you to get back to work.

313
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,710
It'll be harder for you to come back
if you drag it out for longer.

314
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,049
Okay. I'll think about it, Mr. No.

315
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,519
All right. You can think about it
all you want later.

316
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,819
Let's have a meeting first.

317
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,220
What... Right now?

318
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:25,890
Then shall we put it off?

319
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,259
There's so much work to be done.
Come on.

320
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,759
Well... Okay.

321
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:39,599
It's for the loss incurred due to
the drop in the property's value,

322
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,200
so I asked to have it evaluated.

323
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,980
But as always, it's not easy
to accurately estimate the loss.

324
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,509
Right, proving it
can be challenging.

325
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:49,509
Yes. That being said,
I think we should...

326
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:52,650
Is it true that Jung Hyun Soo has
Alzheimer's disease?

327
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,450
Goodness. This meeting
will go nowhere as always.

328
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,289
Tell me! Is it true?

329
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,259
It's not Alzheimer's disease.
He's been diagnosed with amnesia.

330
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:03,930
It's the same thing.

331
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,700
They're not the same thing.

332
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,900
Certainly not.

333
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,170
That scum is lying.

334
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:14,440
Yes. He might be putting on a show
to get his sentence reduced.

335
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,470
- But...
- But what?

336
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:20,039
It did look pretty real.

337
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,640
You're so gullible
that you let him fool you.

338
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,049
I didn't get fooled.

339
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,809
If you were a judge,

340
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,880
you would've been like, "He had
diminished capacity. Not guilty."

341
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,990
You definitely would've
acquitted people like him.

342
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,349
That's why I didn't become a judge.

343
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,920
I bet you couldn't.

344
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,559
You didn't get good grades
at the training institute.

345
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,460
Did you even check my grades
from the institute?

346
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,769
It's all on your resume.

347
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:42,829
Right.

348
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,539
You didn't have to read
and remember all the details.

349
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:49,569
Hey, go on another vacation.

350
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:51,009
Gosh, stop talking about vacation!

351
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,509
What a mess!
This meeting is going nowhere.

352
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,910
Gosh, you startled me.

353
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,549
My apologies.

354
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,220
Why are you apologizing?

355
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,490
We always end up in this mess
because of Mr. Byun.

356
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,490
As always.

357
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,359
You guys blame me all the time.

358
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,430
Yes.

359
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:11,859
Listen up.

360
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:15,069
Was it back in 1985?

361
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:18,069
There was a precedent for a suspect
who claimed he had amnesia,

362
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:21,200
which was similar
to the Jung Hyun Soo case.

363
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,170
You'll find it helpful.

364
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,839
- Oh, my.
- Impressive.

365
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:28,779
Who wants coffee?

366
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,680
Put your hands down!

367
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,460
Sir, I need to get
the warrant issued.

368
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,900
We have concrete evidence.

369
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,299
But you said his memory
isn't fully recovered yet.

370
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,599
It will be.

371
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
Are you sure?

372
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:55,970
The public consensus
isn't favorable of it.

373
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,069
What if you arrest him
and it goes south?

374
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,109
Who is going to take
the responsibility?

375
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:01,339
- I will...
- Wait a bit longer.

376
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:03,150
Pay attention to what's going on.

377
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,049
You have to see how the wheels
are turning. Okay?

378
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,519
You know nothing and
only bother me. Good grief.

379
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,309
What are you doing?
My arm's going to fall off.

380
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,690
What is that?

381
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:49,589
I see. You are studying
regarding Jung Hyun Soo's condition.

382
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:53,029
Yes, I'm studying medicine which
is completely irrelevant to my job.

383
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,769
I get that you are working hard.

384
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:00,240
You should eat your meals properly.

385
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:03,740
I don't have anyone
to eat with anyway.

386
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,339
Eating alone is more comfortable.

387
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,250
Are you...

388
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:12,720
being ostracized
from your work...

389
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,049
after the appeal I worked on?

390
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,089
You really don't know
anything about me.

391
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,019
It's not because
of that appeal case.

392
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,990
I was always an outcast.

393
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,630
I always ate alone except for a
few times that I ate with Ji Hye.

394
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,170
- Really?
- Yes.

395
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,470
Hey,

396
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,579
you should either work
or eat. Don't multitask.

397
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,180
I will read this
and summarize it for you.

398
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
Okay.

399
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:49,450
Make it a thorough summary.

400
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:50,619
Yes, ma'am.

401
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:55,829
But that paper is over 100 pages.

402
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,130
Hey.

403
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,700
Thank you for your help, my friend.

404
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,069
Drink the coffee with your sandwich.
You'll upset your stomach.

405
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,940
Okay.

406
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,160
It's late. You can
continue tomorrow.

407
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,960
I see.

408
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,299
Let me just finish this.

409
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:37,329
You don't have to work so late
on your first day back.

410
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,769
You might exhaust yourself.

411
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:41,940
Okay.

412
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,220
I'll give you a ride.

413
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,990
Oh, that's fine.

414
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,420
I know you don't need it.

415
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,529
It's just that I was
on my way out anyway.

416
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:11,369
Thank you for driving me home.

417
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:18,240
You should go in.

418
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,680
- Okay.
- Mr. No.

419
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,250
I see you often these days.

420
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,480
Right.

421
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,920
What's going on? I thought...

422
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,490
you guys broke up.

423
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,160
- Hey, Ji Hye.
- What?

424
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,289
Mr. No.

425
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,329
You should get going. Drive safely.

426
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:41,559
All right. Shall I get going?

427
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,599
Yes.

428
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,970
See you around.

429
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:47,700
- Bye.
- Bye.

430
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,210
Oh, what brings the two of you here?

431
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,279
Ji Hye, you're here too.

432
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:05,150
Ji Wook.

433
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:09,630
Why are you guys together?

434
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,190
I asked you first.

435
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,460
Why are the three of you together?

436
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:16,029
I live with her.

437
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,269
My gosh, you're more generous
than I thought you'd be.

438
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:22,470
Letting a friend stay at your place
isn't an easy thing to do.

439
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,440
I agree with you.

440
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:26,880
I thought you two lived together.

441
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,509
Did you guys break up?

442
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:34,549
What?

443
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,650
She's worse than me.

444
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,319
What's gotten into you?

445
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,420
You said you hate Ms. Eun
the most in the whole world.

446
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,490
Why do you live with her?

447
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,059
Well, you know.

448
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,960
She basically barged in
and coerced me to let her stay.

449
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,900
Oh, is that what happened?

450
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:49,930
Pardon me?

451
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:53,170
No, I guess not.

452
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,569
What's going on here?

453
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,539
Are you trying to act coy?

454
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:59,079
When did I act coy?

455
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,079
Why would she do that?

456
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,140
For whom?

457
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,680
That's really not what I was doing.

458
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,180
When did I do such a thing?

459
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,789
I'm off.

460
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,590
It looks like you'll have
to stay longer.

461
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,159
No, I'm leaving too. Wait up.

462
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,429
Bye.

463
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:21,360
Bye.

464
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,269
Stay for a bit longer.

465
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,530
Bye, see you.

466
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,570
I don't think I can do this.

467
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,099
You're putting me in a foul mood.

468
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,369
Let's sit at separate tables.

469
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:02,710
Why? I like this.

470
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,579
Do you know how long it's been since
we last drank together like this?

471
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:07,710
I don't know,
and I'm not interested.

472
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,710
This reminds me of the old days.

473
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,179
I don't remember anything.

474
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,570
Hey, Ji Wook.

475
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:36,739
Why are you and Ms. Eun
having problems?

476
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
Hey.

477
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,409
Know your place, Eun Hyuk.

478
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,510
Just let me give you
a piece of advice today.

479
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,119
Don't break it off with her.

480
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,230
I don't think you'll be okay
if you two break up.

481
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,559
We didn't break up...

482
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,369
yet.

483
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,949
Well, what's the problem? Tell me.

484
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,420
Do you think talking about it...

485
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,889
will make me feel better?

486
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:25,789
Will talking to you about it...

487
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,090
take a load off...

488
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,159
of my mind?

489
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,570
Since I was a kid,

490
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,010
I've always had nightmares.

491
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,409
Did you know that?

492
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,980
That I know.

493
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:50,280
In the dreams, I always saw
the man who tried...

494
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,380
to kill me and my parents
in the arson case,

495
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:58,750
and I remembered his face.

496
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,690
Who is he?

497
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,019
Bong Hee's dad.

498
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,570
Are you sure about that?

499
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,300
I don't know. Well...

500
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,170
It happened so long ago.

501
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,010
And memory isn't...

502
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:19,710
always accurate, you know.

503
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:21,809
I have no idea.

504
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,820
What about Ms. Eun? Does she know?

505
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:37,429
She wants to break up.

506
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,269
What about you?

507
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:47,900
Hey, telling you this isn't making
me feel any better.

508
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,170
I don't feel better.

509
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:52,980
You are useless.

510
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,980
Sir, bring us the check please.

511
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,750
Hey, No Ji Wook.

512
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,489
Hey,

513
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:05,119
mind your own business.

514
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,429
And I...

515
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:20,869
don't care...

516
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,940
about you and Yoo Jung.

517
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,329
The doctor said you are healthy
enough to be questioned.

518
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:58,039
Now, it's time for us to
get to the point.

519
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,380
Mr. Jung.

520
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,150
- Yes?
- You're being investigated about...

521
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,719
Lee Jae Ho's murder case and an
attempted murder of Bang Eun Ho.

522
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:25,429
Murder?

523
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,739
I killed a person?

524
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,510
Yes.

525
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,909
You have the right to refuse to
answer if it may incriminate you.

526
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,050
You have the right to consult
to an attorney.

527
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:43,519
Are you okay, Mr. Jung?

528
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,719
What?

529
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:48,059
I...

530
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,329
If I really did murder someone,

531
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,829
it's fair that I be punished.

532
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,780
Goodness, this crazy meeting
has ended at last.

533
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,550
Jung Hyun Soo still hasn't
regained his memory?

534
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,960
Not yet, but...

535
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,130
I'm going to make him
regain his memory.

536
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:25,329
What about just leaving him alone?

537
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,460
If he gets his memory back,

538
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,599
he might be a menace again.

539
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:33,800
No, we ought to make him remember
and be punished justly.

540
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:36,909
The prosecution has
to investigate further crimes...

541
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,039
and Bong Hee has to clear
her name too.

542
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:46,849
I'll help too.

543
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,820
I'm going to delve into his past.

544
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,119
If you do that, just like Eun Ho,
you might...

545
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:00,130
I'm sorry, Mr. Bang.

546
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,769
No, I'm the one who should be sorry.

547
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:05,400
Jung Hyun Soo is being detained
in the hospital.

548
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,570
I will be safe.

549
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:09,369
I'll help as well. I can protect
her if it gets dangerous.

550
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:10,969
Don't worry, Ji Wook.

551
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:13,710
Okay. For your information,
I might be stronger than you.

552
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,440
Come on, Ms. Eun.

553
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,980
But this is after your work hours.

554
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,119
During your work hours,
please stay in the office.

That little...

557
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,590
Anyway,

558
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:30,590
be careful.

559
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,230
When you meet Jung Hyun Soo,

560
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:35,159
you should be careful too.

561
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:45,570
Hey, are they dating
each other or what?

562
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:03,260
Hello.

563
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,099
Supposedly, I...

564
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:12,840
killed a person.

565
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,670
Is that why you didn't tell me?

566
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:19,980
You must...

567
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:22,849
have been deeply shocked.

568
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,050
That's why...

569
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,760
I gave this a lot of thought
on my own.

570
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,730
Wasn't there...

571
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,429
a reason why I must have killed him?

572

You're thinking outside the box.

573

Oh, am I?

574
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,909
It looks like you don't
understand it.

575
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:56,579
Okay, fine.

576
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,579
I'll help you regain your memory.

577
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,449
- Will you cooperate?
- Of course.

578
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,889
I'd be grateful.

You should go first.

660
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,230
I'll be right there.

661
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:45,610
By the way, you said...

662
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:49,210
I don't have any friends or family,
right?

663
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:52,380
That's what I heard.

664
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,519
Did I not even like anyone?

665
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,349
The last thing Jung Hyun Soo was
looking at was...

666
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,139
Yes, it's me.

667
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,550
Mr. No.

668
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:03,590
I think I've found out
why Jung Hyun Soo kills people.

669
00:58:04,989 --> 00:58:08,119
Did that girl go to Hyunjin
Middle School by any chance?

670
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,489
Yes.

671
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,929
All right. Good work.

672
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,670
It's suffocating to stay indoors
all the time.

673
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,269
I'd like to go outside.

674
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,409
Darn it.

675
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:24,400
Jung Hyun Soo.

676
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:39,239
Are you really okay?
Aren't you feeling dizzy at all?

677
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:41,179
- I'm fine.
- Shall I get you anything?

678
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,409
Is there anything you need?

679
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:44,579
I really hope things change.

680
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:46,449
I can't handle it.

681
01:00:46,449 --> 01:00:48,480
Do you think Jung Hyun Soo
will really come here?

682
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,489
This is the one place
he remembers for certain.

683
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:54,090
After that,
he'll go to the places...

684
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,260
where he killed people.

685
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,559
Who are you?

686
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,130
Mr. No. Mr. No.

687
01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:00,659
Mr. No.

688
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:12,639
(Love in Trouble)
