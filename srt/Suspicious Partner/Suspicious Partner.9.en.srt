1
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,509
(Bong Hee: I'm on my way to
Hanmoo Park to meet Ko Chan Ho.)

2
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,890
This is what one poet said.

3
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,789
"We can generally
predict the start of things."

4
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,890
"But we can't generally
predict the end of them."

5
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,000
In my case, it was the opposite.

6
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,599
I had to experience the end of
things many times in my short life.

7
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,810
I hesitated to start this because
I was afraid of it coming to an end.

8
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:13,379
The moment I realized
my feelings for you...

9
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,250
Don't fall for me.

10
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,890
I ran away from you...

11
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,989
like a coward.

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,359
Bong Hee, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,629
Please stay...

14
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,599
Please stay with me
for just five minutes.

15
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,900
And I failed...

16
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,140
because...

17
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,510
I started to have feelings
for you without realizing.

18
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,040
I just realized it late.

19
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,079
I wonder when and
with what incident it began.

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,180
I realized it too late that I can't
figure out the starting point of it.

21
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,049
Come back to me.

22
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,319
Come work for me.

23
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:28,219
The only thing...

24
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,960
that I know now is...

25
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,340
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,870
Do you mean it?

27
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,280
Yes, I do.

28
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,250
Let's see if you are
telling the truth.

29
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,560
You are telling the truth.

30
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:30,479
Mr. No.

31
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,639
I can't get my head around it.

32
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,610
I just know my relationship with you
that I can't stop...

33
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,939
going further, has begun.

34
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:38,680
Bong Hee.

35
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Hey.

36
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:27,930
You little...

37
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,470
What was that? My gosh.

38
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,470
Where do you think you're going?

39
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,639
I told you to pay for your mistake.

40
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:42,970
Do you think I was joking?

41
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,379
I can't do this anymore!

42
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,120
This is driving me crazy.

43
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,250
My gosh.

44
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,290
My goodness.

45
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,129
What...

46
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,939
My gosh.

47
00:07:58,579 --> 00:07:59,949
Wait a minute. Let's see.

48
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Now...

49
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,660
Four people have disappeared,

50
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,100
and three people will disappear.

51
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,799
I... I was just about to knock on
your door.

52
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,539
What a coincidence.

53
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,309
I was just about to go see you
anyway.

54
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:02,549
Oh, really?

55
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,649
Then shall we talk for a while?

56
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,950
Okay, let's do that.

57
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,850
This is refreshing and nice.

58
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,519
Right.

59
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:47,759
Bong Hee, what...

60
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,360
- What happened earlier was...
- I'm pretty sure...

61
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,000
it wasn't our first time.

62
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,139
Let's not struggle over...

63
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,539
something...

64
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,340
that's so meaningless like this.

65
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,350
No.

66
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,980
That's not it.

67
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,879
I can't just let it go.

68
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,320
- Bong Hee, I...
- I'm really...

69
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,360
trying my best to not like you,
just like you told me to.

70
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,259
No. Actually, I don't like you
anymore.

71
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,799
I don't want to get swayed over
a small accident like this.

72
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,629
And I don't plan to get swayed
either.

73
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,639
Otherwise, I'll have to go through
a hard time.

74
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,379
I'm really happy right now.

75
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,679
I'm working at a company where
I can eat and sleep.

76
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,919
It feels like a dream to be working
at such a nice place.

77
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,850
I feel so lucky.

78
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,860
I really like my coworkers too.

79
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,889
"I regret pushing you away."

80
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,100
I actually thank you for
turning me down.

81
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,330
I mean it.

82
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,730
"I want to turn back time."

83
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,870
That's what I was planning to say.

84
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,440
I'm happy with our relationship
right now.

85
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,309
I want it to last for a long time.

86
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,549
Goodnight.

87
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,789
Good job, Bong Hee.

88
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:40,700
My goodness.

89
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,429
My gosh, this is so tiring.

90
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,370
- There you go. Goodbye.
- Thank you.

91
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:48,539
My goodness.

92
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,039
My gosh, why did he park the car
here?

93
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:56,350
Mr. Ham, that little...

94
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,750
My goodness.

95
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,220
Let's see.

96
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,929
I need to call for a
chauffeur service.

97
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:20,539
Oh, gosh.

98
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,450
My goodness.

99
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:42,429
Are you okay?

100
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,200
I only did my duty as a citizen of
this country.

101
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,529
I heard that journalists even
write stories about...

102
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,210
these kind of things,
but there's no need for that.

103
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,340
What's your name, sir?

104
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,379
Me? Well, I'm the chairman of
Byun and Partners...

105
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,049
Well, I used to be the chairman.
Right now, I work at Byun and...

106
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,120
No, wait. It's No and Ji...

107
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,190
Was it No and Ji?

108
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,360
Anyway, I'm a lawyer.
My name is Byun Young Hee.

109
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:17,190
Why? What are you doing?

110
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,659
Sir, I need to measure your
blood alcohol level.

111
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,830
I only had two glasses of beer.
I have no problem blowing into this.

112
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,769
Are you sure this isn't broken?

113
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:29,539
I knew it. You were drunk driving.

114
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:32,309
My gosh, I only had two glasses.

115
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:33,480
You'll need to come with me.

116
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,080
I don't mind going with you,
but I think this is broken.

117
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,289
(Chairman Byun Young Hee)

118
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,059
No, no.

119
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:21,629
I already decided to forget about
what happened. Don't dwell on it.

120
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,500
Please stop...

121
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,279
Gosh.

122
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,730
You talked yesterday,

123
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,830
so I'll talk now.

124
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,899
Sorry? About what?

125
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:43,139
First off,

126
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,279
I want to apologize.

127
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Pardon?

128
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,179
I took too long to realize
how I feel about you,

129
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:52,750
and I was scared too.

130
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,950
This will sound like an excuse,

131
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:01,490
but I was afraid that I might not
be good enough for you.

132
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,130
Are you done with that?

133
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:10,130
Oh, yes. I'm done.

134
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,240
Great, thanks.

135
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,750
Because I took too long,

136
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,150
you seem to have given up
your feelings for me.

137
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,720
All right. I totally respect that.

138
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,390
What I'm trying to say is... I'm not
asking you to change your mind...

139
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,789
or like me again. That's not
what I'm trying to tell you.

140
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,430
Since I respect your decision,

141
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,970
you should respect mine as well.
So in other words,

142
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,140
let me like you.

143
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,210
Just leave me be.

144
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,319
I won't stress you out.

145
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,359
I'll never interfere with
your peaceful life.

146
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,089
Things can stay like this.
Then one day,

147
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:09,829
if you can open up to me again,

148
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,230
change your mind...

149
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,470
and look at me.

150
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,240
I'll be waiting.

151
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,470
You can take your time.

152
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:29,450
Oh, it looks like you've forgotten
to breathe again.

153
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,980
Breathe.

154
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,049
Good.

155
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:45,099
I left the cup here.

156
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,670
(Eun Bong Hee's Prime)

157
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,049
Gosh.

158
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,279
I'm the one who needs to breathe.

159
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,740
What should we do with the adulterer
who's suing for alimony?

160
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,440
It's a small case.

161
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:33,539
Right.

162
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,380
Actually, I think it'll be good
if Ms. Eun takes it on.

163
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,349
Shall we do this meeting
without those two?

164
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,190
I wonder what happened
in a matter of a day.

165
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,230
Don't you want to dig it up?

166
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,329
What happened was...

167
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:51,329
Not you, Mr. Byun.

168
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:52,700
Gosh, I don't want to know.

169
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,730
I became a hero.

170
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,730
A hero?

171
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:00,339
I saved someone's life.

172
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:02,109
But...

173
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:03,839
But?

174
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:08,779
Are you sure this isn't broken?

175
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:11,150
I knew it. You were drunk driving.

176
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:13,319
Those obnoxious cops.

177
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,089
I think it's extremely unfair.

178
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,220
I sent my driver home early because
something came up at his home.

179
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,329
When I was about to call
a chauffeur service,

180
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,359
the accident happened,
and I stopped it.

181
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,660
Do you have dash cam footage?

182
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,799
It was off. My driver must have
turned the camera off.

183
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:33,099
I'm serious.

184
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,740
Is there a record that you
called a chauffeur service?

185
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,640
Well, that's... As I was about
to call the service...

186
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,740
So there's no record.

187
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,710
You know that alcohol-impaired
driving can cause deaths, right?

188
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,009
Hey, Ms. Lack of Evidence!

189
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,420
I also think it's like an
attempted murder.

190
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,519
Exactly. You have no right to call
me Ms. Lack of Evidence.

191
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,619
Why were you sitting
in the driver's seat to begin with?

192
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,460
Because I was hot. I just wanted
to turn on the air conditioning.

193
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,859
You were idling the engine too?

194
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,400
Gosh, you have to pay a fine
if you do it for over five minutes.

195
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,430
You all know, right?

196
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,529
He said you can call him your son
if he drinks again.

197
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,299
I don't want a son like him.

198
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:05,470
I feel bad for you.

199
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:08,940
I'll file for
an administrative appeal...

200
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,769
and go to trial.

201
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,480
Just accept the punishment.

202
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,480
- What?
- Your license will be cancelled,

203
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,549
and you'll just have to pay a fine.
Why would you go to trial?

204
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,380
Don't you think the punishment
for drunk driving is so light?

205
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,119
Those with important social
status...

206
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,490
should be subject
to heavier punishment.

207
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,690
As an example.

208
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,359
- Someone like him.
- That's what I'm saying.

209
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,589
You ungrateful brats.

210
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,259
You guys are betrayers.

211
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,730
All right. As usual, this is our cue
to wrap up the meeting.

212
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,069
Gosh. Hey, you won't help me?

213
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:38,140
Hey. Guys!

214
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,000
Gosh, these brats.

215
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,140
Goodness.

216
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:45,380
The meeting is over.

217
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,480
Gosh.

218
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,750
Unbelievable.

219
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,519
Sorry? You want me to find out what
Jung Hyun Soo was up to last night?

220
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,019
I keep thinking that it's strange.

221
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,130
What...

222
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,470
Gosh.

223
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:13,400
Well...

224
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,109
Something urgent has come up.
We'll have to reschedule.

225
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,480
It was odd that the text was sent
right at that time.

226
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,089
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

227
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,289
His phone got turned off right away.
And most of all,

228
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:34,730
the air at the scene was odd.

229
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,630
The air?

230
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,930
Yes, I can't explain it in words.
It's just this feeling I got.

231
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,960
My hunch, you know.

232
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,299
Investigations
must be based on science.

233
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,769
Right, you always go on
about science.

234
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:49,470
That's why I'm asking you to see
if you can find evidence.

235
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,740
Anyway, you're saying you're
suspicious of Jung Hyun Soo, right?

236
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,250
Yes. Regardless of the reason,

237
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,319
he did lie. He lied to me.

238
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,519
And he made a fool of Bong Hee
even though she trusted him.

239
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,119
Right. Everything is about
Ms. Eun, isn't it?

240
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,559
I hope that this feeling I'm getting
is nothing...

241
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,259
and that I've been worried
for nothing.

242
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,569
I hope that Jung Hyun Soo
is a good person...

243
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:18,440
who was falsely accused.

244
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,109
Like how Bong Hee believes.

245
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,470
Right, I hear you.

246
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,640
Bong Hee.

247
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,380
Mr. Bang, look at those two.

248
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,019
Do they actually have
that much to talk about?

249
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:37,450
Why are they always together?

250
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,960
They're always there.

251
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,089
Exactly.

252
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:43,859
They're always laughing together
and chatting away.

253
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,759
I'm here for
today's counseling session.

254
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,430
Aren't you here because
you're curious?

255
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Well, half and half?

256
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,539
I was totally caught off guard.

257
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:58,380
By Ji Wook?

258
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:00,309
Yes.

259
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:02,849
It hurts so much,

260
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,920
yet it makes me very happy
at the same time.

261
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,690
It also makes me so mad.

262
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,089
I'm not really following.

263
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,519
Love is all about timing.

264
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,690
I know that. I know that very well.

265
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:18,500
My timing is good with most things,
but not with that.

266
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,599
What does he want me to do now?

267
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,470
What a joke. It's too late.

268
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:34,309
I'm saying I will not be swayed.

269
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,289
What a nice day.

270
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,960
I'm on my way to meet Ko Chan Ho
as I couldn't see him yesterday.

271
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:51,960
So?

272
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,259
I thought you'd be interested.

273
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,599
Never mind if you're not.

274
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,039
You aren't interested?

275
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,279
I'm very much interested.

276
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,500
Let me like you.

277
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,539
Just leave me be.

278
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,210
I'll be waiting.

279
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,440
You can take your time.

280
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:50,589
Gosh, stop. Stop thinking
about that.

281
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,819
What did you say?

282
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,500
Why? Did I do something wrong?

283
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:21,619
So you like me? You're sorry
that you realized it late?

284
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,990
Yes, Bong Hee.

285
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,759
Wait all you want.

286
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,220
I won't change my mind.

287
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,130
I won't because it was so unfair.

288
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:34,329
I went through such a hard time.
Now you like me?

289
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:37,470
It's too late.

290
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:39,369
You realized it too late.

291
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,009
I'm sorry.

292
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,710
I'll make you suffer
as much as I have.

293
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,309
- Okay.
- Don't even answer me.

294
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:47,410
I hate you so much.

295
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,150
I hate you even more since
you are doing as I said.

296
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,420
Then what should I do?

297
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,990
Anyway,

298
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,960
you will have to really wait for me
this time.

299
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,400
It will be longer than seven minutes
this time.

300
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:12,140
You might get old and die
while you wait for me.

301
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,970
- I understand.
- I'm not joking.

302
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,440
I know.

303
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,710
Hold on.

304
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,519
By the way,

305
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,450
starting now, change your attitude.

306
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,859
Since this is about work,
I have the upper hand.

307
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,990
Did you get that?

308
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,900
Yes, Mr. No.

309
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,960
Bong Hee, hurry.

310
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,069
I'm going.

311
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:46,200
He's on leave?

312
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,099
He said something urgent came up.

313
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,980
Call me anytime.

314
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:57,049
I'll help you if there's anything
I can do for you.

315
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,480
(Attorney No Ji Wook)

316
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,519
I mentioned that I have to use
some of my unused vacation days.

317
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,960
I need to use them right now.

318
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:11,390
I understand.

319
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:13,259
Thank you.

320
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,869
Did he predict there would be a time
he has to use up his vacation days?

321
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,309
It seems like it, right?

322
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,309
As expected, Ko Chan Ho isn't home.

323
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,779
He isn't.

324
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,279
Then...

325
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,920
No, it's really hard to get
into that house secretly.

326
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,619
We need an excavator
to make a hole to get in.

327
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:45,859
Bong Hee, I think you are capable
of doing anything. Aren't you?

328
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,700
- You are.
- Are you here to look at the house?

329
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,529
This is my building.

330
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,369
You two look like newlyweds.

331
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,339
Are you here for your marital house?

332
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

333
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,750
The guy who lives here gave me his
permission...

334
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,019
to look at the house
even when he's not home.

335
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,890
Take your time to take a look.

336
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,619
When was this unit put
on the market?

337
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:17,829
Well, let me think. It was first put
on the market on May 10 or 20.

338
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,000
It's before the murder of Chef Yang.

339
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,299
Who?

340
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,430
No, it's nothing.

341
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,099
Can we take a look around it
privately? Just the two of us?

342
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,240
We just need to discuss
some private matters.

343
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,109
Since we're newlyweds, we must talk
about where the bed goes and stuff.

344
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,920
You two look so intimate with
each other just like newlyweds.

345
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,319
Fine. I'll leave you two alone.
Look at it in private.

346
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,059
Let's look at it in private.

347
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:01,140
Where on earth could he have gone?

348
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:02,769
I don't know.

349
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,509
Could he have run away or something?

350
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,480
Or could he have gone somewhere
to take care of something?

351
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,119
If none of these are correct,
could he have gone on a trip?

352
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:14,980
It's plausible. Or...

353
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,119
he could already have disappeared.

354
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:19,619
Sorry?

355
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,130
Nothing.

356
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,240
What?

357
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,140
What is this?

358
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Mr. No.

359
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,559
We went to Ko Chan Ho's place,
but...30

360
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:57,630
There was nothing.

361
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,329
You didn't find anything?

362
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,130
No. Oh, right.

363
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:06,140
I'm not sure if this will be useful,

364
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,470
but I brought it just in case. Here.

365
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,039
It won't be easy,
but I'll look into it.

366
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,710
I'd really appreciate it.

367
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,180
Like I said, it won't be easy.

368
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,079
I feel like my limbs are tied now
that I have no governmental power.

369
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,890
Me too.

370
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,069
Will you not tell Ms. Eun
about Jung Hyun Soo?

371
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,740
I was going to tell her,

372
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:44,140
but I've decided to wait on it
as nothing has been confirmed yet.

373
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,119
My son.

374
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,750
It's a case file
on Jang Hee Jun's case.

375
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,390
(The estimated time of his death is
midnight, May 11, 2015.)

376
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,200
I'd like the two of you
to reinvestigate the case.

377
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:07,759
Reinvestigate it?

378
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,369
I've tried so hard
to come to terms...

379
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,869
with the verdict of the trial.

380
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,559
I went to the scene so many times...

381
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,099
in order to look for
different possibilities.

382
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:46,069
I wondered if someone who was
holding grudges against me...

383
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,140
killed my son for revenge.

384
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,440
But it wasn't that.

385
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,079
The more I think about it,

386
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,279
the more certain I become
that it was her.

387
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:00,619
There's no evidence
that tells otherwise.

388
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,490
I read the case file.

389
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,890
There were two weapons. One was...

390
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:05,890
That's right.

391
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,519
I fabricated the evidence.

392
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:10,829
I used tricks
in order to catch Eun Bong Hee.

393
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,059
Then what about the other one?

394
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:14,900
I'm not sure how this will sound,

395
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,470
but I think I know
what you're thinking, sir.

396
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,299
Prosecutor No Ji Wook.

397
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,670
He was the prosecutor in charge
of the case.

398
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:28,140
You're probably thinking that
he placed it on the scene...

399
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,009
just like what you did.

400
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:40,759
In order to save Eun Bong Hee,

401
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,430
he must've planted
the evidence on the scene...

402
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,690
just like what I did.

403
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,160
That's my conclusion.

404
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,369
Ji Wook would not do
such a thing, sir.

405
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:50,500
If that's what you think,

406
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:52,569
go ahead and prove it to me.

407
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,740
I'm saying you should try to find
something new, no matter what it is.

408
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,099
What?

409
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,800
Mr. Byun.

410
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,929
Say it.

411
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,500
Shall I...

412
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:26,670
help you with the trial?

413
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,610
Ms. Lack of Evidence,
will you do that for me?

414
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,210
I won't help you if you're going
to keep calling me like that.

415
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,309
All right, Eun Bong Hee.

416
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,380
Ms. Eun.

417
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:42,320
All right, Ms. Eun.
Help me out.

418
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,590
I feel that it's so unfair.

419
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,519
My insurance won't cover
if this is a DUI.

420
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:48,659
Did you know that?

421
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,559
Everyone, please come.

422
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,500
(The loser will do the dishes,
buy coffee, and take out trash.)

423
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,880
This week's designator for dishes,
coffee, and trash is...

424
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,679
you, Ms. Eun.

425
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,130
I'd like to volunteer.

426
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,460
Darn it.

427
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:30,869
Why would he...

428
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,269
Did something happen?

429
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,210
(Attorney Eun Bong Hee)

430
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,710
Drink up.

431
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,920
Are you done with that?

432
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,489
I'll clean it up.

433
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:58,559
- I'll put it away for you.
- Thank you.

434
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,539
Ms. Eun, are you done?

435
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,940
I'm working on the files.

436
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,510
Let me see your hands.

437
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,309
My hands?

438
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:18,980
Eat them while you work.

439
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:20,750
Thank you.

440
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,699
(Attorney Eun Bong Hee)

441
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:41,170
Were you running Widmark's formula?

442
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,170
- I see.
- Yes.

443
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,539
This formula is
to calculate someone's...

444
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:48,309
blood alcohol content
after driving under the influence.

445
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
So...

446
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,769
Make sure you check this part.
Can you do it?

447
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,289
Drink some soda. You might choke.

448
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:36,789
Mom.

449
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,300
I think I'm in my golden days now.

450
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Golden days?

451
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,730
You know how people have
their golden days...

452
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,530
like when they are in their prime.

453
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,969
Really? Why do you think so?

454
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,070
Did something spark between you
and the CEO of your firm?

455
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,340
Is business going well?

456
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,110
It's not that. It's just...

457
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,179
I'm so happy that all
of my colleagues adore me.

458
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,849
I'm so happy that it sometimes
scares me.

459
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:04,420
I'm afraid that
someone might take it away from me.

460
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,389
Pathetic.

461
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,659
When you had something, you didn't
let people take it away from you.

462
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,230
It's just that you never had
a lot of things growing up.

463
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,539
Really?

464
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,800
She looks like it.

465
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:29,650
Mom, by the way,
why do I get the feeling...

466
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,650
your boss is always eavesdropping
our conversation?

467
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,150
Is it just me?

468
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,349
Let her be. It's
because her life is boring.

469
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,219
Young Soon!

470
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:24,400
The attorneys made several visits.

471
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,940
They also met the couple
in the photo.

472
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,400
I see.

473
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,710
So did your alibi hold up?

474
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:33,610
Yes.

475
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,440
It's all thanks to you.

476
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:37,050
- I'll get going now.
- Bye.

477
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:46,019
What's going on?

478
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,869
Am I being suspected?

479
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,119
Mr. No.

480
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,190
Mr. No.

481
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:23,059
Mr. No.

482
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,400
Mr. No, are you all right?

483
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,769
I heard you all the way
from the first floor.

484
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,340
Bong Hee.

485
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,750
Bong Hee, you are okay, right?

486
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:46,050
You are safe, right?

487
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,650
What? What is it?

488
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:52,320
Did I die in your nightmare
or something?

489
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,920
I don't know.

490
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,630
I don't know who it was.

491
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,900
Someone...

492
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,900
got hurt.

493
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,320
I...

494
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,320
I'm sorry.

495
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,190
I'll get going.

496
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,949
Get some sleep.

497
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,150
I'll stay with you just
for five minutes.

498
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,090
Don't get the wrong idea.

499
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,920
This is love for mankind.

500
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,750
I won't fall for you no matter
how cute you look sleeping.

501
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:07,590
(Currently under trial)

502
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,460
The defendant finished
drinking at 9pm.

503
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:14,000
The time of the accident...

504
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:17,300
was 9:35pm. The police officer
who arrived at the scene...

505
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,070
conducted the sobriety test
at 9:45pm.

506
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:21,699
The sobriety test was conducted...

507
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,210
at the time when the blood alcohol
content was on the rise.

508
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,340
Hence, it can't be concluded
that the blood alcohol content...

509
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,079
at the time of driving was
over 0.05 percent.

510
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:31,679
(Attorney, Defendant)

511
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,260
Darn it.

512
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,400
Are you here to see Bong Hee?

513
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:53,369
I'm here for Chairman Byun.

514
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:55,699
He's like a father figure to me.

515
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,710
I'm here to see our youngest
attorney, Bong Hee.

516
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:00,940
Let's see how good she is. Shall we?

517
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:04,110
First of all, the grounds
of the claim...

518
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:07,050
that he finished drinking at 9pm...

519
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,849
seem to be lacking.

520
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:12,289
He didn't have any acquaintances
who joined him.

521
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:16,090
Yes, Your Honor, so I've submitted
the affidavit of the bartender...

522
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,960
who finished drinking at 9pm
and his credit card statement.

523
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,400
I see.

524
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,300
Do you have evidence
to prove it was a justifiable act?

525
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Well.

526
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,869
Unfortunately, due to the
malfunction of the dash cam,

527
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,480
we don't have any proof.

528
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,909
However, we are looking
for an eyewitness of the incident.

529
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:39,920
I understand.

530
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,250
I have a bad feeling about this.

531
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,289
- Prosecution.
- So do I.

532
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:44,420
Proceed with your sentencing.

533
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,960
Please punish the defendant with
a fine of 3,000 dollars.

534
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,059
Lastly, does the defendant have...

535
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,130
any last words he'd like to say?

536
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:56,730
Yes, Your Honor.

537
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,170
I agree that drinking and driving...

538
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:07,079
is a very wrong thing to do.

539
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,610
Therefore, I deeply regret
what I have done.

540
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,710
However, it is true that...

541
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:16,250
I only had two glasses of beer.

542
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:17,489
And...

543
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,460
I only drove because I wanted to
save a person's life.

544
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,789
Please consider that my mistake
came out of good will.

545
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,400
Here is the verdict.

546
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,369
The defendant will have to pay
a fine of 3,000 dollars.

547
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:39,710
If the defendant refuses to pay
the fine,

548
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,739
100 dollars will be converted
into 1 day,

549
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,880
and thus, he will be imprisoned in a
workhouse for 30 days.

550
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,019
What did you say?

551
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,360
Hey, Ms. Lack of Evidence!

552
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,730
You used me like a slave.

553
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,590
And you lost?

554
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,659
You little... Stop right there.

555
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:01,760
Hey!

556
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,699
Gosh, he's really angry.

557
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,170
Bong Hee took it too far.

558
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:09,639
She could've won if it was a
different judge.

559
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:13,840
Ji Hye, I'm sure you already know
that...

560
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,539
I'm quite pretty.

561
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,380
Yes.

562
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,280
That's what I thought when we
weren't so close.

563
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:21,579
What?

564
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,920
Never mind.

565
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:29,159
But you see, Ji Wook and Eun Hyuk
were also really handsome.

566
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:30,860
I see.

567
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:34,130
I used to feel proud when the three
of us hung out together.

568
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,800
People used to stare at us.

569
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,429
Oh, I see.

570
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:40,840
But...

571
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,869
I hurt them both...

572
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:45,369
and abandoned them.

573
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:49,239
I must've been crazy.

574
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,309
That's what happens when you
have it all.

575
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,920
I can't argue with you
because you're right.

576
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:01,320
Right now,

577
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,630
she must be the one who has it all.

578
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:14,239
You'll only embarrass yourself
if you go out right now.

579
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,639
You'll regret it tomorrow.

580
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:18,909
Let go.

581
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,010
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

582
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:28,650
Hey, you guys.

583
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,190
Prosecutor Cha?

584
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,159
I don't even want to hear you
talk to me.

585
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,300
You guys...

586
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,099
You guys are so...

587
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,070
Let's go.

588
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,559
She looked really drunk.
Don't you think so?

589
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:12,929
You don't need to worry.

590
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,199
He's right. She wasn't that drunk.

591
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,429
She's a strong drinker.

592
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:18,099
She can probably drink for
a couple more hours.

593
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:19,099
Of course.

594
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,380
Well, what I meant was that...

595
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,380
you don't need to worry about her
too much.

596
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,679
That's what I was trying to
tell you.

597
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:35,679
He's right. That was the point.

598
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,989
He meant nothing else.

599
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:38,389
I didn't say anything.

600
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:43,090
I was only thinking of hitting the
back of her head if she was drunk...

601
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,860
because she always glares at me.

602
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:56,070
Will you be okay?

603
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,269
Go home safely, Yoo Jung.

604
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,480
Okay, bye.

605
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,679
It's hard to track where Ko Chan Ho
went on the day he disappeared.

606
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:15,880
I'm still checking the dash cams
of the cars...

607
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,889
that were parked in the alley
outside of his house.

608
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,090
But there are a few blind spots, and
it's not clear since it was dark.

609
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:22,559
Oh, I see.

610
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:24,730
Then...

611
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,929
did you look into the people
in this photo?

612
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,630
I've started to go through
Ko Chan Ho's alumni.

613
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:37,409
I know...

614
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,340
who bought you the shoes.

615
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:43,480
That's exactly what Ko Chan Ho said
to Bong Hee.

616
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,010
Then...

617
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,519
do you think the person who
bought the shoes...

618
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,449
is in this photo?

619
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:51,650
Or do you think it's Jung Hyun Soo?

620
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:54,989
Ji Wook.

621
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,289
Come over here and look at this.

622
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,230
Here's a breaking story. Yesterday,
on a roadside in Chuncheon,

623
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,369
there was a car with a knife inside
that is assumed to have been used...

624
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:08,769
to kill Chef Yang Jin Woo.

625
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:11,739
The assumed culprit is Mr. Ko,

626
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:15,380
and it's more shocking because he
used to work in forensics.

627
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:18,780
It seems like he ran away after
abandoning the car...

628
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,349
on a remote roadside along
with the weapon.

629
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,789
Meanwhile, the fact that
Mr. Ko was in charge of the...

630
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,889
forensic examination
of the scene...

631
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:27,989
will shock the public even more.

632
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,630
The police say they will do their
best to find and arrest Mr. Ko.

633
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,000
The police of Goyang and Chuncheon
are back-tracking...

634
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,530
the route that Mr. Ko used.

635
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,000
They're doing their best to track
his whereabouts.

636
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,199
Ms. Eun, you're here.

637
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,039
Have you been well?

638
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:44,409
Yes, of course.

639
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,679
What's with you two?

640
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:58,489
Is there something I don't know
about?

641
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:02,860
Hey, guys.

642
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,900
Where's Ms. Lack of Evidence,
the girl who lost...

643
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,000
my case?

644
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,670
She's been slipping out whenever
she has the chance.

645
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,639
I haven't been able to see her for
a while now.

646
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:17,570
I miss her so dearly.

647
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:20,510
I guess she's not here.

648
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,510
Where did she escape to?

649
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,949
My goodness.

650
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:26,579
Goodness.

651
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:27,750
What?

652
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,690
Where is Bong Hee anyway?

653
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,289
What is it that you want to tell me?

654
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:38,360
Well...

655
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,159
I actually lied to you about
something.

656
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,530
You lied to me?

657
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:46,769
Yes.

658
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,070
My alibi.

659
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:55,579
To be honest,

660
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,980
I couldn't remember exactly
where I was and what I did that day.

661
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:04,650
But if I didn't tell you my
whereabouts in detail,

662
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:08,019
I felt like you wouldn't believe me.

663
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,460
So I lied to you.

664
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,130
May I ask...

665
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:16,000
why you're telling me this
right now?

666
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:24,340
When everyone in the world attacked
me and called me a murderer,

667
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:27,940
you're the only person who
believed in what I said.

668
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:32,380
I'm telling you this because
I want to be truthful to you.

669
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:35,519
I'm sorry.

670
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:37,690
What about Jung Hyun Soo?
What are you looking into?

671
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:39,489
Well...

672
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,389
You don't need to know about it yet.

673
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:47,800
What is it? Why are you saying
I don't need to know it yet?

674
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:50,769
I just feel a little suspicious.
That's all.

675
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:53,599
Thank you...

676
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:55,800
for being honest with me.

677
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,349
I can go by myself.

678
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,989
I'll escort you to your car.

679
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,820
Okay, then.

680
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:17,059
Sir!

681
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:19,389
Hey, long time no see.

682
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,099
How have you been?

683
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:23,369
Good. By the way, I was planning to
call you.

684
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,570
Really?

685
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:27,639
Yes. Until when do you plan to
leave that banner up there?

686
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,840
It'll only cost you money.

687
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:30,869
For just a little bit more.

688
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,210
Okay, okay. I think that's fine.

689
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,579
Thank you for helping me.
I finished it quickly thanks to you.

690
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,320
By any chance, are you a witness?

691
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:41,619
Are you going to report something?

692
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,619
Thanks anyway.

693
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,059
Didn't you get the report?

694
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,230
A report?

695
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,329
Yes, someone said
he'd report something.

696
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:56,429
Who? Who said that?

697
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,269
I don't know who he is.

698
00:54:58,269 --> 00:55:00,800
It was a young man.

699
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:03,539
When was it?

700
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:04,969
Was it at the beginning
of this spring?

701
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:06,940
I saw him while switching
the banners.

702
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,349
Was it before he sent me the shoes?

703
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:14,550
By any chance, do you remember
what he looked like?

704
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,119
Anything will help.
Do you remember anything?

705
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,489
I'm not sure.

706
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,489
It's not easy to remember
someone whom you met just once.

707
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,829
I don't even remember
what I had for breakfast today.

708
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:26,130
Then I should test him.

709
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,170
Let's see if he...

710
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:36,369
remembers me or not.

711
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:38,840
If he remembers me...

712
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:40,309
Is he a friend of yours?

713
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,250
No, no.

714
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,980
Excuse me for a second.

715
00:55:51,889 --> 00:55:52,949
Yes, Mr. No.

716
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:57,489
I'm with Hyun Soo now.

717
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:00,260
Well... If that's the case,

718
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:02,300
bring him here.

719
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:06,099
We now know the real culprit anyway.
We should have dinner with him.

720
00:56:07,469 --> 00:56:08,469
All right.

721
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,769
Don't make any stops.
Come here right away.

722
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:14,179
Okay, I will.

723
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,550
Mr. No is saying
we should have dinner together.

724
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,420
Oh, really?

725
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,280
Sure, let's do that.

726
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,889
Sir, please give me a call
if you remember anything.

727
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,820
I'll be in touch too.
I'll see you soon.

728
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:30,960
All right.

729
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,199
- Have a good day.
- You too. Bye.

(Report on the Judicial Trainee
Jang Hee Jun Murder in 2015)

731
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,960
I think that the DA's speculation...

732
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,860
is actually quite plausible.

733
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:11,269
Even before they met as a mentor
and a probationary officer,

734
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:14,670
there was something between
No Ji Wook and Bong Hee.

735
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:18,610
I heard they were spotted
meeting at a hotel as well.

736
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:21,639
There were bad rumors about her.
And...

737
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,179
"You're dirty,
but you're so pretty."

738
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:28,519
He used to make such
affectionate remarks too.

739
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,320
He did?

740
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:34,119
Then Bong Hee became
a murder suspect.

741
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:38,329
He might have been willing to do
anything to get her acquitted.

(Prosecutor Cha Yoo Jung)

743
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:51,210
- We're here.
- Welcome.

744
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,039
Hello, have you been well?

745
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:55,409
Of course.
Please make yourself at home.

746
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,510
All right.

747
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,949
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

748
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,949
Can I give you a hand with it?

749
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:06,250
Why? Are you skilled with knives?

750
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,889
Gosh, what are you talking about?

751
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,590
You're our guest. Please relax
and make yourself at home.

752
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,769
What's the matter?

753
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,739
- What is it?
- Why didn't you tell me?

754
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,400
- What?
- Jung Hyun Soo...

755
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:27,179
About Hyun Soo.
Why didn't you tell me?

756
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,280
Oh, well... That's...

757
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:31,909
That was because...

758
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:35,380
Nothing was really confirmed, so...

759
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,349
Something seems off about him,
and he did lie.

760
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:39,150
You were sure about those things.

761
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:41,260
Yes, you're right.

762
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,860
Did you want me
to feel like an idiot or what?

763
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:46,630
I'm so disappointed in you.

764
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:49,000
Gosh, it's not like that.
That's really not what I intended.

765
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:53,300
You see, there wasn't really
anything concrete I could tell you.

766
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,039
And I was worried that you might
beat yourself up like crazy.

767
00:58:57,269 --> 00:58:58,940
You kept what I should know
from me.

768
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:01,179
Did you really think
you were doing it for my sake?

769
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,250
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

770
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,920
Yes, you did.

771
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,219
Just a second. How...

772
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:12,690
How did you know?

773
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:16,690
Hyun Soo beat you to it.

774
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,130
He told me
that he lied about his alibi.

775
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,699
He beat us to it?

776
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,840
All right.

777
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,170
Then what's your thought on him?

778
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:35,179
I don't know. I'll say I'm neutral.

779
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,980
But what's bothering me is...

780
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,880
the fact that you won't
be suspicious of him for no reason.

781
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:49,659
All right.

782
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,010
Hey.

783
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,139
Is there anything
I can help you with?

784
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:07,780
No.

785
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,710
Just go plate the food.

786
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,280
- That's fine too.
- Yes.

787
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:27,130
Now, we have another guest.

788
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:29,099
I'm here for work.

789
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:31,400
Don't look at me like that,
everyone.

790
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:37,909
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

791
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:42,440
What do you say?
Are they dishes that you guys like?

792
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:44,179
Everything looks so delicious.

793
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,719
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I'm good with everything,

794
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:49,250
but putting tomatoes
in bulgogi is...

795
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,590
Then don't eat it.

796
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:51,619
Thank you for the food.

797
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:53,119
You're welcome.
I hope you all enjoy it.

798
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:02,300
Oh, about the forensic officer,
Ko Chan Ho...

799
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,500
Do you know that he's now being
chased by the police...

800
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,070
as the suspect
of the Yang Jin Woo murder?

801
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Yes, I saw it in the news.

802
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,409
I see, you saw it.

803
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,309
You don't know him personally,
do you?

804
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,079
No, not at all.

805
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,179
I was so surprised to hear that
the killer is a police officer.

806
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,110
Congratulations.

807
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,579
Those who are
acquitted for lack of evidence...

808
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,119
continue to look or get treated
like culprits...

809
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,190
in the absence of other suspects
or real culprits.

810
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:31,889
Please don't worry.

811
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:33,429
The killer hasn't been caught...

812
01:01:33,429 --> 01:01:34,800
as the prosecution has been
neglecting its duties.

813
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:37,769
I'll be sure to catch him
and bring him to you.

814
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:52,809
I came here to tell you this.

815
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,280
Bong Hee, your ex-boyfriend...
I mean, Jang Hee Jun.

816
01:01:56,619 --> 01:01:58,289
I'll be reinvestigating his case.

817
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,860
I'm not sure if I'll be able
to find anything now,

818
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,420
but I'll try to dig things up.

819
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:07,699
From the scene to those who were
involved, I'll go through them all.

820
01:02:09,929 --> 01:02:13,400
The killer might be
in this house right now.

821
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,079
Anyhow, what do you think
is going on with Ko Chan Ho?

822
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:22,980
Would he really be on the run?

823
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,949
I'm not sure.
I'm really curious too.

824
01:02:45,369 --> 01:02:47,239
(Bumkey's "Breathing All Day" is
available on music websites.)

825
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,610
We should try to sound out
Jung Hyun Soo.

826
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,380
That's the only thing we can do now.

827
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:02,949
Don't you think the house feels
so empty now that everyone is gone?

828
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:04,949
Not really. I like how quiet it is.

829
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:07,460
Mr. Ji, my husband died.

830
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,659
What happened?

831
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:09,989
Please think about it once more.

832
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:12,159
Hey, Eun Hyuk. Aren't you
hiding something from me?

833
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:14,360
I'm going to give my client what
she wants, no matter what it is.

834
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,000
Will you be able to handle
the consequences?

835
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:26,269
(Love in Trouble)
