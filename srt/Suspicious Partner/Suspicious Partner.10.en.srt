1
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,740
I see.

2
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:37,939
Well... If that's the case,

3
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:39,539
bring him here.

4
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:42,950
We now know the real culprit anyway.
We should have dinner with him.

5
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,450
All right.

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,090
Don't make any stops.
Come here right away.

7
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,060
Okay. I got it.

8
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:56,799
What are you planning to do?

9
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:02,100
First of all, he can't slip away
with Bong Hee...

10
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,700
- and...
- And?

11
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,269
We should try to sound out
Jung Hyun Soo.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,840
We have no other choice than that
right now.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,349
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

14
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,689
What do you say?
Are they dishes that you guys like?

15
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,420
Everything looks so delicious.

16
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,590
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you for the food.

17
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,060
You're welcome.
I hope you all enjoy it.

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,129
Oh, about the forensic officer,
Ko Chan Ho...

19
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,370
Do you know that he's now being
chased by the police...

20
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,969
as the suspect
of the Yang Jin Woo murder?

21
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:39,799
Yes, I saw it in the news.

22
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,370
I see, you saw it.

23
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,109
You don't know him personally,
do you?

24
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,609
No, not at all.
I was so surprised to hear that...

25
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,079
the killer is a police officer.

26
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,750
I came here to tell you this.

27
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,120
Bong Hee, your ex-boyfriend...
I mean, Jang Hee Jun.

28
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,159
I'll be reinvestigating his case.

29
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,159
I'm not sure if I'll be able
to find anything now,

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,159
but I'll try to dig things up.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,930
From the scene to those
who were involved,

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,530
I'll go through them all.

33
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,110
Who knows? The killer might be
in this house right now.

34
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,780
Anyhow, what do you think
is going on with Ko Chan Ho?

35
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,650
Would he really be on the run?

36
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:29,719
I'm not sure.
I'm really curious too.

37
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,069
Hey, Chan Ho.

38
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,139
Are you tired already?

39
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,740
You look like you're about to die.

40
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:12,360
Did I tell you that I could have
met Ko Chan Ho...

41
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,669
right before his disappearance?

42
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,639
The meeting was canceled
rather abruptly, so we couldn't.

43
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,669
Right.

44
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:20,310
- Really?
- Yes.

45
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:25,680
It'd be better if you check
every CCTV footage...

46
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,810
from Hanmoo Park to the spot
where his car was found.

47
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,719
Well, it's more likely that he
took the local route...

48
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:35,090
instead of the highway,
given the circumstances.

49
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,319
Okay. I'll check on it.

50
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,800
He's not showing any signs
of agitation. It's not working.

51
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:46,800
The only time...

52
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,530
Jung Hyun Soo
seemed shaken up was...

53
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,740
Have you ever seen anyone
close to you getting hurt?

54
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:57,479
This jerk was assaulting a woman.

55
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,849
Oh, by the way, check if Ko
Chan Ho has a record...

56
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,310
regarding a woman or someone.

57
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:08,219
He might have assaulted
or physically abused a woman.

58
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,389
This is just my hunch.

59
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,689
Hyun Soo, eat a lot.

60
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,629
This is delicious.

61
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,110
Wasn't that a boring dinner?

62
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:30,540
Sorry? No, it wasn't.

63
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,339
Since you are attorneys
and a prosecutor,

64
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,850
you do talk about cases a lot.

65
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,279
The cases weren't good
topics for dinner.

66
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,550
They weren't.

67
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,220
I got a new job.

68
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,889
I was going to promote my company,

69
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,629
but I couldn't get the chance.

70
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,060
I'm a motorcycle messenger now.

71
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,600
- Oh, I see. Really?
- Yes.

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,230
We use messengers a lot.

73
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,899
I can be a loyal customer.

74
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,040
By the way,

75
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,740
why did you hire Bong Hee
as your attorney?

76
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:08,180
She was famous for being wrongfully
accused. It was similar to my case.

77
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,620
Gosh, you are not falling for it.

78
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,290
I was curious,
so I was putting feelers out.

79
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,319
I heard that there were many
murderers and criminals...

80
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,490
who approach Bong Hee
with a wrong intention.

81
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,699
Mr. Ji, I think you are very honest.

82
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,500
Oh, I'm the opposite.

83
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,560
Really?

84
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,420
Get home safe.

85
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,550
Take care, Hyun Soo.

86
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,850
I'll get going. Bye.

87
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,250
Bye.

88
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,829
You are not going home, Ms. Eun?

89
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,930
Oh, me? He provides me
room...

90
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,199
and board.

91
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,230
You live here?

92
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,470
No, he's providing me
room and board.

93
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,600
So you are living here.

94
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,040
Well...

95
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,069
Yes, she's living with me.

96
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,439
Why? It's true, Bong Hee.

97
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,449
That's right.

98
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,500
I'll help you.

99
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
No, there's no need.
Go and get some rest.

100
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,170
No, you cooked all by yourself.

101
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Give me that, please.

102
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,899
The house was crowded only a few
minutes ago. Now it's all empty.

103
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,600
Don't you think the house feels
so empty now that everyone is gone?

104
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:14,269
Not really.

105
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,870
I like how quiet it is.

106
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,079
Don't look at me with those eyes.

107
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,149
What?

108
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,120
Don't try to charm me
with your eyes.

109
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,449
I'm not trying to.
I was just looking at you.

110
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:28,689
Just like this.

111
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,490
Get this.

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Gosh.

113
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,329
Do your dishes.

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,170
Focus on your dishes.

115
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,709
I'm completely focused
on washing this dish.

116
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,379
- Focus.
- Look, I'm focused.

117
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,410
Stay focused.

118
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,129
(Client: Park Seong Eun)

119
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,300
Hello, this is Ji Eun Hyuk.

120
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,870
Mr. Ji.

121
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:15,399
Hi. How have you been?

122
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,699
My husband...

123
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,100
died.

124
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,910
What?

125
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,639
I see. Okay.

126
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,550
Okay, I'll be right there.

127
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,480
Ma'am.

128
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,149
What happened?

129
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,429
I'd like to accompany her.

130
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
Okay.

131
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,179
A lawyer has...

132
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:37,450
a legal responsibility to...

133
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,320
keep the client's secret.
Am I correct?

134
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:42,649
Yes.

135
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,220
But a lawyer...

136
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:47,259
also cannot hide the truth...

137
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,690
or make a false statement.
Therefore,

138
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,159
we also have a responsibility to
tell the truth.

139
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,100
Which one will you choose?

140
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,429
Will you tell the truth...

141
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,039
or keep my secret?

142
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
I...

143
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,350
didn't kill my husband.

144
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:08,909
But...

145
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,679
I'm going to confess that I did...

146
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,789
and turn myself in.

147
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,690
Will you...

148
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,289
keep my secret?

149
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,159
A lawyer is...

150
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,429
obligated to do
two very important things.

151
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,500
They're obligated to keep their
client's secret.

152
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,470
They also cannot conceal...

153
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,870
or hide the truth. They're obligated
to tell the truth.

154
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,169
If those two obligations collide
with each other,

155
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:39,309
which one must we choose?

156
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:45,779
(The Truth Versus the Secret)

157
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,220
This is the tea you got me...

158
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,289
for insomnia.

159
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,029
It tastes very bad,

160
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
but I feel like you'll need it
today.

161
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,279
Bong Hee.

162
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:17,049
You're bothered by Jung Hyun Soo,
aren't you?

163
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,259
What if...

164
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,929
it turns out that...

165
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,000
I had asked you to defend a
murderer?

166
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:54,149
The presumption of innocence.

167
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:56,820
Have you forgotten that?

168
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,889
He lied about his alibi.
That's all...

169
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
that bothers me.

170
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,929
Other than that, there's nothing
else I found out about him.

171
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,870
I just tend to be really thorough.
You know that.

172
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,470
That's why I'm double-checking.

173
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,909
Do you expect me to believe you?

174
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:15,940
Yes.

175
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:17,509
Believe me.

176
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,139
You're being serious, right?

177
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,409
No.

178
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,250
I'm lying.

179
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,919
If you find anything,

180
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,889
you need to be honest and tell me
about it, okay?

181
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,860
Okay.

182
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,330
Don't...

183
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,860
keep anything from me.

184
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,399
All right.

185
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,610
By the way,

186
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,809
that guy Jung Hyun Soo.

187
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,080
I don't care if he's dangerous
or not.

188
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,049
And I don't care if he's bad
or nice.

189
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,720
I just don't want you to meet him by
yourself anymore.

190
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,289
Since we're on that subject,
let me tell you this.

191
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,120
I want you to always be somewhere...

192
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,759
where I can always keep an eye
on you for 24 hours.

193
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
I...

194
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,029
- What I mean is...
- Gosh.

195
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:18,169
24 hours is a bit too...

196
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,240
Well...

197
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,110
"Isn't that a bit too much?"

198
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,509
"24 hours is a bit too much."

199
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,980
Is that what you were going to say?

200
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,820
What about 20 hours?

201
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,029
How... How did you drink this?

202
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,659
I drink it every day.

203
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,299
You bought it for me.

204
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,110
It's so bitter.

205
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,679
I drink it every day, but it still
tastes bitter.

206
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,049
It's bitter, but I drink it
every day.

207
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,289
Jung Hyun Soo reacted to two things.

208
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,120
First, when I questioned him about
the assault incident...

209
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,659
in the reception room. And...

210
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:17,360
when I told you to see if Ko Chan Ho
had any problems with women.

211
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm pretty sure he has an issue
or a trauma regarding women.

212
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:23,830
Should I meet the woman who got
assaulted?

213
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,269
Yes, but you should be careful.

214
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,970
Jung Hyun Soo is not an easy target.

215
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,909
I'm not a sloppy investigator
either.

216
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,710
That's why you're exploiting me...

217
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,549
by asking me to do so many things.

218
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,179
It's all because I'm very competent.

219
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,480
Yes, I can't argue with that.

220
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,789
By any chance,

221
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,019
if we actually end up finding
anything,

222
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,159
I'd still like to keep this case to
ourselves.

223
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,590
You're talking about Ms. Eun, right?

224
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:51,929
If...

225
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,500
Jung Hyun Soo turns out to be
guilty,

226
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,669
and it turns out that we gave him
freedom...

227
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:03,509
I shouldn't hide that from Bong Hee,
and I won't be able to anyway.

228
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,509
But I just want to help her find out
in a way that she won't get hurt.

229
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,409
I want to give her time to prepare
herself.

230
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,850
Okay.

231
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,690
You confessed about your crime
yourself.

232
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,460
Her mind was weak due to continuous
domestic violence.

233
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,730
It happened when she was not in her
right mind.

234
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,100
He died because he had a stroke
due to a skull fracture.

235
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,639
To sum up, you pushed him
during a fight,

236
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,909
and he died because his skull got
fractured after he fell.

237
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:39,679
After that, you stabbed his stomach
with a kitchen knife...

238
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:41,779
even though he was already dead.

239
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,110
That's how much I hated him.

240
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,149
I couldn't...

241
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,220
resolve my anger.

242
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:00,799
I'll be off now.

243
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,809
This is an accidental encounter...

244
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,509
as a prosecutor and attorney, right?

245
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,450
I guess.

246
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,820
I noticed that you defended
Eun Bong Hee's case.

247
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,690
Yes.

248
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,490
Do you think she's innocent?

249
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:27,320
You know that I don't believe
my clients, right?

250
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,830
It doesn't matter if I believe them
or if they're telling me the truth.

251
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,830
It's just work.

252
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
But...

253
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,470
I believed Bong Hee.

254
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,840
I defended her because I trusted
her.

255
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,039
Why?

256
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
I don't know.

257
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,610
I just did.

258
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:47,409
Eun Hyuk.

259
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,820
Can we have a meal with each other
once in a while?

260
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,400
Ms. Park Seong Eun had suffered from
domestic violence for a long time...

261
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,269
from her husband, Kang Jin Ho.

262
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:14,269
(Victim, Kang Jin Ho)

263
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,509
On the day of the incident,

264
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,180
her husband was supposed to have
left the house for a few days...

265
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,680
because of work.

266
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,250
But he suddenly came home
without notice,

267
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,079
and the two started a fight.
In the end,

268
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,049
Park Seong Eun pushed her husband,
Kang Jin Ho.

269
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,519
Unfortunately, as you can see,

270
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,359
her husband ended up dying due to a
stroke cause by a skull fracture.

271
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,099
However, our client, Park Seong Eun,

272
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:44,069
is admitting to her crime without
denying anything.

273
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,940
Then are you planning to defend
her by saying that...

274
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,039
she was weak-minded because she
had been assaulted for a long time?

275
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:50,569
That's exactly what I'm planning.

276
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,109
Wait. Just a second.

277
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,279
But something's...

278
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,180
strange.

279
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,559
It doesn't seem like her husband
assaulted her that day.

280
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,559
According to the materials you've
given us,

281
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,960
There's no wound on Park Seong
Eun's body. Aren't I right?

282
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:14,099
Yes, you're right.

283
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,329
They just had an argument.

284
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,940
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

285
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,680
All right.
This is their son, Kang Jae Young.

286
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,579
(Kang Jae Young, Age 24,
University student)

287
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,450
I think my mom killed my dad...

288
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,150
out of self-defense.

289
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,950
He confessed that his mom
was physically abused by his dad.

290
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:39,390
Well, this is actually
a very simple case.

291
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,730
I only briefed you on it
because you guys were curious.

292
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,029
As always,
I'll figure it all out on my own...

293
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:46,529
and do a great job, so don't worry.

294
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:48,230
I won't worry.
I'll help you instead.

295
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,170
- I'll be fine on my own.
- I'll help.

296
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:54,369
Ms. Eun, let's help him together.

297
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,039
Oh, sure.

298
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,470
No, Ms. Eun. I'll be fine.

299
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,240
Why not? She'll be able
to learn a lot from this case.

300
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,509
Then Ms. Eun can help me.
I don't need your help. I decline.

301
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,950
I want to help you too.

302
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,450
Why would you do that?

303
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,380
You've asked me for help,

304
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,119
but you've never offered help.
What's with you?

305
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,319
I didn't want to help you
when you asked me for help,

306
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,789
but I'm dying to help you because
you're saying you don't want help.

307
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,829
- Then help me.
- All right, I will.

308
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,690
You're supposed to say
you won't help me.

309
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,930
No, I am going to help you.

310
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,700
You don't need to help me.

311
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,769
I'll help you.

312
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,799
You really don't need to help me.

313
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,369
I'm going to help you.

314
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,480
Gosh, they're like kids.

315
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,980
That's what I'm saying.

316
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,480
I'm single,

317
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,349
but I feel as if
I'm a father of four kids.

318
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,589
- 4?
- Yes, 4.

319
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,819
Here comes my eldest son.

320
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:49,430
Hey.

321
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,599
Ms. Lack of Evidence,
you walked out during my trial.

322
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,230
Hey. My gosh.

323
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,529
You better get yourself back here.
Stop right there!

324
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
Get back here.

325
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:01,609
Goodness.

326
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,450
Your eyes must be exhausted.

327
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,319
Yes, I'm so swamped.

328
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,319
I have to dig up
what Ko Chan Ho has been up to.

329
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,619
Oh, I also have a mountain
of other cases to work on.

330
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:19,390
Gosh, the resolution is so bad.

331
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,859
Even the forensic team won't be
able to bump up the resolution.

332
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,859
- Right?
- Yes.

333
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:30,430
By the way, I can't believe
that Ko Chan Ho is the killer,

334
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,069
not Jung Hyun Soo.

335
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:36,410
To be honest,
I don't know what's going on.

336
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,410
Same here. I really thought
Jung Hyun Soo was the killer.

337
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,079
I know.

338
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,890
There's a delivery for you.

339
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,759
- Welcome.
- Hello.

340
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:58,759
It's nice to see you
for something work-related.

341
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,829
I know, right? Attorney Ji asked me
to drop off these medical records.

342
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,339
Gosh, hello. I see you working hard.

343
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:06,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

344
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,039
It looks like
Park Seong Eun's medical records.

345
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,740
I must say, we keep getting
cases nonstop these days.

346
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,579
And it's another murder case.

347
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,609
- Gosh.
- But this case is different.

348
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,849
The suspect confessed first
that it was her doing.

349
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:20,250
You can get your sentence lightened
by turning yourself in, you know.

350
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,490
Oh, really? I see.

351
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,319
Everyone knows that.

352
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,619
Of course she should get her
sentence lightened. See you.

353
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,569
Please.

354
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,640
Please rethink your decision
just once more.

355
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:10,630
Mr. No, here you go.

356
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:11,799
Thanks.

357
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,609
Wait, isn't Mr. Byun supposed
to be in charge of it this week?

358
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:19,940
This sort of just happened.

359
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,880
How should I put it? Shall I say
life is about give-and-take?

360
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,150
Do you want to have a seat?

361
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,420
What are you reading?

362
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,789
Oh, is it the case Mr. Ji took on?

363
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,289
Yes.

364
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,829
Why are you insisting on
helping him...

365
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:41,130
when he keeps saying
he doesn't want your help?

366
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,769
Well...

367
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:46,000
Shall I say it's because
he's being weird about it?

368
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:49,509
I don't agree with that.
He's always...

369
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:50,769
just weird like that.

370
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,910
You're a pretty good judge
of character.

371
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:58,220
I used to think
that you're always...

372
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,880
so obnoxious.

373
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,349
Was I like that?

374
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Yes.

375
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:05,890
Anyhow,

376
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,430
I've gone through
this document and...

377
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:10,430
There's something, isn't there?

378
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,630
No, I'm not sure.

379
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,069
Gosh, what was that about?

380
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,769
But something is bothering me.

381
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,380
I think it's possible that someone
was supposed to come by.

382
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,549
Well...

383
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,250
I think it's odd that his body
was stabbed after he died.

384
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,150
Even if she deeply resented him,

385
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,619
I don't think there was a need
for such an act.

386
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,630
You're right.
I agree with you on that.

387
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,559
Look at you. You've improved a lot.
You're pretty good now.

388
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,769
One more thing. The person
who was supposed to come by...

389
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,269
could've been their son,
don't you think?

390
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Their son?

391
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,240
He's actually downstairs now.

392
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,480
He's preparing for his witness
interview with Mr. Ji.

393
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,130
Anyone would think
that they're dating.

394
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,069
Who?

395
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,269
I didn't say anything.

396
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,769
I heard something.

397
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:28,369
You were probably imagining things.
Old people can get like that.

398
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:29,809
That little...

399
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
What was that about?

400
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,450
First,

401
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,950
I'll start with questions
that the prosecution might ask.

402
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,119
Sure.

403
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:45,259
For how long was Kang Jin Ho
abusive...

404
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,019
towards your mother?

405
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:50,359
For a long time.

406
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,630
For a very long time.

407
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,670
He was always violent towards her
for as long as I can remember.

408
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,069
I really...

409
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,240
She's my mother,
but I pity her so much.

410
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,079
If you pity her that much,
why did you...

411
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:10,349
Let's do it again.

412
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,619
All right. Your mother...

413
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:13,680
Was your father...

414
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,019
only abusive toward your mother,
or did he also abuse you?

415
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,359
- Ji Wook.
- Why did you...

416
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,160
move out of your parents' place?

417
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,400
- Attorney No.
- To be fully prepared,

418
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,130
you should also practice
answering unexpected questions.

419
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,170
I'll take care of it.

420
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:35,140
Witness, have you ever thought
that you could get into a fight...

421
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,680
with your father
after you came of age?

422
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
I know of someone who's been
through something like that.

423
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,680
I should've kept that person safe.

424
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,819
There was a kid whom I failed
to protect.

425
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,589
That's when I had this thought.
"Right."

426
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,890
"Right. When I'm a little older
and have more power and ability,"

427
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:00,400
"I shouldn't let anyone fall victim
to such unfairness."

428
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,529
How was it for you, Jae Young?

429
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:08,069
All right. I think we can wrap up
the preparation for today.

430
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,109
Shall we meet again another time?

431
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:13,509
Yes.

432
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,549
Bye.

433
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,259
Gosh, what is the matter with you?
Why are you being like this?

434
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,670
That's what I want to ask.

435
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,869
Hey, Eun Hyuk. Look at me. Come on.

436
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,109
I'm always looking at you, Ji Wook.

437
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,779
Sure you are. But look at me
in the eye and tell me the truth.

438
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:48,349
What is this about? What truth?

439
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:49,609
Stop joking around.

440
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:56,390
What on earth
are you trying to do now, Ji Wook?

441
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,150
You're hiding something. Am I wrong?

442
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,119
- Don't jump to conclusions.
- I want to.

443
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,119
What is it?

444
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,960
Is he the culprit?

445
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,059
Goodness.

446
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,630
Is he? Yes? Tell me.

447
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,839
What would you do if he is?

448
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,309
Park Seong Eun went out
to get groceries to make dinner...

449
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,809
for her son who was coming by.

450
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:24,349
But when she got back,

451
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,750
she found her husband
collapsed on the floor.

452
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,170
Honey.

453
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,539
She got a hunch as soon as she
saw her husband who wasn't...

454
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,369
- supposed to be home at that hour.
- Honey.

455
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,569
"Gosh,"

456
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,740
"my son must've been here."

457
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,710
- Honey.
- "The two of them..."

458
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,079
"must've had a fight."

459
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:01,750
Gosh...

460
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
So she made a decision.

461
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,750
She decided that she will be
the murderer in place of her son.

462
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,819
She decided that she will
take all the blame.

463
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,690
Good grief.

464
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,759
I see.

465
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,329
- This was the reason behind it?
- So, now you are obligated...

466
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,730
to confidentiality.

467
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,000
According to Clause 21
of Attorneys-at-Law Act,

468
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,599
lawyers can't disclose information
acquired in line of service.

469
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,230
Before that,
according to Article 24, Clause 2,

470
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:55,240
lawyers can't conceal the truth
while serving their clients...

471
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,539
or make a false statement.

472
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,740
To me, my client's wish
is the first priority.

473
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,680
Which means I'm going
to keep it confidential.

474
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,150
You'll put an innocent person in
prison and release the guilty one?

475
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,220
- Do you think this makes sense?
- I'm trying to persuade her...

476
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,579
to make this right.

477
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,289
Your persuasion seems
to be failing.

478
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,059
You have a false confession,
and the trial is around the corner.

479
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,319
So what? How and when are you
going to convince her?

480
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,390
Even if I can't convince her,
I'm going to comply with her wish.

481
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,960
Do you believe that's
for the sake of the client?

482
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,759
Yes, I believe that.

483
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,529
Stop being idiotic!

484
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:26,170
Hey, why does she have to sacrifice
for the sake of the criminal?

485
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,470
Can't you understand
what I'm saying?

486
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,910
That's what my client wants.

487
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,710
I'm going to give my client what
she wants,

488
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,980
- no matter what it is.
- So you are going to release...

489
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,180
the real murderer?

490
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,519
Hey, Eun Hyuk. Will you be able
to handle the consequences?

491
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:52,130
I must say,
that really is a catch-22.

492
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,000
He must follow the industry rules
and keep the client's secret.

493
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,630
Who would want to hire an attorney
that doesn't keep secrets?

494
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,269
No matter what gets decided,

495
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,500
just leave them be.

496
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:03,710
All kids fight while growing up.

497
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:16,950
On June 6, 2017,
Defendant Park Seong Eun...

498
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,490
had an argument with her husband,
Kang Jin Ho, at home...

499
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,390
and pushed him violently during the
argument.

500
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,000
He fell and hit his head hard
on the edge of a stair tread.

501
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,170
As a result, he died of cerebral
hemorrhage and skull fractures.

502
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,440
The defendant didn't stop there.
Even after the victim died,

503
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,869
she ruthlessly stabbed him
in the stomach with a sharp weapon.

504
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:40,380
Hence, according to Article 259
Section 1 and Article 161...

505
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,279
of the Criminal Law, the prosecution
would like to press charges...

506
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,279
for manslaughter and damaging
a dead body.

507
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,250
Defense counsel, do you admit
the allegations?

508
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,319
Yes, Your Honor.

509
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,460
The defendant admits
the allegations.

510
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,259
However, it was due to her traumatic
stress disorder and depression,

511
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:03,029
which she got from being physically
and verbally abused for 20 years.

512
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,869
Please take that into consideration.

513
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:13,279
Are you...

514
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:16,349
here to cause a scene
by any chance?

515
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,049
I am.

516
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:23,589
It's Eun Hyuk's trial,
so I should leave it in his hands.

517
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:25,619
Why would I bother
with causing a scene?

518
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,619
Considering how brutally
the victim was murdered,

519
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,730
we cannot accept the counsel's claim
that the defendant is...

520
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,160
feeble-minded or mentally defective.

521
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,029
Also, we could not find...

522
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:39,039
any evidence or traces that show the
defendant was physically abused...

523
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,569
by the victim on the day
of the incident.

524
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,640
In other words, what the defendant
did on the day of the incident...

525
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,509
has nothing to do with being
abused by her husband.

526
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,180
It is true that she wasn't
physically abused that day,

527
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:55,720
but being verbally and physically
abused for 20 years...

528
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:58,089
gave her severe depression.

529
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:01,920
Hence, her mental state must
be taken into consideration.

530
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,190
Mr. Kang, just a second.

531
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,630
I'd like to ask you something.
Is that okay?

532
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,670
Mr. Bang, get me all the documents
related to the Park Seong Eun case.

533
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,700
All right.

534
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,910
(Attorney Eun Bong Hee)

535
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,710
Don't work too hard.

536
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,619
Thank you.

537
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
By the way,

538
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,549
what's the matter with her?

539
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:35,220
I know this because I gave her a lot
of work when I first met her.

540
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,349
When she's working on something
challenging...

541
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,190
or has to use her brain a lot,

542
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,559
she gets like that.

543
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:43,630
Yes, I've seen her like that too.

544
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,559
Her hair used to look so messy.

545
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,400
Soon,
her hair will get all greasy too.

546
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,200
When she works, she...

547
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,470
She doesn't really shower.

548
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:00,910
Gosh.

549
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,619
- Mr. No.
- Yes.

550
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,789
Gosh, yes.

551
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,420
You... You're here.

552
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,130
I got a lot done
in the last three days.

553
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,429
Right, I can see that.

554
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,869
I met with Park Seong Eun
and her son, Kang Jae Young.

555
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:26,900
I met the doctor
as well as the autopsy examiner.

556
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,170
I went to the scene too.

557
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,840
Oh, it does sound
like you got a lot done.

558
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,980
All right, that's all great.
But I'm just wondering...

559
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,849
Your hair and...

560
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,679
Have you been walking around
like this?

561
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,219
Yes. Is there a problem?

562
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,519
No, not at all.

563
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,190
It's fine.

564
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,519
There's no problem at all.
It's great.

565
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,260
- Then hear me out.
- Okay.

566
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:51,989
The first thing I thought was
strange took place at the court.

567
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,260
I know this because I've been locked
up in the detention center.

568
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:59,000
What I hated the most was that my
mom would be worried about me.

569
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,840
Both my mom and I
acted like we were totally fine.

570
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,670
But...

571
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,340
I noticed that Park Seong Eun and
her son were doing the same thing.

572
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,349
"I'm okay. Don't worry about me."

573
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,949
They were saying that to each other
with their eyes.

574
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,019
Isn't it strange?

575
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,650
They clearly love each other
so much.

576
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,559
How could the son let his mom
take all the blame for what he did?

577
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:22,760
I couldn't understand.

578
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,590
I regret it so much.

579
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:27,030
I should've just stayed home.

580
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:30,099
Then none of this would've happened.

581
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:32,199
What do you mean by that?

582
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:34,570
Dad, you're always like this.

583
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,309
I'd rather have you gone!

584
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,710
How dare you!

585
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,510
How could you glare at me like that
and talk back to me?

586
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,079
Shall I beat you up
to put some sense into you?

587
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,579
Why did you even have me?

588
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:51,150
Why did you bring me into this world
if you can't take responsibility?

589
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,090
If you're not going to disappear,

590
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:56,030
I should.

591
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,260
On the day of the incident,
the son...

592
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,230
- left after arguing with his dad.
- You little...

593
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:03,500
- Hey!
- That was the last time he saw him.

594
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:07,739
On the other hand, when Park
Seong Eun last saw her husband...

595
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,380
He was dead.

596
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,550
She assumed that it was
her son's doing...

597
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,880
because he was supposed to come by.

598
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,150
Hence, she went ahead
and stabbed her dead husband...

599
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,119
in order to take all the blame.

600
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:25,449
She willfully damaged the body.

601
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,289
Then what on earth happened between
the two points in time...

602
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,260
for her husband, Kang Jin Ho,
to have been found dead?

603
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,500
From robbery to an accident,
I thought of all possible scenarios.

604
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,739
This is my dad's medication.

605
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,079
Why has no one thought of checking
the husband's medical records?

606
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,980
Kang Jin Ho's doctor suspects
that he might...

607
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,230
Cerebral hemorrhage caused by
ruptured cerebral aneurysm.

608
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,659
Please request
an in-depth postmortem.

609
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,570
The examiner might have missed it
due to the visible wounds.

610
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,710
The doctor said it'll come out
in an in-depth postmortem.

611
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:28,179
Come here.

612
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,190
Sorry?

613
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,000
Don't get the wrong idea.
This hug is...

614
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,059
from your senior attorney.

615
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,329
- That's an excuse, isn't it?
- Yes.

616
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,170
My goodness, come on.

617
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:50,539
Bong Hee, you are...

618
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Okay.

619
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,510
You are dirty, but you are...

620
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,980
so pretty.

621
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,130
I returned the favor
with my hard work.

622
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:12,059
You are right.
You did return the favor...

623
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,130
You returned the favor with work.

624
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,070
You did. You've grown
a lot as a lawyer.

625
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:20,239
Good job.

626
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,070
Goodness.

627
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,980
This is the report
of the second autopsy.

628
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,849
(Report of the Second Autopsy)

629
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:35,079
The cause of death was a brain
hemorrhage by a brain aneurysm.

630
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:39,789
Ergo, the manslaughter charge
of Park Seong Eun will be dropped.

631
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:42,159
We will prosecute her
for abuse of a corpse.

632
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,829
I'm glad.

633
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:49,329
I called in Park Seong Eun
because of the autopsy report.

634
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,429
You can go and
tell the news personally.

635
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,239
Thank you, Prosecutor Cha.

636
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,780
Me too.

637
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,949
Stop it. I know that you two
aren't really grateful.

638
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,329
Goodness.

639
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,389
Bong Hee, what are you
doing over there?

640
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,730
Where are you going?

641
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,670
Let go. Let go of my arm.

642
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,340
Why are you being friendly?
What do you want from me?

643
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,139
I don't want anything from you.
Come on, Bong Hee.

644
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,440
You are such a hyena.

645
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:07,780
A hyena?

646
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,980
Bong Hee,

647
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,719
when did your relationship
with Mr. No begin?

648
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,889
Hey, relax. Can't I ask you a
question as a colleague?

649
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:21,719
I told you not to mention Mr. No...

650
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,960
or get him involved in
whatever you are trying to pull.

651
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,130
It started at the hotel, didn't it?

652
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,869
- What?
- I mean the hotel...

653
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:31,900
where you caught Hee Jun.

654
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,800
It started right then, didn't it?

655
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:36,940
How do you know that?

656
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,570
What do you mean? I saw...

657
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,380
What? You saw something?

658
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,050
No. I mean...

659
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,179
I got confused.

660
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,079
I heard. I think I heard it.

661
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,590
The girl in a yellow dress
who was with Hee Jun...

662
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,860
It was you, right?

663
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:07,369
Well, why is that important now?

664
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:08,739
- The important thing is...
- Right.

665
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,409
It's not important.

666
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,809
Cheating is nothing
to make a fuss over.

667
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,909
It's the least thing
I'm concerned about, but...

668
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,880
But you were the one
who bullied me...

669
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,550
and said I was unethical.

670
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,119
How do you sleep at night?

671
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:24,420
Don't you dare hit me.

672
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:26,719
- I'm going to hit you back.
- What is this?

673
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,559
Hey, let go of my hair.

674
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:29,730
You, let go first.

675
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,590
Let go first. Let go of me.

676
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,159
- I told you to let go of me.
- Gosh, let me go.

677
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,900
- Hey, Na Ji Hye.
- Hey.

678
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,300
Hold on. Hold on.

679
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,369
Let go of her. Let her go.

680
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,900
What are you doing?

681
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:42,539
What about her?

682
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,809
Excuse me? Oh, right.
Bong Hee, let go of her hair.

683
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:46,840
- Let go of me.
- Do it now.

684
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,409
- Let go of her hair.
- Let go of me.

685
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:49,710
Come on, Bong Hee.

686
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,409
- Whatever.
- There you go.

687
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,280
Goodness, you... What are you doing?
That was so uncivilized.

688
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,820
I guess you two are quite close.

689
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,059
I told you to
mind your own business.

690
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,260
You little...

691
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,559
Gosh, that was so unsophisticated.

692
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,369
This is embarrassing.

693
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,769
Goodness.

694
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:14,699
- Shoot.
- Darn.

695
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,239
- Go.
- Unbelievable.

696
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,030
Take the next one, please.
Get the next one.

697
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,269
What's wrong with him?

698
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,809
Why? They look cute.

699
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,639
I'm going to take the stairs too.

700
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,920
Hey!

701
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:23,309
Oh, I'm fine. I'm all right.

702
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,579
I have a lot of hair. So getting
a few hair plucked is nothing.

703
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:29,809
I don't like that.

704
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,219
Don't try to flirt with me.

705
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,590
Is it working?

706
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,219
Not at all.

707
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,989
Then what should I do...

708
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,969
to make this work?

709
00:43:58,409 --> 00:43:59,809
You're not breathing again, are you?

710
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:05,880
Wait, I think it worked.

711
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,090
By the way, I feel so proud.

712
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,630
You should be. You deserve it too.

713
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,699
I think moms are amazing.

714
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,130
How can they sacrifice
to go to prison for their children?

715
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,969
I agree. They are truly amazing.

716
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,670
I like you,

717
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:34,909
but I want to see my mom more today.

718
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,610
Bong Hee, you just said
that you like me. You did, right?

719
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,150
No, I didn't. I don't know anything
about that.

720
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,150
I should go see my mom
today just like you, Bong Hee.

721
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,469
My daughter said that
when she makes a lot of money,

722
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,739
she'd send me on a trip
around the world.

723
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,809
My son sent me on trips
countless times.

724
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,579
My daughter is really considerate.

725
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:18,789
That's the important factor,
her love for me.

726
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:22,019
You think my son isn't considerate?

727
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:26,059
He cares deeply about me.
You don't know the half of it.

728
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,630
My daughter does too.

729
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:29,670
Young Soon,

730
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,869
why are you speaking so casually
to me all of a sudden?

731
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,210
I'm sick of her calling me.

732
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,550
Mom.

733
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:45,679
My daughter!

734
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,449
Come here.

735
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:51,590
I missed you.

736
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:56,019
What a sight. They see
each other all the time.

737
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,960
They are putting on a show.

738
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:01,300
What brings you here?

739
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,829
I came here to see you.

740
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:06,869
I miss my son too.

741
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,679
Mom,

742
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,349
I'm here.

743
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,289
(Late Kim Mi Yeon)

744
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:29,389
Your son,

745
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:31,590
Ji Wook is here.

746
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:39,030
I'm sorry...

747
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:42,800
for not visiting you more often.

748
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:51,349
Goodness, I miss you today
more than ever.

749
00:46:57,989 --> 00:46:59,119
My dear Mom.

750
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:17,809
Hello?

751
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,340
Oh, hi. How have you been?

752
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,440
Yes.

753
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,519
Oh, really?

754
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,119
I got it. Thank you so much.

755
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:34,989
Okay.

756
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,809
(Jung Hyun Soo)

757
00:47:55,909 --> 00:47:57,179
(Jung Hyun Soo)

758
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,659
Do you remember that I have a
criminal record regarding assault?

759
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,789
I just got a call from the woman
I helped back then.

760
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,929
She told me that someone...

761
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:18,630
visited her and asked about me
and the incident.

762
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,380
My gosh, how did you know?

763
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,449
I'm sorry if I offended you.

764
00:48:32,449 --> 00:48:33,519
I'm really sorry.

765
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,849
No, you don't need to apologize.

766
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:39,590
But I'd like to ask you something.

767
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,590
Why do you continue to keep an eye
on me and doubt me?

768
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,159
What did I do wrong?

769
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:47,400
What did I do?

770
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:52,670
I really like you guys, but why
do you keep doing this to me?

771
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,269
Because you lied to me.

772
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,340
I lied?

773
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:08,380
Mr. No, have you...

774
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:11,849
Have you never lied in your life?

775
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:17,289
In average, people lie at least
10 to 200 times a day.

776
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,329
People can't live without telling
a lie. That's the truth.

777
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:21,360
Did you know that?

778
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:22,500
No, I didn't.

779
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,199
Do people really lie that much?

780
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:27,739
Okay, let's say that's the case.

781
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,940
But don't you think it's important
to differentiate what kind of lie...

782
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:34,710
it is?

783
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,510
What in the world did I lie about
anyway?

784
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,179
Do you even know what it is?

785
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,579
No, I don't.

786
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,789
If I knew, I wouldn't be here
right now.

787
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:45,849
Don't you think so?

788
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,760
But seriously, I'm sorry if I
offended you in any way.

789
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,260
It's just a habit I had ever since
I was a prosecutor.

790
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,099
If something bothers me,
I need to look into it.

791
00:49:58,099 --> 00:49:59,969
To be honest, I did look into you.

792
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:01,199
But I couldn't find anything.

793
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,539
That was the end of it.

794
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,340
It's over.

795
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:06,010
From now on,

796
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,849
I won't go around and ask people
about you. I promise.

797
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,920
It sounds like you're lying.

798
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,920
Yes. How witty.

799
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,360
Gosh, I'm very witty.

800
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,090
It's not very classy though.

801
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,860
Okay.

802
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,269
Let's meet again with Ms. Eun
one day.

803
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:37,510
I'd love to,

804
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,909
but I don't have time these days
because I'm so busy.

805
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:43,250
I'll think about it though.

806
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:44,849
Okay, then.

807
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,719
You should hurry up and drink.
The ice will melt.

808
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,260
My drink became cold.

809
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,510
Ko Chan Ho.

810
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,940
Ko Chan Ho is the culprit?

811
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,889
Is something wrong?

812
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:30,559
What?

813
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,969
No.

814
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:41,039
You look like you're concerned
about something.

815
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,039
Not at all.

816
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,880
Do you have anything to tell me?

817
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,909
Not yet.

818
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:51,449
No.

819
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:52,449
About what?

820
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:53,980
Well...

821
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,590
It also seems like you want to
tell me something.

822
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,559
No, I don't have anything to
tell you.

823
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,929
In order to hide a big lie,

824
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:12,900
people sometimes...

825
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,769
confess a small truth.

826
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:20,940
Bong Hee.

827
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,909
I'd like to talk to you...

828
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:27,579
about anything.

829
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:36,829
Shall we talk about my family?

830
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:00,280
I went to see my mom earlier.

831
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,949
She must've been happy to see her
son.

832
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:22,969
Just like that.

833
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,539
Spread it evenly.

834
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,639
I'm here, Mom.

835
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:31,809
My goodness, Ji Wook!

836
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:40,960
- By the way,
- Yes?

837
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,159
I went to see...

838
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,630
my mom today.

839
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:46,760
You did?

840
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:50,300
I also dreamed about...

841
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,199
your mother yesterday.

842
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,840
Really?

843
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,070
Yes.

844
00:53:57,639 --> 00:53:58,639
I...

845
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,710
have two mothers.

846
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,079
My current mother...

847
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:09,519
is my biological mother's friend.

848
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,750
My goodness.

849
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:16,420
How can he be so handsome, imposing,

850
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,030
lovely, adorable, and smart?

851
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,659
You can even tell that he's smart?

852
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,269
Of course. I can tell right away.

853
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,769
He's my son too, you know.

854
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:34,239
You have two moms.

855
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,440
Okay?

856
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,619
My gosh, he's adorable.

857
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:46,989
When I was young,

858
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:49,320
I lost both my parents in a
fire accident.

859
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,260
My dad died first.

860
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,760
And...

861
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:58,570
my mom got transferred to a
hospital.

862
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,440
She died...

863
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:02,900
not too long after that.

864
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,670
I'm...

865
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,980
going to be your mom now.

866
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,610
I'm your mom, Ji Wook.

867
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,150
Okay?

868
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:30,769
Don't cry.

869
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,110
My goodness, my son.

870
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:38,809
My precious son.

871
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:42,380
I miss you even when I'm looking
at you.

872
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,980
Mom, stop it. People will think that
I'm a mother's boy.

873
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,179
Why? What's wrong with that?

874
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,420
It's wrong on so many levels.

875
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,590
Why do you keep coming here,
Mr. Byun?

876
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,789
My gosh, am I not allowed to
come to my wife's restaurant?

877
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,159
What do you think, Ji Wook?

878
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:02,329
I'm sure she's acting like this for
a reason.

879
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,730
Your mom's taking it too far.

880
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:06,840
She won't even let me come home.

881
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,639
When did I do that?

882
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:11,110
I just told you to stay out of my
sight. I don't want to see you.

883
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,840
Exactly. Why don't you want to
see me?

884
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,650
I don't know what's going on,
but it's all your fault, Mr. Byun.

885
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:20,750
Why do you keep calling me
"Mr. Byun"...

886
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,280
when you call her "Mom"?

887
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:24,420
That's because I'm always on
Mom's side.

888
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:25,650
That's a given.

889
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:27,090
My goodness.

890
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,789
Mr. Byun, why don't you buy
10 boxes of pizza to go?

891
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,070
I see.

892
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:42,039
Yes.

893
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,010
I'm in a similar situation.

894
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,110
I...

895
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,550
have two dads.

896
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,650
Really?

897
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:01,590
I'll tell you...

898
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:03,219
my story next time,

899
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,630
if I have the chance.

900
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,360
Okay.

901
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,510
Then shall we go sleep?

902
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,650
What?

903
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,449
No, I just meant that we should
both go to our rooms and...

904
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:35,989
What were you thinking?
Are you crazy?

905
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,530
- Oh, right.
- Goodness.

906
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,860
What was that about?
You're really something.

907
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:25,840
Have a good sleep.

908
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:32,650
- If you...
- Yes.

909
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,280
can't fall asleep,

910
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:37,789
you should think
that I'm right beside you...

911
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,320
It's up to you.

912
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,960
Can you just stay beside me?

913
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:47,199
No, I can't!

914
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,090
Goodness.

915
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,489
You two look so cute together.
