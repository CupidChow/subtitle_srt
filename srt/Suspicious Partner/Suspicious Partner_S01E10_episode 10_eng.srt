1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920


2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,930
 Yoneda-san! 

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,840
 Yoneda-san! 

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,210
 Yoneda-san! 

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,850
   

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,070
How is Yoneda-san?

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,000
He lost a dangerous amount of blood from his abdomen; we barely managed to stop it.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,860
The rest will depend on Yoneda-san himself.

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,040
He'll be fine.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,480
The guy's got guts.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,940
Right. Yoneda-san will be fine.

12
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,710
Were you able to make the delivery? 
    

13
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,510
Yes.

14
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,190
There was one security camera above the hairdresser.

15
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,580
Thank you.

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,340
Your reward. Please accept it.

17
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,420
Inaba was working part-time doing deliveries

18
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,960
during the time Shimano-san and Yoneda-san were stabbed.

19
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,850
His alibi is almost too perfect.

20
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,930
That helmet covers his face.

21
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,630
He most likely hired a double to cover for him.

22
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,850
But we have no evidence to prove it.

23
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,220
Evidence?

24
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,690
- Don't pull any crazy stunts. 
 - Now is the time to do that.

25
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,600
   

26
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,420
Hello?

27
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,090
This is Tateishi.

28
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,140
Could I have a moment of your time later?

29
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,630
Of course.

30
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,030
Anything for my savior, Tateishi-san.

31
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,890
Where shall we speak?

32
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,010
I will text you a location.

33
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,010
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

34
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,320
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,910
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

36
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,920
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

37
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,390
♫  Here's the love that I long for  ♫

38
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,090
   

39
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,390
Where is Tateishi-san?

40
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,960
He went out.

41
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,730
Where?

42
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,500
He didn't tell me.

43
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,690
I see.

44
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,610
Why did you choose a place like this?

45
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,490
Because we're about to discuss something crucial, right?

46
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,190
Yes, I killed them.

47
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,420
The body in the water tank, Sakura-san's ex-boyfriend,

48
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,960
Chef Haneda; I killed them all.

49
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,450
Yoneda-san, too. Though I guess he technically isn't dead.

50
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,210
I honestly expected more of a reaction. What gives?

51
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,790
I already knew you were behind it all.

52
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,010
Then why aren't you arresting me?

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,060
Oh, don't worry, I will.

54
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,680
What exactly is your motive?

55
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,110
My motive?

56
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,170
Sorry, I just remembered suddenly.

57
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,280
You were so desperate to defend me in court,

58
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,420
even though I killed that Haneda-san.

59
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,040
Seriously, you were so cool.

60
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,380
And I regret ever taking your side.

61
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,380
If I'd realized you were the culprit earlier,

62
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,890
Yoneda-san wouldn't be suffering like that.

63
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,950
Could you please just leave me alone already?

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,430
Promise me that, and I won't lay a hand on you or Sakura-san.

65
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,830
Deal?

66
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,840
No deal.

67
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,870
Then I guess I'll just have to kill them all.

68
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,710
Why are you doing this?

69
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,470
He's still not home.

70
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,810
Hello?

71
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,310
What?

72
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,740
   

73
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,770
Are you a lawyer?

74
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes.

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,440
Why did you have a fight?

76
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,150
Whatever the reason, he refuses to settle it over pen and paper.

77
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,720
- Sir, look at this blood. 
 - I get it. Sit down first.

78
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,400
- This is all because you—
 - All right, sit! Sit down.

79
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,010
It was not like Tateishi-san to throw a punch.

80
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,030
Haruto bought us time.

81
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,230
-  Sir, look at this blood. 
 - I get it. 

82
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,830
-  I will not settle this out of court. 
 - Calm down. Okay? 

83
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,990
-  This is your fault, Inaba!  
 - Right, we hear you. 

84
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,090
-  He may have broken my nose! 
 - No, it's not broken. 

85
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,680
Now is the time to pull a crazy stunt.

86
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,880
This is too crazy.

87
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,530
Right then.

88
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,680
Umehara-san.

89
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,230
Who's this?

90
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,560
Take a picture, just in case.

91
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,750
Sure.

92
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,330
   

93
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,110
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

94
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,130
What does this entail?

95
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,270
You're a lawyer, right? You should know this.

96
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm a bit frazzled after being beaten up by this man here.

97
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,090
These wounds were not worth the price of searching Inaba-san's home.

98
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,060
Why did you do something so rash?

99
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,450
 Then I guess I'll just have to kill them all. 

100
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,220
You're keeping secrets again.

101
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,580
I am not.

102
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,420
That's the face you make when you are hiding something,

103
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,840
but I won't pester you anymore. Just rest for today.

104
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,040
I will.

105
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,250
Ouch!

106
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,470
Hello?

107
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,910
Hey.

108
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,870
 What's up? 

109
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,910
I need to ask you for a favor.

110
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,710
Now it's unusual for you to ask me for a favor, Ren.

111
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,090
What do you need?

112
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:21,520
You were looking into various women involved with Inaba, right?

113
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,310
I want you to pass that information to me.

114
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,070
You'll owe me one.

115
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,480
I know.

116
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,360
Then I'll look forward to my reward.

117
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,250
Tateishi-san?

118
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,170
You're awake.

119
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,130
Yoneda-san, it's me, Ren.

120
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,670
Can you recognize me?

121
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,650
Ren-san...

122
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,810
And Sakura-san too...

123
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,140
Thank goodness...

124
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,300
Do you know who I am?

125
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,350
Shinjo.

126
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,960
Why don't I get a prefix?

127
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,380
Whatever, I'm glad you hung in there.

128
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,470
What an absolute relief.

129
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,980
Indeed.

130
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,280
Where were you?

131
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,080
Kind of...

132
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,030
Are you holding something?

133
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,240
No.

134
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,660
What? I have nothing.

135
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,930
So... we're alone.

136
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,250
We certainly are.

137
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,550
No one else is around.

138
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,160
I suppose not.

139
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,810
- I'll take a bath. 
 - A bath.

140
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,760
It was a hot day today.

141
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,500
- Was it? 
 - Yes.

142
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,020
Did you want to bathe first?

143
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,000
No, you ought to go first, Sakura.

144
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,200
Then I will... go first.

145
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,040
You, too. Go ahead and freshen up, Tateishi-san.

146
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,710
Sure.

147
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,110
I think it's about time I head to bed.

148
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,060
Okay.

149
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,650
R-Right.

150
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,050
It was a long day.

151
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,050
You can leave that behind.

152
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,980
- It's fine. 
 - No, I'll handle it.

153
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,830
If you insist.

154
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,480
Good night.

155
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,240
Night.

156
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,450
How about a drink?

157
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,220
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

158
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,080
Are you sleepy?

159
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,460
No.

160
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,050
Feel free to sleep here.

161
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,700
I'm fine, though.

162
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,600
Say, want to go on a date tomorrow?

163
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,430
A date?

164
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:49,200
Yes. It'll be our first date.

165
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,050
Sure.

166
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,410
Then I'll see you again tomorrow.

167
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,460
Tomorrow.

168
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,480
Scared?

169
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,260
Of course not.

170
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,010
Stop that.

171
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,830
I'll take a picture, too.

172
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,680
Let's take one together.

173
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,640
Oh, I got one!

174
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,000
It's on the reel!

175
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,560
 Tateishi Haruto, the righteous lawyer, is currently sulking! 

176
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,020
 I am not. 

177
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,000
 It's not that you suck, I'm just an amazing angler. 

178
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,760
 Can't argue with that. You were pretty good. 

179
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,310
 He complimented me! 

180
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,130
 I promise to lose next time, okay? 

181
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,230
 Don't you dare go easy on me. 

182
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,800
 All's fair in fishing. 

183
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,280
 But of course. Here's to our next fishing competition. 

184
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:51,990
"Here. I thought this would look good on you, Sakura."

185
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,540
Or more like... this?

186
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,950
"Would you have this? It's for you."

187
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,890
Tateishi-san?

188
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,990
What is it?

189
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,630
I'm headed to the laundromat to do my laundry in bulk.

190
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,510
I'll come with you.

191
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,010
I can't remember the last time I was in a laundromat.

192
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,520
I used to frequent them all the time in college.

193
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,900
So when will you give that to me?

194
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,230
What are you talking about?

195
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,440
It's been on your mind all day today.

196
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,510
♫  I changed everything for you, to suit you  ♫

197
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,540
You noticed.

198
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,200
I did.

199
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,090
♫  I changed everything for you, to suit you  ♫

200
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,730
♫  The cheesy lines like a drama  ♫

201
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,840
- Wait, here? 
 - Yes, here.

202
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,700
♫  But don't laugh at me even if I try to act like a grown-up  ♫

203
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,300
♫  All I wanna do is kiss your heart  ♫

204
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,780
For you.

205
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,760
♫  I want you more  ♫

206
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,670
♫  But you seem close and yet far away  ♫

207
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,950
How adorable.

208
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,080
May I try it on?

209
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,860
Of course.

210
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,890
♫  In the spring with flower scent, what do you think about when you dream of the moon  ♫

211
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,500
♫  To hand you one of my earphones  ♫

212
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,280
Looks good on you.

213
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,210
♫  I try to get closer to you  ♫

214
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,410
♫  With my feelings  ♫

215
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,700
Thank you. 
 ♫  carried on the wind of love  ♫

216
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,560
♫  That flutters in the air,  ♫

217
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,240
♫  How far shall I fly?  ♫

218
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,470
♫  I'm sure the world without you  ♫

219
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,510
♫  Is like a fleeting moment  ♫

220
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,180
♫  Where time stands still  ♫

221
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,720
Well then.

222
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,240
Yes.

223
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,830
♫  When you tell me it's okay, I can get through long nights  ♫

224
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,670
Good night.

225
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:25,830
♫  That never seem to end  ♫

226
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:30,190
♫  With your magic words  ♫

227
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,870
Night.

228
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:41,890


229
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,440
 Dad! 

230
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,300
 Dad! 

231
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,400
   
 Promise you'll stay by my side, forever. 

232
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,810
 Haruto's been acting off lately. 

233
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,840
 You were shouldering that burden on your own? 

234
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,610
-  Please break up with me. 
 - No. 

235
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,390
 I cannot stand to see Tateishi-san like this. 

236
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,020
 Tateishi-san!
