1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040


2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,380
-  Dad! 
 - Haruto! 

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,600
 Dad! 

4
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,420
 I also lost my father when I was young. 

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,620
Good morning.

6
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,370
Morning. Were you able to sleep?

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,640
Were you?

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,380
Yes.

9
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,440
Good morning.

10
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,260
Good morning.

11
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,060
- Are you already ready to work?
 - Yes.

12
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,650
I will catch up on what I've missed.

13
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,680
Thank you.

14
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:38,420
Say, could I ask you to look into something personal for me?

15
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,170
Something personal?

16
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,650
I'd like to know more about the fire my parents were involved in.

17
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:52,570
Anything you can find about the incident, including the culprit.

18
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,740
Understood. But why all of a sudden?

19
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,700
Because I can't move on unless I face the facts.

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,030
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

21
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,380
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

22
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,870
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

23
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,970
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

24
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:38,430
♫  Here's the love that I long for  ♫

25
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,050
   

26
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,010
Will you really take a look?

27
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,800
I will.

28
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,120
Thank you.

29
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,960
Tateishi-san, the one who set fire to your home

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,580
was Sakura-san's father. 
    

31
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,140
He also passed away in the fire with your parents.

32
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,520
   

33
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,310
The one in charge of this case was Chief Prosecutor Aoki. 
    

34
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,310
   

35
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,650
Thank you.

36
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,710
Tateishi-san.

37
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,090
Here's a special juice. I made it with healthy ingredients for you.

38
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,590
- Thanks. 
 - Likewise.

39
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,400
Thank you for the necklace.

40
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,340
Sure thing.

41
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,570
Are you keeping secrets again?

42
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,910
No.

43
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,570
You are.

44
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,570
Sakura.

45
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,980
No matter what happens, I want you to promise to stay with me.

46
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,950
Don't ever leave my side.

47
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,110
What's the matter all of a sudden?

48
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,100
Promise me, please.

49
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,550
Promise you'll stay by my side, forever.

50
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,090
All right.

51
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,350
I promise.

52
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,200
Thank you.

53
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,200
  ­ 

54
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,000
Aren't those Shinjo-san's snacks?

55
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
He won't notice if we don't tell him.

56
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,410
Now I'm an accomplice.

57
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,050
You can talk to me about anything, you know.

58
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,850
What?

59
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,830
Haruto's been acting off lately, right?

60
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,320
Yes, a bit.

61
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,580
Apparently, he's been looking into the incident his parents were involved in.

62
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,480
He mentioned he had lost them when he was young?

63
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:39,140
Yes. A man who resented Haruto's father set fire to their home.

64
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,110
I hear the culprit died in the fire as well.

65
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,900
   

66
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,140
   

67
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,350
No way...

68
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,330
I'm back.

69
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,960
Tateishi-san, shall we go on a date?

70
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,450
Was there something you wanted to do?

71
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,160
Not in particular...

72
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,740
But I am craving something sweet.

73
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,250
Wait by the bench there.

74
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,990
Sure.

75
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,140
This is so good I'm getting emotional.

76
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,250
Thank you for grabbing these.

77
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,080
Oh, right!

78
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,790
Let's take a picture together.

79
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,670
Okay.

80
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,710
Three, two, one...

81
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,020
 - Oh? 
 - You're taking a video. 

82
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,800
 What? I am? 

83
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,170
 Doofus... 

84
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,880
Again.

85
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,200
Come here.

86
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,420
 I was making fruitless efforts to delay the inevitable even for a moment. 

87
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,650
 But we can't stay like this, not with our circumstances. 

88
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,240
Tateishi-san.

89
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,950
There was something I needed to tell you today.

90
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,530
Let's break up.

91
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,360
Please break up with me.

92
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,910
When did you find out?

93
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,610
When did you find out about my father, Tateishi-san?

94
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,260
Only recently.

95
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,440
Were you shouldering that burden on your own?

96
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,820
I'm not letting this bother me.

97
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,510
Our parents have nothing to do with us.

98
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,860
But they do.

99
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,930
I know how much you respected your father, Tateishi-san.

100
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,940
I cannot stand to see Tateishi-san like this.

101
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,280
My father is no criminal. It's true.

102
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I hope to prove his innocence one day.

103
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,860
But I can't do that, not now.

104
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,000
So please...

105
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,820
- Break up with me. 
 - No.

106
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,880
Sakura, I won't leave you, no matter what you say.

107
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm at my limit.

108
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,820
I will be staying the night at a hotel in the area.

109
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,780
This is for the best.

110
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,680
Did you bring me evidence to prove that woman was guilty?

111
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,360
No, I am here to ask about another case.

112
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,440
What other case?

113
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,150
I wish to ask about the fire that took my parents' lives.

114
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,630
You are the one who handled their case, correct?

115
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,960
That's right. What do you want to know?

116
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,160
Why were my parents killed?

117
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,350
   

118
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,500
A man who was prosecuted by your father was exacting revenge.

119
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,790
That doesn't serve as enough reason.

120
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,580
Even if that were the case, why was the accused also found dead in the fire?

121
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,870
I bet he failed to make it out in time.

122
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,040
What made you believe that man was the culprit?

123
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,070
Your testimony.

124
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,800
What?

125
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,000
You testified against him.

126
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,920
Said the man set the fire and killed your whole family.

127
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,860
It was all you.

128
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,150
I... did.

129
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,380
 I promise to lose next time, okay? 

130
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,520
 Don't you dare go easy on me. 

131
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,140
 All's fair in fishing. 

132
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,740
 But of course. Here's to our next fishing competition. 

133
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:33,280
   

134
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,240
How about we grab a drink together, for old time's sake?

135
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,270
No, thanks.

136
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,200
A shame.

137
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,690
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

138
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,170
Well...

139
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Did you break up with  Miyashita-san?

140
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,580
Talk it out, you'll feel better.

141
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:46,620
You know about my nightmares, right? The ones I've had since I was a kid.

142
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,160
Yes.

143
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:57,470
Well, I remembered the culprit. The one who set fire to my home.

144
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,890
Who was it?

145
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,180
Sakura's father.

146
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,960
What?

147
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,990
Y-You're sure?

148
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,640
No.

149
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,780
It all happened so long ago, my memories are getting hazy.

150
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,830
Does Miyashita-san know?

151
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,970
That's why she insists we break up.

152
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,220
I see...

153
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:43,510
Hey, I don't feel any better even though I talked it out.

154
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:48,090
Sorry I couldn't be of any help.

155
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,660
   

156
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,970
Haruto.

157
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,240
They've identified the individual in the photograph from Inaba's place.

158
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,520
Who is it?

159
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,130
A woman named Honda Kanade.

160
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,850
She was Inaba's childhood friend.

161
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,280
It seems like she passed away quite some time ago.

162
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,350
Apparently, her family runs a small cafe.

163
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,720
I plan on visiting with Miyashita-san, if that's all right with you?

164
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,140
   

165
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,940
Are you thinking of quitting the firm by any chance?

166
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,160
Well...

167
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,800
I'd rather you didn't.

168
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,970
I'd be bored without your company, Miyashita-san.

169
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,110
Not to mention how stifling it'd get with only old men around.

170
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,630
Fair point.

171
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,640
 ­  

172
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,490
- Let's head on in. 
 - Yes.

173
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,390
 ­  

174
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,120
- Welcome. 
 - A party of two, please.

175
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,070
Have a seat at the counter.

176
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,280
What a charming cafe.

177
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,100
Thank you.

178
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,610
Ma'am, may I ask what song this is?

179
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,310
It's a tune my daughter composed.

180
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,650
   
   

181
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,030
Here you go.

182
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,210
Is the individual in that photograph your daughter?

183
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,050
Yes. She passed away 14 years ago.

184
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:06,530
No... she was murdered.

185
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,510
Do you know of a man named Inaba Takahiko?

186
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,100
Yes. He was my daughter's childhood friend.

187
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,760
He was a kind boy, who was always at Kanade's side.

188
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,450
He supported Kanade's dream as well.

189
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,580
 Help me! 

190
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,320
 Help! 

191
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,720
 Help! 

192
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,010
We've gotten a grasp on Inaba's motive.

193
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,290
Tell me.

194
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,650
 14 years ago, 

195
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,640
Honda Kanade-san was assaulted by a group of men.

196
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,350
She then proceeded to take her own life.

197
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:27,140
The men who assailed her are the now dead Tabata, Haneda, Momoi, and Shimano.

198
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,510
Inaba loved Kanade-san.

199
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,220
So that's what this is about.

200
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:56,200
   

201
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,590
Don't work yourself into the night.

202
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:11,850
Thank you. I'll make sure to turn in after I look a bit more into Kanade-san.

203
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,000
Tateishi-san is late, too.

204
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,520
In any case, I will see you tomorrow.

205
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,140
Good night.

206
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,930
Evening.

207
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
Don't come any closer.

208
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,310
Stop!

209
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,110
You're not getting away this time.

210
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,500
Miyashita-san, call the police.

211
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,340
Right.

212
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,080
Tateishi-san?

213
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,370
Tateishi-san? Tateishi-san?

214
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,320
Tateishi-san, stay with us!

215
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,750
Tateishi-san!

216
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,910
Tateishi-san!

217
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,220
 Dad! 

218
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,640
 Dad! 

219
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,420
 Dad! 

220
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,070
 Haruto, run! 

221
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,920
 Dad! 

222
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,900
 Haruto! 

223
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,930
 Mr. Prosecutor! Are you all right? 

224
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,940
 Take Haruto... and run... 

225
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,950
 Dad! 

226
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,660
 I've got you now, kid. Let's go. 

227
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,780
 Dad! 

228
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:50,540


229
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,250
   
 I remembered what really happened. 

230
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,840
 Don't overthink it and be honest with yourself. 

231
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,310
 I want the person I cherish to be happy. 

232
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:04,380
 Shall we have a fresh start from here?
