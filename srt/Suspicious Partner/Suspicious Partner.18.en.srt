1
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,219
Jung Hyun Soo.

2
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Darn it.

3
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,930
Hey, Prosecutor Cha.
Jung Hyun Soo just escaped.

4
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,900
Yes, Investigator.

5
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,610
What? What happened
to Prosecutor Cha?

6
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Darn it.

7
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,189
Hey, Ji Wook.

8
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,030
What did you just say?

9
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,629
Yoo Jung had what?

10
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,900
Okay.

11
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,240
What happened?

12
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,009
Did something happen
to Prosecutor Cha?

13
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,449
Hey, Prosecutor Lee.

14
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,219
Give me a call as soon as you find
out Jung Hyun Soo's whereabouts.

15
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,090
Thank you. Bye.

16
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,599
Hey, what happened?

17
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,210
Yoo Jung. Cha Yoo Jung!

18
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,240
Is Prosecutor Cha all right?

19
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,840
Hey, what's wrong with Yoo Jung?

20
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,650
Why is she unconscious?

21
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,580
Well, she had a mild concussion.

22
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,580
A concussion?

23
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,889
Hey, the damage of
concussions can be serious.

24
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
She has to be examined then.
Why is she just lying here?

25
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,289
So the doctor wanted
to take a CT scan.

26
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,930
Is there a specialist
instead of an intern?

27
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,060
Shouldn't we move her
to a specialized hospital?

28
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,259
Hey, Ji Wook. Do you know
any doctors? Please help her.

29
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,930
Please help her.

30
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,439
Hey, Yoo Jung. Yoo Jung.

31
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,939
Please wake up.

32
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,379
Hey, why is she unconscious?

33
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,939
Be quiet. You're embarrassing me.

34
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,050
Yoo Jung.

35
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,479
Keep quiet.

36
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,590
I fell asleep.

37
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,620
I'm so relieved.

38
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:12,689
I'm relieved.

39
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,659
I really am.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,129
You fool.

41
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,699
I was just acting.

42
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,410
(Emergency Center)

43
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,009
They haven't caught
Jung Hyun Soo yet?

44
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,509
No.

45
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,990
I should have seen it coming
that he was going to run.

46
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,250
There's no way you could've
predicted that.

47
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,720
Do you think he regained...

48
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,290
his memory?

49
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,699
I think so.

50
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,100
I had no way of knowing
how much of his memory...

51
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,769
was regained.

52
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,500
I see.

53
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,939
Which brings me to this point.

54
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,810
I want you to stay at my house
for the time being.

55
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,920
No one knows what he's going to do.

56
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,579
No.

57
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,220
Bong Hee, you should listen
to me this time.

58
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,189
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

59
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,240
Are you really okay?

60
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,740
Aren't you feeling dizzy at all?

61
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:35,509
I'm fine.

62
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,639
Shall I get you anything?
Is there anything you need?

63
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,279
Climb on my back.

64
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,379
I'm fine.

65
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:58,759
- We are here.
- Yes.

66
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,800
- Be careful.
- Okay.

67
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,670
Hey, Yoo Jung. Take your bag.

68
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:08,910
Goodness.

69
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:10,610
Yoo Jung, here is your bag.

70
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,360
I'm exhausted.

71
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,930
Hey, get some rest now.

72
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,899
Call me if there's anything.

73
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,569
I hope I never wake up from sleep.

74
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,769
What do you mean?

75
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,899
I'm a prosecutor who lost a suspect.

76
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,939
How am I supposed
to deal with this circumstance?

77
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,269
How far...

78
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,240
does Jung Hyun Soo know?

79
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,839
People whom he met
after he woke up are...

80
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,439
me,

81
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,279
Prosecutor Cha,

82
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,790
and...

83
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,189
Bong Hee.

84
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,100
Who is that woman?

85
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,110
How far does the memory go...

86
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,649
that Jung Hyun Soo got back?

87
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,570
(Park So Young)

88
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,409
(Park So Young)

89
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,679
Why did I murder them?

90
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,879
What is it that I couldn't finish?

91
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,779
Did he regain his memory...

92
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,220
regarding the murders...

93
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,389
and his purpose?

94
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,399
(Return)

95
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,669
It has been two days
since the suspect, Mr. Jung,

96
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:26,070
escaped from the hospital
where he was being investigated.

97
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,639
His whereabouts are still unknown.

98
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,210
The prosecution has issued a
nationwide man hunt of the fugitive.

99
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,950
They announced they deployed a large
number of personnels on the case.

100
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:37,080
They are being criticized
for wasting manpower...

101
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,679
due to their lack of supervision
of the suspect.

102
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,149
I'm sorry, sir.

103
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,590
If you are sorry,

104
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,659
stay out of my sight.

105
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,360
There are many ways.

106
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:51,860
You can take a leave
of absence or something.

107
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,600
Hey, I'm about to get transferred
to one of the rural areas.

108
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:58,240
I'm the type that likes staying in
cities.

109
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,370
Hey, this is ridiculous.

110
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,409
Should I fire or suspend you now?
Should I?

111
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,539
That's right. You should go now.

112
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,710
Go take your leave of absence.

113
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,809
Go right now!

114
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,679
Hey, you should go with her.

115
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,490
You can follow her and
be on your way right away.

116
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,750
Good grief. You know what? I'll go.

117
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,389
Unbelievable.

118
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,389
What just happened?

119
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:23,690
Come on.

120
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,730
Why are you all serious?

121
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,470
Are you that afraid of that suspect
with the memory loss?

122
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,870
He's right. I bet
he can't even go far.

123
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,139
They will catch him soon enough.

124
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,870
By any slim chance,
if he shows up in front of me,

125
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,840
I'll catch him.

126
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,580
I can go at him one more time.

127
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,350
I agree. We must catch him.

128
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,679
Our current situation...

129
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,350
is nothing to joke about.

130
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,990
I still don't think you
understand my feelings.

131
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,059
I really want you
to feel what I feel.

132
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,259
What should I do?

133
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,100
I have no other choice.
I shall kill them all.

134
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,210
Everyone, stop goofing around.
It's not funny.

135
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,009
Let me tell you again.
You have to keep yourselves safe.

136
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,309
Got it?

137
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,070
(Park So Young)

138
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,629
(Park So Young)

139
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,370
(Park So Young)

140
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,049
Do you think Jung Hyun Soo
will really come here?

141
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,250
It's certainly very possible.

142
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,860
If he hasn't fully regained
his memory yet,

143
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,559
he'll wander around in an attempt
to get his memory back,

144
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,259
and this is the one place
that he remembers for certain.

145
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,629
The school in the yearbook, right?

146
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,899
That's right. After that,

147
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,070
he'll go to the places
where he killed his victims.

148
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,940
I've already called the company
that's rebuilding the apartment.

149
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,179
I've also sent them
the wanted flyer for Jung Hyun Soo.

150
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,779
Great. Good work.

151
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:00,580
Gosh. I would've sent a unit here
for stakeout if I was in the police.

152
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Shall we go?

153
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,220
All right.

154
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,039
Who are you?

155
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,230
Aren't you leaving for the day?

156
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,100
I just want to finish this up.

157
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:23,200
Oh, I see. See you tomorrow.

158
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:25,399
- Get home safely.
- Okay.

159
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,039
Who are you?

160
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,100
What...

161
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,909
Are you asking me right now?

162
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,879
Who on earth are you?

163
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:46,850
I should be asking you...

164
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,720
why you are here right now.

165
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,820
Gosh. Well...

166
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,259
My head is hurting so badly.

167
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:59,159
I beg your pardon?

168
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,230
You're...

169
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,269
the very first person I saw
as soon as I woke up.

170
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:09,769
But my head keeps telling me
that I have to get rid of you.

171
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,080
Do you happen to know the reason?

172
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:13,809
Do you?

173
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,669
I must make sure she can't talk.

174
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,850
I asked you a question,
so you should answer me.

175
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,720
Why are you doing this to me?

176
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,859
Tell me. Who are you? What are you?

177
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,829
Gosh, what am I?

178
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,369
Who am I? Tell me.

179
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,799
Why...

180
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,470
Why on earth am I being like this?

181
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,650
Do you want to know the reason?

182
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,680
It's because I witnessed...

183
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,259
your killing.

184
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,349
Bong Hee, are you all right?

185
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,450
Mr. No.

186
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,759
Mr. No.

187
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,329
Mr. No, you're bleeding.
The blood...

188
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,549
Mr. No.

189
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,920
Mr. No.

190
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:26,640
Gosh, please...

191
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,240
Please...

192
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,380
What?

193
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,779
You want to become like Dad?

194
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,049
Yes, I want to be like you
when I grow up.

195
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:43,690
My gosh, I'm so honored.
Come here, my boy.

196
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:47,660
Who told you that you can wear
my judicial robe?

197
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,930
Raise your arms.

198
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,299
- Dad.
- Yes.

199
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Prosecutor No.

200
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:17,849
Prosecutor No.

201
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,220
- Prosecutor No.
- Ji Wook.

202
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,230
- Ji Wook...
- Gosh.

203
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,660
Come here. Let's go.
I'll get you out of here.

204
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,730
It's okay. Let's go.

205
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,900
Dad...

206
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,869
Dad, no...

207
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,579
Dad...

208
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,349
Dad...

209
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,460
Are you okay?

210
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,059
I'll go in and get
your mom and dad too.

211
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:29,490
No...

212
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,200
(Gookil Hospital)

213
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:54,180
Hey, Ji Wook. Are you all right?

214
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,519
I'm Eun Hyuk.
Can you recognize me, Ji Wook?

215
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,390
Hey. It's me, your dad.

216
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,619
Thank you, Ji Wook.

217
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:03,460
Hey, why aren't you saying anything?

218
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,299
Can't you recognize me?

219
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,829
It's me. Say something.
Can't you talk?

220
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,200
Why are you two stopping me?

221
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,710
- Who are you?
- What?

222
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,039
Hey, Ji Wook. It's me.

223
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,619
You little...
Gosh, he totally scared me.

224
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,150
You've obviously
regained your consciousness.

225
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,660
You brat.

226
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,990
He's such a prankster.

227
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,130
You little...

228
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,500
- Gosh, you totally got me.
- Mr. Byun.

229
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,430
- Mr. Byun.
- Let's get something to drink.

230
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,799
- What's the matter?
- Let's step out.

231
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,329
- Just a few minutes.
- Why are we stepping out?

232
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,640
- Let's get fresh air.
- All right.

233
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
- I just wanted to see him.
- You saw him.

234
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,710
Why are you guys being like this?
Hey.

235
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,009
Hang on a second. Why on earth
are you two being like this?

236
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,440
You guys are so weird.

237
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,880
We should step out so that they can
spend some alone time together.

238
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,410
Why don't you get it?

239
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,849
Oh, are they...

240
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,690
You guys should have just told me.

241
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,819
- Most people just know...
- All right, I heard you.

242
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,690
I should go to the washroom.

243
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,390
He just can't take a hint.

244
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,170
Bong Hee.

245
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:24,470
I'm sorry.

246
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,480
Why did you have to get yourself
involved and get hurt like this?

247
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,420
If you do that again,

248
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,390
I'll actually get mad at you.

249
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,089
You should really apologize to me.

250
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,299
You quit your job because of me,
and you keep...

251
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,059
getting hurt because of me.

252
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,829
What is this mess?

253
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,069
So?

254
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:25,500
Have you regained your memory?

255
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:35,549
Let's start over.

256
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:37,950
You're Jung Hyun Soo, right?

257
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:45,420
Do you know why you're here now?

258
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,730
Do you really not remember anything?

259
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,380
(Murder weapon for Lee Jae Ho)

260
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,750
The knife had Lee Jae Ho
and Bang Eun Ho's blood on it.

261
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,019
It was found at your place, and it
had your fingerprints all over it.

262
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,049
You don't remember it?

263
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,670
Mr. Jung.

264
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,069
I'll see until when you can
exercise...

265
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,009
your right to remain silent.

266
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,289
Well...

267
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,160
Did you have a good sleep?

268
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,630
Yes, I did. Thanks to you.

269
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,259
How are you feeling?

270
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,900
How are the stitches
on the stab wound?

271
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,369
- Can I see?
- No.

272
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,069
You can't.
It looks so ugly right now.

273
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:15,410
I absolutely can't let you see it.

274
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,470
Don't say that.

275
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:19,509
I'm sure it looks cute and sexy.

276
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:27,880
I'm sorry.

277
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,750
I can't really separate
my feelings from work.

278
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,059
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

279
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,319
I like it.

280
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,529
I'll go wash my face quickly.

281
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,160
Bong Hee.

282
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:53,309
There's something
I have to tell you.

283
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,180
It's about something very important.

284
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,720
What is it?

285
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,819
Mr. No!

286
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:06,819
Did you have a good sleep?

287
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,130
What are you doing here?
Did you skip school or what?

288
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,230
Why are you here now?

289
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,099
Today is Saturday.

290
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,200
Kids don't have school
on Saturdays these days?

291
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,500
- No, they don't.
- What a great world they live in.

292
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,539
How did you get yourself injured?

293
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:23,910
May I see the wound?

294
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,779
No, you may not.

295
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,609
Just show us. It's not like it'll
get worse if you show it to us.

296
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:31,049
- Let us see it.
- It's not even healed yet... Gosh.

297
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,650
You guys shouldn't be
doing this to him.

298
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:34,880
Bong Hee.

299
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,619
You've been the worst.

300
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,890
- Have I?
- Yes.

301
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:43,789
Jae Hong.

302
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,700
You see that man there, right?
Ask him to show you his scar.

303
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,029
His scar is a lot bigger than mine.

304
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:54,670
I have no interest in him.

305
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:57,170
I have no interest in you either.

306
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,650
By the way, are you ill too?

307
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,950
Me? I'm totally fine.

308
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:07,650
Your face and hair look weird.

309
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:13,190
Hey, you should go home.

310
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,230
That little boy...

311
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,329
has a very good eye.

312
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:20,900
What?

313
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,440
By the way, I really can't wait
to leave the hospital.

314
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:29,869
Being hospitalized
is even more exhausting.

315
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:31,470
Right? I know.

316
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,180

318
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,029
Gosh, you startled me.

319
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,730
I didn't expect to see you here.

320
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,029
You're standing
in front of my office.

321
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,269
Right, this is your office.

322
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,869
How's your head?

323
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:06,480
Are there any delayed symptoms?

324
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:08,880
Symptoms like headaches,
dizziness or memory loss.

325
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,309
Are you experiencing
anything like that?

326
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:12,079
- I am.
- Seriously?

327
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,079
I'm depressed.

328
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,720
Not because of the concussion.

329
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,349
My life is depressing me.

330
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:19,890

Jung Hyun Soo, who made you,
Ji Wook, and Mr. Bang like that,

332
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,759
has been caught, you know.

333
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:27,500
You're right. He won't be able
to escape again.

334
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,099
Of course not.

335
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,599
Oh, right. Take this.

336
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,910
You've been skipping meals
all the time.

337
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,940
You should eat well...

338
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,740
to pull all of those all-nighters.

339
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,450
Okay. Thanks.

340
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,180
I'm off.

341
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:59,000
Gosh, it hurts.

342
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,650
Hey, what are you doing?

343
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:23,819
You absolutely have to stay away
from work until you fully recover.

344
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,359
I'm really okay.
We should have a meeting now.

345
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:28,559
The doctor said that you shouldn't
be working now.

346
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,890
You got discharged
on that condition.

347
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,559
I'm really fine.
I can take care of myself...

348
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,099
I will look after you.
As your co-worker, that is.

349
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,170
- No, Bong Hee.
- No, Mr. No.

350
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,609
I'll feel guilty if you don't
let me take care of you.

351
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:47,480
I'll keep beating myself up thinking
that you got stabbed instead of me.

352
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,710
Shall I do that?

353
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:03,259
Eat the porridge first, then take
your medication with water.

354
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,430
Hey, I...

355
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,200
I don't like porridge.

356
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,339
I'll... I'll help you.

357
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,839
No, it's okay.

358
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,039
No, it must be hard for you.

359
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,609
No, it's okay. I can do it myself.

360
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,119
- Does it sting?
- It's okay.

361
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,430
You're tickling me.

362
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,559
Am I?

363
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,339
I'm really struggling
to hold myself back.

364
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,450
Hey.

365
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,819
I'll do it.

366
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,250
Okay.

367
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:56,940
Nothing is for certain because
it happened too long ago.

368
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,940
However,

369
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,509
there's a possibility that it was
an accidental fire, not arson.

370
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,809
That's the best conclusion
we can arrive at now.

371
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,619
How am I...

372
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,090
supposed to bring all this up
to Bong Hee?

373
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,179
There's something
I have to tell you.

374
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,980
Can you make some time
for me after work today?

375
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,289
Sure, I will.

376
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:18,750
The reason of the fire
still remains to be unknown.

377
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,920
But one thing I'm certain of...

378
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,460
is that your father...

379
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,170
was not an arsonist...

380
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,340
that killed...

381
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
my parents.

382
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,949
Actually, it was the opposite.

383
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:46,949
He saved my life...

384
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:49,619
and passed away...

385
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:53,960
while trying to rescue my parents.

386
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,010
Then...

387
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:13,809
why...

388
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,349
was my dad...

389
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:18,610
accused of killing them?

390
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:21,880
Why on earth did that happen?

391
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,969
It was because of me.

392
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,929
Sorry?

393
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,110
I beg your pardon?

394
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,210
I...

395
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,719
made a mistake
while giving my statement.

396
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,619
I said that your dad is the culprit.

397
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,260
I gave wrong information
in my statement.

398
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,230
Why?

399
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:06,960
Why did you do that?

400
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,300
Answer me.

401
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,300
Tell me why you did such a thing.

402
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,969
Whatever I say will be an excuse.

403
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:16,840
Then go ahead and give me
your excuse.

404
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:18,409
Say something, please.

405
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,710
Do whatever you can
to try to make me understand.

406
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:26,650
Can you recognize him?

407
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,789
This is the man...

408
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,389
who killed your dad...

409
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:36,630
and mom.

410
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:38,059
Okay?

411
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,300
I think...

412
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,599
I had lost my memory temporarily...

413
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,369
due to the shock
from the incident...

414
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,809
back then.

415
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,110
The District Attorney,
Jang Moo Young,

416
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,909
who wrongly charged your dad...

417
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:58,250
had to conceal his mistake.

418
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,050
Hence,

419
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:02,389
he probably blamed him
for the fire...

420
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:05,050
because he was found on the scene.

421
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,920
The prosecution... Back then,
the prosecution...

422
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,530
was even more unforgiving
toward mistakes than they are now.

423
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,630
No, but...

424
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,199
It was that man.

425
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:25,239
He's the culprit.

426
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,750
Whatever excuse I give,
it is ultimately...

427
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,150
all my fault.

428
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,199
I must have...

429
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:03,969
gotten way ahead of myself.

430
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,010
He's not even calling me.

431
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,179
Ji Eun Hyuk, you jerk.

432
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:21,659
Hey, you're home.

00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,429
Hey.

434
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,940
Did you cry?

435
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,239
Darn it. Pretend you didn't
see that at least.

436
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,610
Why are you about to cry too?

437
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,530
Hey, I'm okay.

438
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:03,099
You don't have to cry for me.
I'm not that sad.

439
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,010
Hey, I'm really fine.

440
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,420
- Hey.
- Hey, don't cry.

441
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,460
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry.

442
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:38,969
Eun Hyuk, you've been
nice to me lately.

443
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,940
It's all because of meeting
you coincidentally.

444
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,579
Besides, who knew I had
to carry all these files?

445
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,679
By the way, you are going
to read these files again at home?

446
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,420
Don't you think you're
overworking yourself?

447
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,190
Eun Hyuk.

448
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,420
Yes?

449
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,289
Is it really a coincidence?

450
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:05,360

Yes, we are.

I did the right thing.

461
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,070
Yes, I did.

498
00:46:26,389 --> 00:46:27,389
Yes.

499
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,389
I was going to tell you that...

500
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,429
you should lead a better life.

501
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,630
What?

502
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,469
My dad was...

503
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:40,369
Eun Man Soo.

504
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:45,239
You are...

505
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,909
Eun Man Soo's daughter?

506
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,349
Yes.

507
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,420
He's the scapegoat who you used
to cover up your little mistake.

508
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,289
I'm his daughter.

509
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:59,150
- That was...
- Just listen.

510
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,030
My dad...

511
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,329
was never an arsonist.

512
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:08,760
I...

513
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:12,329
am not the murderer
who killed your son.

514
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:17,039
But you think you are
always right...

515
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:19,739
and that you are never wrong.

516
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:23,380
On top of that, you even fabricated
evidence and persecuted him.

517
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:29,219
Have you thought about
how the family you ruined lived?

518
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,750
Or how my mother lived?

519
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,590
Do you know how hard my life was
because of what you did to me?

520
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,460
You don't know, do you?
You were never interested anyway.

521
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,699
Let me tell you again.

522
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,840
My dad...

523
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:55,239
was an innocent man
who did nothing wrong.

524
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,480
It was you...

525
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,380
who made a mistake.

526
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,159
(Attorney No Ji Wook)

527
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,539
No, don't. There's no need.
I'm fine.

528
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,610
Sit down.

529
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,309
- Bong Hee.
- Mr. No.

530
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,710
Just listen to me, please.

531
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:40,119
Aren't you...

532
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:42,780
sorry?

533
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,329
Yes.

534
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,460
I don't know how to act around you.

535
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:57,829
I know that the DA's mistake
is bigger than yours.

536
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:01,269
That's that. Anyway,

537
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:04,570
it is true that you did make
the false statement...

538
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,780
against my dad.

539
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:11,480
You're right.

540
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,449
So wait for my decision.

541
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,750
Whether I should forgive you,

542
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:20,559
or I should just let things be.

543
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:24,429
Please sit down.

544
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,760
No, it's really okay.

545
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,829
I can do it myself.
Don't worry about it.

546
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,739
All right, then.

547
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:38,909
Wait.

548
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,550
Thanks...

549
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,719
for coming back.

550
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,090
I didn't come back for good.

551
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:00,329
I'm just trying to keep
my feelings from work...

552
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,429
and giving myself time
to sort through my thoughts.

553
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:07,369
You're right, but...

554
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,170
this is more than enough for me.

555
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,650
Just listen to me.

556
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,559
They can settle right away.

557
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,190
Gosh, that's not how it works.

558
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,960
Are you sure you have
decades of experience?

559
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,099
Goodness, that's how things
used to be done back in the days.

560
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:35,860
Can we please get this meeting done?

561
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,900
Yes, please.
That's what I've wanted to say.

562
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,699
Ms. Lack of Evidence, shut it.

563
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,039
Gosh, seriously!

564
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,099
Let's focus on the meeting, please!

565
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:45,070
You guys are so loud.

566
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,309
Hey, don't record this.

567
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:47,840
You're distracting me.

568
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,780
Hey, you should've told us
that you were filming us.

569
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,179
Good. Okay.

570
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,449
I look pretty good.

571
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,219
Okay.

572
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,559
Can we please get this meeting done?

573
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,500
Yes, please.
That's what I've wanted to say.

574
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,800
Hey, shut it.

575
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:13,199
(Smart selection)

576
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,409
Gosh, seriously!
Let's focus on the meeting, please!

577
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,039
Hey, don't record this.

578
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,000
Can you...

579
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:45,730
recognize me?

580
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:54,840
Your memory must've come back.

581
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,019
Yes, thanks to you.

582
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,050
Then you must know this too.

583
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,920
There's no more loophole
for you to escape through.

584
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,989
You're charged with two counts
of attempted murders,

585
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:09,059
including what you did to me.

586
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,829
And I'll be sure to prove that
you killed all those people. So...

587
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:15,130
you better come clean, you scum.

588
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,030
The system in this country
is merciful...

589
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,300
toward those who confess...

590
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,940
and repent their wrongdoings.

591
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,309
But personally,
I don't think scums like you...

592
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:26,639
deserve any mercy.

593
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,880
What was that about?
Are you not totally there yet?

594
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,780
Is that it?
Do you not get what's going on?

595
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,789
No, no. That's not it.

596
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,460
This is just a speculation,

597
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,190
but someone might still
be on my side.

598
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,690
That's what it was about.

599
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,179
(Sunho District Prosecutor's Office)

600
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:16,190
So you've finally decided to talk?

601
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,929
Mr. Jung.

602
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:29,539
First off,

603
00:54:32,139 --> 00:54:33,440
I killed them all.

604
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,980
Whom shall I start with?

605
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,449
Whom shall I talk about first?

606
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,219
We first met through
the Yang Jin Woo case,

607
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:47,389
so shall I start with Jin Woo?

608
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,059
No, no. I take that back.

609
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:52,059
Supa Apartment.
I should start with Supa Apartment.

610
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,800
You've managed to confirm
the identity of only one body...

611
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,099
found in the water tank there,
right?

612
00:54:57,769 --> 00:54:59,199
Shall I tell you
who the other one is?

613
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,340
There's no reason for me to say no.

614
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:05,309
All right.

615
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:08,440
His name is Sung Jae Hyun.

616
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,150
He and Jin Woo went
to the same high school.

617
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:11,250
Go ahead and check it.

618
00:55:13,449 --> 00:55:14,820
- Is that right?
- I'm not done yet.

619
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,050
How dare you cut me off?

620
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:22,420
There was one more.

621
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,260
Was his name Jang Hee Jun?

622
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,960
Jang Hee Jun?

623
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:34,400
I'm pretty sure it was Jang Hee Jun.
Yes, that was his name.

624
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,809
Well... Initially,

625
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:41,010
I had no intention of killing him.

626
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,550
I was working on my stuff
on the rooftop,

627
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:45,010
and someone witnessed it.

628
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,650
That was Eun Bong Hee.

629
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,420
So I went there to kill her,

630
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,090
but I found a drunk guy
instead of her.

631
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,059
I ended up stabbing him
with a knife,

632
00:55:57,429 --> 00:55:58,989
and he collapsed while crying.

633
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,469
"Dad."

634
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,000
"Dad, save me."

635
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:08,769
"Dad, help me."

636
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,239
"I'm terrified."

637
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:14,210
He was saying things like that.

638
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,949
And he kept crying.

639
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:20,750
Gosh, that guy was being such
a crybaby, and I couldn't stand it.

640
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,750
So I stabbed him again
and killed him.

641
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,519
That's what happened.

642
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,590
Hey, Ji Hye.
I'm on my way to your office now.

643
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,559
Yes, okay.

644
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,199
I'm sorry.

645
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,150
I won't accept your apology.

646
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,440
Come with me for a second.

647
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,380
Why?

648
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,820
I'm calling from the HR department
at the Ministry of Justice.

649
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:44,590
I'd like to let you know
that you have...

650
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,389
passed the recruitment exam
for experienced prosecutors.

651
