1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580


2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,510
 Chef and owner of Ristorante, Haneda Ryujiro-san was found murdered in his home. 

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:18,300
 Police have arrested the delivery driver, Inaba Takahiko, aged 31, as prime suspect. 

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,300
He is our first client.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,680
 Officials report that Inaba's DNA was found... 

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,860
He has requested you to be his defense attorney.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,770
Me?

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,150
We ought to turn him down. No one requesting my help is a decent client.

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,420
No, let's take on this case.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,100
It'll do great publicity for us.

11
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,070
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

12
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,360
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,950
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

14
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,980
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:24,430
♫  Here's the love that I long for  ♫

16
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,640
   

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,690
A button left at the scene was found to have your DNA on it.

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,130
There's no use denying cold, hard facts.

19
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,880
I will have you prosecuted for theft and murder.

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,510
Exercising your right to stay silent?

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,060
You wouldn't believe my side of things, even if I spoke.

22
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,420
No one believes me.

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,630
Hello there. How have you been?

24
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,050
Horrible. And you, Attorney Miyashita?

25
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,160
I've been well.

26
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,700
Are you truly dating Haruto?

27
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,200
I am not obligated to answer.

28
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,710
I can't believe it's you, of all people.

29
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,430
The sentiment is mine.

30
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,230
I can't believe his ex is someone so attractive.

31
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,390
Please give me an answer.

32
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,320
We're in a relationship.

33
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,140
So you are lying.

34
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,110
I'm telling the truth.

35
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,860
Let's go.

36
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,240
Are you all right?

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,490
I'd forgotten to breathe.

38
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,660
How is that remotely possible?

39
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,190
You were upset and told me not to pretend to be your girlfriend before.

40
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,280
I can't have my coworker be a liar now, can I?

41
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,480
Oh my gosh, we'll be late.

42
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,230
We already are!

43
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,270
Why did you request that I become your attorney?

44
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,820
If you wanted to evade court, then–

45
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,100
Because you're the only one who can save me now.

46
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,490
I had often frequented Haneda-san's home as part of my job,

47
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,310
but that reason alone is why I've been suspected of murder.

48
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,520
That's why they've placed me here.

49
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,500
No one has taken my side.

50
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,930
And being here terrifies me.

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,610
But I thought you might believe my side of things.

52
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,710
That's why I've requested your help.

53
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,900
 I did not kill him. 

54
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,340
 Tateishi-san, are you doubting me as well? 

55
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,490
 Tateishi-san. Only you can save me now. 

56
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,590
I understand. I will accept your case.

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,620
Thank you.

58
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,320
When the incident occurred, I had been eating lunch at a cafe I frequent.

59
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,740
 All together now. Happy birthday! 

60
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,140
 A couple was celebrating a birthday with friends behind me. 

61
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,200
 I saw they had a cake with candles in it as well. 

62
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,270
 Everyone, say cheese! 

63
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,500
 - Oops, it was a video! 
 - Seriously? 

64
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,800
 Dude, come on! 

65
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,210
The folks around celebrated as well.

66
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,330
I recall everyone was in a jovial mood.

67
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,890
Afterward...

68
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,110
Let's not handle this case.

69
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,810
Why?

70
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,950
His alibi has no solid proof.

71
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,940
The cafe had no security cameras, and he paid in cash.

72
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,290
We can't prove he was ever in that store.

73
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,540
That was the same for my case as well.

74
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,110
Don't let your empathy sway you.

75
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,870
An attorney should be an ally to their client.

76
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,520
This is why I hate attorneys.

77
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,540
- But you're one yourself. 
 - That's your–

78
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,240
- He may be innocent. 
 - There's no proof.

79
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,320
If you think clients are innocent, our job is to believe them and do our best.

80
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,870
You already believe him, right?

81
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,030
Yes, I'm an attorney.

82
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,200
That's why I truly hate attorneys.

83
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,320
Our conversation is getting nowhere, no thanks to you.

84
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,100
Why won't you answer my calls?

85
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,450
Ren, are you ignoring me too?

86
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,160
What's up with you two?

87
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,890
Sorry.

88
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,600
I'm being immature.

89
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,590
I know it's my fault, but you share the blame, too, Ren.

90
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,410
It's been a while.

91
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,430
Yes, it has.

92
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,330
See you around.

93
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,240
If we ever cross paths again, it'll be a coincidence.

94
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,580
   

95
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,900
I'd like to ask about this individual. He was sitting in that seat, back there.

96
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,560
Was he?

97
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,530
I unfortunately don't recall anyone there.

98
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,160
- Excuse me. 
 - I'll be right with you.

99
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,060
My apologies.

100
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,590
 I thought you might believe my side of things. 

101
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,170
Thank you again.

102
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,140
Your son is turning 28 this year?

103
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,650
Happy birthday.

104
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,890
Thank you.

105
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,050
You.

106
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,950
How dare you smile without a care?

107
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,890
Do you realize what day it is today?

108
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,260
If my son were alive...

109
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,110
I... I would be celebrating with him.

110
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,220
I would be grasping his hand.

111
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,100
And yet...

112
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,230
Don't smile in my presence ever again.

113
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,930
Sir, I am innocent.

114
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,140
Although I know you won't believe anything I say,

115
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,120
your threats won't change the fact I am innocent.

116
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,810
And your action just now counts as assault. A crime, punishable by law.

117
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,950
Unless a true culprit is found, you will always be guilty.

118
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,090
I will continue to pressure your firm, mark my words.

119
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,340
I've found proof of his alibi.

120
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,660
This couple celebrated a birthday on March 23rd, the day of the incident.

121
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,050
Just as he testified.

122
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,220
This isn't enough to solidify his alibi.

123
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,720
But it's enough to believe his statement.

124
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,250
Did something happen while you were out?

125
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,900
No, nothing at all.

126
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,150
Why won't you talk to me?

127
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,240
I don't wish to bring it up.

128
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,340
Are you all right?

129
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,300
Then I won't press.

130
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,220
It's unfortunate they wouldn't talk.

131
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,850
You were asking the wrong questions.

132
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,610
Not me, but you were, Tateishi-san.

133
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,250
No, you...

134
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,150
Yikes.

135
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,090
Let's run.

136
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,320
It doesn't look like it'll stop any time soon.

137
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,080
It sure doesn't.

138
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,130
Why do you look so happy?

139
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,850
Because it's a beautiful sight.

140
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,170
I hope we win.

141
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,470
Not hope. We will win.

142
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,020
Right.

143
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,500
Are you all right?

144
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,180
I'm fine, thank you.

145
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:14,160
In an effort to steal Haneda Ryujiro's valuables, the accused murdered him.

146
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,780
He was stabbed several times with a 12 cm long blade

147
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,220
and died instantly due to major blood loss.

148
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:28,730
The accused then stole three watches and several branded bags, totaling 10 million yen.

149
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,640
Accused, I will now ask about the charges the prosecution has made against you.

150
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Do they speak the truth?

151
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,620
Are there any errors in their statement?

152
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,140
Defense, may we hear your opinion on this matter?

153
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,100
Judge, I believe our accused is innocent.

154
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,710
The accused has no motive to commit this offense.

155
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,090
A murder with theft as the reason needs no motive.

156
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,850
But for that reason to check out,

157
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,950
the theft must have happened.

158
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,940
Valuables have disappeared from the murder site.

159
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,170
There's no proof the accused was involved.

160
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,480
Because these items were not found in his home or his office.

161
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,200
Defense, are you suggesting the accused was not a thief?

162
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,480
Yes, Sir. Our conclusion now relies heavily on this "theft."

163
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,610
But if the accused committed no robbery,

164
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,420
then the reason for this murder falls through completely.

165
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,380
That is all from the Defense.

166
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,190
You played the part of an attorney to a tee.

167
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,350
Of course.

168
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,450
You okay?

169
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,270
I'm fine. I just became a bit dizzy.

170
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,080
Here, grab my arm.

171
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,260
Sorry.

172
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,060
I'm going to say something very immature.

173
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,720
I'm not one to fall ill,

174
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,810
so while this might not be the time, I am a bit jealous of her.

175
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,490
So am I.

176
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,560
I envy the fact he can offer help like that with ease.

177
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,540
Shall we?

178
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,450
Thank you.

179
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,490
- Are you okay? 
 - Thanks.

180
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,290
Please give us a moment.

181
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,270
- Thanks again. 
 - Sure.

182
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,760
Are you sure you don't need to see a doctor?

183
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,660
No, some medicine will pick me right back up.

184
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,100
You know that works for me, right?

185
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,960
Let's call it here.

186
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,810
Right.

187
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,850
Wait.

188
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,320
Stay with me a bit longer.

189
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,890
I'm sorry I hurt you back then.

190
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,570
I just wanted you to actually "see" me.

191
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,740
I know I'm in no position to say this.

192
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,740
But I want to stay with you, Haruto.

193
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,760
Maybe I'll clean up a bit.

194
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,930
 The place is already spotless. 

195
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,320
I'll clean out the fridge instead.

196
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,990
 Also spotless. 

197
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,740
 You're... 

198
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,410
 no trouble. 

199
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,230
 Let me hire you. 

200
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,280
I'm back.

201
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,720
I thought you weren't ever coming back.

202
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,660
I'm here now.

203
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,140
♫  I do things like listening to your favorite songs like you do  ♫

204
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,450
♫  Or tucking a bookmark into a novel that I don't usually read  ♫

205
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,170
I love you.

206
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,420
♫  The color of my hair and my fashion  ♫

207
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,190
I'm in love with you.

208
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,580
♫  I changed everything for you, to suit you  ♫

209
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,390
♫  The cheesy lines like a drama  ♫

210
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,210
♫  Don't suit me  ♫

211
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,350
♫  But don't laugh at me even if I try to act like a grown-up  ♫

212
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,910
Don't...

213
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,350
♫  Kiss your heart  ♫

214
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,270
Don't fall in love with me.

215
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,870
♫  But you seem close and yet far away  ♫

216
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:44,130


217
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,490
Why not?

218
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,830
I don't even get a reason?

219
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,350
I must ask you for a favor.

220
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:25,950
Please hug me, and I'll give you up.

221
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,390
   
 I will return to the way I was, before I ever loved you. 

222
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,340
 Did something happen between you and Haruto? 

223
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,620
 Inaba has a criminal record. 

224
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,970
 You'll defend someone like him? 

225
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,330
 I only did what I needed to. 

226
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,330
 Is Miyashita-san currently in a relationship with anyone? 

227
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,380
 She's quite the wonderful individual. 

228
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,120
 I think I'll invite her to eat out sometime. 

229
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,750
 Will I come to regret this decision? 

230
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,410
 Just five minutes... 

231
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,740
 Could you stay by my side?
