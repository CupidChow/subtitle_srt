1
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:46,549
Wait, it's Ji Wook.

2
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,049
Hey, Ji Wook, I didn't know
you were going for a run today.

3
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,689
You should've let me know you were
going for a run. I could've joined.

4
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:56,229
It's been ages since I jogged
with you. It's nice, isn't it?

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,399
But I actually ran a lot today.

6
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,969
Let's slow down a bit.

7
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,569
Ji Wook? Let's slow down a bit.

8
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,480
Hey, go away. Get lost.

9
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,519
The day is...

10
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,319
already approaching again.

11
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,569
Hey, let me join you.

12
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,540
Get lost.

13
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,739
- I don't want to.
- Just get lost.

14
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,109
No, I don't want to.
I'm going to run with you forever.

15
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,310
Get lost forever.

16
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,510
Let me be with you.

17
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,750
Let go of me.

18
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,719
Come on. Give me a piggyback ride.

19
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,489
Seriously. Just get lost.

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,189
Why are you so fast?

21
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,430
(The day of visiting...)

22
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,800
(The day of visiting Dad)

23
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:28,289
Why did you follow me here?

24
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,090
I want to have a meal you cook.
It's delicious.

25
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,430
What's that look on your face?
Why are you smiling this early?

26
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,270
Two men came home sweating
after their work out.

27
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,439
This sure is a fantasy of all women.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,569
- This is nice.
- It's nice, isn't it?

29
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,639
Why is it nice? You just
need one man. Got it?

30
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,939
2 is better than 1.

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,879
- Hey, you need to get out. Go.
- Why? Hold on.

32
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,250
Should I go?

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,219
No, why should you?
Let's have breakfast together.

34
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,849
Hey, this is my house,
and that's my food.

35
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,759
Hey, Bong Hee, come here.

36
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,530
Come and help me.
Stop smiling at him.

37
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,759
Hold on. Do you think
I can be of help?

38
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:16,129
Well... Watch me cook.

39
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,340
Okay.

40
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,800
Me too. I'll watch you too.

41
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,659
You know how I asked you to
delve into Jung Hyun Soo's past?

42
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:41,389
I think I'd be best to put it
on the back burner for now.

43
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,789
Why?

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,060
He...

45
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,300
found out.

46
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,370
Why do you continue to keep an eye
on me and doubt me?

47
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:53,270
What did I do wrong?
What did I do?

48
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,539
I really like you guys, but why
do you keep doing this to me?

49
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,449
I didn't know he was going
to find this out. I'm sorry.

50
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,180
Don't be. He could've gotten the
wind of it if he wanted to.

51
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:07,919
It's just that...

52
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,289
I have a bad feeling about this.

53
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,330
Let's stop officially
digging his past here.

54
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,730
Did you hear me?

55
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:23,300
Yes, I did.

56
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:43,920
That jerk. If that jerk
didn't do what he did...

57
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,949
(Late No Young Suk)

58
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,589
You could have watched your son
growing up...

59
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,959
all you want.

60
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,959
Honey. My sweetie.

61
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,389
(Late Eun Man Soo)

62
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,160
Don't you worry about us.

63
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,899
We are doing just fine.

64
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,399
That's right, Dad. We are fine.

65
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,040
Your daughter is such a cool lawyer.

66
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,279
(Lawyer License ID,
Eun Bong Hee)

67
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,209
A lawyer who represents...

68
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,180
wrongfully charged defendants.

69
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,750
I'm not a good lawyer now,
but I'm planning to become one.

70
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,740
Wait. Is she...

71
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,209
- What is it?
- What?

72
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
It's nothing.

73
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,810
I must be seeing things again.

74
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:25,480
Goodness, I can't believe you're
doing that even here.

75
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,689
What did I do, Bok Ja?

76
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,089
She was...

77
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,160
- Thanks to you, I'm never bored.
- What?

78
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,800
I'll be waiting for you.
Be careful when you come.

79
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,129
(Be careful when you come.)

80
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,040
Enjoy your drink.

81
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,310
Don't do that.

82
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,850
Who are you?

83
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,110
Don't do what you are
planning to do.

84
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,149
Get out of my way.

85
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,819
You jerk.

86
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,689
Get up. Have you gone mad?

87
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,899
Article 260 of Criminal Law,
first-degree assault.

88
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:18,370
Article 266 of Criminal Law,
personal injury due to negligence.

89
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,370
Shoot.

90
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:23,439
Okay.

91
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,250
Article 366 of Criminal Law,

92
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,720
damage of property charge.

93
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,320
Stop it!

94
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
What?

95
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,860
Lastly, since you fought in a cafe,

96
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,690
Article 314 of Criminal Law,
obstruction of business is applied.

97
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,100
That just happened.

98
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,730
Besides, you are on probation
for the same charges.

99
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,970
Yes, I am. It sort of
happened that way.

100
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,110
When the assault is mutual,
you won't be charged...

101
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,840
as long as you can settle
with the other party,

102
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,179
but you weren't able to settle it.

103
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,149
No, I couldn't.

104
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,120
You started the dispute, right?

105
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,580
Yes, that sort of happened that way.

106
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,049
Why did it happen that way? Why?

107
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,289
Why, Mr. So Jung Ha? Why do you
keep letting things happen this way?

108
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:14,159
Let me ask you
why you let this happen.

109
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,860
Mr. No, you are an attorney.

110
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,299
You are not a prosecutor,
but an attorney.

111
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:19,659
I know that I'm...

112
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,179
I can't work like this.
This is so uncomfortable.

113
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,220
All right. What I'm trying
to tell you is...

114
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,519
that I need understandable reasons
for me to settle this case,

115
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,559
ask for a plea bargain,
and plead for mercy in court.

116
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:50,190
You all know this, don't you?
I'm asking you to tell us...

117
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:51,799
why you did this.

118
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,629
I can see what's ahead of me.

119
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,470
Yes, we all can see what is
ahead of us as well.

120
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,870
I can see what's going to happen
in the future.

121
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,139
It's pizza.

122
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,980
Excuse me? Pizza?

123
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:09,950
Guys!

124
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,720
Let's have some pizza!

125
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,759
What?

126
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,230
To sum up, this is what he said.

127
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,970
He can sometimes foresee what will
happen in the future.

128
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,210
That's what happened that day.

129
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,750
The guy who came in...

130
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,580
was going to stab the part-timer.

131
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,220
We must be getting crazy clients...

132
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,559
because the lawyers working here
are crazy too.

133
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,169
He mentioned that the opponent
was about to stab the part-timer.

134
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,629
But that's just our client's
opinion.

135
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,039
We checked the CCTV at the cafe and
asked the witnesses who were there.

136
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,669
There was no evidence to prove that
the opponent was carrying a weapon.

137
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,379
He's right. He had nothing in
his hands.

138
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,639
But So Jung Ha suddenly blocked
his way,

139
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,179
and that's when the fight started.

140
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,419
Maybe he's lying or has a mental
disease.

141
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:19,850
Maybe he's delusional.

142
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,549
He could be one of those people...

143
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:24,019
who think they're aliens or
have supernatural powers.

144
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:25,659
He foresaw that we were going to
bring pizza.

145
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,929
He could've smelled it before
we did.

146
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,360
I'm going to drop this case.

147
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
No, you can't.

148
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:34,200
We must take every single
client that comes to us.

149
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,529
Of course, you must.

150
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,740
I pay your monthly salary and cost
of maintenance for this office.

151
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,610
Do you know how much money
I spend every month because of that?

152
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,009
Especially...

153
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:44,580
you two.

154
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,009
Our meeting ends here.

155
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,350
Thank you for the pizza.

156
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,450
Good work, everyone.

157
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,450
Wait!

158
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,159
This is the same evidence that
the prosecution has.

159
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,370
It is. That's because I sent them
the CCTV footage.

160
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,730
There really was no knife.

161
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,899
There was.

162
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,139
There was?

163
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,940
A knife? Where?

164
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,179
There's no knife.

165
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,740
Well, it was inside his jacket.

166
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,809
We searched him after he got
arrested. That's when we found it.

167
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,350
I'm sure he had a knife.

168
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:33,389
If I didn't stop him,
he would've taken it out.

169
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,629
The opponent really had a knife.

170
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:39,899
How could he have known that?

171
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,830
I think he really can foresee
the future.

172
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,039
Maybe he's a shaman or something.

173
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,570
You know those people who get
possessed by a spirt and stuff?

174
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,409
Maybe he got lucky and saw it.

175
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,669
That's not possible.

176
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,039
I've analyzed the CCTV footage.

177
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,480
The opponent never took out
the knife.

178
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,850
Hey, Mr. Bang.

179
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,149
Do you believe in shamanism?

180
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,490
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

181
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,919
You even believed in monks.

182
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,019
"The woman who ruined my life
was Eun..."

183
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,360
A monk? What are you talking about?

184
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,000
It's nothing.

185
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,529
It doesn't look like it's nothing.

186
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,899
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

187
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,340
Hey, Ji Wook. Our client's here.

188
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:20,340
- You're here.
- Hello.

189
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,769
Be careful with the cup.

190
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,080
Our crazy client is here...

191
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,419
I was one step too slow.

192
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,639
There's a probability that...

193
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,009
two people will soon die.

194
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:00,509
(In This Limited World)

195
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,360
By the way,

196
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,230
where is everyone?

197
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,990
Chairman Byun...

198
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,200
thinks he's definitely the one
who's going to die soon.

199
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,659
So he went to get a checkup.

200
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,169
Mr. Bang went to get a lucky charm.

201
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,539
You're probably most curious
about Ji Wook,

202
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,480
but I'm not going to tell you.

203
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,350
My gosh.

204
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,929
The day after his dad died...

205
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,629
is the day Ji Wook and
his parents...

206
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,899
had promised to go on a
family picnic.

207
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,899
So every year, Ji Wook goes on
a picnic by himself.

208
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,240
And every time he does, me,
Chairman Byun, and Yoo Jung...

209
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,009
We...

210
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,179
never once disturbed Ji Wook.

211
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
I...

212
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,490
also have a similar experience.

213
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,399
So I know how he must feel.

214
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,299
To be honest,
it feels really lonely.

215
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:04,940
To be honest,

216
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,840
it doesn't feel good to be alone.

217
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:08,909
He might...

218
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,309
actually want someone to
disturb him.

219
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:33,230
I was coincidentally passing by,

220
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,970
and I thought maybe I should try
disturbing you.

221
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,940
Come here and sit down.
Come and disturb me.

222
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,460
Here.

223
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,490
They're documents regarding
psychiatric evaluation.

224
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:06,529
Read it carefully and see if
So Jung Ha fits in any category.

225
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,930
Okay.

226
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,200
You seem a bit dissatisfied
these days.

227
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,740
Did you come here to slack off
or something?

228
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,039
- Of course, not.
- Okay.

229
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,609
- Let's work hard.
- Okay.

230
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:37,460
That's great. Keep going.

231
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,210
I don't have a lot of memories about
my late dad,

232
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:55,549
but one of them is a bicycle.

233
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,049
He said he would buy me one...

234
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,319
and teach me how to ride it.

235
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:02,849
Then he passed away.

236
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,319
Maybe that's why...

237
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,730
I feel happy whenever I see
kids of that age.

238
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,000
Let's go.

239
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,670
I'll teach you.

240
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Pardon?

241
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,240
- No, it's okay.
- Don't worry.

242
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
It's not that hard.

243
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,680
That's not it.

244
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Here. Come on.

245
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,509
Gosh, wait.

246
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,450
- You just need to go slowly.
- Okay.

247
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,880
I'll hold the bicycle from behind.

248
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,750
So try pushing...

249
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,859
- the pedal slowly.
- Should I push it now?

250
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,519
- Okay, I'm going to go now.
- Okay.

251
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,529
- Like this?
- I'm holding the bicycle,

252
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:42,960
- so don't be nervous.
- Like this?

253
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,029
- Do it comfortably.
- I'm going to make a left turn.

254
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:46,359
- Okay, try doing that.
- Okay.

255
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,759
Good. You're doing great.

256
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,670
- That's right.
- Like this.

257
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,400
- Try turning one more time.
- I'm going to turn left again.

258
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,769
- Okay, go.
- Like this?

259
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:53,900
That's right.

260
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,170
You're doing great. Good.

261
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,309
Wait a second.

262
00:18:58,309 --> 00:18:59,380
Why? Is it too hard?

263
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,500
Why? What's wrong?

264
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,529
Excuse me.

265
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:27,240
Can you report him to the
subway security center for me?

266
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Okay.

267
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,970
You're disgusting!

268
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,109
Hey!

269
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,220
You were the guy who touched
my bottom, weren't you?

270
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,089
Hey, he's trying to run away.

271
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:46,460
Don't you dare run away.

272
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,460
Don't run away.

273
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,460
- Hey, hey.
- Don't you dare escape.

274
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,599
I guess she already knew
how to ride a bicycle.

275
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,069
My gosh, don't come near me.

276
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,640
Go away. Don't come.

277
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,680
My gosh.

278
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,049
Go away. Don't follow me.

279
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:17,119
Come over here.
Where do you think you're going?

280
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,819
- Gosh, no. Stop.
- You little...

281
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,960
Give me your camera. Give me that.

282
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,089
- No, I can't.
- Gosh!

283
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:23,390
- Give it to me.
- No!

284
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,230
My memory card...

285
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:27,329
It's mine.

286
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,400
Good grief, you still haven't
given up your old habit?

287
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,440
I don't like living like this
either.

288
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,710
I bet. You should've been kept
behind bars for longer.

289
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,079
My goodness.

290
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,450
Oh, right.

291
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:46,680
You went through such a rough patch.

292
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:49,420
I saw everything in the news.

293
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,859
You don't need to bring that up.

294
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,289
A few murder incidents...

295
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,289
have happened
in that apartment building.

296
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,099
On the rooftop, you know.

297
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,500
That's why I moved to a different
neighborhood right away.

298
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,039
I was scared.

299
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,509
Gosh. For goodness' sake.

300
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,029
Oh, right. You're actually
better at biking than I am.

301
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,670
I taught myself after my dad passed
away. Was I in elementary school?

302
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:42,839
But I had forgotten it all.
I remembered it thanks to you...

303
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,309
because you were such
a good teacher.

304
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:45,380
Cut it out.

305
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,150
A few murder incidents...

306
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,220
have happened
in that apartment building.

307
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,960
On the rooftop, you know.

308
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:03,359
That's why I moved to a different
neighborhood right away.

309
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,859
I was scared.

310
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:18,109
The rooftop?

311
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:21,039
The rooftop?

312
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,450
I think I witnessed a murder.

313
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,579
It's dangerous.

314
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,460
That night, I was observing...

315
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,390
the stars in the sky as I always do.

316
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,900
On the day that Hee Jun got killed,
I was...

317
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:45,470
Well... This is what you told me.

318
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,700
Was it around 12:30am?

319
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,769
I looked out the window
because I was feeling a bit hot.

320
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,910
I couldn't see anything
because I wasn't wearing my glasses.

321
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,680
I just felt the cool breeze,
and that was it.

322
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,450
What if she saw something...

323
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,019
but didn't even know
that she saw it...

324
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,660
No way.

325
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,329
Let's check. That's the only way
we can find out.

326
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,430
Okay.

327
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:24,509
This neighborhood hasn't
really changed at all.

328
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,640
A redevelopment plan
has been in talks since then.

329
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,009
Are there still people living here?

330
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,519
I'm not sure. I think most of them
were forced out back then.

331
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,519
I see.

332
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,920
We should check
over there first, right?

333
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,359
Yes.

334
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,240
You two are always together,
aren't you?

335
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,170
- I told you...
- What?

336
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,849
to mind your own business,
didn't I? You little...

337
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,910
What?

338
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,420
You have hair on your face.
Wasn't it tickling you?

339
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,720
Goodness.

340
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,220
Were you scared?

341
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,690
- Me?
- You look scared.

342
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,329
- Not at all.
- Don't lie.

343
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,430
I'm not lying.

344
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,500
What's wrong with those two?

345
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
- What are you talking about?
- I think you were scared.

346
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:22,829
- You have hair...
- Don't even.

347
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,769
Thanks to her, there's not
a single boring day.

348
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,470
It's fun.

349
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,740
I feel like you're trying
to get back at me.

350
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,410
Think whatever you want.

351
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:39,680
Are you here for
the reinvestigation of the case?

352
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Yes.

353
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:43,849
Okay, good luck.

354
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,059
Bong Hee, let's go.

355
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:47,319
Okay.

356
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:50,559
Yoo Jung, let's go.

357
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
All right.

358
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,079
Bong Hee.

359
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,990
Stay here.

360
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,299
If...

361
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:09,140
I witnessed something without even
realizing that I saw it,

362
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,609
and that's why Hee Jun
died like that,

363
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,349
and I had to go through
everything I've been through,

364
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,180
I think both Hee Jun and I
suffered so unfairly.

365
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,549
It'll be okay.

366
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,819
I took care of it perfectly.

367
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,299
Well, I'll head in.

368
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,089
Can I come in for a second?

369
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,460
Well...

370
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,069
- Sure.
- Thanks.

371
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,509
I failed to carry out my duties
properly as a prosecutor.

372
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,079
What I mean is...

373
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,619
I should've found it back then.

374
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,519
Had I done that...

375
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,819
You're so helpless.

376
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:06,759
You always apologize as you can't
keep personal feelings from work.

377
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,059
You keep trying to seduce me using
how you used to be my mentor.

378
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,960
That's not true. I'm totally keeping
my personal feelings at bay now.

379
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,299
The apology was purely about work.

380
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,869
We've already let our personal
feelings get in the way. Hence,

381
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,599
I'll change my plan to play
hard to get for a bit longer...

382
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,470
and give you my answer.

383
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,440
The answer to your confession.

384
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,450
I'll give it to you now.

385
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,099
Thanks.

386
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,430
Gosh.

387
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:53,539
I haven't given you my answer yet.

388
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,970
Come on. Tell me.

389
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:57,609
- Not today.
- What?

390
00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:01,079
I want to pick a day so that we can
go somewhere and do it properly.

391
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:02,980
Then shall we go out in the evening?

392
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,650
Not today.
How about the day after tomorrow?

393
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:09,089
Tomorrow. Let's do it
tomorrow, okay? Tomorrow.

394
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,690
Tomorrow... Sure.

395
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:13,990
Great. Tomorrow it is.

396
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,490
It'll be tomorrow, right?

397
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,630
It's happening tomorrow, right?

398
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,700
By the way,
you're such a pro at this.

399
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,769
I'm using the negotiation skills
I've learned from you.

400
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:30,769
Right, we're certainly failing
to keep our personal feelings away.

401
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,839
Bong Hee.

402
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,809
You're great.

403
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:03,940
All right. Today's agenda is...

404
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,710
the defense strategy for your cases
and requests regarding...

405
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,710
Are you two...

406
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,420
seeing each other?

407
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,450
Are you seeing each other?

408
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,690
No, we're not.

409
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,289
You know what?

410
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,400
I want you to see each other.

411
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,529
Mr. Byun must have
actually been liking you.

412
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,099
Gosh, this is so unexpected.

413
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:34,440
It's so that I can oppose
them dating!

414
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:38,170
They need to date for me
to oppose to their relationship.

415
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,240
I'm not going to accept them
until the day I die.

416
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,750
I'm going to throw the water glass
and throw money on you too!

417
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,579
Then I will dodge
the glass quickly...

418
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:47,079
and accept the money with accuracy.

419
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,220
So are you saying that you are going
to date him no matter what?

420
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,990
- You told us to.
- That was irony. Don't you know?

421
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,890
By the way, what makes
this your business?

422
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:57,130
What?

423
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,660
Why isn't this my business?

424
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:04,000
You are banned from attending
meetings from now on.

425
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,970
Because of you, we can never
get anywhere with our meetings.

426
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,970
I second that.

427
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,210
Today's meeting is ruined too.

428
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:10,809
Gosh.

429
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,109
My head. Good grief,
I have a headache.

430
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,490
I'll give you my answer...

431
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,529
to your confession.

432
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,970
I want to pick a day so that we can
go somewhere and do it properly.

433
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:11,700
Does this look too formal?

434
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,740
Should I change?

435
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:22,450
- This is it.
- This is it.

436
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:47,069
Ms. Eun.

437
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,740
What a coincidence.

438
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,210
I was delivering some packages.

439
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,750
- I'm sorry.
- I'll pick these up.

440
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,819
No, I'll do it.

441
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,650
Here you go.

442
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,920
Oh, no. Do you think they are
ruined?

443
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:39,759
They are fine.

444
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:41,789
Here.

445
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,730
That's a relief.

446
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,260
Don't pressure yourself.
Just try to recall.

447
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,690
The guy who was going to make
a report didn't look like him?

448
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,869
I'm not sure.

449
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,269
Then...

450
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:29,539
what about this guy?

451
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:34,510
Wait! I think it must be him.
He looks familiar.

452
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,250
This is the guy?

453
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,750
Yes. He looks familiar.
I think it's him.

454
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,730
Sir,

455
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,960
I won't visit you
or cause any harm to you.

456
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,429
Just tell me if this is true.

457
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,869
The guy who supposedly
made a report...

458
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,900
is the guy I was
with the other day, right?

459
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:05,239
It's the guy in the photo whom
you said wasn't the right guy.

460
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,639
Sir?

461
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:11,449
Sir?

462
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,239
You have three kids, right?

463
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,710
How can all of them be so pretty?

464
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:42,409
How did you...

465
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,110
This is such a common blackmailing
technique, but it works every time.

466
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:48,219
Am I scary?

467
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:50,289
Are you scared of me?

468
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,500
I'm going to tell you
who made the report.

469
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,570
It's him.

470
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:10,440
Take a good look at him.

471
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,380
- Did you have a good look at him?
- Yes.

472
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,679
Give it back.

473
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:17,980
Darn it.

474
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,019
I can't do that.

475
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,090
No, it's not.

476
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,329
That doesn't prove that
Jung Hyun Soo is the real murderer.

477
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,199
Listening to the same song
doesn't make him a murderer.

478
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,969
It could be a mere coincidence.

479
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,650
There is no way...

480
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,389
it could be a coincidence.

481
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,860
Ms. Eun.

482
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,369
Breathe and think clearly.

483
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:21,840
Bong Hee, you have a brain.

484
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,250
Use your brain.

485
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,449
- This is my conjecture.
- Ms. Eun,

486
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,659
I thought that you might be
the only ray of hope I have.

487
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:38,059
He approached me on purpose
as he earned my sympathy.

488
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,869
He was checking
if I recognized him or not.

489
00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:59,820
If this is all true...

490
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,550
Due to fabricated evidence,

491
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,750
an innocent man was framed
as a murderer.

492
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:08,019
Who upholds the right of such a man?

493
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:10,360
It was me...

494
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,829
who got the murderer involved...

495
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,769
and made Ji Wook...

496
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,739
to defend a murderer.

497
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,880
You shouldn't recognize me.

498
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,309
If you do, I have to get rid of you.

499
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,920
Darn it.

500
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,869
It's Ji Wook.

501
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,710
Don't say hi to him.

502
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:33,309
He doesn't even like you.

503
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,110
But that doesn't mean
I shouldn't say hi.

504
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:43,550
I'm already embarrassed.

505
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,360
Do you have business at the court?

506
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,000
No, I have an appointment here.

507
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,869
- Can I sit down?
- No, you can't.

508
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,610
I wasn't planning to do anything.

509
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:08,309
I was just going to talk to you...

510
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,250
about work.

511
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,250
I see. I'm really sorry, but I have
a very important appointment...

512
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:32,329
I'm sorry.

513
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,840
But I need to use Prosecutor Cha.

514
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:36,409
I need to use her as an excuse.

515
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,809
I'm sorry.

516
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,380
We should go too.

517
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,050
Okay.

518
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,750
Are you okay?

519
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,130
Wait.

520
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:00,900
Why did you just leave?

521
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,769
You didn't misunderstand anything,
did you?

522
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:07,440
No.

523
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:10,510
But I keep seeing you two together,

524
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,110
and it doesn't feel that great.

525
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,139
Okay, I'll be careful from now on.

526
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,380
No. You don't need to be careful.

527
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:25,090
I changed my mind.

528
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,989
I'm not going to give you an answer
today.

529
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:28,920
I'm going to continue to play
hard to get.

530
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,659
Okay, that's fine.

531
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,030
I'm okay with that.

532
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,530
But you don't...

533
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,599
look so well.

534
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,500
I think you should worry about
yourself.

535
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,269
Bong Hee, what I mean is,

536
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,710
I want you to tell me...

537
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,340
what happened to you.

538
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,610
I just suddenly felt pressured
to accept...

539
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,110
your feelings for me.

540
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:54,150
I started to feel a bit
uncomfortable.

541
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,449
That's all.

542
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
You said...

543
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:04,360
you were going to respect
my decision.

544
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:08,500
Please respect...

545
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,730
my feelings...

546
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,730
and my decision.

547
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:13,739
Bye, then.

548
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,550
Bong Hee.

549
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,309
Mr. Ji.

550
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,650
I'm sorry.

551
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,519
I really wanted to talk to someone,

552
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:06,789
but the only person I could think of
was you.

553
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:10,130
Good.

554
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,199
You did a good job by calling me.

555
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,869
I'm really scared right now.

556
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:21,070
This is how I felt...

557
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,809
when Hee Jun died,

558
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,309
and I got accused of being
the murderer.

559
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:29,510
I felt like I did something wrong,

560
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,349
but I couldn't figure out
what it was.

561
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:33,550
That was how I felt.

562
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,949
But right now,

563
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,690
I'm more scared than...

564
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,260
when Hee Jun died.

565
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:48,300
Back then, I just had to handle
the situation by myself.

566
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:52,469
But now, I have precious people
around me.

567
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,440
I have Mr. No.

568
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,639
The more loved ones I have,

569
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:02,139
the more scared I get, Mr. Ji.

570
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,219
You're talking about
Jung Hyun Soo, right?

571
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:14,489
You know that I'm quick-witted.

572
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,679
A picture of a magpie or tiger
can help us repel bad luck.

573
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,949
It also says that beating a gong
could help,

574
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,619
but we can't really do that
right now.

575
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,090
He said two people among us
will die.

576
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,059
One of them is me.

577
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,659
Right? It has to be me, right?

578
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,699
Do you know that you've been saying
that for the past couple of days?

579
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:55,329
Whether it's the age or whatnot,

580
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:58,130
- it has to be me.
- There's an order in birth,

581
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,400
but that's not the case for death.

582
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:02,170
I can't just sit here.

583
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:03,539
Where are you going?

584
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:04,670
I'm going to buy a gong.

585
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,690
Is something bothering you?

586
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:21,519
"What could be the reason?"

587
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:24,289
That's what I was thinking.

588
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:25,559
Sorry?

589
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,559
What reason?

590
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,030
Well...

591
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,570
she's not the type to do such a
thing because of a misunderstanding.

592
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:35,239
What is going on with her?

593
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,840
I wonder what happened.

594
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:01,429
I'm sure there was an umbrella here.

595
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:21,780
You're not going to refuse
my kindness...

596
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,719
just because you decided to
reject me, right?

597
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:31,960
Let's go.

598
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,730
What do you think about...

599
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,300
spending time together
to be honest with each other?

600
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:14,699
If there's...

601
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,469
anything that we couldn't tell
each other,

602
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,340
let's try telling that today.

603
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:22,440
If you refuse,

604
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:24,980
I'll say it first.

605
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,280
No.

606
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,829
I don't want to do anything
right now.

607
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:42,230
There's a lot on my mind.

608
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:47,500
Let's talk once my head becomes
clear.

609
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:00,980
Okay. I'll give you time.

610
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,349
Until then,

611
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,420
should I treat you as a coworker?

612
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,260
That would be more comfortable,
right?

613
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,030
Okay, let's do that.

614
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,239
The melody.

615
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,809
The owner of the banner store.

616
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,980
The pervert who witnessed
the murder.

617
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,289
(The owner of the banner store)

618
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,429
Let's go meet him first.

619
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,480
Why are you so startled?

620
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:44,619
That's because you suddenly
showed up out of nowhere.

621
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:46,659
I wouldn't have been startled
had I known it was you.

622
00:49:49,059 --> 00:49:51,190
I see. Is that so?

623
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:52,860
Of course.

624
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,460
By the way, what brings you here?

625
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,369
What do you think?
I had a delivery in the area.

626
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,139
I was hoping to see you today.

627
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:03,469
I'm glad I caught you like this.

628
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:06,710
Today must be my lucky day,
don't you think?

629
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,349
I'm flattered.

630
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,690
Ms. Eun.

631
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:21,190
Mr. Ji.

632
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,159
Did you call the courier service?

633
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,199
I feel like we've gotten very close
since we see each other so often.

634
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:29,199
I know, right?

635
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:33,170
Where are you going this late?

636
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,340
Don't work at night. Just do it
tomorrow morning.

637
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,269
Let's go in. Give it to me.

638
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,380
Do you want to come in?

639
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,940
No, it's all right. Go on in.

640
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,579
Feel free to come by anytime.
Our clients are like family to us.

641
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,110
Do you think he came
to figure out what I'm thinking?

642
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:13,110
Probably.

643
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,380
By the way,

644
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:17,280
are you not going to...

645
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:20,320
tell Ji Wook?

646
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,980
I should tell him.

647
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:25,719
But I can't...

648
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:29,659
I can't bring myself to tell him
that we might have gotten...

649
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,329
a murderer acquitted.

650
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:37,429
Ji Wook.

651
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,969
Hey, guys.
Continue your conversation.

652
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:19,909
What is going on?

653
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:26,750
Hence, the prosecution would
like to charge the defendant...

654
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,820
- with assault,
- We'll see each other soon.

655
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,349
with negligence causing injury
according to Article 266,

656
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:34,190
with damage to property
according to Article 366,

657
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,519
and with obstruction of business...

658
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:37,429
according to Article 314
of the Criminal Law.

659
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,099
Defendant, do you admit the charges?

660
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:46,940
The defendant partially admits
the charges.

661
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:50,440
As for negligence causing injury,
he and the victim already settled.

662
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:54,679
And the damage to property was
made due to a physical fight,

663
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:56,239
so we cannot plead guilty.

664
00:52:56,679 --> 00:52:59,050
So has everything been settled
except for the assault charge?

665
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,949
Yes, Your Honor. We're working
on settling that one as well.

666
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:06,519
However, we cannot get a hold
of the injured party at the moment,

667
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,789
so we're having a hard time
making progress.

668
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:12,460
We'll do our best to settle if you
can allow us a little more time.

669
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,210
- Let's ask them.
- Okay.

670
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,880
- Hello.
- Excuse me.

671
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,409
This man lives in that house.

672
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,750
Have you seen him at all?

673
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:34,380
I've never seen him before.

674
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,980
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

675
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:36,989
Thank you.

676
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:42,519
Like we expected,
he wasn't home either.

677
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:44,789
He neither has a job nor a family,

678
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:47,199
so we had to stop our search there,
but I can try to...

679
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,030
You should come and see this.

680
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,840
Next news. Another random attack
took place.

681
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,269
A man in his 30s who attacked people
at a cafe a little while ago...

682
00:53:57,469 --> 00:53:59,340
visited the same cafe...

683
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,940
and tried to attack the part-timer
with a weapon.

684
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,679
He claims that the female part-timer
looked down on him...

685
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:08,719
and that he went back to the cafe
to get back at her.

686
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,849
The police have caught
the assailant, Mr. Kim, red-handed.

687
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:15,719
They will investigate to see if he
has connections to other cases.

688
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,630
That's the cafe where
So Jung Ha had the fight.

689
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:20,829
That means...

690
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:23,969
Mr. So's claim that he stopped...

691
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,869
the man as he knew he'd brandish
a knife is indeed true.

692
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,309
- It could be.
- That also means...

693
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:33,980
the possibility that two of us will
die like he predicted is...

694
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:37,480
Stop talking nonsense.

695
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,489
This is an announcement.

696
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,519
Japanese Airline 271...

697
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:49,860
has departed from Tokyo.

698
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,190
Japanese Airline 271...

699
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:04,309
Thank you for everything, Mr. No.
I really appreciate it.

700
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:07,510
You'll probably be sentenced
to a fine.

701
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:08,639
I see.

702
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:12,079
By the way, you kept texting someone
during the trial.

703
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,679
Whom are you waiting for?

704
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:17,849
My girlfriend, whom I haven't seen
for a long time, is coming back.

705
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:18,849
I see.

706
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:21,989
Oh, I was also wondering...

707
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:26,260
You said you can foresee the future.

708
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,300
Yes.

709
00:55:27,429 --> 00:55:28,530
Is it true?

710
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,429
Or is it more like a prank using
probability and coincidence?

711
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,099
It is true.

712
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:40,179
I get hunches. It only happens
once in a while though.

713
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:45,349
You said two people at my firm
might die. Was that also true?

714
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:46,949
Yes, that's true too.

715
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:52,289
I guess you don't believe me.

716
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:56,289
No, I don't.

717
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,289
I'm not kidding though.

718
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,059
I should get going.

719
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,670
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

720
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:05,769
- Bye.
- Bye.

721
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,710
Gosh, no!

722
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,420
There's a probability that...

723
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:26,389
two people will soon die.

724
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,690
I didn't know...

725
00:56:32,659 --> 00:56:34,400
that I'd be one of them.

726
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,300
Mr. So. Mr. So!

727
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:48,239
Mr. So, are you okay? Mr. So!

728
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:30,079
Hello?

729
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:32,219
Where are you?

730
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:36,960
Well... He's being stubborn
and insisting that he won't...

731
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,489
get surgery before you get here.

732
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,630
Yes. You should get here
as soon as possible.

733
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:47,940
I tried persuading him,
but it didn't work.

734
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,510
Yes, I'm sorry. Please try
to get here as soon as possible.

735
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:54,480
Okay.

736
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,050
Mr. So, please don't be like this.
You need to get surgery first.

737
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,090
I've been told
that I'm not likely...

738
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,989
to come out alive.

739
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,829
If that's the case,

740
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,030
I'd rather see...

741
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,039
the person whom
I've missed so much.

742
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:26,909
By the way, I'm not...

743
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,139
a swindler after all, right?

744
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,539
Mr. No.

745
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:03,010
Come closer for a second.

746
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:10,079
Don't cry so much.

747
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:11,949
Mr. No.

748
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:16,289
Everything will be okay.

749
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:21,300
What are you saying all of a sudden?

750
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,429
Jung Ha, Jung Ha!

751
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,469
Jung Ha.

752
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:31,840
Jung Ha...

753
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:34,780
You made it.

754
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,309
Jung Ha, I'm here.

755
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:38,980
You need to see me.

756
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:41,579
Jung Ha, wake up.

757
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:44,389
Jung Ha, open your eyes.

758
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:48,420
Jung Ha, open your eyes.
Come on, Jung Ha.

759
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,460
All of us...

760
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,760
have lost someone.

761
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,070
Some lost a family member.

762
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:06,070
Some lost a friend.

763
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,710
Some lost a lover.

764
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,780
Whether the person was kind or evil,

765
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:13,079
there is no one...

766
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,679
who didn't lose someone...

767
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:18,050
in their course of life.

768
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:35,840
Yes, Mr. No.

769
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,510
Where am I now? I am...

770
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,380
(Emergency room)

771
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,780
Okay. Stay where you are.

772
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,679
Therefore, life is cruel.

773
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:22,750
If that's true,

774
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,719
during this cruel,
limited period of time...

775
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:27,360
and in a way,

776
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:30,190
in this brief lifetime,

777
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,760
the only thing we can do is...

778
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,550
Bong Hee,

779
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:56,519
please...

780
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,519
please like me back now.

781
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,829
I'm sorry I didn't...

782
01:02:09,929 --> 01:02:11,800
keep my promise that
I was going to wait for you.

783
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:18,739
Bong Hee,

784
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,050
like me back right now, please.

785
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:47,099
Where are you going at this hour?

786
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:49,639
A friend of mine just got
into an accident.

787
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:53,210
I have to come up with the order
first. Who's going to go first?

788
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,909
It's been a while, my friend.

789
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,980
Bong Hee, are you all right?

790
01:02:57,849 --> 01:03:00,579
Do you want us to go through
this separately? Or do you want...

791
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:02,019
to go through it together?

792
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:04,320
I want you by my side
when we go through this.

793
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:15,329
(Love in Trouble)
