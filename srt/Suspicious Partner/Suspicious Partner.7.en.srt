1
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,289
I thought you might not come home.

2
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,130
I really didn't mean
to confess my love.

3
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,740
I like you.

4
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,310
I like you, Mr. No.

5
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,829
Don't...

6
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,170
fall for me.

7
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,359
Why not?

8
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,300
Do you...

9
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,710
No.

10
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,379
There are so many things...

11
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,590
I want to ask you.

12
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,460
But...

13
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,099
you won't answer
my questions, right?

14
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,639
Will I...

15
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,210
regret this moment?

16
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:00,949
Goodness. I'm starting to regret
confessing my love to you.

17
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,219
Will I regret stopping myself
because I'm scared...

18
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:07,990
of starting a new relationship?

19
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,370
But I don't regret liking you.

20
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,879
Can I ask you for a favor?

21
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,990
Let me...

22
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,620
hug you one more time.

23
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:43,159
Can't you at least allow
me to do that?

24
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,099
Since I have to end
this one-sided love...

25
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:25,459
What...

26
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,759
Well...

27
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,829
I slept so much that
my eyes got swollen.

28
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,230
Ice-cold spoons are the cure
for swollen eyes.

29
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,170
Cold... Cold towel.

30
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:42,009
I'll soak a towel in cold water
for you.

31
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:45,540
Don't do that.

32
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,180
You told me not to like you.

33
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,879
Then you shouldn't be so nice to me.

34
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,889
You have to help me out.

35
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,089
Right.

36
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,529
I always listen to you so well.

37
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,129
So I'm trying my best to
not like you.

38
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:12,569
But if you keep being nice
like this,

39
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,939
it'll be hard for me.

40
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,670
I'll be confused.

41
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:19,579
Okay.

42
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,449
I'm...

43
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,420
going to reset myself...

44
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,649
to back when I didn't like you.

45
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,420
Back to when you used to be
my mentor.

46
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,860
So...

47
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,529
don't do this.

48
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Okay, fine.

49
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,050
I'll do as you say.

50
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,379
Are you going to stay here?

51
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
No.

52
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,810
My gosh.

53
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,350
What is all this?

54
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,259
I used what I had in the fridge
to make these,

55
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,730
so the dishes...

56
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,230
are quite random.

57
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,590
Do you have insomnia again?

58
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,860
Is it a special day today, Ji Wook?

59
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,899
I know what this is.

60
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:48,700
You two.

61
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,370
What do you think you're doing?

62
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,039
Last night,

63
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,240
I finished work a bit late.

64
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,480
That's when I saw it.

65
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,519
Look at those two.

66
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,320
I saw you guys hugging each other.

67
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,460
- You must be mistaken.
- Yes.

68
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,529
- What? What?
- That can happen when you're old.

69
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,830
I saw it with my own eyes.

70
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:18,000
Ji Wook, say something.

71
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,330
You two were definitely...

72
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,070
If Bong Hee says you're wrong,
I guess you are.

73
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,039
Don't try to fool me.

74
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:27,240
I'm sure there's something
going on between you two.

75
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,870
- No, there's nothing going on.
- There's nothing going on.

76
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,039
We're not in any kind of
relationship.

77
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,679
Really?

78
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,710
Then was I really mistaken?

79
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

80
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,049
Hey, should I get my eyes checked?

81
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,019
You little...

82
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,019
I had breakfast already,

83
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,690
but I'll have it again. Thank you.

84
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,789
Chairman Byun.

85
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,860
It's okay. Everything will be fine.

86
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,029
Your eyes will get better.

87
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,509
As you can see,
it's a murder by a robber.

88
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:04,679
The prosecution charged Jung Hyun
Soo for the murder by a robber.

89
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,139
The evidence is the witness living
across the street from the victim,

90
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,850
Jung Hyun Soo's footprint,

91
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,320
and the button that
fell off from his shirt.

92
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,990
He even has a criminal intent.

93
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,950
Jung Hyun Soo's lease contract
was soon to be terminated.

94
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:18,820
The deposit money for lease is
very expensive.

95
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,590
- Right.
- I guess he needed money.

96
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,259
Where's Jung Hyun Soo's
criminal record?

97
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,730
Right.

98
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,830
He got into a minor assault incident
while he was trying to...

99
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,269
save a woman from danger.

100
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,669
But...

101
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,039
what happened to the weapon?

102
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
It disappeared.

103
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,470
The autopsy results show that...

104
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,639
it must be a knife that's around
13cm in length and 3.5cm in width.

105
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,710
There's no direct evidence to prove
that Jung Hyun Soo is the murderer.

106
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,179
But there's no evidence
to prove that he's not either.

107
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,480
I'll find his alibi.

108
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,620
I'm going to look for that couple
who was at the bar...

109
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,289
with Jung Hyun Soo on the day
of the incident.

110
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:54,059
I'm looking for the couple
in this picture.

111
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,590
It's a very important matter.

112
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,129
Please call me at this number.

113
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,629
I left my phone number at the bar.

114
00:10:58,629 --> 00:10:59,830
I'm sure I'll get a call.

115
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,830
Jung Hyun Soo is the culprit.

116
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
I'm sure of it.

117
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,080
With that naive face of his,

118
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,580
he was mocking...

119
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,190
me and the law.

120
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,250
I don't care about that,

121
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,460
but I must win this case because
I'm going against Bong Hee.

122
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,230
Anyway, don't overwork yourself.

123
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,360
You were really sick.

124
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,960
I'm all better now.
What's the use of being sick?

125
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,870
I don't have a guy to take care
of me anyway. It's all useless.

126
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,870
I agree.

127
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,169
No good comes from being sick.
We should always stay healthy.

128
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:02,830
(Alibi)

129
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,940
What are you doing, Ms. Eun?

130
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,379
I'm drying off.

131
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,350
What?

132
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,389
Do you want me to keep
talking to you or not?

133
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,960
Gently, please.

134
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:35,259
Talk to me gently, please.

135
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:40,159
My whole body is filled with
water right now.

136
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:43,399
If you accidentally poke me,
I might burst.

137
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,570
I hope you dry yourself well.

138
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:52,309
I just need to make sure
I don't cry in front of Mr. No.

139
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,649
I can do that much, right?

140
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,720
Would you like to cry your eyes out
in advance?

141
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,190
Should I do that?

142
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,789
I think I'm done for.

143
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,580
Excuse me.

144
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,610
Yes?

145
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,080
What happened between
you and Ms. Eun?

146
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,019
Chairman Byun...

147
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,220
saw you hugging each other.

148
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:38,190
Then you guys were so
indifferent this morning.

149
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,360
Excuse me, but since
I'm working with both of you,

150
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,460
I need to know what's going on.

151
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:48,470
You said there weren't any CCTVs
in the alley, right?

152
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,730
Please at least get me a CCTV
footage from the nearest road.

153
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,100
And try to find out if there were
any cars with black boxes nearby.

154
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,970
I also need every single information
on Chef Yang's restaurant.

155
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,480
Starting from the list of employees,
I also want to know his reputation,

156
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,710
rumor, and every other detail
you can gather.

157
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,309
And don't forget to check if
the stolen material...

158
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,610
was found.

159
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,720
I'm not curious.

160
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,279
I don't have a single thing
I wish to know about you two.

161
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
I'm serious.

162
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,019
Okay, I think I'll need about
that much.

163
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,389
I'm serious.

164
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,570
You might like him more because
you know it's not going to work out.

165
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,309
I wish I could just be okay.

166
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:30,470
Of course. If things worked
like we want them to,

167
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,679
life would be so much easier.

168
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,110
Why are you guys slacking off?

169
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,549
Sorry, Ji Wook.

170
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,049
Are... Are you going somewhere?

171
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:41,450
I'm going on a field investigation.

172
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,120
I'll go with you.

173
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,519
If you don't hurry up, I'm going to
leave without you.

174
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
Good luck.

175
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:52,629
Get your mind straight.

176
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:55,429
You can do it. You made a good
choice to stop liking him.

177
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,529
Right?

178
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,639
Good luck.

179
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,669
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

180
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Good luck.

181
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,480
Doing your best doesn't mean
you can change someone's mind.

182
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,759
Wake up.

183
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,360
Gosh, that hurts.

184
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,409
I don't think there's any here.

185
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:49,419
Nothing was visible because someone
sprayed spray paint over it.

186
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:51,789
This one is out.

187
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:01,230
This one was turned off
because it's broken.

188
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,110
Is this where
the prosecution's evidence is from?

189
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,240
I don't think I've seen that one.

190
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,750
Okay. Check it
and get the footage from it.

191
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,919
I didn't think you'd work this hard.

192
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,629
I must prove
that Jung Hyun Soo is not guilty...

193
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:31,259
in order for myself
to understand this case.

194
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,269
Well, don't get the wrong idea.
I'm doing this for myself.

195
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,100
All right, Bong Hee. Go.

196
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,009
- Pardon?
- Relax and get in there.

197
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,710
Yes.

198
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:11,000
Good. Underlings have to take care
of these things.

199
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes, sir.

200
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:02,519
Something definitely seems off.

201
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,059
It's so odd.

202
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,759
What's so odd?

203
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,009
Why do you think
he took the framed painting?

204
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,150
By the way, we are...

205
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,250
committing house-breaking,
aren't we?

206
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,220
Plus, we're illegally
searching the property.

207
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,390
Come on.

208
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,130
Gosh.

209
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,430
I can't get arrested again. I'm
still traumatized from last time.

210
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,039
Right. That's understandable.

211
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:06,920
What's this? It's you guys?

212
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,720
- Let go.
- You let go first.

213
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,630
Goodness. Stop it already.
Both of you should let go.

214
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:17,859
We're...

215
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:24,029
We're here to inspect the scene
as Mr. Jung's attorneys.

216
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,240
Don't work too hard.
Let's go, Bong Hee.

217
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,670
Shall we?

218
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,640
Stop right there, Ji Wook.

219
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,309
Let's talk for just 10 minutes.
Bong Hee, you can leave.

220
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,509
Pardon?

221
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,720
If you guys leave like that,
I'll get a warrant and arrest you.

222
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,390
Just Bong Hee alone.

223
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:45,890
Sorry?

224
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,990
Why only me?

225
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,589
It's up to me.

226
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,630
What do you say?
Shall I request for a warrant?

227
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,130
- I just need 10 minutes.
- Make it 5.

228
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,670
All right.

229
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:10,009
(Do not enter, Under investigation)

230
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,309
You still visit the scenes
even though you're an attorney now.

231
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,150
I know. You're also
working pretty hard yourself.

232
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,480
You taught me all this.

233
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,880
As a prosecutor, you had
more experience than me.

234
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,490
You taught me the importance
of inspecting scenes...

235
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,890
- and how to interrogate suspects.
- Your five minutes are almost up.

236
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,829
You must know Jung Hyun Soo has been
previously convicted of assault.

237
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,029
Yes.

238
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,509
It's not just the face.

239
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,339
The victim got a few ribs broken
as he was beaten up to a pulp.

240
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,279
Had people not stopped him,

241
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,880
he would've killed the victim.

242
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,720
You used to catch
criminals like him.

243
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,619
Why would you defend him?

244
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,029
Navy is a good color on you.

245
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,630
You were wearing a navy tie
the last time you came.

246
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,799
I think navy looks great on you.

247
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,410
Oh, did I?

248
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,039
Does it look okay?
Does the color suit me?

249
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,039
I actually have heard that many
times.

250
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,779
All right. Shall we get started?

251
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:57,920
Well, I did some research...

252
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,690
and found out that... Gosh.
You have...

253
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,829
beaten someone up
to a pulp in the past.

254
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:06,359
Like this.

255
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,440
So? Are you trying to say
that you think...

256
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,869
I killed Chef Yang just because
I have a previous record?

257
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:18,579
No, no. Not because of your
past criminal record.

258
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:19,609
It's just...

259
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:23,880
a feeling I'm getting.
I think you might have done it.

260
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,819
Mr. Jung.

261
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,720
People use the phrase,
"spur-of-the-moment", a lot.

262
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:33,789
It's used to refer to crimes
that are committed on impulse.

263
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,359
If you look at this... Gosh.

264
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,059
This wasn't
a spur-of-the-moment case.

265
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:42,329
A will is needed for anyone to beat
up someone like this.

266
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
A murderous intent.

267
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:49,539
An urge to kill that person
or an intent to act on such urge.

268
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:53,240
- That kind of will.
- Right, I wanted to kill him.

269
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,750
Have you ever seen anyone
close to you getting hurt?

270
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,390
I have.

271
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,759
I should've kept that person safe.

272
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,130
There was a kid whom I failed
to protect.

273
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:12,200
That's when I had this thought.

274
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,099
"Right. When I'm a little older..."

275
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,230
"and have more power and ability,"

276
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:21,809
"I shouldn't let anyone fall victim
to such unfairness."

277
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:23,869
That's when I saw this jerk.

278
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,609
Have a look.

279
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:28,579
This scum.

280
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,460
This jerk was assaulting a woman.

281
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:47,730
Do you think he had a reason
for that?

282
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:51,839
Not at all. Like you just said,
it was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

283
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,269
He had no reason whatsoever.
He attacked her randomly,

284
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:58,009
and I only did what I could do
to help her. Do you understand?

285
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,839
All right. Please calm down.

286
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,509
Well... Gosh, I can't get
these photos crinkled up like this.

287
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,980
Let's say that everything
you're telling me is true.

288
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,750
Yes, you're absolutely right.
However...

289
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,190
You didn't do this to stop him.

290
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,829
You did this as a way
of punishing him.

291
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:19,900
Am I wrong?

292
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,710
What's wrong with that?

293
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,519
Gosh, I'm sorry. My apologies.

294
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,549
I'm really sorry.

295
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,420
At the time, I was...

296
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,390
My gosh. I guess I lost it
for a few minutes.

297
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,230
I was trying to do a good deed,

298
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,700
but I think I overdid it a little.
Aren't I right?

299
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,339
Gosh. I'm sorry, Mr. No.
I got too worked up.

300
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:01,539
It's all right.

301
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,269
But there is one thing I can
be certain about.

302
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,640
It's that I didn't kill
Chef Yang Jin Woo.

303
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,980
There's no reason why I would
do such a thing.

304
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,250
I don't hurt people
without any reason.

305
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:14,849
I'm sorry.

306
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,809
Did something happen?

307
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:43,880
I...

308
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:48,250
really hate clients.

309
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,450
I really hate...

310
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,690
guilty clients.

311
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,460
But...

312
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,529
I hate innocent clients even more.

313
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:02,930
I'm afraid that I might not
be able to prove their innocence.

314
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,809
Were you okay when you were
a prosecutor then?

315
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,279
Your dad...

316
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,509
was always worried too.

317
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:18,049
He was worried that someone
he arrested today...

318
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:19,779
might actually be innocent...

319
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,250
and that someone
he released today...

320
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:24,490
might actually be guilty.

321
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,529
Dad went through the same thing.

322
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,759
Cheers.

323
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

324
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,039
I...

325
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,210
should have liked Mr. Ji instead.

326
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,380
If only you were my type...

327
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,349
How awesome would that have been?

328
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,079
Thinking about it
gives me the thrill.

329
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,089
If that were the case, it wouldn't
have been one-sided.

330
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:58,019
Our love would have
been reciprocated.

331
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,019
Reciprocated.

332
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,529
But why are you not my type?

333
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,259
No matter how many times
I look at you,

334
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,329
I don't have feelings for you.

335
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:11,599
None.

336
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,410
It's because Cupid is...

337
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,809
a baby. That's the root
of this problem.

338
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:19,640
It's because he can't shoot
his arrows right.

339
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,680
- That's exactly right.
- If a Korean archer was Cupid,

340
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,380
the success rate of falling in love
would have been 100 percent.

341
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
You're right!

342
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,650
- Aren't I?
- You're right.

343
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:30,789
I'm right!

344
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,119
- It would have been perfect.
- He would've shot like this.

345
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,789
I've never thought about that.

346
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,200
It's Ji Wook.

347
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:45,470
Mr. No, you are here.

348
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:49,809
What are you all doing?

349
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,740
Why did you make her drink so much?

350
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,789
Ji Wook, don't worry. I'll text
you when I get home.

351
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:04,720
- I love you!
- Don't worry. I can go home.

352
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,160
Don't worry. I'm going.

353
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,559
I can go home.

354
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,130
That's it.

355
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,900
My life has become a war.

356
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:34,279
How can a girl black out...

357
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,150
every time she drinks?

358
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,140
We're here.

359
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,680
All right.

360
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,480
Well...

361
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,480
This isn't my place.

362
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,920
Really?
This is the address you gave me.

363
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,829
I'm sorry.

364
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,900
Please drop me off
at Royal Apartment in Seongsan-dong.

365
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,099
Sure.

366
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,170
(Gangseo Police Station)

367
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,650
Well, I asked you
for a bunch of documents.

368
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,759
I see that you only brought me
a few, Mr. Bang.

369
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:30,960
I didn't have time to go through
all the documents...

370
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,930
And you had time
to go out for drinks?

371
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,769
Please go through them all...

372
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:38,230
and find everything related
to Yang Jin Woo.

373
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,670
Go look through his social media
pages or even his garbage bins.

374
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,240
And make sure to find what that
painting was.

375
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,279
And about that restaurant...

376
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,150
Yes, you. You do it.

377
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:54,420
- Me?
- Yes, you. Go find it.

378
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,190
Why me? I'm already working on many
cases. I don't have time for that.

379
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,019
Yet you also have time
to go out for drinks.

380
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:10,329
Check every frame of that footage
we got from the CCTV...

381
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,670
and show me everything you find.

382
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:13,200
What if I don't find anything?

383
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,769
You have to find something no matter
what. You must find something!

384
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,210
Keep looking! Keep your eyes peeled
and bring me something.

385
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Okay, I will.

386
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,349
You brought this case to our firm.

387
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:27,619
You also wanted to take it on,

388
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:31,319
so you should feel more responsible.

389
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:35,859
Got it.

390
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,200
You guys...

391
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:46,240
must've joined this firm
to go out drinking all the time.

392
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,230
I need to watch the footage from
the store, but it's on your laptop.

393
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:31,680
Thank you.

Hello.

396
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,289
- I'm Attorney Ji Eun Hyuk.
- Oh, hello.

397
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,190
I just need to ask you
a quick question.

398
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,960
Wait, just a second. Excuse me.

399
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,489
Excuse me.

400
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,289
It's heavy. You shouldn't carry
things like this.

401
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,059
- It's fine.
- Let me help. It's okay.

402
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,760
Well, this is... Oh, boy.

403
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,699
Just 5 minutes. Please spare me
5 minutes of your time.

404
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,599
My apologies.
I'm not some weird guy.

405
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,610
There's not much trash today.

406
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,110
It turns out he was a scumbag.

407
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:39,880
Is that all?

408
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,250
No way.

409
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:43,989
All right. When someone does
something bad,

410
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,360
there's a person who just
watches and patches it up.

411
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,460
It's the chef's sister.

412
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:49,929
Didn't she discover the body?

413
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,360
Her name is Yang Ji Yeon.

414

00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:12,849
Let me see.

418
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,280
Look at this...

419
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,320
and this.

420
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,360
- Here.
- Hold on.

421
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:22,460
It's him.

(Goyang Branch of the District
Court)

These are the pieces of evidence
that prove the suspect...

427
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,619
was at the crime scene
where the deceased was murdered.

This is the button found
at the crime scene.

430
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,130
It's confirmed that the fingerprints
and DNA on this button match...

00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,699
to the suspect, Jung Hyun Soo's
fingerprints and DNA.

432

In addition, these are the
footprints found at the scene.

433

Can you see them? These footprints
are also identical...

434
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,340
to the footprints from the
defendant's sneakers, Your Honor.

435

The button found
at the crime scene...

436
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,110
is indeed the button that
the defendant dropped.

However,

438
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,949
he dropped it on the day
before the murder,

which is May 19.

- Can you lift it?
- Lift it?

The defendant who couldn't turn
away from the deceased...

448
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,949
who had to get something
under the sofa,

449
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,280
helped Yang Jin Woo and moved
the furniture together at his house.

450
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,789
It's conjectured that he might have
dropped it when he was helping him.

451

Your Honor, this is
only a conjecture.

452

It's also only a conjecture he
dropped it on the day of murder...

when he allegedly murdered Chef
Yang.

You witnessed a man coming out
of the victim's house...

456
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:23,909
on the day of murder, May 20
around 7:30pm.

457
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,019
Of course. I saw him.

458
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,590
I know it well since I was looking
out the window the whole evening.

459
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,659
Could you point out
who that man was?

Oh, he's right there.

461

That's all, Your Honor.

how good is your eyesight?

464
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,539
I may be old,

but I have 20 and 20 vision.

466
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,980
Your eyesight is great.

467
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:02,789
If so, can I ask you...

468
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:05,489
to describe the scene
you witnessed in detail?

469
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:07,059
Describe?

470
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,929
Yes. For example, can you tell us
what the defendant was wearing?

471
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:14,300
I see. He was wearing
a black outfit.

472
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,929
He wore black clothes, hat, and
even gloves although it was hot.

473
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,099
Didn't he have a bag with him?

474
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,670
No, he didn't.

475
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,210
You remember it very clearly.

476
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:28,110
I'm famous in my neighborhood
for having a good memory.

477
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,280
I see. What about
the man's physique?

478
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,320
Did he look fatter back then...

479
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,579
like he was wearing a winter jacket?

480
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,150
No way. He was slim
just like he is now.

481
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:43,590
Then how did he move
the valuables he supposedly stole?

00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,739
a DSLR camera, lenses,
expensive watches,

485
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,079
and a big painting were stolen.

486
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,579
This is a bag that I filled with
the items I've just mentioned.

487
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:12,050
All those items put together
will be as big as this bag.

488
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,659
On top of that, the big painting
didn't even fit in this bag.

489
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:17,489
Seeing how things are,

490
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:22,329
the witness who have a
perfect vision,

491
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:25,400
testified the defendant didn't have
any bag with him.

492
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,570
Seeing that he looked slim,
it implies that...

493
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,670
he didn't hide the valuables
under his clothes.

494
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,079
Your Honor,

495
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,880
please remember the fact...

496
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,650
that the stolen valuables
from the victim's house...

497
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,949
didn't resurface at all.

498
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:45,219
The defendant could have come back.

499
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:49,730
It's possible he returned after the
murder to take the valuables.

500
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:55,400
These are the photos
of footprints...

501
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,400
that the prosecution claims
to belong to the defendant.

502
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,400
Following the prosecutor's logic,

503
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,340
if the defendant did return
to the scene,

504
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:04,840
there should have been
duplicate footprints.

505
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:07,079
Don't you agree?

506
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,659
(Strategy to refute the prosecution)

507
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:24,230
You were the first person
to discover your brother,

508
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:28,630
Yang Jin Woo's body the day after
he was murdered around 1pm.

509
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,829
Is this true?

510
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:31,469
Yes, it's true.

511
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,599
After the discovery,
you reported it to the police...

512
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,940
and called the ambulance
without any hesitation.

513
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,309
Yes.

514
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,250
This is the screen of the CCTV
footages we submitted additionally.

515
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,750
Since this was located
in an unnoticeable alley,

516
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,820
the prosecution was unable
to acquire these footages.

517
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,559
When you look at the screen,
the plate number is 8209.

518
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,929
Isn't this your vehicle?

519
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,429
Yes, it is.

520
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,000
Let me direct you
to the date and the time.

521
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,969
It was the day
after the murder at 11:13am.

522
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,710
What is the meaning of this?

523
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,550
You testified you were certain...

524
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:23,789
that you arrived
at the victim's house at 1pm.

525
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:25,090
That was your testimony, wasn't it?

526
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,960
I think it was.

527
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:30,789
Was it 11am or 1pm?

528
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,860
I'm asking you
the time of your arrival.

529
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,230
I don't know.

530
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:39,000
A while ago, you seemed
to remember it clearly.

531
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,769
But now you can't seem to remember
at all.

532
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:44,210
Your Honor, the defense attorney is
pressuring the witness to testify.

533
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,110
I'm merely questioning her since
there is a reasonable doubt.

534
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,179
You may continue.

535
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,880
Please answer the question.

536
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,980
- Ms. Yang!
- I said I don't know.

537
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,719
I don't remember!

538
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:57,050
Should I refresh your memory?

539
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:00,420
Isn't it true...

540
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:02,730
that you murdered...

541
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:04,989
your brother, the victim?

542
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,460
- Your Honor.
- No, I didn't.

543
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,300
You didn't murder him?

544
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,800
You are going to argue that
Ms. Yang is the murderer?

545
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,369
Yes. In order to get
a true testimony out of her,

546
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:16,539
I'm going to pressure her
to make a false testimony.

547
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:18,570
It's called a leading question.

548
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:21,940
No, I didn't.

549
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,880
According to the evidence
we have gathered,

550
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:29,489
we were informed that Ms. Yang and
the victim were not on good terms.

551
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,320
The victim had rather a promiscuous
love life which is contrary...

552
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,960
to his reputation in the media.

553
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,590
So the witness had to clean
up the mess after the victim.

554
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:40,860
Because of this, the witness
couldn't put up with it anymore...

555
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,800
and killed her brother.
Isn't this true, Ms. Yang?

556
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,500
- I said I didn't!
- Ms. Yang!

557
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,739
Please speak up.

558
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,820
I was just trying to cover it up.

559
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,219
I was just trying to cover up...

560
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,219
the monstrous acts
my brother committed.

561
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:12,389
When I arrived at his house,

562
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,530
my brother was already murdered.

563
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,570
On TV, the evil acts he had done
to women were airing.

564
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:23,769
So I tainted every piece
of evidence...

565
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,769
and set it up to look
like a murder by a robber.

566
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:31,079
I was trying to uphold my family
and my brother's reputation.

567
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,650
Is that so wrong?

568
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:35,750
Do you think you wouldn't have
done the same thing, Mr. No?

569
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,519
Then who preserves
the reputation of women...

570
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,329
that your brother trampled on?

571
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:56,369
Due to the fabricated pieces
of evidence,

572
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:58,469
an innocent man was unfairly
framed for murder.

573
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,210
Who will uphold his rights?

574
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,260
You did great, Mr. No.

575
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,400
Yes, you too.

576
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,090
Mr. No.

577
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,960
There aren't enough bath supplies
on the first floor...

578
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,449
He should at least take off his tie
and sleep.

579
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:54,219
Done.

580
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,800
I wasn't trying to undress you.

581
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,639
I mean, I was just trying to
take off your tie for you.

582
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:21,909
Why do I always stutter so much?

583
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,320
I promise that I was only trying to
take off your tie.

584
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,519
Please trust me.

585
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:37,929
Bye, then.

586
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:47,769
Bong Hee, I'm sorry.

587
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,880
Please stay...

588
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,250
Please stay with me
for just five minutes.

589
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:13,630
Sleep tight.

590
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:05,809
Where's Ji Wook? He should be
downstairs by now.

591
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,250
No.

592
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,150
Move out of the way.

593
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,159
- No. No.
- What's wrong with you?

594
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,900
(Currently under trial)

595
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,969
Considering the overall story
which was investigated based on...

596
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:34,409
the legally selected evidence,

597
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,309
it is difficult to prove that
the defendant...

598
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,519
robbed and murdered the victim,

599
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:43,420
Yang Jin Woo.

600
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:45,989
There is also no evidence
to prove otherwise.

601
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,289
This applies to a case
where there is...

602
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:50,360
no evidence to prove
a criminal fact.

603
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:54,059
Therefore, according to the Criminal
Procedure Act, Article 325,

604
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,630
I find him not guilty.

605
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,000
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

606
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,670
The smell of soju is so strong.

607
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:38,539
Thank you.

608
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:40,639
Everyone, it's a great day.

609
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:41,679
Here.

610
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:44,150
Here's to our first victory...

611
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:46,719
and Jung Hyun Soo's freedom.

612
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:48,179
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

613
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:49,889
Congratulations.

614
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:50,989
- Thank you.
- That's great.

615
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:53,519
Great.

616
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:56,260
There's too much soju.

617
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,829
Gosh, the soju is so strong.

618
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:00,199
Just drink it.

619
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,340
What are you doing?

620
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,710
Nothing. I was just...

621
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,780
I was just enjoying the breeze.

622
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,150
It's so gentle.

623
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:27,760
You feel a bit uncomfortable,
don't you?

624
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:32,429
The real culprit didn't
get caught yet.

625
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:34,730
To be exact,

626
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,869
it's only the beginning,
not the end.

627
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:38,000
You're right.

628
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,269
But that's the prosecution's job.

629
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,199
It's not ours.
It's the prosecution's job.

630
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:45,909
You're right.

631
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:08,199
- Look.
- What?

632
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,969
What's this?

633
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:12,599
What? A song?

634
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:13,699
Yes.

635
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:15,199
Ms. Lack of Evidence.

636
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:17,940
You're the youngest one.

637
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:19,880
You should do as you're told.

638
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:21,239
Okay, fine.

639
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,739
Hey, Bong Hee. Stop it.

640
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,880
Don't sing. Just sit still.

641
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,050
Why?

642
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,349
Why? Why won't you let her sing?

643
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:29,150
Don't make her sing.

644
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,949
Why won't you let me sing?

645
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:33,989
Well...

646
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,059
- Don't you know why?
- I don't.

647
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,690
My goodness,
what should I do with you?

648
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:42,530
Fine, go...

649
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,699
Go ahead. Do what you wish.

650
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,070
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

651
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,739
My goodness, my goodness,
don't do this

652
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:56,440
A woman's heart is like reed

653
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,050
No, please, don't ask me why

654
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,519
- My goodness.
- You should no longer

655
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,119
Want anything from me

656
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:09,420
I met you for the first time today

657
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,530
But you are my love

658
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,699
Although we will become strangers

659
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:18,670
If we break up

660
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,829
Hello?

661
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,900
- Yes, I'm No Ji Wook.
- I like you

662
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,110
- That case is over...
- I love you.

663
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:29,039
I love you like it's a lie

664
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,880
- No, I'll meet you there.
- Like a fairy tale

665
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,079
Like a movie

666
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,949
Why? Do you need to go somewhere?

667
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:36,590
I love you like it's a lie

668
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,320
- Yes, I'll be right back.
- I like you

669
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,550
I love you

670
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:42,460
I'll give my everything

671
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:45,829
- If it's for you
- Gosh, she...

672
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,159
Don't drink too much.

673
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:51,400
(It's a very important matter.
Please call me at this number.)

674
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,429
An alibi?

675
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,840
Yes, there was a guy
drinking alone that night.

676
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,500
- You remember, right?
- Yes.

677
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,909
Not many people drink alone,
so I remember him clearly.

678
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:01,639
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

679
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,380
We have a video.

680
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,650
We took a video that night.

681
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,960
In 1, 2, 3.

682
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,030
It's a video.

683
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,360
My gosh.

684
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,559
- You fooled me.
- Did I fool you?

685
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:24,670
There we go.

686
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,570
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

687
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:34,610
Well... By any chance,

688
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,949
was there any other guy than
this guy?

689
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,920
I'm not sure.
We stayed here for quite a while,

690
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,349
but we don't think
we saw another guy.

691
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,820
I see.

692
00:54:51,929 --> 00:54:52,960
That's strange.

693
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:00,670
(May 20, 2017, Your birthday)

694
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:12,980
On the day of the incident,

695
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:15,280
since the weather was great,

696
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:17,320
I went for a walk to the park.

697
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,960
Girls were having fun with
the balloons and running about.

698
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,159
They were so cute.

699
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:32,570
I remembered that "The Usual
Suspects" was being re-released.

700
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,239
So I went to the movies
to catch that film.

701
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:37,170
I came back because
the schedule didn't fit mine.

702
00:55:37,269 --> 00:55:38,710
And...

703
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:44,380
I had the street food for my lunch
on that day.

704
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,119
I had tteokbokki.
I had good coffee though.

705
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:50,750
I had tteokbokki and caffe mocha. I
added whipped cream on top.

706
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,659
And I had a drink by myself at a bar
that I visit sometimes.

707
00:55:55,659 --> 00:55:57,159
I usually drink alone.

708
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:01,599
By the way, at the bar, a couple
had a birthday party on that day.

709
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,530
They brought a birthday cake
with the candles.

710
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:09,369
That's what I got as Jung Hyun Soo's
full account of what he did...

711
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:10,739
on the day of the incident.

712
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:13,480
He actually listed alibis
without making it explicit.

713
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:17,349
Hello, I'd like fries and beer.

714
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:22,320
From here on, it's only my
imagination and speculation.

715
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:27,659
Jung Hyun Soo was here some time
after the incident...

716
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,530
and happened to see
the photo as well as the note.

717
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:36,400
He has a good memory,

718
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:38,599
so after getting arrested
unexpectedly...

719
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:42,170
On May 20, the day of the incident,

720
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,070
you were off duty.

721
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,840
We went through all the CCTV
footages from your neighborhood...

722
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,909
and found out that you left home
early and came back late at night.

723
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:55,320
Please give me a full account
of what you did that day.

724
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:56,820
Don't leave anything out.

725
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,730
That day, I...

726
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:08,159
He remembered this photo
and the notes he saw that day,

727
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,130
then fabricated a believable story
of what he did that day.

728
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:20,039
He staged himself in busy or crowded
areas so that we can't confirm it.

729
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:29,250
What's he trying to hide
by telling such a lie?

730
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:41,159
Bong Hee, I heard there are classes
that correct tone-deafness.

731
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:42,860
Hey, come on.

732
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,170
I told you that correcting a thing
or two won't even make a difference.

733
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:52,340
From head to toe, everything about
her needs to be corrected.

734
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:56,440
Forget it.
I just need to find out one thing.

735
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:58,349
What? What is it?

736
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:01,019
- The melody that the killer sang?
- What?

737
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,420
That can't even serve as evidence.

738
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,119
Still, I have to find out.

739
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:08,690
Listen up.

740
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,230
Again?

741
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:38,650
How pretty.

742
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,860
(Shoe Repair Shop)

743
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,329
If someone can recognize
that melody,

744
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,030
I swear that person
must be a genius.

745
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,239
She's pretty good.

746
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:05,670
Hyun Soo, you must be very drunk
right now.

747
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:09,710
Are you saying you can tell
what song it is?

748
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:12,210
Well, no. That I don't know.

749
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,420
- I'm doomed.
- I was just kidding.

750
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:18,690
Mr. Byun, Mr. Byun.

751
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,920
- Yes.
- I'll be sure to find him.

752
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:44,550
They say that a judge who lets
a criminal get acquitted is guilty.

753
01:00:45,579 --> 01:00:47,679
It means that when a criminal is
acquitted and gets to walk away,

754
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:49,920
the judge, prosecutor,
and attorney who set him free...

755
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:51,920
are all guilty.

756
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:14,440
If I...

757
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:17,550
helped a criminal get acquitted,

758
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,619
it's Jung Hyun Soo.

759
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:22,750
It's you.

760
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,530
If you never find out who I am,

761
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:41,500
I'll always be remembered
as a good person to you.

762
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,699
I've actually gotten
quite used to this.

763
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:45,210
I've also stopped
having a crush on him.

764
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,340
Shall I help you?
Come a little closer.

765
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,880
I know who bought the shoes.

766
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,179
What if something happened to you?

767
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:54,079
What would you have done?
What was I...

768
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:55,780
What was I supposed to do?

769
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:06,889
