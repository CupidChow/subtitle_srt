1
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,409
I hesitated to start this because
I was afraid of it coming to an end.

2
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,939
The moment I realized
my feelings for you...

3
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,710
I ran away from you like a coward.

4
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,280
Don't fall for me.

5
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,420
And I failed...

6
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,289
because I started to have feelings
for you without realizing.

7
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,390
If you can open up to me again,
change your mind.

8
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,119
I'll be waiting.
You can take your time.

9
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,289
There must be a connection.

10
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,200
You know Jung Hyun Soo, right?
Can you please look into his past?

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,100
The guy who was going to make
a report didn't look like him?

12
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,000
- Ms. Eun.
- What a coincidence.

13
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,480
It was me who made Mr. No
defend a murderer.

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,480
I came here to tell you this.
Bong Hee, your ex-boyfriend...

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,049
I mean Jang Hee Jun. I'll be
reinvestigating his case.

16
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,349
I witnessed something without even
realizing that I saw it,

17
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:20,989
Bong Hee, stay here.

18
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,359
If I went through everything because
of this, I suffered so unfairly.

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,530
It'll be okay.
I took care of it perfectly.

20
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,599
Hey, Ji Wook. Our client's here.

21
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,430
I can see what's ahead of me.

22
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,099
I can see what's going to happen
in the future.

23
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,799
There's a probability that...

24
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,870
two people will soon die.

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,340
I...

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,569
changed my mind.

27
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,840
I suddenly felt pressured.

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,480
I started to feel a bit
uncomfortable.

29
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,810
Please respect my feelings...

30
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,049
and my decision.

31
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,620
Can you really foresee the future?

32
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,049
I get hunches.

33
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,290
It only happens
once in a while though.

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,790
You said two people at my firm
might die. Was that also true?

35
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,090
Yes, that's true too.

36
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,730
I should get going.

37
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,930
- Thank you so much.
- No problem. Bye.

38
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,930
Bye.

39
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,509
Gosh, no!

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,460
By the way, I'm not...

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,500
a swindler after all, right?

42
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,650
Don't cry so much, Mr. No.

43
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,090
Everything will be okay.

44
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,729
Yes, Mr. No.

45
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,210
Where am I now? I am...

46
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,639
(Emergency room)

47
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,580
Okay. Stay where you are.

48
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,479
All of us...

49
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,710
have lost someone.

50
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,080
Some lost a family member.

51
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,150
Some lost a friend.

52
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:35,719
Some lost a lover.

53
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,789
Whether the person was kind or evil,

54
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,560
there is no one...

55
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,430
who didn't lose someone...

56
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,599
in their course of life.

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,300
Therefore, life is cruel.

58
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,439
If that's true,

59
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,509
during this cruel,
limited period of time...

60
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,009
and in a way,

61
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,879
in this brief lifetime,

62
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,389
the only thing we can do is...

63
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,199
Bong Hee,

64
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,170
please...

65
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,079
Please like me back now.

66
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,779
I'm sorry I didn't...

67
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,790
keep my promise that
I was going to wait for you.

68
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:44,589
Bong Hee,

69
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,529
like me back right now, please.

70
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,569
What should I...

71
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,540
do now?

72
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,329
What's wrong?

73
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,670
I'm the one who should ask you
that question.

74
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,939
Why did you suddenly confess
your feelings...

75
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,810
in the middle of the street?
I felt pressured.

76
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,110
I just...

77
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,879
suddenly felt like...

78
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,379
I was wasting my time.

79
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,019
It's your turn, Bong Hee.

80
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:55,889
I know there's something going on.

81
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,990
What is it?

82
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:19,879
I'm just really exhausted.

83
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,850
Today was just...

84
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,420
one of those days where everything
annoys me and makes me want to cry.

85
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,879
That's when I ran into you.

86
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,519
That's why I cried,
which really wasn't like me.

87
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:40,730
Jung Hyun Soo.

88
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,769
Is it because of Jung Hyun Soo?

89
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,319
What do you know of him?

90
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,629
Long time no see, my friend.

91
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,639
What about you?

92
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,710
What do you know?

93
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,450
I know that Jung Hyun Soo...

94
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,159
might be...

95
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:15,629
the murderer.

96
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,200
He could be the one who murdered
Chef Yang.

97
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
And maybe...

98
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,210
This is just an over interpreted
guess.

99
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,909
I have no evidence to prove it.

100
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:32,909
It's just...

101
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,580
something I guessed based on my
instincts.

102
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,320
It's a nonscientific guess.

103
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,990
My gosh.

104
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:42,450
You're so mean.

105
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,929
Why didn't you tell me
when you knew everything?

106
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,759
You told me that you won't keep
secrets from me.

107
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,799
Okay, I shouldn't have done that.
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,129
Then stop everything you're doing.

109
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,570
Stop expressing your feelings
for me.

110
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,570
I'm sorry,

111
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:01,909
but I don't want to.

112
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:04,139
- What do you mean?
- Why do we have to be like this...

113
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,279
because of a jerk like him?

114
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,509
Do you really not know why?

115
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,580
Yes.

116
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,850
I'm asking because I don't know.

117
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,549
- Try putting yourself in my shoes.
- I do.

118
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,120
I think a lot about how you might
feel.

119
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:20,960
I know you're blaming yourself.

120
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,059
"I lured the criminal."

121
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,559
"It's all because of me."

122
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,559
"I defended a criminal..."

123
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,570
"and set him free."

124
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,570
You're probably going through a hard
time. I know that already.

125
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,600
You're right. You know very well.

126
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,909
But I'm trying to tell you...

127
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,539
that you're mistaken.

128
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,509
No, you're wrong. It's the truth.

129
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:40,779
It's not the truth.
It's just an accident.

130
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,519
You got into an accident
with Jung Hyun Soo.

131
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,190
And I'm going to get through
this accident...

132
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,990
with you.

133
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,389
My decision won't change even if you
try to push me away.

134
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:55,789
I'm definitely...

135
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,029
going to catch Jung Hyun Soo.

136
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,200
So you need to make a decision.

137
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,340
Do you want us to...

138
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:10,409
go through this separately?

139
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,250
Or do you want to go through it
together?

140
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,279
I want us...

141
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,049
to do this together.

142
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,450
I asked you not to abandon me,
Yeon Woo.

143
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,659
Let's put an end to this.
We should just die together.

144
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,590
(Choi Yeon Woo)

145
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:10,759
Hey, Yeon Woo.
It's been such a long time...

146
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,070
What happened?

147
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:29,809
Where are you going this late?

148
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,990
Oh, well...
A friend of mine had a mishap.

149
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,289
A mishap?

150
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,860
Yes.

151
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,789
Yeon Woo. Yeon Woo...

152
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,230
Yeon Woo!

153
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,700
Hey, what happened?

154
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,730
Look at me. Let me have a look.
What happened?

155
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,299
I broke up with my ex-boyfriend,
and he said we should die together.

156
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,009
What?

157
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,610
Gosh, what a worthless piece
of trash.

158
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:00,879
Where's that jerk now?

159
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,710
He's in the holding cell.

160
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,690
But we couldn't find the weapon
you insisted he attacked you with.

161
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,789
He really tried to stab me
with a knife.

162
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,159
She has this cut that seems like
the knife brushed against.

163
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,629
It should be considered attempted
murder if he brandished a weapon.

164
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,230
However... Excuse me for a second.

165
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,200
The wound is too insignificant
to insist that was the case.

166
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,340
Plus, there's no evidence that
it was done by her ex-boyfriend.

167
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,669
What are you talking about?

168
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,500
I'm telling him the fact.

169
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,639
He can be detained
for up to 48 hours, right?

170
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,980
Yes, that's correct.

171
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,350
And we have to find
a suspect or the weapon...

172
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,679
in order to request a warrant.

173
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:38,549
We'll go through the CCTV footages
around the time of his arrest.

174
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,049
We'll do a thorough search.

175
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,419
Please find something.

176
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,120
You have to find something
within 48 hours.

177
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:52,259
I'll kill her.

178
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,029
Go on in.

179
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,700
- Thanks.
- Don't worry too much.

180
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,649
(48 Hours Later)

181
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,769
You two must be close friends.

182
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,210
I met her while preparing
for the bar exam.

183
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:38,440
I see. I guess you guys
used to study together.

184
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:41,049
No, her parents owned the restaurant
I used to go to often.

185
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
I see.

186
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,990
I'm really upset.

187
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,720
Why did she date a jerk like that?

188
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,639
I just...

189
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,250
suddenly felt like...

190
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,850
I was wasting my time.

191
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,409
Then stop everything you're doing.

192
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,409
Stop expressing your feelings
for me.

193
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,450
I'm sorry,

194
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,450
- but I don't want to.
- What do you mean?

195
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,889
Why do we have to be like this
because of a jerk like him?

196
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,670
So you need to make a decision.

197
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,069
Do you want us to
go through this separately? Or...

198
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,980
do you want to go through it
together?

199
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:23,509
I want us...

200
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,549
to do this together.

201
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,269
Hey, hey, hey! Goodness!

202
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,670
What do you think you're doing now?
What are you looking at?

203
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:23,769
I came to tell you something.

204
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:25,339
What is it?

205
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,109
I thought hard all night and have
decided to live with no shame.

206
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:35,049
Who cares, right? We should just
be selfish and live as we please.

207
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,490
What?

208
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,160
Let's start today.
Today is our first day. See you.

209
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,000
Hey, what does that mean?
What... What did you say?

210
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,900
Let's start a relationship.

211
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,970
What relationship...

212
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:53,799
Wait.

213
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,809
That relationship.

214
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,980
I have a girlfriend now.

215
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,349
My gosh.

216
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,519
I finally told him.

217
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,460
Does that mean today
is our first day together?

218
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,470
What's going on? What brought
such a drastic change in mood?

219
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,069
It's like night and day.

220
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,509
It's like going from a fall-winter
collection to a spring-summer one.

221
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:14,380
By the way, did the two of you not
get a good night's sleep or what?

222
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,119
I didn't get any sleep.

223
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,190
Same here.

224
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,990
Gosh, you two must've gotten
insomnia from Ji Wook.

225
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,930
What that crazy guy said...

226
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,230
keeps bothering me.

227
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:27,529
He said that two people from here
will die.

228
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,970
I think...

229
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:32,640
you and I will be those two people.

230
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,009
Why... Why are you dragging me
into it?

231
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,240
Oh, I guess none of you
have heard the news about...

232
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,509
What news?

233
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:41,509
It's nothing.

234
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,750
Don't cry so much, Mr. No.

235
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,089
Everything will be okay.

236
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,890
Anyhow, from now on...
No matter what happens,

237
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,059
no one can talk about anyone dying.

238
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,859
- Just don't talk about it, okay?
- By the way,

239
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,400
did I tell you that my doctor
wants to me to get tests done again?

240
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:07,069
Gosh, I must be terminally ill...

241
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:09,670
Mr. No just said that we can't
talk about things like that.

242
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,009
You always have to cut me off
like that, don't you?

243
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,579
With all due respect...

244
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,779
Don't even begin if you have any
respect.

245
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,380
Our meeting is going nowhere.

246
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,619
Why are you trying to blame me?
It's all your fault.

247
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,319
Today, it's your fault.

248
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:24,619
Be quiet! Go get me a glass of
water. I need to take my medication.

249
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,890
The older you get, the more you need
to move around to stay healthy.

250
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,890
Hey, Ms. Lack of Evidence!

251
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:31,559
- Yes?
- Goodness.

252
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,769
Young people these days...
I should try to be understanding.

253
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:38,670
What? What is it?

254
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,269
- What is it?
- Well...

255
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,269
You know...

256
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,980
I told you about my family,

257
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,779
didn't I?

258
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,809
Yes, you told me.

259
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,990
My parents' friends who raised me...

260
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,359
are now my legal guardians.
I told you...

261
00:21:58,819 --> 00:21:59,819
about them too, right?

262
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,160
Yes, you did.

263
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,890
I really think they are like angels.

264
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,200
But I didn't tell you...

265
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,000
who they are.

266
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
No.

267
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,299
Who are they?

268
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,940
One of them is Mr. Byun.

269
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,410
I see. Mr. Byun?

270
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
Mister...

271
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:26,880
Mr. Byun?

272
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,650
Yes.

273
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,920
- It's him.
- I know you.

274
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,089
You are a murderer.

275
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:36,089
Ms. Lack of Evidence.
Ms. Lack of Evidence!

276
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,190
We have a secretary.

277
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:38,299
It's Ms. Lack of Evidence.

278
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:41,470
Ms. Lack of Evidence,
you lost my trial!

279
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,970
Hey! Look at you.

280
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,769
Are you all right?

281
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,170
We are doomed.

282
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,119
I do think we are doomed.

283
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,390
What are you up to?

284
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,789
Why are you smiling?

285
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:11,460
I'm not up to anything.

286
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,460
Don't smile.

287
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,500
It makes me feel sick.

288
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,970
I'm done.

289
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,880
I'm finished.

290
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:50,869
Yes?

291
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,940
What?

292
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,210
You found him?

293
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:59,210
Thank you for contacting me.

294
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:01,750
Okay. All right.

295
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,349
Nice!

296
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:20,759
Whom did they find?

297
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,670
By any chance, were you still
investigating Jung Hyun Soo?

298
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,809
To be more precise,

299
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:33,880
I found the identity
of the man in the photo.

300
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,519
I explicitly told you to stop
investigating him temporarily.

301
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,990
So you don't want me to brief you?

302
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,960
Well... I mean...

303
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:51,900
It'd be rude if I don't hear your
report since you investigated.

304
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,059
You don't need to be so formal
between us.

305
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,069
You don't need to hear it.

306
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:56,329
No, no.

307
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,269
I'd like to hear your report.
Please tell me.

308
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,720
- I met Ko Chan Ho's teacher.
- I will look into that.

309
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,579
Thank you.

310
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,049
Did he have any close friends?

311
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:16,950
- I went to the youth club...
- Well, I don't know.

312
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,859
he went during his high school days.

313
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Finally,

314
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,829
I received a call.

315
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:26,099
He was in a senior class
in Ko Chan Ho's high school.

316
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,829
There was a reason why I couldn't
find him in the year book.

317
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,599
The years they graduated high
school were all different.

318
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:32,569
But what on earth...

319
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,470
happened between them?

320
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,710
Firstly,

321
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:39,640
I will meet with Kim Min Gu.

322
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,809
Since I found out who he is,

323
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:43,109
I'm sure I can find out
his address and contact quickly.

324
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,519
Hello?

325
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,349
It's me.

326
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:54,359
We just identified the body
in the water tank.

327
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,329
Luckily, he was in the database
of the missing person.

328
00:25:58,329 --> 00:25:59,960
We found his identity quite fast.

329
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,329
No, we only identified one body,
not all of them.

330
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:07,670
- His name is Kim Min Gu.
- Kim Min Gu.

331
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:10,640
How did you know?

332
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,240
On what date was the missing
person report filed?

333
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,480
(Status of Ko
Chan Ho's disappearance)

334
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,079
Ko Chan Ho, the forensic officer,

335
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,980
said he wanted to give Bong Hee
information about the real killer.

336
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,250
After that, he's gone missing.

337
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,619
And this man.

338
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,789
This man was recently found
dead in the water tank...

339
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,390
on the roof top of the apartment.

340
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,690
When did he disappear?

341
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,900
The date of his disappearance is...

342
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:33,859
falls around the same time of
the murder of Jang Hee Jun.

343
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:34,859
Which means...

344
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,269
Everything is connected.

345
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,170
And this is the murder weapon
used in Jang Hee Jun's murder.

346
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,869
The size of the murder weapon
happens to match the size of the...

347
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:42,869
weapon used in Chef Yang's murder.

348
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:45,109
This implies the murderer
of these two cases is the same.

349
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:46,910
- That's right. He is...
- Jung Hyun Soo.

350
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,150
Jung Hyun Soo was listening
to the same song...

351
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,880
that I heard on the night
of Hee Jun's murder.

352
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:55,150
We don't have...

353
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,549
any physical evidence, do we?

354
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,690
No. None at all.

355
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,660
First, we should find that man.

356
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,059
But...

357
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,859
what if something bad happened
to that guy too?

358
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,230
Nothing might have happened to him.

359
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:09,970
We should have hope
and look for him.

360
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:12,269
No.

361
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:14,970
We are going to stop
everything here.

362
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:18,069
We are civilians
without any investigative right.

363
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,440
I am going to let the prosecution
take over.

364
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,809
Which means...

365
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,849
everyone in this room...

366
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,849
cannot make a rash move...

367
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:27,819
or do something.

368
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,619
I agree with Ji Wook on this.

369
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,420
I will notify Prosecutor Cha.

370
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,490
All right. That's all.

371
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,240
Are you feeling all right?

372
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,369
That's a relief.

373
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,680
Yes.

374
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,549
Don't look back.

375
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,450
I don't even want to see it.

376
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:10,789
Prosecutor Cha.

377
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,029
I'm glad I caught you.
I came here to see you.

378
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,230
Why? You said you wanted
to meet only coincidentally.

379
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,539
Why did you contact me?

380
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,410
- Then should I not?
- I didn't say that.

381
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,339
Well, it's nice...

382
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,750
if you want to get in touch with me.

383
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:30,880
Goodness, Yoo Jung.

384
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:35,849
Hello, Ms. Na.

385
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:39,089
Hello, Mr. Ji.

386
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,690
Let go. I said let go.

387
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,099
- You need to let go first.
- Hold on. Wait!

388
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,960
- Darn it.
- All right. There you go.

389
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:51,230
Have a good day then.

390
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:53,599
I need to talk to you.

391
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:54,799
Okay.

392
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,210
What was that?

393
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,509
I think he just laughed at me.

394
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,049
No way. He couldn't have.

395
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,190
You are suspecting Jung Hyun Soo
to be the murderer?

396
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,690
Well, not exactly.

397
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,730
So far, we just think that he has
something to do with the murders.

398
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,539
To be honest,

399
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:34,009
something about him
didn't sit right with me.

400
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,279
I see.

401
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
So?

402
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:40,720
What do you really want to tell me?

403
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,849
We need the authority
to investigate.

404
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,920
There's nothing we can do.

405
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Okay.

406
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:50,289
By the way,

407
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,559
why are you guys involved
in the case this deeply?

408
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,259
Is it about justice?

409
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,470
Or...

410
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,099
is it about Bong Hee?

411
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,299
Can't it be both?

412
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,410
I feel terrible.

413
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:08,109
I feel like I have
been just replaced.

414
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,380
Regardless of my wrongdoings,
I have lost you guys,

415
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,519
and now I have
to investigate for her.

416
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:16,750
What should I do? Should I look
for another prosecutor?

417
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,450
No.

418
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
I'll do it.

419
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,430
But...

420
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,430
don't be so harsh on me.

421
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,930
You know that you guys are
the only friends I have.

422
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,970
Please look into this case for us.

423
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,380
But...

424
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,380
you shouldn't personally handle it.

425
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,980
Jung Hyun Soo is dangerous.

426
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:52,059
You know there are strong
and experienced investigators.

427
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,359
Ask them to help you.

428
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,259
I'm also strong and experienced.

429
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,029
I can take care of myself
and protect others.

430
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
You know me.

431
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,970
Right, I know you.

432
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,400
I might have gone a bit far.

433
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,980
Be careful.

434
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,380
I'm serious.

435
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,349
Being careful won't cause any harm.

436
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:20,549
I'm going now.

437
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,230
Still nothing?

438
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:32,029
The weapon wasn't caught on any
of the CCTV cameras in the area...

439
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:33,500
around the time of the incident.

440
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,730
It happened at night,
and the angle wasn't ideal either.

441
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,970
We also searched the area, but
we couldn't find anything.

442
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,910
We'd like to know where he was
before he got arrested.

443
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,940
Could we get that information?

444
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:48,910
You don't have to tag along
like this.

445
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:50,509
I'll figure it out on my own
from here on.

446
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:51,579
What will you do now, then?

447
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:53,980
I need to find the weapon.

448
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,049
All by yourself?

449
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:57,789
That's nonsense. Even the police
haven't been able to find it.

450
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,720
If that jerk gets released from the
holding cell with no weapon found,

451
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,460
I know exactly what he's
going to do.

452
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,289
He'll go to see her
and do something crazy again.

453
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,900
You're right. That's highly likely.

454
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,529
- But still...
- We should still...

455
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,069
try our best with whatever it is
that we can do.

456
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,539
All right. Good luck with it.

457
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,799
Thanks.

458
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,250
Let's go and find that weapon.

459
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,910
Goodness.

460
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,359
Didn't it happen over there?

461
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,789
Yes.

462
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,660
It was right here.

463
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,000
Then...

464
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,809
They said he went in there, right?

465
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,609
Do you think he could've
left it in there?

466
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,250
If you go in there,

467
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:32,680
it could be seen as trespassing on
public property for sexual purposes.

468
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,470
Darn it. Goodness.

469
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,470
There's nothing.

470
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:58,539
Let's go.

471
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,260
It happened quite long ago.
I'm sure...

472
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,659
All the garbage from that time
must've been picked up already.

473
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,070
Are you really sure?

474
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,659
Let's go.

475
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,309
There's certainly a problem here.

476
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,679
Hey, you guys are back.

477
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:12,480
Gosh, what on earth happened?
What is this stink?

478
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,380
Right? They really stink.

479
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,260
I feel like throwing up.
Isn't it so bad?

480
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,659
I don't smell anything.

481
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,230
Anyway, that's not
important right now.

482
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,460
We couldn't find the weapon.

483
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,030
We have less than 24 hours now.

484
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,570
Oh, your friend's case, right?

485
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:33,670
What about the witness?

486
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,940
Not yet. I know which school
she goes to because of her uniform,

487
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,039
but I haven't been able to track
her down among all the students.

488
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:41,539
I see.

489
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,849
By the way, I'm getting...

490
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,750
a bad feeling about this case.

491
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,780
I feel like that jerk was determined
to harm her.

492
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,090
Don't cry so much,

493
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:53,760
Mr. No.

494
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:56,360
No, nothing will happen. Everything
will be fine. That can't be.

495
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,730
- Pardon?
- What?

496
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,900
What? Oh, I was just saying
you should go wash up.

497
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,070
We should wash up for everything
to be okay. What I mean is...

498
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,969
we won't get sick because we'll
get rid of all the germs. Let's go.

499
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:10,670
Don't you smell anything?

500
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,840
Thank goodness.

501
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,039
They'll wash up.

502
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,039
Thank goodness indeed.

503
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:17,179
Where's the air freshener?

504
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,260
Alibi...

505
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,360
I need an alibi.

506
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,579
No, I need to nail down
on the order first.

507
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:52,250
Who should go first?

508
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:03,360
If we can't find the weapon
or any witness,

509
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,460
it'll be considered
a simple assault case,

510
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,000
and he'll just get a fine.

511
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,900
Right.
That's why we have to find it.

512
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,269
Yes, we have to find it. We must.

513
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:16,070
By the way, why are you guys still
working at this late hour?

514
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,440
We have a lot of work, Ji Wook.

515
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,840
Unlike someone.

516
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,940
That's right.

517
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,250
Okay, fine.
Let's say that is the case.

518
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:28,119
But what I'm saying is,
you can work on it at home.

519
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:30,289
Why do you guys have to be working
here until this late today?

520
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,019
Today is the first day.

521
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,789
No, it's not.
It's the middle of the month.

522
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,489
My credit card payment
was taken out yesterday.

523
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:37,260
By "first day", do you mean...

524
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,659
- that kind of "first day"?
- What do you mean?

525
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,239
Hey, go find the witness.

526
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:49,039
You'll find a clue if you watch the
CCTV footage until your eyes hurt.

527
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,409
I told you that I'm busy.

528
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,679
All right. I'll help you like the
last time if you refuse to help us.

529
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:54,280
For goodness' sake.

530
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,510
I'll try to track her down
using social media.

531
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:57,780
You said she's in high school.

532
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,449
Using social media will be
the best bet.

533
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,320
How can we use it to find her?

534
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:05,050
Well, we can look up
the school's name as a hashtag...

535
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,920
and see if anything about the case
has been posted.

536
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,659
If that doesn't work, we can post...

537
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:10,989
a notice about looking for her
with the school's name as a hashtag.

538
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,730
You guys are not following, are you?

539
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,570
Don't you use social media?

540
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,539
Are you really not on things like
Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter?

541
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,710
Bong Hee, you don't use it either?

542
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,809
That's how people keep a record of
their daily experiences these days.

543
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,820
Oh, I keep a journal.
I handwrite it though.

544
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,619
- My goodness.
- Hey, and...

545
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:40,019
Alex Ferguson said that social media
is a waste of time.

546
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:41,059
That is true.

547
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:44,190
I see. All right.

548
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:47,059
Then I'll go waste my time
and use social media...

549
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,599
in order to track down that girl
all on my own.

550
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:52,900
Gosh, you guys are seriously...
Good grief.

551
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,570
You guys sure blow my mind.

552
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:56,369
They're such nerds.

553
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,940
Right, social media. That's it.

554
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,639
Goodness.

555
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:01,639
They should just go home.

556
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,880
Darn it.

557
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:26,070
Today must've been
stressful for you.

558
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:29,239
Don't worry about it.
But I must say,

559
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,210
going through the dumpster
was a bit much.

560
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:35,679
Which tea do you want?

561
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,010
Anything.

562
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,650
Anything? Okay.

563
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,429
Thanks for everything today.

564
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,269
Look at you.

565
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:01,269
Come here.

566
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,940
Come...

567
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,909
That's enough
to celebrate our first day.

568
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:14,179
She's pretty good at this.

569
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,050
That girl.

570
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:24,989
Don't work too hard.

571
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,550
You can drink this. Hey, drink it.

572
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,889
Gosh, this is bitter. What is it?

573
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,329
Is this drinkable?

574
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,599
What is this?

575
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,250
Tomorrow, I have to find the weapon,
a witness, or something...

576
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,480
and have a warrant issued.

577
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,059
Focus on. Look.

578
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,699
Take the photo and upload it.

579
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,570
- Is that it?
- Yes.

580
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:47,210
Come on. Try it.
I'm going to check.

581
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,539
Okay.

582
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,420
- Take the photo.
- Take the photo.

583
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:57,050
- Upload it.
- Gosh, it worked.

584
00:41:57,489 --> 00:41:59,920
Goodness, it was uploaded.

585
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:03,829
(Hello)

586
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,130
(This is so interesting!)

587
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,699
Ta-da. I liked your photo.

588
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:11,869
So did I.

589
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,639
I also liked my own photo.

590
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:19,139
- This is new.
- I like this.

591
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:21,539
Eun Hyuk, I liked your photo too.

592
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:23,780
I have two likes.

593
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,820
Ms. Eun, you look
good in the photo.

594
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,019
(Dongbang High School)

595
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:34,960
- Look at him.
- Gosh, you are so handsome.

596
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,030
He's amazingly hot.

597
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:37,360
He's so good looking.

598
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:50,610
I see.

599
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:53,510
You guys are the ones who
wrote comments online, right?

600
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:57,650
What's up?

601
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,980
You are not that bad to look at.

602
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,179
Well, I have great looks actually.

603
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,420
What am I saying?

604
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,289
To you guys, I shouldn't act like
your peers. I'm an adult after all.

605
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:09,730
Anyhow,

606
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:12,860
there was someone
who witnessed...

607
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,329
an assault the night
before yesterday around here?

608
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,570
Yes, but she won't testify.

609
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,070
Leave that to me.

610
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:23,010
Where can I find her?

611
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,320
I'm glad I caught you, Ji Hye.
I needed to talk to you.

612
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:35,119
What is it?

613
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:38,349
Don't try to assault me again.
Just tell me.

614
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:41,159
When did I assault you?

615
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,159
What do you think about the crimes
committed after breakups...

616
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,260
that are on the rise nowadays?

617
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,530
Are you here to tell me you broke up
with Hee Jun because of me...

618
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,969
and physically abuse me again?

619
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:56,670
How did you become a prosecutor
with that head of yours?

620
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,980
I feel extremely uncomfortable...

621
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:02,750
to hear that from you. Are you aware
of that?

622
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:04,280
Obviously, I'm not.

623
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,019
You don't know the number of people
who reported their loved ones...

624
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:12,690
for abusive relationships for the
last 5 years is over 30,000, right?

625
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,019
I don't run the statistics.
How would I know that?

626
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:18,889
Average of seven women per month
are dead due to dating violence.

627
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:21,460
You ought to know this
as a prosecutor.

628
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,030
So what do you want from me?

629
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:30,369
Gather up all the related
previous cases...

630
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:31,969
and run an investigation for me.

631
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,440
Get some attention
to your investigation.

632
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,780
Inform the public of precautions.

633
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,280
I have a suitable case
to hand you over.

634
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,920
If you look into other cases, I'm
sure you'll find more cases.

635
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,250
Hey, this isn't easy.

636
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:47,219
I know that crimes committed
after breakups are problems.

637
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:50,329
There are no legal acts that can
prevent the crimes from happening.

638
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:54,059
Besides, they have to commit
crimes for me to arrest...

639
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:57,030
and punish them. What can I do
before the crimes even occur?

640
00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:00,570
I knew it. You are not capable
of this. It was a waste of time.

641
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:02,269
- Hey!
- What?

642
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,349
There are only 2 hours left
until we reach the 48th hour.

643
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,130
(Attorney No Ji Wook)

644
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,360
Yes, Mr. Ji.

645
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,730
Yes. Should I go?

646
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,570
I see. Then I will go
see Yeon Woo then.

647
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,440
Yes. Okay, I got it.

648
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,579
Thank you so much.

649
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,280
Okay.

650
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,980
Mr. Ji is doing his best
for this case.

651
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,550
I'm so touched.

652
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:51,989
He is.

653
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,719
He is indeed.

654
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,829
What about me?

655
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:04,869
What about me? I'm doing
my hardest too.

656
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,840
(Investigator Bang Eun Ho)

657
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:21,250
I told you to look into and save
all the text messages...

658
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:25,250
and letters Choi Yeon Woo
received, right?

659
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,059
Yes, I did those.

660
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:30,789
You did? Okay. Good job.

661
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,059
I'm going to meet Yeon Woo later.

662
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,800
My instincts tell me that I should
be with her today.

663
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,409
I'll come with you.

664
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,579
What? I'll be all right.

665
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,750
My instincts tell me...

666
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,579
that I should come with you.

667
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:06,659
What?

668
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,010
Yes, this is Bang Eun Ho speaking.

669
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,750
You found him?

670
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,280
Okay.

671
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,789
I see.

672
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,559
He recently came to Korea. I see.

673
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:37,789
His name is Lee Jae Ho?

674
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,699
Do you have his number and address?

675
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,829
Okay.

676
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,000
Yes. Thank you.

677
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,610
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

678
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:59,980
We are civilians
without any investigative authority.

679
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,219
I'm going to let the prosecution
take over.

680
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:05,920
Which means
everyone in this room...

681
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,260
cannot make a rash move
or do something.

682
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,670
After your message, press the star
or the sharp button.

683
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,670
(Attorney No Ji Wook)

684
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,969
I'm on my way
to Lee Jae Ho, Mr. No.

685
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,710
You know the other man
in Ko Chan Ho's photo?

686
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:25,269
I found his whereabouts.

687
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:28,139
He has been abroad until recently
and just moved back to Korea.

688
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,880
I think that I should make a move
before Jung Hyun Soo gets to him.

689
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:35,449
I will leave you his number
and address just in case.

690
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,849
Bye.

691
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,019
Can he go there by himself?

692
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,360
I told him not to do this.
Goodness, Mr. Bang.

693
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,000
Should I call him?

694
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,699
He'll go even if we try to stop him.

695
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:50,730
It's not like we don't
know how he is.

696
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:54,139
Then go to Mr. Bang.

697
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:55,699
I will go to Yeon Woo.

698
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:58,869
Do you think you'll be okay alone?

699
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,909
Of course. Don't worry.

700
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,909
Goodness.

701
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,849
Okay. Let's do that.

702
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,920
Okay.

703
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,630
I'll call you, and you should
give me a call too, okay?

704
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:19,659
I will.

705
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,130
Bong Hee.

706
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,099
Be careful.

707
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:32,170
Don't worry.

708
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,429
- Hey, Yeon Woo.
- Bong Hee!

709
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,130
You didn't have to come.

710
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,840
Come on, that's nonsense.

711
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:03,539
An attorney must protect
her client.

712
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,880
Follow me. I'll protect you tonight.

713
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,880
- Let's go.
- Let's get going.

714
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:12,780
Are you done for the night?

715
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:21,360
(My friends are so pretty!)

716
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,059
Come on.

717
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,730
Shoot.

718
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Yes, Detective.

719
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:32,400
I know that our 48 hours are up.

720
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:35,570
Please, give us a bit more time.

721
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,039
I want to hold him
for a longer time too,

722
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:40,739
but I can't hold him for more
than 48 hours.

723
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,949
I really believe that
I can meet up with the witness.

724
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,179
I don't even need that much time.
Please give me a bit more time.

725
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,750
She's here. I just met her.

726
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,360
Detective, please do me a favor.
Okay?

727
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:56,059
Hello.

728
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,829
Do you know how long I've waited
for you?

729
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,130
Me?

730
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,530
Who are you?

731
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,730
Anyway, thank you so much
for coming.

732
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:08,340
So can you spare me some time to
do a good deed?

733
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,039
They won't issue an arrest warrant,
so you'll be out in no time.

734
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:15,309
Don't worry. You just need to wait.

735
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:16,909
I'll trust that I'm in good hands.

736
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:17,909
Okay.

737
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,820
Excuse me, sir.

738
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,550
- Are you talking to me?
- What will happen to a guy like me?

739
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,760
Will I go straight to prison?

740
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,960
I don't defend people for free.

741
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,699
I heard that he's been locked up for
more than 48 hours.

742
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:42,340
Why are you still keeping him there?

743
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:45,139
- Well, it's because...
- You can't do this.

744
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:47,579
You can't do this to a civilian
without a warrant.

745
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:48,780
What you're doing is illegal.

746
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,050
Why can't you testify?

747
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:59,050
I was only there to witness that
because I skipped a class.

748
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,460
If my mom finds out about that
after I testify,

749
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,559
she'll kill me.

750
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:08,429
I'll make sure she never finds out.

751
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:10,000
My mom knows everything.

752
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,130
I see.

753
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,940
Okay.

754
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:18,340
Then I'll just tell her everything.

755
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:19,639
What?

756
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:20,840
You skipped class that day,

757
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,809
and you came out early today
to do the same thing.

758
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,750
I'm going to tell your mom
everything...

759
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,909
if you don't testify.

760
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:35,219
By the way,

761
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,429
is she okay?
She got stabbed with a knife.

762
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,230
You saw a knife?

763
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,500
Yes.

764
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:43,230
Then did you see what he did
with that knife?

765
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:44,599
Did you see where he threw it away?

766
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,429
Yes, I did.

767
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,940
He put it inside his cast.

768
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:58,809
Yes, this is Ji Eun Hyuk.

769
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,679
I already found the witness.

770
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,820
The weapon is in...

771
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,519
The suspect got released?

772
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:14,230
I'll walk you home tomorrow too.

773
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,300
How will you go home?

774
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,070
You don't need to worry about me.

775
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,530
Yeon Woo.

776
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,670
- Stay behind me.
- Oh, gosh.

777
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,670
Stay there.

778
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:32,679
Bong Hee. Bong Hee.

779
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,619
- Hey, are you okay?
- I told you to stay behind me.

780
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:45,030
(Ji Eun Hyuk)

781
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,630
Hey, what did the witness say?

782
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:50,630
I found...

783
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:51,869
the weapon.

784
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,699
Where?

785
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,800
He hid it inside his cast.

786
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,909
- What?
- But there's a problem.

787
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:01,510
It's been more than 48 hours,
so he got released.

788
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,449
- He's probably...
- You should've told me that first.

789
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:05,510
Okay, I got it.

790
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,150
My gosh.

791
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:21,059
Bong Hee. Bong Hee.

792
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,329
Bong Hee. I'm her guardian.
Get out of my way.

793
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:26,599
Bong Hee. Hey, Bong Hee.

794
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:27,769
Are you...

795
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,539
Mr. No.

796
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:33,840
Are you okay?

797
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:37,780
I'm okay. It just brushed against
my arm.

798
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,420
- Hey, you. Get over here.
- Stop, Mr. No.

799
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,050
I'm really okay.

800
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:48,420
I'm fine. I'm okay.

801
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:52,059
Are you sure you're okay?

802
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,500
Okay.

803
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:56,630
Gosh.

804
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,309
I'm relieved.

805
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,340
Hey, wait.

806
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,210
Where's Mr. Bang?

807
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:15,880
I was on my way there,

808
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,590
but I came here as soon as
I got a call from Eun Hyuk

809
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:21,320
Then you should go to him right now.

810
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:24,929
Okay.

811
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:29,630
Eun Hyuk will be here soon, so ask
him for help if anything happens.

812
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,599
- Okay?
- Okay. You should hurry up and go.

813
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,739
Please look after her.

814
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,039
