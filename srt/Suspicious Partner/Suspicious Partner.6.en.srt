1
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,840
- You're back.
- Yes.

2
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,469
Let me see your face.

3
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,880
No, it's okay. Go away.

4
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:40,479
I've been staying up until now
to see your face.

5
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,009
You have to show me...
Got you!

6
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,859
The score was about 30 to 2.

7
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:59,700
It was a very fierce fight. They hit
us 30 times when I hit them twice.

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,810
Gosh, what kind of scums
did this to you?

9
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,510
You don't need to know.
They're just jerks.

10
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,750
Call me next time. You know I'm
a fourth-degree taekwondo master.

11
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:25,920
Be gentle.

12
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,230
The other side too.

13
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,540
Sometimes, it doesn't look like
he suffers from insomnia.

14
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,810
This is the definition
of the word "beginning".

15
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,699
The first step
of an act or a circumstance.

16
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,139
Or the first step of an emotion.

17
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:51,479
(The Beginning That Hasn't Begun)

18
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,069
Well.

19
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,580
Don't get the wrong idea.

20
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,310
Why? What is it?

21
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,780
What do you mean why?

22
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,250
I don't know what you are
telling me not to do.

23
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,460
I just told you not to get the wrong
idea since it was nothing.

24
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,129
If you ask me that question, I don't
know how to respond to that.

25
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:44,930
Teasing you is fun.

26
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,000
Hey, I've been too nice to you,
haven't I?

27
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,599
Not really.

28
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,300
- You think I'm easy.
- I'm comfortable with you.

29
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,340
I'm the CEO and
you are a mere employee.

30
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,580
I forgot for a moment
that you...

31
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,610
trample on people with your status.

32
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,449
Really? Let me refresh
your memory...

33
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,150
of the days
when you were a trainee.

34
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,250
I'll behave now.

35
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,780
You knew you were misbehaving.

36
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,250
I'm sorry. I overstepped my boundary
because I was hyper.

37
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,689
Are you drunk? Why are you hyper?

38
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:13,520
I'm not drunk. I was hyper
because I was in a good mood.

39
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,600
I didn't get to thank you properly.
Thank you.

40
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,699
You always rescue me whenever
I'm at a dead end.

41
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,870
Pay me back with hard work.

42
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,569
I'll do my best.

43
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,310
Okay. Do your best.

44
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,220
Make sure you lock your door.
I might accidentally go in.

45
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,420
I was kidding. I was hyper.

46
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,120
Darn it. Why do you
keep getting hyper?

47
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,740
(Congratulations on getting hired
and becoming a hostage.)

48
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,480
Nice.

49
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,319
This is our very first meeting
at last.

50
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:25,430
The beginning is...

51
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:28,029
- always thrilling.
- You're not going to fire her?

52
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,839
Why are you glaring at me?
Ms. Lack of Evidence.

53
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,709
We are feeling a bit fierce
from the start, aren't we?

54
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,439
Should I brief you on recruiting
first?

55
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,509
- Please.
- We need secretaries, clerks...

56
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,449
We have a secretary,
Ms. Lack of Evidence.

57
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,949
I'm an attorney with a proper
license.

58
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:48,220
You'll be both. If you don't
like it, pay for your position.

59
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,949
Who would pay
for his or her position at work?

60
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,819
You should do that because...

61
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:54,389
you will bring our firm
only negative effects.

62
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,199
I'll make the profits,
Chairman Byun.

63
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,100
All right. You are our only hope.

64
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:05,970
That's why you should make
me a named partner.

65
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,310
Instead of "No Ji Wook Law Firm",
make it "Ji and No".

66
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:12,509
Should it be "No and Ji" instead?

67
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,449
We should go ahead
with "Byun and No".

68
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,750
Then Chairman Byun, we should
go with "No, Ji, and Byun".

69
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,350
If you're going to include
everyone's name, then add mine too.

70
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,189
"No, Ji, Byun, Eun, and Bang".

71
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,160
I added my last name too.

72
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,459
Let's move onto the next agenda.

73
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,860
- The next agenda is...
- By the way,

74
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,600
what happened to your faces?
Did you have a fight?

75
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,600
No, we just had to teach
20 or 30 high school juveniles.

76
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,709
As for me, I won a fight
against 37 people all by myself.

77
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,480
- Did you just laugh at me?
- Did I?

78
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,139
It was a rainy night.

79
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,949
There were 37 thugs
in our neighborhood.

80
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,079
The beginning...

81
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,180
is often quite clumsy.

82
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:54,519
But this is...

83
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,720
worse than being clumsy.

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,889
This is a mess!

85
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,189
Get to work!

86
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,279
What's your relationship with her?

87
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,720
What? What do you mean?

88
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,519
I saw everything earlier.

89
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,819
Can't you hear me?

90
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,160
Hire Eun Hyuk!

91
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,259
Up to you.

92
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:36,589
What?

93
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,829
That brat.

94
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,470
What?

95
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,240
Why is she coming out of there?

96
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,839
Are you living with her?

97
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,980
She had nowhere to go,
so I'm just letting her stay here.

98
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,149
It's okay.

99
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,819
You can be honest with me.

100
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,819
Is there really nothing going on
between you two?

101
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
Yes.

102
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:13,699
Ms. Eun!

103
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,540
Where have you been?

104
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,069
I ran a small errand for Mr. Bang.
I also needed to get something.

105
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,639
Bye, then.

106
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:24,709
Hey.

107
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,850
You know what happened between
me and Ji Wook, right?

108
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,120
Whom should I badmouth for you?

109
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,350
A friend of mine.

110
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,799
That friend who was with
Yoo Jung...

111
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,899
that night.

112
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,200
You're very quick-witted.

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,440
It's both my strength and weakness.

114
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:55,840
People don't like that
I'm quick-witted.

115
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,919
Ji Wook called me thanks to you.

116
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,450
He wanted me to defend your case.

117
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,730
I guess...

118
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,259
I became a murder suspect
in order to help you guys...

119
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,830
get back in touch.

120
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:22,470
That's right. I really can't
thank you enough.

121
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,110
I know you hate me,

122
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,539
but don't hate me too much.

123
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,649
It wasn't even my love affair.
I have no right to hate you.

124
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,950
I really don't like
jerks and wenches who...

125
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,090
I really don't like people who cheat
on their significant other.

126
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,730
But why are you always
joking around and laughing?

127
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,960
If I don't joke around,

128
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,970
how will I be able to
hang around Ji Wook?

129
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,269
I don't know...

130
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,179
any other way.

131
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,879
I guess I was meant to be an
attorney.

132
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,889
I really can't picture myself as
a prosecutor or judge.

133
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,090
Instead of accusing and judging
someone of their crime,

134
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,690
I'm the type who'd rather plead
for mercy.

135
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,629
I'm more fit to be an attorney.

136
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,100
It's because you're good-hearted.

137
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,169
My gosh.

138
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,740
My colleagues will laugh
at what you just said.

139
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,240
I'm a murderer. I'm a person
who killed someone.

140
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:45,620
So you ended up kicking
that pervert?

141
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,679
That's right.

142
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,049
Everything got so messed up
because of him.

143
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,419
You're really something.
I admire your courage.

144
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,190
They seem close.

145
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,159
No way.

146
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,529
Are you jealous?

147
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,440
My gosh, that's nonsense.

148
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,370
If Bong Hee is in her right mind,

149
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,740
she'd never become friends
with a jerk like Eun Hyuk...

150
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,450
What's with everyone today?

151
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,320
Why are you laughing?

152
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,190
Hurry up and tell me.

153
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,789
- Well, it's not...
- Gosh, it's cold!

154
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:27,789
- Hey, hey.
- Gosh.

155
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,889
You're spraying water on me.

156
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,730
What's wrong with you, Ji Wook?

157
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,059
Mr. No?

158
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,330
Hey, hey!

159
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,529
What's wrong with you?

160
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,539
I... I'm going to go in now.

161
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,340
Hey, stop.
You're getting my suit wet.

162
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:45,039
My gosh, stop it.

163
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,610
Hey! It's cold!

164
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,179
Did you finish your training?

165
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,190
Yes.

166
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,820
Our boss is here.

167
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,059
Hello.

168
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,429
Thank you so much. Nobody would
hire me at my age.

169
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,529
Darn it.

170
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,230
It's nice to meet you.

171
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:14,240
"Darn it. It's nice to meet you?"

172
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,539
I tend to curse when I'm nervous.

173
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,710
Are you sure that we've never met?

174
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,450
Miss.

175
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,220
Look at me in the eyes.

176
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,450
Look at me in the eyes
and answer me.

177
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,190
Is it really your first time
seeing me?

178
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,190
I feel like...

179
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,789
I was born again.

180
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,330
My goodness, you're funny.

181
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,830
You are a newborn baby.

182
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,629
Why don't you cry like one?

183
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:44,440
But then again, newborn babies
do tend to have a lot of wrinkles.

184
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,169
What an old and brazen newborn baby.

185
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,610
Let's welcome her with an applause.

186
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,149
Miss,

187
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,620
you better watch out.

188
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,049
I'm the incarnation of revenge.

189
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,159
My gosh, this is so frustrating.

190
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,190
My goodness.

191
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,059
But I'm going to let it go.

192
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,139
I look forward to working
with you, ma'am.

193
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,370
I'm a very diligent worker.

194
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,970
I may be old, but I make sure
to keep a neat appearance.

195
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,440
I live from hand to mouth, you see.

196
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,850
I can't afford to lose
a month's pay.

197
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:33,049
My husband doesn't earn
a single penny and lies in bed.

198
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,990
But I still need to provide for him
because he's my husband.

199
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,120
My daughter's trying her best,

200
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,220
but she doesn't have
a stable job yet.

201
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,330
As a parent, the least I could do...

202
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,990
is to provide for myself.

203
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,529
That's why I changed my mind...

204
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,629
and decided to stay.

205
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,370
Why are you so pitiful?

206
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,740
I know.

207
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:54,340
I feel sorry for you,

208
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,470
but I also feel annoyed by you.
This is confusing me.

209
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,539
I know.

210
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:01,450
I'd also love to be arrogant
without having to be so pitiful.

211
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:03,909
Just like someone I know.

212
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:04,950
Hey!

213
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:08,620
What should I do first?

214
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,690
I don't know.
Just find something to do.

215
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,090
My goodness, you must've eaten
a lot of chicken and pizza.

216
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,629
You have such a strong voice.

217
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,730
Well, yes.
Our pizza tastes delicious.

218
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,100
Wait a minute.

219
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,000
What does that have anything
to do with my voice?

220
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,039
Exactly.

221
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,710
My gosh.

222
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:31,009
My gosh, she doesn't know
how to step back.

223
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:34,350
My goodness. Hey, Mom and Dad.

224
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,149
I heard other people look out for
their children from above.

225
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,049
Why did you have to send me here
to work for that wench?

226
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,450
Hello.

227
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:46,190
They haven't caught the culprit yet.

228
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,360
What? That's so scary.

229
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:57,269
("The Celebrity Chef's Death
Has Left Everyone in a Big Shock")

230
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,799
What do you think the reason is?

231
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,340
Why would someone kill a person?

232
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I'm not sure.

233
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:09,110
I guess everybody has their
own situation and reason.

234
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,950
What kind of situation
can justify a murder?

235
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,590
A woman's revenge.

236
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,730
A reasonable punishment.

237
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,139
Hey.

238
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,970
(Deuteronomy 22:25)

239
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,240
"But if a man..."

240
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,539
"happens to meet a girl pledged
to be married and rapes her,"

241
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,210
"only the man who has
done this shall die."

242
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,820
Deuteronomy 22:25.

243
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:29,789
A thief.

244
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:31,059
A thief.

245
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,330
A thief. It was done by a thief.

246
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,700
A thief did this.

247
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:42,710
Something expensive.

248
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,240
Something expensive
needs to be gone.

249
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,909
Mr. Jung Hyun Soo.

250
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:53,649
You're under arrest
for the murder of Yang Jin Woo.

251
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,250
You have the right to an attorney...

252
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,419
and to resist
an unlawful apprehension.

253
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,829
How do you feel at the moment?

254
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,000
- What's your motive?
- Say a few words.

255
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,029
- Why did you kill him?
- Please say a few words!

256
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,000
Please step back.

257
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,710
I heard you kept denying
when the police interrogated you.

258
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,819
There's a witness who saw you
on the day of the incident.

259
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:33,190
You used to deliver packages
to residents in Dong A Building One.

260
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,859
Because of that,
one of the residents...

261
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,660
recognized you right away.

262
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,599
He's the courier guy.

263
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,029
That's not all.

264
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:45,970
From the
footprints left on the scene...

265
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:49,769
to other evidence and DNA,
everything is pointing at you.

266
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,980
What I'm trying to say is
that denying it is of no use.

267
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:59,650
I'll prosecute you
for robbery and homicide.

268
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:04,349
Are you exercising your right
to remain silent?

269
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,390
I guess you paid attention when they
were reciting the Miranda warning.

270
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,690
(Miranda warning: A right to remain
silent)

271
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:10,890
Well...

272
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,200
You won't believe me
even if I tell you the truth, right?

273
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,769
You're jumping to conclusions
without even trying.

274
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,000
I know that much.

275
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,410
I admit it.

276
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:31,079
I don't believe you,
Mr. Jung Hyun Soo.

277
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:43,430
Will anyone be able to really
understand...

278
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,200
and believe me?

279
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:56,869
Baby, baby, don't

280
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,980
How do the lyrics go?
Well, who cares?

281
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,700
A seasoned driver must be able
to back her car into a parking spot.

282
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,299
Nicely done. Perfect job.
I got it done at one blow.

283
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,309
You get to use a company car?
What a great place to work.

284
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:34,380
I can use it whenever I need it
for work. Isn't it great?

285
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:37,309
I can eat as much pizza as I want.
Isn't it great?

286
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,880
Gosh, that's amazing.

287
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,420
- Get whatever you want.
- What should I get?

288
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,490
You can order everything.

289
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:50,660
The chairman is a man
named Byun Young Hee.

290
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:54,500
His voice is loud,
but he's so petty-minded.

291
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,329
You wouldn't even believe how
petty and small-minded he is.

292
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,799
It blows my mind.

293
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,400
Let me vent to you
about a venomous snake.

294
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,940
Every word my boss utters
is like venom.

295
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,309
My boss too.
Every word he utters is like a bomb.

296
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:06,440
Even her eyes look evil.

297
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,880
My boss' eyes look messed up.

298
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,910
That woman is so cold.

299
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,349
You can feel her cold energy
even when she's 15m away...

300
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,819
The cold energy is...

301
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,390
Is she your daughter?

302
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,329
I didn't know anyone could
become an attorney these days.

303
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,700
Mom. Recently, there was a verdict
that workplace harassment...

304
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:35,569
can be considered
an industrial accident as well.

305
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,579
Just keep that in mind.
Oh, and the Ministry of Labor is...

306
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,980
putting together recommendations for
eliminating workplace harassment.

307
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,819
Are you saying those things
to me right now?

308
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:49,049
Not at all. Why would I?

309
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,920
After bad-mouthing me like that,
you're saying those things to...

310
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:58,430
I think this is about work.

311
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,759
Hello?
Attorney Eun Bong Hee speaking.

312
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,200
- I obviously know who you are.
- Hey, Attorney No!

313
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,339
What? Attorney No?

314
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:06,869
What's up? Get to the point.

315
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,609
Hey, stop being ridiculous and
get yourself back here immediately.

316
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,839
Oh, I totally forgot
about the meeting with our client.

317
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,839
All right.

318
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,710
Is she out of her mind?

319
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,349
Daughter, you're so cool.

320
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,420
Don't forget, Mom.

321
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,589
Workplace harassment can be
considered an industrial accident.

322
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,390
What? That little...

323
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,789
Gosh, she sure takes after you!

324
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,259
Goodness!

325
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,869
The police, who have been
investigating Mr. Jung who was...

326
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:39,339
arrested as a suspect for
the murder of Chef Yang Jin Woo,

327
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,539
sent Mr. Jung to the prosecution
this morning...

328
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,109
for robbery and murder charges.
Those in prosecution are saying...

329
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:47,680
that he is denying the allegation
and that any details...

330
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:52,349
The suspect, Mr. Jung,
wants me to take on the case?

331
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,490
Right.

332
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,289
I heard that you succeeded in
killing your boyfriend.

333
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,930
I know you have your ways. You know
how to get away with murder.

334
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:09,230
People like that do reach out
to me from time to time.

335
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,799
They assume I'm like them just
because I was a murder suspect.

336
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,970
You're useful, Ms. Lack of Evidence.

337
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,839
It could actually help us
promote the firm.

338
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,240
It's all over the media, you know.

339
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
Our firm will surely be well-known.

340
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,640
"Be famous,"

341
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,910
"and they will give you applause
even when you are actually pooping."

342
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,150
Oh, Andy Warhol.

343
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,450
No, it's not.

344
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,779
- He actually never said it.
- See?

345
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,420
Even something you didn't say become
famous when you're famous.

346
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,190
Yes, that's so true.

347
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,660
Gosh, who knew this Ms. Lack
of Evidence here would be so useful?

348
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,660
An attorney who has experience
with being arrested.

349
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,400
You can share your experience
in the detention cell.

350
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,599
An attorney who understands
how killers feel.

351
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,200
I don't. I don't understand them.

352
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:49,339
They keep calling me
Lack of Evidence.

353
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,009
Yes.

354
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,910
All right, Mom.

355
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,950
Okay.

356
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:03,420
Did something happen?

357
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,190
A young woman insulted my mom today.

358
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,890
My gosh, how rude.

359
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,089
What's wrong with people?

360
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,359
What do you need?

361
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,069
Well...

362
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,369
I'm heading out to visit Jung
Hyun Soo. Should I go alone?

363
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,509
Do you know why I quit the firm
and opened my own practice?

364
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,220
- No.
- To make others do all the work.

365
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,720
That's what CEOs do. They suck
the life out of their employees.

366
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,819
Then I'll go, Ji Wook.

367
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,710
Hello.

368
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,779
Hey, Ji Wook! My gosh.

369
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,680
I guess I had that terrible
nightmare last night...

370
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,980
because I'd be running into you
like this.

371
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:08,950
I'll go in first.

372
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,089
I'm sure I hate this more.

373
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,420
Hey, do you bring her everywhere?

374
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,960
Why?

375
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,730
I don't even know.

376
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,609
How have you been, Ms. Cha?

377
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,049
Not well. What about you, Ms. Eun?

378
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,180
I've been very well.

379
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,750
- Good for you.
- It is good.

380
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,690
Let me cut to the chase.
Are you two really going out?

381
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,829
Am I obligated to answer
that question?

382
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:50,430
I do have the right to know.

383
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,799
You talk about that right whenever
you're at a disadvantage.

384
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,630
I'm so annoyed.

385
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,200
Same here.

386
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,339
I really liked you
when I first saw you.

387
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:01,710
Why does it have to be you?

388
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,980
That's what I want to say.
I really liked you too.

389
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:08,250
And why did he have to date
such a pretty woman?

390
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,150
It upsets me so much.

391
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:12,579
What's she saying?

392
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,220
What a bunch of nonsense.

393
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,859
So? You won't tell me?

394
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,930
I asked if you two
are actually dating.

395
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,630
Yes, we are.

396
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,799
It's a lie. I knew it.

397
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,640
No, it's true.

398
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,240
I knew it. With me around,
Ji Wook would never...

399
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,309
Right, you are around.

400
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:44,579
But I chose her.

401
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,190
Oh, right.

402
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,230
Shall we?

403
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:16,180
Hey, hey. Bong Hee, are you okay?

404
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:18,619
Your face looks all weird.

405
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,319
I forget to breathe sometimes.

406
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:26,359
How can you forget to breathe?

407
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,930
Are you giving me a hard time
for acting like your girlfriend?

408
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,059
That's so mean.

409
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,529
Well, you know. I can't turn
my employee into a liar.

410
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,130
I see.

411
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,640
How shall I put this?

412
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,710
Shall I say I reaped
the seeds you sowed?

413
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,740
Whatever!

414
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,980
You think I'm easy, don't you?

415
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,150
- Yes.
- I've been way too lenient.

416
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,210
We're late.

417
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,079
We were already late
for the interview long ago.

418
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:59,019
There are more than 20,000 attorneys
in this country nowadays.

419
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,289
Why did you choose me over others
who have better winning-rate?

420
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,630
If you were planning to ask me
how to get out of a murder charge...

421
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,700
or to ask for tips
regarding lack of evidence...

422
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,700
Why are you laughing?

423
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,140
This is driving me nuts.

424
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:23,210
I killed him.

425
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:24,849
I stabbed him.

426
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,750
Is this the answer
you were looking for?

427
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,089
Is there no other way than
admitting to a false charge...

428
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:35,930
and getting a plea bargain?

429
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,500
Ms. Eun.

430
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,069
I...

431
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,410
I thought you might be
my only ray of hope.

432
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,009
Mr. No, you believe me, don't you?

433
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,509
I trust that you believe me.

434
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,950
To me,

435
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,150
you are my only hope.

436
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,519
I'm a delivery man.
You know this, don't you?

437
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:05,920
I can't even count how many times
I've been to that neighborhood...

438
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,690
and that house.
That's how often I go there.

439
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,259
They're saying that's the evidence.

440
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,799
They told me that's the evidence.
That's the evidence.

441
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,670
That is the evidence for the murder.

442
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,700
That's how they got me
and put me in this seat.

443
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,609
I still don't understand
why I'm sitting in this seat now.

444
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,180
I don't even understand
how this happened to me.

445
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:29,079
To be honest, I'm really lonely.

446
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:33,519
This situation scares me.

447
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,319
It really does.

448
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,420
Then I did some thinking.

449
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,859
I thought that...

450
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:43,730
there might be a person who might
sincerely understand and believe me.

451
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,160
There might be a person
I might be able to rely on.

452
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,900
That's it.

453
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,109
I don't know
why this is happening to me.

454
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,039
I can't believe this is really
happening, and I'm scared too.

455
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:03,250
But you are the only person
I can rely on.

456
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,730
You're asking me if Bong Hee really
killed the son of the DA?

457
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:17,859
Yes.

458
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,430
She doesn't look like she would
do that sort of thing.

459
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,069
I've been a prosecutor only
for a few years.

460
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:28,809
I've met a lot of criminals
who committed murder.

461
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:32,539
My conclusion is...

462
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:35,349
everyone is capable
of killing a person.

463
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,619
Of course, some people are
just born as psychopaths...

464
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:40,420
and crazy jerks.

465
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,089
Excluding them,

466
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,890
normal people do kill people too.

467
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,960
They kill because they can't hold
back the sudden anger.

468
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,289
People die from a simple beating.

469
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:49,359
They kill people accidentally.

470
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,329
Some people murder people
out of hatred...

471
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,430
and money as well.

472
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,730
Therefore, my answer
to your question is...

473
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:00,299
Yes, Bong Hee killed him.

474
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,410
This isn't just based
on my personal feelings,

475
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,240
but also reasonable doubts.

476
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:09,450
I didn't know
this is how you thought of her.

477
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,220
I'm letting this take
its own course,

478
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,420
but one day,

479
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,390
I'm definitely going to catch her.

480
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:19,089
Ms. Na.

481
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,789
What you said...

482
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,359
is helping me come up
with an excuse.

483
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:27,799
Sorry?

484
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:29,869
Nothing.

485
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,140
In the afternoon of the incident,

486
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,069
since the weather was great,

487
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:40,779
I went for a walk to the park.

488
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,880
Girls were having fun
with the balloons...

489
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,680
and running about.
They were so cute.

490
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,990
I remembered that "The Usual
Suspects" was being re-released.

491
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,690
So I went to the movies
to catch that film.

492
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,690
I came back because
the schedule didn't fit mine.

493
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,230
And...

494
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,970
I had the street food for my lunch
on that day.

495
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,539
I had tteokbokki.
I had good coffee though.

496
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,069
I had tteokbokki and caffe mocha.

497
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,140
I added whipped cream
on top of the coffee.

498
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:13,779
And I had a drink by myself at a bar
that I visit sometimes.

499
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,210
I usually drink alone.

500
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:18,509
By the way, at the bar,

501
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,380
a couple had a birthday party
on that day.

502
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,849
In 1, 2, 3.

503
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,890
This was a video.

504
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:25,890
- Seriously?
- Come on.

505
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,759
- Got you.
- He got us.

506
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,690
- Come sit down.
- Let me see.

507
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,829
Here it is.

508
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,160
They brought a birthday cake
with the candles.

509
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,980
There's no material evidence
that can prove his alibi.

510
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,650
There's nothing
on his transit pass,

511
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,589
and there are no photos either.
What's more?

512
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,420
He even paid for his drink
with cash.

513
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:00,619
He said he rarely uses credit cards.

514
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,890
- Do you actually believe that?
- I was in that situation too.

515
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,059
There was no physical evidence
that could prove my alibi.

516
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,799
You're overly empathizing with him.

517
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,930
We're attorneys.

518
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,470
We have to side with our clients.

519
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,269
This is precisely why
I hate attorneys.

520
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:12,869
Then why did you become one?

521
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:14,170
I became one because of you...

522
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:27,049
Do not empathize with all murderers
that exist in this world.

523
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,150
With all due respect, I do not
empathize with murderers.

524
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,259
I only empathize with those who are
wrongly accused of murder.

525
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:34,859
I'm saying there's no evidence that
shows he's being wrongly accused.

526
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:36,289
I'm not trying to say...

527
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:38,529
that I want to blindly believe him.
I'm saying we should check...

528
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:40,359
all facts and believe him
if he seems innocent.

529
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,559
I'm telling you
we should do our best.

530
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,069
I know that you already believe him.

531
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:44,299
We're his attorneys!

532
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:45,769
This is why I hate
attorneys so much...

533
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,740
From over there to here,

534
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,869
I've been repeating myself
because of you!

535
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:53,210
Because of me? Why is it because
of me? It was because of you!

536
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:55,480
Why is it because of me?
It was all because of you!

537
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:56,609
- I can't hear you.
- It's your fault.

538
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,650
- Whatever!
- You're seriously a piece of work.

539
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,349
Stop right there! Hey.

540
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,460
Hey.

541
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,059
Why didn't you answer my calls?

542
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:14,960
Why are you and Ji Wook
treating me like this?

543
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:16,869
Are you two ganging up
against me or what?

544
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:19,200
Why am I being so childish?

545
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,700
I don't even know anymore.

546
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,240
Everything got messed up
because of you two.

547
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,279
I know that you guys hate me.

548
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,480
I admit that what I did was bad.

549
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,880
You were bad too.

550
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:34,920
But what's so wrong with that?

551
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,990
Hey, did you know
that Ji Wook has a girlfriend now?

552
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,619
How could you let him date someone
who used to be a murder suspect?

553
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,089
Why am I blabbering away like this?
I'm so annoyed.

554
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
It's been a long time.

555
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,170
Yes.

556
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:57,140
It has been a long time.

557
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:01,109
You should get going.

558
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:02,609
What?

559
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,180
Let's...

560
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,150
only run into each other like this.

561
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:29,000
I think it's somewhere around here.

562
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,469
This is it.

563
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,059
I think there used to be
a cake shop around here.

564
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,289
Please stay in the car. I'll go...

565
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:56,289
No, I'll go.

566
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,599
I should get it myself.

567
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,780
Today is my son's birthday.

568
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,050
Cheesecake was his favorite.

569
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,860
I will wrap one for you.

570
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,789
District Attorney.

571
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,059
How dare you smile?

572
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,070
- Excuse me?
- Do you know what day today is?

573
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,000
How could you laugh
and smile like that?

574
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:17,210
If he were alive,

575
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,940
he would be lighting the candles
about now.

576
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,110
I would be holding
the hand of my son...

577
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:28,079
who is alive. My heart
is breaking into pieces...

578
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,190
as I buy a cake he can't even eat.

579
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,719
How dare you?
You are smiling all you want.

580
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,789
District Attorney, that's...

581
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,469
If I were a mere,
insignificant thug,

582
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,099
it would have been better.

583
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:49,440
If I were a savage who didn't know
about the law or the ideal...

584
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:52,579
An eye for an eye.
A tooth for a tooth.

585
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,510
I would have ripped you
into pieces immediately.

586
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,869
I really didn't do it.

587
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,780
There's nothing I can do
if you don't believe me.

588
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:31,949
I...

589
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:36,349
didn't do it. You can accuse
me all you want,

590
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,849
but I can't admit
to what I never did, sir.

591
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:39,860
Prove it then!

592
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,460
If you are not the real culprit,
bring me the real culprit.

593
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,829
Until then,
you're the culprit.

594
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:51,570
To me, you are the only culprit.

595
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,510
This is the alibi of Jung Hyun Soo.

596
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,820
You think you could have seen him,
but you are not certain?

597
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:42,889
The bar owner didn't help,

598
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,320
but I found this.

599
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,500
(May 20: Your birthday)

600
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,230
This is the birthday photo
on the day of the incident.

601
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,869
This completely checks out what
Jung Hyun Soo told us, doesn't it?

602
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:01,199
However, that won't be
considered evidence...

603
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,539
that could prove his alibi.

604
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:05,739
This gives us grounds
that we can trust him.

605
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:09,210
I scored one today.

606
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,949
I'm relieved.

607
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,449
This won't be a major bruise.

608
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:52,420
It's all right, Bong Hee.

609
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,519
Yes?

610
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
What happened?

611
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:24,289
This is nothing.

612
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:27,119
It's okay. You can tell me.

613
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,769
I don't want to talk about it.

614
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:44,809
Okay.

615
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,250
Will you be okay?

616
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,889
Okay.

617
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,320
All right then.

618
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:36,630
I'll make copies of evidence
files including the footprints...

619
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:37,960
and the DNA in the buttons.

620
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,500
By the way, the witness
is a senior citizen.

621
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:42,460
Does the witness have good eyesight?

622
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,369
Gosh.

623
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,369
Ms. Lack of Evidence,
bring me a cup of water.

624
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,369
Then we should get rid
of the witness.

625
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:54,809
I have to find out more
about the assailant.

626
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:56,809
Since I have other cases,
I can't help out a lot,

627
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:58,210
but I will try to help
whenever I can.

628
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:01,179
Hey, Ms. Lack of Evidence?

629
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,889
- Ms. Eun, a pen, please?
- Yes, sir.

630
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:08,690
You can't hear only
when I'm talking to you, right?

631
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:10,929
She has selective hearing.

632
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:12,900
Darn!

633
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,969
I'll get some water.

634
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:24,710
Can the witness identify
the suspect at this distance?

635
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,809
It might be possible
if the witness knew the suspect.

636
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:30,980
One more time. Let's do it again.

637
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:40,619
The witness claimed that
she knew the restaurants,

638
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:44,059
neighbors, and residents
in that neighborhood.

639
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:47,230
Why was she staring
at someone else's house?

640
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,429
It's because she's lonely.

641
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:50,630
When we are lonely,
we look at other people.

642
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:53,340
We look to find out what others are
doing or if others are not lonely.

643
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,579
Can you see me?

644
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:02,909
One more time?

645
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,630
Something is off,

646
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,829
but I can't put a finger on it.

647
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,699
We are tracing the stolen items now.
Something might turn up.

648
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,510
It's a murder by a robber. Why
did the suspect stab him many times?

649
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,480
Oh, you're right.

650
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,949
The murder weapon hasn't been
found yet, right?

651
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,309
No.

652
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:51,329
You don't have to visit me
every single time.

653
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:54,530
I'm thankful and sorry, Ms. Eun.

654
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,230
Don't be.

655
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:58,730
Excuse me.

656
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,340
Yes, Mr. No.

657
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:05,940
Yes, I'm in an interview.

658
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:08,809
I don't know anything.

659
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:12,010
- Okay.
- Thank you.

660
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,590
We can't find anything useful
from this place either?

661
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,119
Excuse me. Could we have a talk?

662
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,400
Oh, no. Your looks didn't work.

663
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,130
I didn't use my looks just now.

664
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,679
By the way, where did we park the
car?

665
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:44,710
We parked it somewhere
in some alley.

666
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,349
But this is an alley too.

667
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:47,349
Exactly.

668
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:49,920
We'll eventually find it
when we circle around here.

669
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,250
Hey.

670
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:54,559
She's hopeless.

671
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,530
- Where are we?
- I think we're going in circles.

672
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,739
The alleys here all look alike.

673
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:12,670
- Exactly.
- Why open a restaurant here?

674
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,480
It's a trend to open a restaurant
in places like this.

675
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,480
Really?

676
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,820
- It's raining.
- It's suddenly raining.

677
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:24,619
Let's go over there.

678
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:39,969
My gosh, why is it raining
all of a sudden?

679
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:41,769
I washed my hair this morning.

680
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:44,840
People normally wash their hair
in the morning.

681
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,940
It's nothing special.

682
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:47,340
Really?

683
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,380
Yes.

684
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:03,849
Let's go.

685
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,590
It's still raining a little.

686
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,219
This isn't too bad.

687
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,590
We need to prepare for trial.
Let's go.

688
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,670
Ms. Cha.

689
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,239
Ms. Cha.

690
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:32,610
I have to go to trial.

691
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,619
Okay, I'll go too.

692
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:35,920
I can go by myself.

693
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:39,619
I'm a pretty decent prosecutor.
I can speak well.

694
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,989
You should stay here and rest.

695
00:48:41,489 --> 00:48:43,460
No, it's okay. I want to go too.

696
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:51,730
Do you think Jung Hyun Soo...

697
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:22,300
Let's go, Ms. Eun.

698
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,179
(Currently under trial)

699
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,809
(Attorney)

700
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,030
At 7:30pm on May 20, 2017,
the defendant, Jung Hyun Soo,

701
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,769
secretly entered
the victim's house...

702
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:01,670
to commit burglary.

703
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:04,809
After cruelly murdering the victim
with a sharp weapon,

704
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,739
he stole the victim's belongings.

705
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:10,679
Hence, I accuse the defendant, Jung
Hyun Soo, of murder and theft...

706
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:12,780
based on Article 338
of the Criminal Code.

707
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,789
Attorney, do you admit
to the charges?

708
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:25,329
The defendant does not
admit to the charges.

709
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:30,929
The defendant has no...

710
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:33,900
reason or motive to kill the victim.

711
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,969
A murder by a robber...

712
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,940
does not require a specific
reason or motive.

713
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,139
You're right.

714
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,210
However, there must be a premise.

715
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:49,119
The major premise is that the
defendant committed robbery.

716
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,650
We found at the crime scene that
a belonging had gone missing.

717
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,460
You're right.
Something did go missing.

718
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,820
But...

719
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:59,190
there is also no proof that
the missing object was stolen...

720
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,829
by the defendant.

721
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:05,070
The prosecution...

722
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,800
has yet failed to trace
the locations of...

723
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:09,239
those missing objects.

724
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:11,269
The missing objects...

725
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:14,840
were nowhere to be found in both
the defendants house and workplace.

726
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,210
Also, when we checked his
bank account and cash,

727
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:19,480
we could not find any kind of
monetary benefit...

728
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,750
he could've gained from robbery.

729
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,250
Are you claiming that there
was never a thief...

730
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,320
to begin with?

731
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,349
Yes, Your Honor.

732
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,820
Let me show you this, Your Honor.

733
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:31,889
In order for a murder by a robber
to be valid,

734
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,659
one first needs to be proven
guilty of robbery.

735
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,329
Also, one needs to have...

736
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,099
committed murder at the
chance of robbery itself.

737
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,269
Therefore, the prosecution's charge
against the defendant...

738
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,639
based on Article 338
of the Criminal Code...

739
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:48,480
is not valid because
the defendant never tried to...

740
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:50,179
commit robbery.

741
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:53,949
There is also no specific
evidence to prove...

742
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:55,579
that the defendant committed murder.

743
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,489
Therefore, the defendant...

744
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,090
also can't be accused of murder.

745
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,119
That is all, Your Honor.

746
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:04,889
(Prosecutor)

747
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,099
If we keep this up until
the second trial...

748
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:49,300
and successfully impeach
the witness, we'll win the case,

749
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,539
and Jung Hyun Soo will get released.

750
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,139
Mr. No?

751
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,889
Yoo Jung.

752
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:12,659
Ji Wook.

753
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:13,730
Are you okay?

754
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:15,400
I'm okay.

755
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,170
I don't think you should drive
right now.

756
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,769
I can handle it.

757
00:53:19,969 --> 00:53:21,099
No, I'll drive.

758
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,739
Get in.

759
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,820
I know this is going to
sound immature,

760
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:13,960
but I sometimes envy girls
who get sick.

761
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,630
My mom gave birth to such a
healthy girl, so I rarely get sick.

762
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,570
You don't need to laugh.

763
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:52,019
Bye.

764
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:53,519
I'll get going now.

765
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,460
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

766
00:55:56,989 --> 00:55:59,559
It's okay. I'll get better after
taking a fever reducer and sleep.

767
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:03,199
You know me. I always feel better
after sweating it out.

768
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,269
All right, then.

769
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:14,110
You should come in.

770
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,289
Just come in for a cup of tea, okay?

771
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,360
Let's not do this.

772
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,460
I loved you too much.

773
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,429
That's why your love for me
never felt enough.

774
00:56:40,269 --> 00:56:41,400
I was always thirsty for more.

775
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:44,670
I felt like I was always the
anxious one in the relationship.

776
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,139
But after you left...

777
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,510
After we broke up,

778
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,210
I realized it still had to be you.

779
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,920
Even if it meant
dying of such thirst,

780
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,090
I wanted to be by your side,
Ji Wook.

781
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,429
It's looks pretty well organized.

782
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:08,289
(Attorney No Ji Wook)

783
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,349
Gosh, why isn't he back yet?

784
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,860
I thought you might not come home.

785
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:33,369
I like you.

786
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,409
I...

787
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,349
like you, Mr. No.

788
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:05,969
Don't...

789
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:10,210
fall for me.

790
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:18,090
Not everything that begins
progresses.

791
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:21,659
Some things stop
as soon as they begin...

792
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,860
because every beginning
is frightening.

793
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:09,340
(Love in Trouble)
