1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740


2
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,440
 I've experienced a painful end, numerous times now. 

3
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,890
 That was why I was terrified to start anything with you. 

4
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,940
 So when I realized my feelings for you... 

5
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,720
 I chose to run from them. 

6
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:27,330
 Don't... Don't fall in love with me. 

7
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,420
 But I was only making a futile effort. 

8
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,530
 Because I had already been drawn to you, long before I even knew. 

9
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,870
 Let me hire you. 

10
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,360
 The one thing I know now... 

11
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,400
 is that the inevitable has finally begun. 

12
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,430
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

13
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,850
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

14
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,330
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

15
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,490
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

16
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,970
♫  Here's the love that I long for  ♫

17
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,830
   

18
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,670
I was about to knock.

19
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,320
And I was on my way to the living room.

20
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,810
I see.

21
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,990
Delicious.

22
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,900
I want to talk about what happened earlier.

23
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,410
I know it was an accident.

24
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,780
Don't worry; it doesn't bother me.

25
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,430
But... it bothers me.

26
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,470
I've already decided to move on from you, Tateishi-san.

27
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,810
I won't expect anything from this kind of accident.

28
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,230
It'd only hurt more if I did.

29
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,310
I'm perfectly happy with our current situation.

30
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,060
So I want to keep our relationship as it is.

31
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,200
Night.

32
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,870
Could I have a minute?

33
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,920
You had your time to monologue last night.

34
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,250
Now it's my turn.

35
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,260
Your turn?

36
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,350
I've come to realize my feelings far too late.

37
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,650
During that time, I had convinced you to move on,

38
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,230
and I'll respect your decision.

39
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,100
I won't ask you

40
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,620
to give me another chance.

41
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,730
But I want you to respect how I feel as well.

42
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,630
Don't take away my freedom

43
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,950
to think of you.

44
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,770
We can continue our life here together.

45
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:40,850
And if you ever have a change of heart, please give me that second chance.

46
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,900
Did you forget to breathe again?

47
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,460
I'll be waiting, so take all the time you need.

48
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,800
Then you'll be waiting your whole life.

49
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,270
I've already endured so much suffering.

50
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,720
You've lost your chance.

51
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,610
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,020
Just continue to wait.

53
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,800
Be prepared to wait for me until you die.

54
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,050
I got it.

55
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,820
 Haruto, can you turn on the news now? 

56
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,780
 Earlier this morning, Momoi Yuma-san was found dead in Fujikita-cho. 

57
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:12,330
 He was found with a weapon police believe was used to murder Haneda Ryujiro-san. 

58
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,170
 But that's not all. 

59
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,620
Momoi had a piece of paper with an address on him.

60
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,510
 It was for the building next to Miyashita-san's old apartment. 

61
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:32,140
Police found a body in the water tank there.

62
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,770
A body?

63
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,560
 After some investigating, 

64
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,260
the body is believed to be from March of 2023.

65
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,150
Which happens to be around the time Aoki Sota was killed.

66
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,410
 I'll call again if anything new appears. 

67
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,090
This is all too calculated.

68
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,730
Almost as if someone planned this all along.

69
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,670
But whom?

70
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,750
Sakura.

71
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,180
"Sakura"?

72
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:24,420
Could you stay within my sight, 24 hours a day?

73
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,090
What?

74
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,770
I meant nothing weird by it.

75
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,860
So bitter.

76
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,240
You're the one who bought it.

77
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,630
Oh, that tea.

78
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,750
It truly is bitter,

79
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,380
but I drink it every day.

80
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,240
How long have you suffered from insomnia?

81
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,240
Since I was a child.

82
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,580
It began when I lost my parents in a house fire.

83
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:24,030
I haven't had a good night's rest since.

84
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,160
I also lost my father when I was young.

85
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,020
You did?

86
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,460
But I'll save my story for another day.

87
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,450
Sure.

88
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,820
That is so bitter.

89
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,530
Sakura-san!

90
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,030
Sorry for rushing in like that...

91
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,950
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes, thank you.

92
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,200
What brings you here, Inaba-san?

93
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,310
Did anything break?

94
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,360
No, it's working just fine.

95
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,700
Well, see you.

96
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,740
 Breathe and think carefully. 

97
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,850
 You're the only one who can save me now. 

98
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,530
 He bought my empathy and strategically got close to me. 

99
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,820
 He wanted to see if I would catch on. 

100
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:47,190
 If my hypothesis is true... 

101
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,240
 I declare the accused not guilty. 

102
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,670
 Then I've helped the culprit himself. 

103
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,790
 I made Tateishi-san stand up for a murderer. 

104
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,420
I told you not to leave the house without me.

105
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,040
Are you all right?

106
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,470
Yes.

107
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,030
Sakura.

108
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:17,000
Could you already fall in love with me?

109
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,370
I know I promised to wait.

110
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm sorry.

111
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:33,750
But I want you to fall for me right now.

112
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,930
Did something happen?

113
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,210
I'm just tired.

114
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,510
Is this about Inaba?

115
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,420
I heard that song playing from Inaba-san's phone.

116
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,600
Maybe, Inaba-san is...

117
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,550
He might be the true culprit.

118
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,250
Did you already notice?

119
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,020
I did.

120
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,160
Why didn't you tell me?

121
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,200
Because I wasn't sure then.

122
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,110
Tateishi-san, I've caused you trouble again...

123
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,040
You don't need to worry about that.

124
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,760
- Still... 
 - I'll overcome this hardship together with you, Sakura.

125
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,870
Even if you choose to shove me aside.

126
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,460
I won't let that bastard get away with this.

127
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:04,060
In any case, the choice is yours, Sakura.

128
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:10,000
Do you want to overcome this together or on our own?

129
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,630
I want to overcome this hardship together with you.

130
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,090
 The choice is yours, Sakura. 

131
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:16,270
 Do you want to overcome this together or on our own? 

132
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,530
Tateishi-san.

133
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,820
I have something very important to tell you.

134
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,520
What is it?

135
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,230
From now on, I've decided to be true to myself and live as I wish.

136
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,130
So let's call this day one.

137
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,660
That's all.

138
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,950
Day one? What are you talking about?

139
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,300
Let's start dating from today. This will mark our first day together.

140
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,890
So that's what she meant.

141
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,480
Day one...

142
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,820
My girlfriend...

143
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,770
- Oranges? 
 - Yes, please.

144
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,730
♫  I do things like listening to your favorite songs like you do  ♫

145
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,900
♫  Or tucking a bookmark into a novel that I don't usually read  ♫

146
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,000
♫  The color of my hair and my fashion  ♫

147
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,390
♫  I changed everything for you, to suit you  ♫

148
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,690
That's all for day one.

149
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,810
♫  The cheesy lines like a drama  ♫

150
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,340
♫  Don't suit me  ♫

151
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,850
She's a worthy opponent.

152
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,320
♫  All I wanna do is kiss your heart  ♫

153
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,470
♫  I want you more  ♫

154
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,920
Did something good happen?

155
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,680
No.

156
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,270
- Something definitely happened. 
 - Nope.

157
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,810
- I'm right, aren't I? 
 - No.

158
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,790
Oh, right. We found a picture of Momoi from high school, Sir.

159
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,840
Momoi was Haneda Ryujiro's classmate and good friend.

160
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,310
Who are the other two?

161
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,460
Tabata Masashi and Shimano Daisuke.

162
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,420
Tabata has been radio silent for a while now.

163
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,800
- Hello? 
 - We've identified the body found in the water tank.

164
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,060
- The victim was Tabataー 
 - Masahi.

165
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,280
 You knew? 

166
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,570
I do now.

167
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,980
So when did he go missing?

168
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,520
Momoi went missing after he contacted us to share information.

169
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,340
And his senpai from high school, Tabata Masashi turned up as a dead body.

170
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,120
When did Tabata go radio silent?

171
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,320
The day Aoki Sota was found dead in Miyashita's apartment.

172
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,330
Are these two incidents tied to one another?

173
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,960
I'll look into this "Shimano."

174
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,300
Please do. I'll investigate more on Inaba's acquaintances.

175
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,150
I'll join you.

176
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,860
No, you won't. Messing with Inaba any further is too dangerous.

177
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,220
You stay here, Sakura.

178
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,260
Yes, Sir.

179
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,630
"Sakura"?

180
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,540
Hello?

181
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,160
Yes.

182
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,900
I see.

183
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,210
I'll try heading there right away.

184
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,670
   

185
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,260
 The individual you have called is currently unavailable. 

186
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,120
 Please leave a message after the beep. 

187
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,810
We've tracked down Shimano's location.

188
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,440
He returned from the United States earlier today.

189
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,200
We have to take action before Inaba finds him.

190
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,280
I'll send Shimano's address your way.

191
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,200
Thank you again.

192
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,100
Long time no see, Shimano.

193
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,650
 Can you hear me, Yoneda-san? 

194
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,610
 Yoneda-san? 

195
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,020
 Yoneda-san? 

196
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,150
 Yoneda-san, are you there? 

197
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:20,660


198
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,020
Yoneda-san!

199
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,820
Yoneda-san! Yoneda-san!

200
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,130
Yoneda-san!

201
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,450
Yoneda-san! 
    

202
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,690
   
 For now, we prepare. 

203
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,280
 I'm about to say something crucial so listen well. I killed him. 

204
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,180
 Why are you doing this? 

205
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,340
 Could you please leave me alone already? 

206
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,600
 Haruto bought time for us. 

207
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,890
 Who's this? 

208
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,340
 I need to ask you for a favor. 

209
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,680
 You'll owe me one. 

210
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,990
 Why did you do something so rash? 

211
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,990
 Want to go on a date tomorrow? 

212
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,470
 A date? 

213
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,470
 It'll be our first date.
