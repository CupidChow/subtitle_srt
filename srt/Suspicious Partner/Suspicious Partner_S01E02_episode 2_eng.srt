00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,080
I can't wait to crack open a cold one.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,880
 A turning point in life always comes without warning. 

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,790
Sota?

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,240
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,370
Sota.

7
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,220
 That night... 

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,210
 I became accused of murder. 

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,010
Tateishi-san. We've got trouble.

10
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,610
When you returned home, your former partner, Aoki Sota-san, was found dead.

11
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,060
Yes, Sir.

12
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,410
Was there any trouble between you and Aoki-san?

13
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,000
No, Ma'am.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,210
And yet, he was found murdered in your home.

15
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,260
Sir, I am innocent.

16
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,150
We shall investigate that matter with your utmost cooperation.

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,620
 Sota has died. 

18
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,180
 I was devastated to know he cheated on me, and now he's gone. 

19
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,510
 I cursed Sota for what he had done. 

20
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,250
 But our time together wasn't all bad. 

21
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,300
 He's gone. 

22
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,790
 He's really, truly gone. 

23
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,900
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

24
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,420
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

25
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,820
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

26
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,150
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

27
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,390
♫  Here's the love that I long for  ♫

28
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,290
   

29
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,140
 On to our next headline. 

30
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,230
 Police have apprehended legal apprentice, Miyashita Sakura, age 26, 

31
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:02,600
 under suspicion of murdering fellow apprentice, Aoki Sota. 

32
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:09,310
 The victim is the eldest son of Chief Public Prosecutor, Aoki Soichiro. 

33
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,260
 The suspect seems to have repeatedly stalked her former partner, Aoki-san. 

34
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,740
 It seems their circumstances were– 

35
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,280
Understood.

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,790
Miyashita Sakura was your apprentice, right? 
    

37
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,350
- Yes, Sir. 
 - What is she like?

38
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,830
What do you mean by that?

39
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,400
Is she someone who would kill a man?

40
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,960
While she was a bit crude, she didn't look like she would kill anyone.

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,070
And yet, my son has been killed.

42
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,090
I leave this case to you.

43
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,380
I hear you're able to make the accused plead guilty every time.

44
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,570
Go to court and put that woman behind bars immediately.

45
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,320
Tateishi-san...

46
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,590
I am the prosecutor assigned to your case, Tateishi Haruto.

47
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,210
Now, allow me to get our facts straight.

48
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,650
The store clerk indeed confirmed that a customer came that night.

49
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,200
However, she cannot recall if the individual was you.

50
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,500
I went to the store, Sir.

51
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,490
Due to the blackout that night, all security cameras were out.

52
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:03,440
In other words, there is no evidence to support your alibi.

53
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,950
I did not kill him.

54
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,620
Are you doubting me as well, Tateishi-san?

55
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,800
- Please believe me. 
 - I am the prosecutor.

56
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,180
If you need to rely on anyone, go to your attorney.

57
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,410
Of course, I'll rely on you.

58
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,700
Tateishi-san.

59
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,470
Only you can save me now.

60
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,590
I truly know nothing, Sir.

61
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,070
The victim cheated on you.

62
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,760
I understand your pain all too well.

63
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,890
- That is when– 
 - Don't even bother.

64
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:48,060
Your sympathy tactics won't get me to fess up.

65
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:59,880
The only marks and DNA we found in your room were yours and the victim's.

66
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,820
Do you still choose to play innocent?

67
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,470
Your intimidation tactics won't work either, Sir.

68
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,990
You have a motive, no alibi, and there are no other suspects.

69
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,390
You will be found guilty if taken to court so please confess.

70
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,720
I didn't kill him.

71
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,890
 Given her current circumstances, no matter what she denies, she'll be found guilty. 

72
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,230
I will believe in you, Tateishi-san.

73
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,420
You've always saved me.

74
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,770
   

75
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,590
   

76
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,160
Who will serve as her defense attorney?

77
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,760
The victim is the son of the Chief Public Prosecutor, Aoki.

78
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,360
No one wants to step up for her.

79
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,660
What's up?

80
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,940
Haruto is calling.

81
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,490
It's been years since he last called.

82
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,780
Hello?

83
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,980
What?

84
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,110
What brings you here, Umehara-san?

85
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:55,280
Haruto asked me to be your attorney.

86
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,540
Tateishi-san did?

87
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,310
Since it was his request, I'll be sure to give it my all.

88
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,090
Can I ask you just one question?

89
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,970
Go ahead.

90
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,160
Did you kill Aoki Sota?

91
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,640
No, I did not.

92
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,120
That's all I need to hear.

93
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,850
The security cameras weren't on because of the blackout.

94
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,580
- And the murder weapon? 
 - It hasn't been found.

95
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:37,130
Still, it's unusual for you to visit the crime scene yourself.

96
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,270
There could be another suspect, like she claims.

97
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,610
I'm only checking to be certain.

98
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,320
 At around 12:30 a.m., I opened the window to get some fresh air. 

99
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,220
 I couldn't see much because I had taken off my glasses. 

100
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,170
 What if she had witnessed another crime without her knowledge? 

101
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,880
Were there any other incidents in the area that night?

102
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,500
I don't believe so.

103
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,320
Could you look into it anyway?

104
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,160
Sure thing.

105
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,750
It's an odd feeling, searching an acquaintance's room. I feel as if we're snooping.

106
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,960
   

107
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,310
What's that?

108
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,290
- This? It's nothing. 
 - Allow me.

109
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,510
A handshake? Of course.

110
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,450
No.

111
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,220
Right...

112
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,240
- Do you want to take a look? 
 - Yes.

113
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,290
I warned you. 
    

114
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,900
This is Yoneda, speaking.

115
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,580
Yes.

116
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,430
I see.

117
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,550
Sir, they found the weapon.

118
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,670
It's located seven kilometers away.

119
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,560
The police combed this room thoroughly, right?

120
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,640
Of course.

121
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,290
And yet, I just discovered another weapon under the fridge.

122
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,110
There are two weapons?

123
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,850
We found the murder weapon.

124
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,890
Excellent.

125
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,680
Now we can take that woman to court.

126
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,180
However, for some reason, we have found two weapons.

127
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,090
One weapon was found in her room.

128
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,980
Another, was found seven kilometers away from her place.

129
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,430
What do you think is going on here, Sir?

130
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,290
There is no need for "two" weapons.

131
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,420
The one found in her room is the only weapon.

132
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm expecting great things from you.

133
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,350
   

134
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,630
Upon hearing Aoki Sota's refusal to make amends with her,

135
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,920
the accused was overcome with a murderous urge.

136
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,670
She then took a knife and stabbed the victim twice in the stomach and once in the chest.

137
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,130
The victim then died due to blood loss

138
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,130
because of the violent actions of the accused.

139
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:10,690
She ought to be charged with homicide, under Article 199 of the Penal Code.

140
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,900
Do you have any objection to the truths stated by the prosecution?

141
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,550
Yes, Sir. I have not killed a single soul.

142
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,310
Defense. Your opinion?

143
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:29,490
The accused did not kill Aoki Sota-san. She is innocent.

144
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,230
You witnessed the accused verbally abusing the victim, correct?

145
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,940
Yes, Sir.

146
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,580
With my own two eyes.

147
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,540
 ♪ I am going to kill you, kill you ♪ 

148
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,090
I only meant it as a joke. I wasn't being serious.

149
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,240
You killed Sota, didn't you?

150
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,870
I did not. I am innocent.

151
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,970
Order.

152
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,820
I have no further questions.

153
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:24,980
Recently, we found the suspected weapon in the accused's home.

154
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,380
This weapon wasn't found during prior police inspections.

155
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,930
To have a weapon turn up now is nothing but suspicious.

156
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,340
We shall send this knife to our forensics team and await further information.

157
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:47,910
Defense, could we get your thoughts on Evidence 12, submitted by the prosecution?

158
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,350
So the wounds on the victim match the knife; is that correct?

159
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,720
Yes, Sir. After running a DNA test on the blood from this knife,

160
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,250
we have confirmed it matches the victim's DNA.

161
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,460
The wounds on the victim also help to characterize the weapon.

162
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,720
Either way, it is a perfect match to this knife.

163
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,460
Prosecution, your closing remarks.

164
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,190
The accused invited the victim to her house, hoping to get back together.

165
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,870
However, upon being turned down, she murdered Aoki Sota-san.

166
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,930
There is no doubt about her motive.

167
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:36,590
Yet the accused denies all claims and doesn't seem to regret her actions in the slightest.

168
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,200
As such, I believe the accused must be appropriately sentenced

169
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,230
to at least fifteen years of penal servitude.

170
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,010
This concludes my statement.

171
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,000
 I will believe in you, Tateishi-san. 

172
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,730
 You've always saved me. 

173
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,450
We shall now sentence the accused with our verdict.

174
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,670
The accused has been found...

175
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,470
Judge. I'd like to submit another piece of evidence.

176
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,890
More evidence, you say?

177
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,410
Yes, Sir.

178
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,850
Truth be told, we discovered another weapon.

179
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,520
These two weapons were found in entirely separate locations.

180
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,290
Both weapons were marked with the victim's blood.

181
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,210
Here is where this second weapon was found.

182
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,090
It was found seven kilometers away from the crime scene.

183
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,720
Unless the accused can teleport,

184
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,650
she could not have tossed the weapon so far away.

185
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,390
Prosecution, why were there two weapons?

186
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,810
I believe that of the two weapons,

187
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,520
one was planted.

188
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,630
Why was this evidence kept from us?

189
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,180
It was done with intent.

190
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,790
We prioritized this hearing over probing into the truth.

191
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,590
If there is even a single fake, both lose their credibility as evidence.

192
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,790
In accordance with Article 257 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

193
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,560
I withdraw my prosecution.

194
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,160
Why were there two weapons found?

195
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,510
Withdrawing is unheard of.

196
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,440
- Why did you withdraw your prosecution? 
 - Please, tell us your reasoning.

197
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,220
She's here!

198
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,350
Will you return to being a legal apprentice?

199
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,400
Do you have anything to say to the prosecution?

200
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,180
Who do you wish to owe this withdrawal to?

201
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,250
- Please tell us how you feel. 
 - Even a word.

202
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,410
Please tell us how you feel?

203
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,540
- Miyashita-san, could we get a word? 
 - A word. Just a word.

204
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,440
Please, we would appreciate it.

205
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,590
Do you realize what you've done?

206
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,410
Sir. Did you place the weapon at the scene of the crime?

207
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,110
What are you talking about?

208
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:14,020
I believe withdrawing our prosecution was the appropriate course of action.

209
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,000
You'd best not regret your choice.

210
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:25,290
Your life as a prosecutor ends today.

211
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:31,200
Don't step foot in our premises ever again.

212
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,300

213
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,100
   

214
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,770
♫  I do things like listening to your favorite songs  ♫

215
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,830
I was surprised.

216
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,900
I never thought you would stand up against the Chief Prosecutor, Aoki.

217
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,870
♫  Or tucking a bookmark into a novel that I don't usually read  ♫

218
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,830
♫  The color of my hair and my fashion  ♫

219
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:28,680
But above all else... I believe you made the right choice.

220
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,570
♫  I changed everything for you, to suit you  ♫

221
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,830
♫  The cheesy lines like a drama   ♫

222
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,600
♫  Don't suit me  ♫

223
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,000
 I thought I'd never trust anyone ever again. 

224
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,230
 But that's changed. I've learned to trust once more. 

225
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,850
 Because that person chose to save me. 

226
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,150
♫  But you seem close and yet far away  ♫

227
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:19,790
We first met in a bus. Then we worked together at the office.

228
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:26,250
And in court, we were prosecutor and accused.

229
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,350
No matter how you look at it, we're tied by fate.

230
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,390
- Yes, we– 
 - In a bad way.

231
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,500
Pardon?

232
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,540
Don't barge into my life, ever again.

 I'm no longer a prosecutor. 

235
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,990
 So you're worried about me. 

236
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,870
I'm not "worried." I just care about you.

237
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,990
 Whenever I struggled, I always caught myself looking for you. 

238
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,020
 Tateishi-san, I will prove you made the right choice.
