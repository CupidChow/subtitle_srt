1
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,439
(Ambulance)

2
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,580
Yes.

3
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,650
Yes, I understand.

4
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,189
And please brief me...

5
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,889
about the status report
on the hit-and-run vehicle.

6
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,259
Okay.

7
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,770
Jung Hyun Soo is getting
transported to Sunho Hospital.

8
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:44,840
He's going to arrive shortly
and get a surgery soon.

9
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,240
So?

10
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,669
Who was the informant?

11
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,710
Did I bring up a difficult subject?

12
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,520
What I'm asking is who tipped off
about the knife...

13
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:01,050
that had Mr. Bang's blood on it
in Jung Hyun Soo's house?

14
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:04,360
You wanted me to ride with you
to ask this question.

15
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,930
Prosecutor Cha, I hope you can
answer my question quickly.

16
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,560
It was an anonymous informant.

17
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,300
Even if I knew who it was, I have
to protect his or her identity.

18
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,699
You searched his house with
a warrant that was issued...

19
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,469
based on a tip-off by
an anonymous informant?

20
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,340
Do you want me to believe that?

21
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,469
It doesn't matter if you do or not.

22
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,039
It's illegally obtained evidence. It
is the fruit of the poisonous tree.

23
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,080
No, I searched his house
with a properly issued warrant.

24
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,680
For me, this is a legally obtained
piece of evidence.

25
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Cha Yoo Jung.

26
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,189
Whatever. I can't hear a word
you are saying right now.

27
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,060
To get the warrant, I put my job
on the line and searched his house.

28
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,789
But this is what has happened.

29
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,159
I'm in a tight spot now, Ji Wook.

30
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I...

31
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,099
Yes?

32
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,139
What?

33
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,009
Okay. I'm on my way now.

34
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,240
I really saw it.

35
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,009
- Are you sure?
- Hey, punk.

36
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,580
Do you think I only
see hallucinations?

37
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,620
Mr. Bang, Mr. Bang.

38
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,550
Mr. Bang...

39
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,020
What is this?

40
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,560
You said his finger moved.

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,129
That's what I wanted to say.

42
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,970
What did the doctor say?

43
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,399
Well, the doctor...

44
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,540
said that I might have
been mistaken.

45
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,779
He really moved. Listen to me.

46
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,879
His finger...

47
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,480
Hey! It moved again! Look!

48
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,019
Look! It moved!

49
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:49,589
Hey, just wait a bit more. Okay?

50
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,730
His finger is going to move again.
Keep looking. My goodness.

51
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,410
It really moved.

52
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,209
Mr. Byun.

53
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:07,779
Take a seat.

54
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,250
You should get some sleep.

55
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,720
Goodness.

56
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,050
(Gookil Hospital)

57
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,990
No, no way. That can't be.

58
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,120
Pardon?

59
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,029
- What?
- What did you say?

60
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,389
I didn't say anything.

61
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,000
If you are behind this, Eun Hyuk,
I'm going to...

62
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,000
put you in prison. I mean it.

63
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,740
Why? Did I do something wrong?

64
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,079
What?

65
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,910
Why? What is it about?

66
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,480
I always wondered
when we are going to be friendly.

67
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,120
Is today the day?

68
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,120
Are we going to hold hands today?

69
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
How dare you.

70
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,730
We all know that all of us
are not in a good mood.

71
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,730
But we must still smile. That's how
good things will come to our way.

72
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,970
That's right.

73
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,110
Eun Hyuk, it's been a while since
you said something that made sense.

74
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,850
He's right. We must stay positive
for the good fortune to come...

75
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,850
and that's how Mr. Bang
will wake up as well.

76
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,750
- You think so too, right?
- Of course.

77
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,290
Well, I agree with you guys on that.

78
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,009
I need to tell you something
about Jung Hyun Soo.

79
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,079
Did he do something again?

80
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,879
- Well, that's...
- Ji Wook.

81
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:34,629
Mr. Bang.

82
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,889
Mr. Bang, are you awake now?

83
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,360
Can you see me? It's me, Ji Wook.

84
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,430
Ji Wook.

85
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,329
Yes, that's right. It's me, Ji Wook.

86
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,069
Mr. Bang.

87
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,040
Mr. Bang, it's me, Eun Hyuk.
Can you recognize me?

88
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,279
Of course, I can.

89
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,750
Eun Hyuk.

90
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,079
Hey.

91
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,050
Hey, what about me?
Do you recognize me?

92
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,649
Mr. Bang, it's me!

93
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,689
- Young Hee.
- That's me!

94
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:08,730
My name is Young Hee. I'm Young Hee!

95
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,600
My goodness. But how dare you
speak to me informally? You jerk.

96
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:16,199
Gosh, I'm so happy that you're
awake.

97
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,540
Good job. Good job for waking up.

98
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,240
My gosh. I'm so proud of you,
Eun Ho.

99
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,839
My gosh, I can't believe this.

100
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,740
My goodness.

101
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,449
See? What did I tell you?

102
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:28,680
I told you so.

103
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,680
Wait here. I'll call the doctor.

104
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,330
Thank you. Thank you so much,
Mr. Bang.

105
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,929
Thank you.

106
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,870
I'm so relieved.

107
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:58,440
My... My gosh, you startled me.

108
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,240
It's okay.

109
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,909
(The Memory of That Day)

110
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:03,919
I'm so relieved.

111
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,149
(The Memory of That Day)

112
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,490
Here's a breaking story.

113
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,590
The prosecution was chasing after
a murder suspect this afternoon.

114
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,860
The suspect, Mr. Jung, was escaping
with his motorcycle.

115
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,490
However, he got hit by a hit-and-run
vehicle and is now in a coma.

116
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:20,529
Mr. Jung got transferred to a
hospital right after the accident,

117
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,299
and the police are currently trying
to trace the hit-and-run vehicle.

118
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,409
Some people are questioning whether
or not the prosecution had...

119
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:29,610
carried out a pressed investigation.
They're criticizing that...

120
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,110
the prosecution may have
unreasonably chased the suspect.

121
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,000
Is he...

122
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,529
unconscious?

123
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,669
How ironic.

124
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,669
Now that one person is okay,
the other person falls into a coma.

125
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,879
If this happened in the process
of him getting arrested,

126
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,409
that means something was going on.

127
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:09,309
Does that mean they found evidence?

128
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,779
Well, I guess so.

129
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,019
What's going to happen to...

130
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,659
Jung Hyun Soo now?

131
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,200
He fell into a coma in the process
of getting arrested.

132
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,299
Therefore, we have to wait until he
wakes up.

133
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,470
If he's unconscious for a long time,

134
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:33,070
there will be a suspension of
indictment...

135
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,139
I'm sure he'll wake up.

136
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,080
No. He must wake up no matter what.

137
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,090
Did you trace the hit-and-run
vehicle?

138
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,649
Yes, we found the car.

139
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,659
But the driver has disappeared.

140
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,059
What did the doctor say?

141
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,429
I don't know. Apparently, his head
got injured,

142
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,460
and there's internal bleeding in his
abdomen.

143
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,429
He said it might take some time for
him to wake up.

144
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,600
There's also a risk of brain damage.

145
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,909
Are you okay?

146
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,009
No.

147
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,980
I got chewed out by the chief
and deputy.

148
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,750
Hey, if I end up losing my job
as a prosecutor,

149
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,879
will you guys take me in?

150
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,889
I could go work at your firm.

151
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,220
Forget it. I won't go even if you
beg me to work there.

152
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,399
Prosecutor Cha, wait.

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I have something for you.

154
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:43,669
Mr. Bang got this list...

155
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,340
while he was looking into
Ko Chan Ho and Jung Hyun Soo.

156
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,850
We both think the guy who hit
Jung Hyun Soo could be...

157
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,850
on that list.

158
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,480
What do you mean?

159
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:53,720
That means...

160
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,149
Jung Hyun Soo was planning to get
revenge on one of those guys.

161
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,620
And when that person found out,

162
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,090
he could've hit Jung Hyun Soo
with his car.

163
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,230
So are you saying that...

164
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,059
he hit Jung Hyun Soo because he
knew Jung Hyun Soo was after him?

165
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,529
Yes. The most suspicious person
is on the top of the list.

166
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:10,970
I actually met him in person.

167
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,809
Okay. I'll look into these people.

168
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,129
I had...

169
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,360
so many questions to ask you,

170
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,429
and I was angry at you for
so many things.

171
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,970
I was going to make sure
that you'd get...

172
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,240
punished by law.

173
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,370
I'm sure it was Jung Hyun Soo,

174
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,070
but I wasn't able to see his face
directly...

175
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,940
because I failed to take off
his mask.

176
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,269
I see.

177
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,039
Jung Hyun Soo's unconscious anyway.

178
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,909
He's practically getting an
indictment of suspension.

179
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,580
So just focus on getting better and
discharged.

180
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,120
It'd be better for you to testify...

181
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:33,120
once Jung Hyun Soo wakes up.

182
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,990
Okay.

183
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:36,789
But...

184
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,720
why are they always here?

185
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,159
We're holding a meeting right now.

186
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,529
It's a small case, but I think it's
very meaningful.

187
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,799
So I think we should take this case.

188
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:51,600
No way.

189
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,799
We'll make no money out of this.

190
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,009
Cases like this turn into a bigger
lawsuit later on.

191
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,009
Be quiet.

192
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:58,840
You're the one who should be quiet.

193
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,080
Can you do something about this,
Mr. No?

194
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,509
Just a few days ago,

195
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,320
you were calling him, "Ji Wook".

196
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,350
And Mr. No said, "Eun Ho".

197
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,590
Hey, you even called me,
"Young Hee".

198
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,929
How dare you speak to me informally?

199
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,559
I want to get discharged.

200
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,929
No, Eun Ho. You can't.

201
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,330
No one's on my side.

202
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,659
Congratulations on getting
discharged, Mr. Bang.

203
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,299
Thank you, Ms. Eun.

204
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,659
I sincerely congratulate you.

205
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,169
But I really look forward to
leaving.

206
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:56,230
I'm sick of this place.

207
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,200
Me too. Let's go.

208
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,299
I'm so sick of this hospital room.

209
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,440
We're finally getting out!

210
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,509
You barely managed to live.

211
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,679
Here's the next news.

212
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,610
The suspect who got into an accident
and fell into a coma...

213
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,210
while getting arrested...

214
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,909
had actually been indicted in the
past...

215
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:11,919
for being the suspect of
Chef Yang's murder.

216
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,149
However, he ended up getting
released for being innocent.

217
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,919
Therefore, people continue to think
that the prosecution had...

218
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,220
carried out a vindictive
investigation.

219
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,919
The new government has already once
criticized the prosecution for...

220
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,360
violating people's human rights.

221
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:24,899
The prosecution currently seems to
be embarrassed about what happened.

222
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,129
During the investigation process,
it seems as though...

223
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,399
The reporters seem to be
having fun right now.

224
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,110
Why did this have to happen
at such a bad time...

225
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,039
when everything has gotten
out of hand?

226
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,480
Why did you...

227
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,879
even think about risking your job?

228
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:46,250
You should never do something like
that so thoughtlessly.

229
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,789
You can't gamble with your life.

230
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,049
Stop it already.

231
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:50,649
I might as well just sew your mouth.

232
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,269
I'm sorry, sir.

233
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,509
Unfortunately, similar cases have
continuously occurred recently so...

234
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,139
You've stained the prosecution's
reputation.

235
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,309
I'm sorry, sir.

236
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:13,980
But...

237
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:17,009
Call the correspondents.

238
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,320
Yes, sir.

239
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,620
- He's here.
- Look, he's here.

240
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,230
- Over there.
- Look.

241
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,529
Was this a vindictive investigation
for releasing Mr. Jung...

242
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:35,799
when he got falsely accused for
killing Chef Yang?

243
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,470
Are you not catching Mr. Ko
on purpose,

244
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,970
or have you failed to catch him?

245
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,610
Do you plan to punish the prosecutor
who was in charge of the arrest?

246
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,840
People think you're only visiting
the hospital for show.

247
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,009
They think you're only here to
pretend. What's your opinion?

248
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,350
Are you aware that the people wish
to reform the prosecution?

249
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:51,320
Once the examination of the
prosecutor in charge is done,

250
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,980
we'll carry out a punishment
depending on the results.

251
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,789
But it is hard to tell you what
level of punishment it will be.

252
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,869
I still think Jung Hyun Soo...

253
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,940
is the real culprit, sir.

254
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,079
Not only did he kill Chef Yang and
Lee Jae Ho,

255
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,920
but he also killed...

256
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,720
Be quiet. Shut that mouth!

257
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,319
How incompetent do you have to be...

258
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:36,029
to humiliate me like this?

259
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,440
Don't ever...

260
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,470
stain the prosecution's
reputation again.

261
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,210
Do you understand?

262
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,569
My gosh, I don't even remember
the last time...

263
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,670
I was able to come home
feeling relaxed like this.

264
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,440
Same here. We also haven't had
a relaxed conversation like this...

265
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:27,849
in such a long time. Aren't I right?

266
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,920
And talking like this with smiles on
our faces with no one else around.

267
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,380
That's right. Just the two of us...

268
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,599
Just the two of us.

269
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,829
I guess it is
just the two of us here now.

270
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,599
Is there... I don't think
anyone else is here.

271
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,009
Shall I make you something to eat?

272
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,009
No, I'll go take a shower first.

273
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,950
You'll take a shower?

274
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,450
All right, go ahead.

275
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,559
Okay.

276
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,029
Well... Do you want some beer?

277
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:00,299
Come here.

278
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:03,609
This is only our second day.

279
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:05,779
Our second day?

280
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:09,279
We should exclude the days
Mr. Bang was bedridden...

281
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,109
because we couldn't do anything.

282
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,750
You're right. We actually weren't
able to do...

283
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:15,650
anything.

284
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,490
So come here.

285
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,960
Come here!

286
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,630
Here.

287
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:32,269
Look at all this foam.

288
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:33,900
Cheers!

289
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:46,279
I know that you've been so stressed
out because of this case, Mr. No.

290
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,990
Yes, I have been
very stressed out...

291
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,289
because of my girlfriend who keeps
calling me Mr. No.

292
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,400
Then what should I do?

293
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:05,140
Am I supposed to change the way
I address you overnight?

294
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,140
Yes.

295
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,170
Shall I give it a try?

296
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,279
Darling.

297
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,609
You almost cracked up.

298
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:17,750
No, I didn't.

299
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,480
Then should I keep doing it?
Darling.

300
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,849
You cracked up. Goodness.

301
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,390
No, I was just teasing you.

302
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,559
I'll never do it again.

303
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,660
- I was teasing you.
- Don't make me do it.

304
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,660
- Do it for me.
- Don't expect it.

305
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,430
You're better at it than I am.

306
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,630
Say "darling".

307
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,960
- No, you say it.
- "Darling".

308
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,869
I want you to call me like that.
Just once.

309
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,670
- Just one time, please.
- I don't want to.

310
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,640
- Do it for me.
- I'll never say it.

311
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,839
You cracked up.

312
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:46,640
About Jung Hyun Soo's accident...

313
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,950
It's quite complicated.

314
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,180
Prosecutor Cha left with a warrant
after getting an anonymous tip...

315
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:54,890
and told me about it.

316
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,589
Then Jung Hyun Soo fled.

317
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,519
Shortly after that,

318
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,130
he got into an accident.

319
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,599
Then...

320
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:15,339
has the hit-and-run driver
who hit him...

321
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,009
not been caught yet?

322
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,339
The vehicle was found,
but no one was inside.

323
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,910
The car was rented with a fake ID,
and the driver...

324
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,609
has taken to the hills.

325
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,420
I see.

326
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,119
- Are you sleepy?
- No.

327
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,490
I'm fine.

328
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,990
I'm really okay.

329
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:24,670
I'm here.

330
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,240
Welcome back, Mr. Bang!

331
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Congratulations
on your first day back!

332
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,180
- Thank you.
- We're so glad to have you back!

333
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:38,619
What are you guys doing right now?
Who's going to clean up this mess?

334
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,420
I'll clean it up. I'll...

335
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,329
What was that about?

336
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:45,329
Goodness. You should clean it up,
Mr. No.

337
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:46,599
Hey, you clean this up!

338
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,799
What's the matter with him?

339
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,930
Congratulations!

340
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,369
- Thank you!
- Welcome back!

341
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,170
It is clearly a violation
of the franchise law.

342
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,839
However, proving the losses
caused by it won't be easy.

343
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,839
It will be very tricky indeed.

344
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:03,250
Soon, punitive damages will be
introduced to the system as well.

345
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,880
If this happened in the US, this
person would be in huge trouble.

346
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,150
Speaking of which, people there...

347
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,289
always make sure to strictly punish
companies in such cases.

348
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,500
I'll tell you what happened
when I first went to the US.

349
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,799
My wife used to be very pretty.

350
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,470
Some blond jerks
started hitting on her,

351
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,440
calling her a pretty girl
or a cutie.

352
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,009
Gosh, here he goes again.

353
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,509
What? What did you just say?

354
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:35,650
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

355
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,380
I should put up with it.
He's the father.

356
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:39,450
I'm not your father.

357
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:43,789
I didn't say you're my father.
You have great hearing.

358
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,519
Get her out of here.

359
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,430
Gosh! It's a complete mess here!

360
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:50,990
It's a total mess!

361
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,460
Can we please have a proper meeting
at least once?

362
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,400
- Excuse me.
- Great! Just like him, okay?

363
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,170
Please go ahead, Mr. Bang.

364
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:01,569
It's actually not about work.

365
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:04,009
Something seems a bit off to me.

366
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,549
Shall I say we're missing some
things that are supposed to be here?

367
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:12,920
As you know, I was in a coma.

368
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,150
Oh, that's right. Did you have
an out-of-body experience?

369
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,789
I heard it happens to some people.

370
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,559
I heard some people
go to the underworld and come back.

371
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,759
Gosh, are you serious?

372
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:24,160
Bong Hee.

373
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,329
I hope you end up in the fiery pit.

374
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,200
I didn't experience any of that.

375
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,410
But I think I had some dreams.

376
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,309
I remember a few of them.

377
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,549
Wake up already, will you?

378
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,519
If you wake up, I'll donate
all of my assets.

379
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,819
No, let me correct that.
I'll give them all to you.

380
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,829
You can have it all, okay?

381
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,829
I'll even change the name
of our firm.

382
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,599
I'll take out my surname
and include yours.

383
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,339
"No, Ji, and Bang".

384
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,400
I remember it vividly.

385
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,779
I never said such a thing.

386
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:18,650
If you ever lose the ladder game,
I'll serve your penalty for you.

387
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,579
You can count on me
every single time.

388
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,960
So please wake up, okay?

389
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,460
Mr. Bang.

390
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,799
Please wake up already.

391
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,839
Why did you have to end up like this
after working so hard?

392
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,009
Please just wake up.

393
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,180
Then I'll hire an office manager
as well as a secretary for you.

394
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,150
You can have your own
secretary and driver.

395
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,349
I earn a lot of money, you know.
I don't have anywhere to spend it.

396
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,559
What a fun, imaginative dream.

397
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,400
Gosh. Oh, my!

398
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,549
Oh, right. Mr. Bang's medication.

399
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,529
If I pass by a pharmacy, remind me
to pick up Mr. Bang's medication.

400
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,200
(Searching)

401
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,769
(Under the Tree Pharmacy)

402
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:47,099
(Directions)

403
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,650
I've forgotten about it,
but who could it have been?

404
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,849
The person who left
the knife at Jung Hyun Soo's house.

405
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,319
Gosh. Then...

406
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,490
the culprit must be one of them...

407
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,490
Culprit of what?

408
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,329
I've been reading...

409
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,400
a detective novel lately. I'm trying
to figure out the culprit...

410
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,509
in the novel.

411
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,640
My mom once told me.

412
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,410
"The one who appears
at this moment is the culprit."

413
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:30,349
He's the culprit.

414
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:35,950
You two, get out of my way.

415
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,119
It's my turn to do the dishes.

416
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:22,430
You know that weapon
which is the fabricated evidence?

417
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,039
I...

418
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:30,240
I decided not to use that evidence.

419
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:32,339
But...

420
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,480
I don't know if I have made
the right choice or not.

421
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,119
He's definitely the culprit.

422
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:43,819
He even admitted the crimes himself.

423
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
But...

424
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,559
I'm pretending to be better...

425
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,230
than he is and following the law.

426
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,460
Is this okay? Am I doing
the right thing?

427
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,230
You are supposed to let me
know about these things.

428
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,269
You are supposed to scold me
when I do something wrong.

429
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:06,880
So please...

430
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:13,349
Please wake up soon.

431
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,880
As an officer of the law,
I am ashamed.

432
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,220
But sometimes,

433
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,819
I ought to use my fists
than the law.

434
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,369
Mr. Lee.

435
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:42,910
- Yes.
- You're suspected of starting...

436
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,640
a fire at a house at 746 Haeim-dong.
In other words,

437
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,339
you're under investigation for
attempted incendiarism.

438
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,180
You're aware of it, right?

439
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Yes, I am.

440
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,819
I've already told the police
everything.

441
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,150
Even if you did, you still need
to tell me everything again.

442
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:00,789
I see.

443
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,059
Yes.

444
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,630
Then shall we begin?

445
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,730
I started a fire in Doboo-dong
two years ago, and someone died.

446
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:12,039
But someone else got arrested
as the culprit,

447
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,710
so I confessed everything
to the police as I felt too guilty.

448
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,069
But...

449
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,740
you're saying I have to tell you
again, right?

450
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
That's correct.

451
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,180
What did you just say?

452
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,349
We, at the prosecution,

453
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,660
cannot make any more mistakes.

454
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:35,559
What I'm saying is that we...

455
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,559
can no longer betray
the people's trust.

456
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,559
Do you understand?

457
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,970
How have you been, Mr. Kang?

458
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,509
Not bad, thanks to you.

459
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,240
Why are you thanking me?
You're locked up here because of me.

460
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,220
I'd like to ask you to defend me
at the trial for my appeal.

461
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,150
Well, you lost the first trial
because of me.

462
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,990
Why would you want me
to defend you again?

463
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,089
You're the only one...

464
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:07,390
I can count on.

465
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,730
I...

466
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,299
really can't stand
being falsely accused like this.

467
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:16,000
I never started any fire.

468
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,700
So please...

469
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,940
help me just this once.

470
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240
Please?

471
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,579
Please...

472
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,019
Two years ago, Kang Sun Il...

473
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:35,789
was arrested as the culprit
of the Doboo-dong arson case.

474
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:37,089
The victim was...

475
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,660
this man.

476
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,819
His name is Chae Sung Woo,
and he was sleeping at home.

477
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,359
He suffocated to death
immediately at the scene.

478
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,660
Kang Sun Il was sentenced to 10
years in prison at his first trial.

479
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:47,859
What was his murder motive?

480
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,430
The prosecution insisted
that it's a revenge crime.

481
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:54,200
Kang Sun Il's daughter got hit
by Chae Sung Woo's car and died.

482
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,470
Chae Sung Woo, who was drunk
and didn't have a driver's license,

483
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,579
got released without any punishment
due to diminished capacity.

484
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
Goodness.

485
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,779
From the forensics report alone,

486
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:06,849
I don't think it can be concluded
that Kang Sun Il...

487
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:08,519
is the arsonist.

488
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,949
I know, right?

489
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,989
The incompetent attorney
who lost that first trial...

490
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,619
was me.

491
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,559
He appealed, and the trial
for that will take place soon.

492
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,829
He wants me
to defend him once again.

493
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
But...

494
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,070
I've already lost once,

495
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,269
so I'm feeling unsure
and not confident.

496
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,639
Hence, I'm asking you guys for help.

497
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:28,500
Ji Wook, help me out.

498
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,409
Ms. Eun and Mr. Bang,
please help me with this.

499
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,010
I don't want to.

500
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,210
Last time, you insisted on helping
me when I asked you not to.

501
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,780
I only helped you because
you begged me not to help you.

502
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,480
Okay. Then don't help me.

503
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,719
All right, I won't.

504
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,050
You should offer help
if I tell you not to help me.

505
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,389
He doesn't seem so bright, does he?

506
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,489
No, not really.

507
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,489
He said his IQ is very high.

508
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,489
I'm not sure if it's true.

509
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,099
I really think Kang Sun Il
is innocent. I'm serious.

510
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:55,099
With Jung Hyun Soo,

511
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,539
we thought the same.

512
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:03,769
And...

513
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:06,909
I'm sorry,

514
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:10,280
but I don't want to work on...

515
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,489
arson cases.

516
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,190
My apologies.

517
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,500
I totally forgot about that, Ji
Wook. I'm sorry.

518
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,269
Ms. Eun, how about you take the lead
on this one?

519
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,000
We'll give you the support you need.

520
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,170
Well... I'm not so comfortable
with it either.

521
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,710
My dad...

522
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,409
also passed away in fire.

523
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:52,989
But I'll think about it.

524
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:04,000
A mistake with the prosecution.

525
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,199
A fire.

526
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:10,269
And it's a revenge crime.

527
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,780
Revenge.

528
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,880
Can you recognize him?

529
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,019
This man...

530
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,659
is the one who...

531
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,929
killed your mom and dad.

532
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,400
Okay?

533
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:55,250
Did you have a good sleep?

534
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:56,989
Yes.

535
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,989
Come on.

536
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:05,289
Go take a shower and get dressed up.

537
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,230
- What?
- We're going out on a date today.

538
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,070
A date?

539
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,579
You really wanted to come here?

540
00:37:58,949 --> 00:37:59,949
Yes!

541
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,460
All right. I guess
you are good at these games?

542
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,659
All right.

543
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:13,130
Getting a stuffed doll out of
the claw machine isn't so easy.

544
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,070
People don't think it'd be hard
because the stuffed dolls are cute.

545
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:17,230
They will be in trouble then.

546
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,769
You have to be circumspect.
Look at this.

547
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:22,139
Do it just like this. All right.

548
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,579
Here I go.

549
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:41,789
- Can I give it a try?
- Sure.

550
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:43,090
Give it a shot.

551
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,050
Mr. No?

552
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,150
Bong Hee, do you want to try this?

553
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,090
- Shall we?
- Okay.

554
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,219
Here we go.

555
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,559
It's beside you. No, no.

556
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,789
No, I'm in trouble.

557
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:16,829
Hold on.

558
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,599
No, no.

559
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,730
Oh, no. What do I do?

560
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,539
Mr. No, hold on.

561
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Wait.

562
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,679
There you go.

563
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,590
You fool.

564
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,519
Darn. It's ruined.

565
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,860
Gosh, I won.

566
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,260
Mr. No? Mr. No!

567
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,500
How can you get upset
because of those games?

568
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,909
No, I'm not upset.
I'm not upset at all.

569
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,469
Mr. No...

570
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,880
It's not that you are bad, honey.
I'm just that good.

571
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,980
You were really good though.

572
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:47,380
I'll let you win next time.

573
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,119
No, that's okay.
Don't ever let me win.

574
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,090
The next time we play will
be the game that counts.

575
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,989
This is nothing
to get serious about,

576
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:55,320
but we must play again
next time. I'm in.

577
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,630
Bring it on. Okay!

578
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,769
Hold on.

579
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,179
(Buy medicine for Mr. Bang.)

580
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,610
That's right, Mr. Bang's medicine.

581
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:20,150
Let me go to a pharmacy for a
second.

582
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,150
Okay.

583
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,630
Goodness, Son!

584
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,599
- What's this?
- Ji Wook!

585
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,599
Mom.

586
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:36,599
Mom, why are you here?

587
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:40,039
Mr. Byun insisted
on having dinner today.

588
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,500
He said there's a good sundaeguk
restaurant around this area.

589
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,639
Really?

590
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:44,969
Why are you here, Ji Wook?

591
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,809
Well, I...

592
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,179
This is perfect.
Let's have dinner together.

593
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:53,179
Come on. Join us
and let's have a meal today.

594
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,420
Mom, the truth is I have...

595
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,019
someone with me.

596
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,059
You do? Who is it?

597
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,559
Well...

598
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,699
Is it your girlfriend?

599
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:10,969
Yes.

600
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:12,099
Goodness.

601
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,070
What's wrong, Mom?
You are not happy about that?

602
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,070
- No, I am happy.
- Hold on.

603
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,940
I'm happy to hear that.

604
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,710
What's going on? What is this?

605
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,619
He called her Mom.

606
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,719
Mom?

607
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,550
Is she your daughter?

608
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,059
She's the attorney which every
insignificant person can become?

609
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,489
Mom. Recently, there was a verdict
that workplace harassment...

610
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,300
can be considered
an industrial accident as well.

611
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,429
Just keep that in mind.

612
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:47,369
Mom, why do I get the feeling your
boss is always eavesdropping on us?

613
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:48,699
Or is it just me?

614
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,070
It's because her life is boring.

615
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,110
Young Soon!

616
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,210
Goodness.

617
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,010
What do I do?

618
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,179
You got a girlfriend, Ji Wook.

619
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,320
Wait a second, Mom.

620
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,320
Okay.

621
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,530
Why?

622
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,429
I can't.

623
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:32,820
Gosh.

624
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,460
Bong Hee, hold on. Bong Hee!

625
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:41,789
- Bong Hee, wait!
- Ji Wook!

626
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:44,389
Ji Wook, Ji Wook!

627
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,059
Gosh.

628
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,860
What is it?

629
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,269
Why is she running away?

630
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:54,440
Exactly. Why is she running away?

631
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,610
No way.

632
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,610
I'm doomed.

633
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,650
I'm completely doomed.

634
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,090
Gosh.

635
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,130
You brought us kimchi
and side dishes on this hot day.

636
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,329
Thank you so much.

637
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,869
I'm sorry that I didn't get to visit
earlier although she worked here.

638
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:31,969
Anyway, we will enjoy
the kimchi and pizza, Ms. Park.

639
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,940
Goodness, you didn't have
to address me like that.

640
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,619
I didn't know that...

641
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:46,289
you had a bright halo
around your head.

642
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:47,389
Excuse me?

643
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:52,829
Sure, it's shining.

644
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:54,230
Thank you for your compliment.

645
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,329
It's bright.

646
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:58,329
Thank you for the pizza.

647
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:00,599
Gosh, you are so loud.

648
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,869
Don't laugh so loudly.
You should go home.

649
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:04,539
Say hello.

650
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,809
Who is she?

651
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,519
You are the prosecutor
who saved Bong Hee, right?

652
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:15,949
Are you Bong Hee's...

653
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:17,219
I'm Bong Hee's mom.

654
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:18,949
Goodness.

655
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,420
There's another one
around his head too.

656
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:24,889
Who is it between you two?

657
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:32,170
I haven't formally introduced
myself. I am No Ji Wook.

658
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,269
Hello.

659
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,670
Young Soon?

660
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,880
Ms. Hong.

661
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,179
The CEO your daughter
talked about is...

662
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,980
my son?

663
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:55,190
No way. Is he your son?

664
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:01,929
Ji Wook, you are not
dating her daughter,

665
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,300
right?

666
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,369
I think it's a bit rude to say that.

667
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,769
Ms. Hong.

668
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:08,170
What is it, Young Soon?

669
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,010
Since we are about the same age,
stop addressing me like that.

670
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,880
Pardon?

671
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,550
We should leave them to handle
their own businesses.

672
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,619
We should go out and talk.

673
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,820
Goodness, how can a mother
with a daughter be so confident?

674
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,719
You're so old-fashioned. Are you
bragging because you have a son?

675
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,130
She's lame.

676
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,059
So what?

677
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:35,360
What are you going to do if I don't
approve of their relationship?

678
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,300
Mom, that was out of line.

679
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,429
I don't approve either.

680
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:42,000
Sure. Go ahead
and don't give your blessing.

681
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,869
What's wrong with my daughter?

682
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:45,210
She's your daughter.

683
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,010
I'm scared of her.

684
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:55,849
Ms. Eun.

685
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:58,789
Bong Hee!

686
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:14,940
Mom.

687
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:16,070
We're dating each other.

688
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,440
Ji Wook!

689
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,750
Act surprised.

690
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,510
- My gosh!
- My goodness!

691
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,079

(Seongbuk-dong Assault Incident)

693
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,440
Sir.

694
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,010
It really wasn't me.

695
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,849
I drove my taxi during the day.

696
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:01,619
It was the driver on the night shift
who fought with the customer.

697
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,690
Please check the work history.

698
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,690
Sir.

699
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:09,289
I've never once hit anyone
in my life.

700
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:11,889
I've never even gotten into
an argument before.

701
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,260
The victim already stated that...

702
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,869
you're the assaulter.

703
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:19,030
He said he can't remember anything
because he was drunk.

704
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,769
He's mistaking me...

705
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:22,239
with another driver.

706
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:23,940
Then get your indictment suspended.

707
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,449
Because of this incident,
I got fired from the taxi company.

708
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,349
I can't even do any
physical labor...

709
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:35,550
because I'm always busy coming
to court.

710
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,590
I barely make a proper living
right now.

711
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,289
So please...

712
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:43,559
save me and my family.

713
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,460
Sir.

714
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,699

715
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,800

my boyfriend's parents.

720
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,239
My gosh, what should I do?

721
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:43,920
First, let's do the laundry.

722
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,960
Bong Hee, please take this.

723
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:07,940
Mr. No?

724
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:09,210
Yes?

725
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:12,449
Are you going somewhere?

726
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,150
What's that?

727
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:15,650
It's my laundry.

728
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,050
I feel uncomfortable to dry it here,

729
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,820
so I'm going to go to a laundromat.

730
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,070
I'll be...

731

Let's go.

732
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,289
Don't worry too much about...

733
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,260
my mom and Mr. Byun.

734
00:50:58,289 --> 00:50:59,860
How can I not worry?

735
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,369
I can win them both.

736
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:07,139
I also...

737
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,309
never lose to neither of them.
That's the problem.

738

Yes, you're right.

739

Let's go meet your dad next time.

740
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:29,789
But...

741
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:31,929
when are you going to give it to me?

742
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:36,570
What?

743
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:39,000
That thing you've been hesitating
all day to give me.

744

My gosh.

746
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,210
Yes. Here.

747

What do you think? Do you like it?

748
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,260
It's pretty.

749
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,030
Would you like to try it on?

750
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,210
It's pretty.

751
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,050
- Is it pretty?
- Yes.

To be honest,

756
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,449
I think it'd be better if you never
wake up.

757
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,210
Yes.

758

It's the final trial soon. I'll tell
you as soon as I get the results.

00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:18,559
but I can still see the sun.

in the middle of the day.

Go ahead. It's over there.

768

You're going to wait for me, right?

afterwards.

Yes. A little.

Oh, I see.
