1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,940
 This wasn't "love." 

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:18,090
 If anything, I initially thought it was closer to "hate." 

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,830
 And yet, like a drizzle 

4
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,580
 or a spring breeze, 

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,170
 I felt that gradual change. 

6
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,510
 And without warning, 

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,380
 he slowly seeped and settled into my heart. 

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,740
 That is why I decided I would tell him exactly how I felt. 

9
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,320
We're tied by fate.

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,400
- Yes, we– 
 - In a bad way.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,390
- What? 
 - Don't barge into my life, ever again.

12
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,320
Did you not hear what I said?

13
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,020
Here. This tea works wonders for insomnia.

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,320
How did you know about my insomnia? 
    

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,410
After working for you, it's easy to tell.

16
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,380
And...

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,220
And?

18
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,740
I'm sorry for assuming you were a molester and also for forcing you to resign.

19
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,040
And...

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,770
And?

21
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,600
I...

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,630
wanted to express my gratitude for what you did in court.

23
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,890
- And... 
 - There's more?

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,380
What was it...

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,000
What?

26
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,490
I love you.

27
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:23,250


28
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,490
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

29
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:33,020
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

30
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,470
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

31
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,690
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

32
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:49,050
♫  Here's the love that I long for 

33
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,610
   

34
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,880
 I'm no longer a prosecutor. 

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,420
 Dad, I wanted to become a great man like you. 

36
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,970
 That's not yours, Haruto. 

37
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,730
 - Give it back. 
 - No. 

38
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,420
 Haruto. You've got to be the man worthy of this badge, all right? 

39
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,950
 - Yes. 
 - That's my son. 

40
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,630
 - Now, can I have that back? 
 - No. 

41
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,320
 Why not? 

42
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,120
So bitter!

43
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,090
   

44
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,640
No, I can't.

45
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,510
Could you show me where Sota was found?

46
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,990
I'm impressed you can still live here,

47
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,480
although this is the place where you murdered Sota.

48
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,880
I did no such thing.

49
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,460
There is no proof of your innocence.

50
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,460
Nor of my guilt.

51
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,690
Who else could have possibly done this?

52
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,280
I will arrest you

53
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,690
and have you pay for your sins.

54
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,110
I will never forgive you, for as long as I live.

55
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,500
 I began searching high and low for the culprit. 

56
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,470
 I wanted anything that could be a lead. 

57
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,690
 

58
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,370
   

59
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,070
 This was the only place the culprit left any evidence of themselves. 

60
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,150
 Where did the culprit go afterward? 

61
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,780
No, don't tell me...

62
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,890
Oh, it's just you.

63
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,620
Jeez, you could've at least said a name.

64
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,220
What, you wanted me to walk in while introducing myself?

65
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,140
I suppose that would've been weirder.

66
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,250
What brings you here?

67
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,280
My pride wouldn't allow me to let a case go unsolved.

68
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,690
Don't let this bother you. I'll look into it on my own.

69
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,690
You're searching for leads alone, in a desolate place like this?

70
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,270
Yes.

71
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,160
Don't. Head home for the day.

72
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,800
Are you worried about me?

73
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,250
It's not like that.

74
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,280
Yes, you are.

75
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,780
I am not.

76
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,540
I just care about you as your former mentor.

77
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,160
Most would say that means you're worried about me.

78
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,100
Either way, this is the last of my meddling.

79
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,240
Please don't put yourself in harm's way anymore.

80
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,510
When I find the culprit, may I come see you?

81
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,190
Tateishi-san, I will prove you made the right choice.

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,320
And when I do, I'll come to see you again.

83
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,680
 From then on, I spent my days searching in desperation. 

84
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:21,680
 But whenever I struggled, I always caught myself looking for you. 

85
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:10,380
 Every time I saw you,  

86
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,850
 it inspired me to hold on a little longer. 

87
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,130
   

88
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,410
   

89
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,740
   

90
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,880
How could you threaten the victim to settle this out of court?

91
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,680
It's his fault. Cheeky bastard.

92
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,710
That does not justify your bullying.

93
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,110
The only reason they're not complying is to milk us from reparations.

94
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,580
Those awful parents are using their child to make some spare change.

95
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,840
Ma'am, your son will only repeat his mistakes.

96
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,800
What do you mean by that?

97
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,260
Your son will never own up to his faults because his own parents use money as a solution.

98
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,370
He will only continue to repeat these sorts of incidents.

99
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,790
Ma'am, at this rate, you'll outlive him

100
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,350
and end up cleaning up after his mistakes for life.

101
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,900
Look. You're not a prosecutor anymore.

102
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:31,250
You've been a defense attorney for two years now. You can't go lecturing your clients, all right?

103
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,930
Now go apologize.

104
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,030
Apologize right now!

105
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,850
Yes, Sir.

106
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:57,530
Like father, like son, right?

107
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,750
This is Miyashita Sakura of Miyashita Law Firm, speaking.

108
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,170
Yes.

109
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,220
In thirty minutes?

110
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,140
Yes, I'll be there.

111
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,930
 Because of the incident, 
   

112
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,900
 no firm would hire me, which led me to start my own. 

113
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,460
Please let my next client be normal for once.

114
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,270
 However, about 90% of my clients have been like the following... 

115
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:50,530
 Miss, I hear you murdered your boyfriend. 

116
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,780
 Truth be told, I also wish to murder my husband. 

117
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,760
 Rumor has it you know how to get off scot-free in court? 

118
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,510
 No sir, I do not. 

119
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,380
 I am not a hitman for hire. 

120
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,270
 As you can see, they were not normal... 

121
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,480
Please. Please, let this be an actual client.

122
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,220
Coming.

123
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,960
Please, state your case.

124
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,360
I would like to press for medical fees and reparations.

125
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,940
May I ask from whom?

126
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,210
The girl I used to love.

127
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,470
 Nana. 

128
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,710
 Listen, please just– 

129
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,120
 I don't ever want to see you again. 

130
00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:00,290
 Hayashi-san was told to leave by the person he loves just as I was. 

131
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:07,140
 He then stayed in her periphery, like I stayed in his. 

132
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:14,180
I was given a restraining order for stalking and had not seen her for one and a half years.

133
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,930
 However, just the other day... 

134
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,140
 Nana. 

135
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,000
 Hey, wait. Nana. 

136
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,810
 - Nana– 
- No! 

137
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:48,860
 I no longer have feelings for her. I only wish to press for medical costs and reparations. 

138
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,070
I understand. I will handle this.

139
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,500
The plaintiff suffered a broken wrist and ankle for two months.

140
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,230
As such, he is requesting 700,000 yen in reparations.

141
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:28,050
This incident occurred because the plaintiff broke his restraining order.

142
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,410
The fault lies with the plaintiff alone. He cannot claim reparations.

143
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,660
- He met the defendant by coincidence. 
 - On what basis?

144
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,630
Coincidence or not, he called out to the defendant. He violated the restraining order.

145
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,070
Well...

146
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,010
The defendant has suffered psychological harm.

147
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,590
Pushing the plaintiff was a valid act of self defense.

148
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,170
The plaintiff has never abused the defendant.

149
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,220
Though he has not physically harmed her,

150
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,970
the very act of stalking is psychological abuse.

151
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,960
This includes unwarranted staring,

152
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:10,240
 as well as the fear, disgust, and worry that accompany it. 

153
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,300
 Only those who've experienced such horror could understand her terror. 

154
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,260
Plaintiff's attorney.

155
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,590
How about both parties discuss this in a court-mediated settlement?

156
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,780
Long time no see.

157
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,760
Indeed, it has been.

158
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,560
I never expected you'd be the defense attorney, Tateishi-san.

159
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,320
I shall reach out once I've settled the details with my client.

160
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,840
Why are you acting so distant?

161
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,520
You used to be more upfront and frank with me.

162
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,470
We are not on friendly terms, no?

163
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,630
Please do not contact Nomura-san following this discussion.

164
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,800
Remember, your restraining order is still in effect.

165
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,590
Of course.

166
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,880
One. The plaintiff shall not press charges against the defendant.

167
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:31,470
Two. The defendant shall not press charges against the plaintiff

168
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,000
for violating his restraining order.

169
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,270
Do both parties agree to these terms?

170
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,930
Yes, Sir.

171
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,510
Yes, Sir.

172
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,390
Thank you for all your help.

173
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,880
Thank you for your assistance.

174
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,570
Is this outcome truly all right with you?

175
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,320
Yes.

176
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,170
Thank you again.

177
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,900
I think this result was for the best.

178
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,160
- Please reach out if there's anything else. 
 - Thank you.

179
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,530
Why was he smiling?

180
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,510
He'll never see the person he loves ever again...

181
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,880
   

182
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,880
Tateishi-san?

183
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,620
Could I ask you to come back to the courthouse?

184
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,600
Nana.

185
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,970
Why do you believe he'll chase after Nomura-san?

186
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,350
It was his expression. This is just my intuition, though.

187
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,300
He didn't look unhappy to be parting ways.

188
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,250
Let's hurry.

189
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,690
You trust my intuition?

190
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,340
Come on, let's go.

191
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,550
Nana?

192
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,120
Nana?

193
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,100
Nana?

194
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,800
Nana?

195
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,050
I missed you, Nana.

196
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,390
Let's have a nice, long chat, shall we?

197
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,380
Hayashi-san!

198
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,470
Not another step!

199
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,890
Don't get in my way!

200
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,050
I only wanted to be by your side...

201
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,090
I'm truly sorry for all the trouble.

202
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,700
I misjudged Hayashi-san's character.

203
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,100
Don't blame yourself.

204
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,580
Scum like him always look normal.

205
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,890
Besides, we were able to prevent the worst-case scenario thanks to you.

206
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,400
I appreciate your consolation.

207
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,650
It's the truth.

208
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,820
I mean, I only speak the truth.

209
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,580
 It hurts to not be loved by the person you love. 

210
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:38,340
 But it hurts even more to be asked to love someone you don't love. 

211
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,620
Tateishi-san, I won't get close to you ever again.

212
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,210
Nor do I like you.

213
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,470
With that said, take care.

214
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,770
♫  I changed everything for you, to suit you  ♫

215
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:02,540
♫  The cheesy lines like a drama don't suit me  ♫

216
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,650
♫  But don't laugh at me even if I try to act like a grown-up  ♫

217
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:11,860
 I've put a restraining order on myself. 

218
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,840
♫  But you seem close and yet far away  ♫

219
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,510
Why did I say my farewells like that? We weren't even dating.

220
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:39,990


221
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,560
   

222
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,620
   

223
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,550
Unbelievable...

224
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,210
 You forgot something, again. 

225
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,210
The culprit came. The one who murdered Sota.

226
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,370
Say what?

227
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,900
They're... still here.

228
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,260
   
 I told you to stay out of harm's way. 

229
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,800
 Don't do something so dangerous. 

230
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,820
 You didn't catch the culprit's face? 

231
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,760
 I'm grasping for straws at this point. 

232
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,450
 That case is my responsibility as well. 

233
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,920
 Let me hire you.
