1
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,330
The same goes for me.

2
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,129
I have...

3
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,129
two dads.

4
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,199
Really?

5
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,129
I'll tell you my story next time...

6
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,639
when I have the chance.

7
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,509
I'm not so comfortable
with it either.

8
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,180
My dad...

9
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,750
also passed away due to a
fire accident.

10
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,459
It smells nice.

11
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,970
Did you sleep well?

12
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,029
Yes.

13
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,300
How about you? Did you sleep well?

14
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,470
Yes.

15
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,879
But why are you cooking
so much food?

16
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
You're right.

17
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,069
Hey.

18
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,879
Are you two trying to kill me
or something?

19
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,949
Ms. Eun must've cooked this.
Am I right?

20
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,079
I'm sure it wasn't Mr. No
who cooked this.

21
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,220
No, it wasn't me.

22
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,620
But it looks delicious.
Does it taste bad?

23
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,689
You lack in so many ways.

24
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,959
I already heard everything.

25
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,069
I wasn't going to oppose
of your relationship,

26
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,870
but I really can't accept you.

27
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,970
I... I really didn't cook this.

28
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,819
(Postponement)

29
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,360
I started a fire in Doboo-dong
two years ago, and someone died.

30
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,629
But someone else got arrested
as the culprit,

31
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:03,839
so I confessed everything
to the police as I felt too guilty.

32
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,740
You made a confession last time.

33
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,910
You said you were the one who
caused a fire and killed someone.

34
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,649
And?

35
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,649
You just told me to leave back
then.

36
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,980
I changed my mind.

37
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,750
I don't think I should let go of
that case so easily.

38
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:22,819
I also...

39
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,160
changed my mind.

40
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm going to take back...

41
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,990
my confession.

42
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,970
Mr. Lee, wait.

43
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,379
Hello, Mr. Ji.

44
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,149
Hello, Prosecutor Na.

45
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,689
Can I ask you something?

46
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,689
Of course.

47
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,290
Go ahead.

48
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,290
That guy who was with
Prosecutor Cha just now...

49
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,399
Do you know who he is?

50
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,470
He's an arsonist.

51
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,769
An arsonist?

52
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,639
Yes. My heart caught fire
because of...

53
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,310
He apparently started a fire
at someone's house...

54
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,610
or a car.

55
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,750
He's a serial arsonist.

56
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,220
An arsonist?

57
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,569
Yes, Mr. No. What's going on?

58
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,139
I have a favor to ask.

59
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,939
It's a personal issue.

60
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,740
A personal issue?

61
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,649
Are you two going to register
your marriage already?

62
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm sorry. It was lame, wasn't it?

63
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,019
There's something I'd like to know
regarding my parents' death.

64
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,660
I'd like to know the circumstances
of the incident...

65
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,629
or...

66
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,500
who the culprit was.

67
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,670
Things like that.

68
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,240
Why do you suddenly wish to know
about the past?

69
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,610
I just suddenly...

70
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
became curious.

71
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,209
Okay. I'll look into it
as quickly as...

72
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,550
No, no.

73
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,919
You don't need to rush.

74
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,049
It's nothing urgent.

75
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,590
It might be a better idea to
take it slow.

76
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,629
Just...

77
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,830
take it slow.

78
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,830
You can slowly...

79
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,039
look into it.

80
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,440
Okay. I'll do that.

81
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,009
(Lawyer Ji Eun Hyuk)

82
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
What?

83
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,980
I'm just looking at...

84
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,049
what you're up to.

85
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,919
I'm working. What else
would I be doing?

86
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:18,919
Oh, I see.

87
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,460
I'll help you.

88
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:22,629
You said you needed help.

89
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,230
I don't care if it's complicated
or simple.

90
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,570
I want to get rid of all these
useless thoughts in my head.

91
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:29,830
I'm up for anything that can
help me focus.

92
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,840
I'll help you.

93
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,269
What's with this sudden kindness?

94
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,539
Thank you for the offer,

95
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,210
- but I don't have anything for you.
- You don't have anything?

96
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,440
No. I had some paperwork to take
care of, which you hate doing,

97
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,779
but I'm almost done with that.

98
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:44,049
And the only criminal case...

99
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm in charge of right now...

100
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,120
is that appeal trial regarding
the fire accident.

101
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,559
Thanks for offering,
but you don't need to help.

102
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,889
- I'll do it.
- What?

103
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,460
I'll take that case.

104
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,769
But Ji Wook, it's regarding
a fire incident.

105
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,570
No. No, it's fine.

106
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,440
It's not like I never worked
on arson cases as a prosecutor.

107
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,470
Yes, I think I can do it.

108
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,740
It'll be doable. I'll be all right.
I'll help you.

109
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,179
Will you really be okay?

110
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,509
Yes.

111
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,679
Let's do it together, Mr. No.

112
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,850
I'll help too.

113
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:27,360
Will you be okay with it?

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,059
All right, then.

115
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,649
He's Kang Sun Il, the man who was
sentenced to 10 years in jail...

116
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,289
for the arson case in Doboo-dong.
He's preparing for an appeal now.

117
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:01,460
I looked through the case files
from that time.

118
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,500
(Doboo-dong Arson Case, 2015)

119
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,230
Kang Sun Il was ruled guilty
due to...

120
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,940
the presence of a motive,
circumstantial evidence,

121
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,200
and the witness statement.

122
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,210
You said that Chae Sung Woo
hit Kang Sun Il's daughter...

123
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,110
with his car, right?
It was a DUI hit-and-run.

124
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,580
That's correct. After the accident,

125
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,679
Kang Sun Il visited Chae Sung Woo
from time to time and said...

126
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,279
things like, "I won't let it slide.
I'll get my daughter's revenge."

127
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,620
I think he threatened him.

128
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:30,120
He was even taken to a police
station because of it.

129
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:33,460
The one day, the fire broke out.

130
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:36,230
And Chae Sung Woo died
due to the fire.

131
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,129
But Kang Sun Il is insisting that
he was wrongly accused...

132
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
and that he's innocent.

133
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,240
Well, that's right.

134
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,940
So what are you saying, Yoo Jung?

135
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,909
Do you want to keep digging this up?

136
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,350
Are you out of your mind?
The DA wants us to just bury it.

Whoever that admits
the prosecution's mistakes...

138

or exposes its true face
can't survive in the organization.

139

Just like what happened to Mr. No
because of the Eun Bong Hee case.

140
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,029

Mr. No...

142
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,879
I can't believe...

143
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,480
that you're my man now.

144
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,539

- I'm back now.

00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:54,809
Aren't I right?

166
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:09,119
Everyone is waiting.

167
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,119
Oh, right. I'll come down right now.

168
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,920
- Here.
- Thanks.

169
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,750
- Please have this piece.
- Gosh, it's hot.

170
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,789
It tastes even better
with the dipping sauce.

171
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:43,819
That's right.

172
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:45,819
It's spicy.

173
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,789
It's sort of like
bindaetteok, isn't it?

174
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,230
- You can say that.
- Right?

175
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,660
It's American-style bindaetteok.

176
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,700
I haven't heard "bindaetteok"
in such a long time.

177
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,670
Yes, totally.

178
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,369
- Try the original.
- It's good.

179
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,980
Yes, it's delicious.

180
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,539
No...

181
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:57,160
Are you... Are you okay?

182
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,970
I...

183
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,880
I'm all right.

184
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,450
For how long have you
been standing there?

185
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,990
For a while.

186
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,390
For a while?

187
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,009
What is that for?

188
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:46,109
Don't get the wrong idea.

189
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,779
I was worried about you, Mr. No.

190
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,849
I mean you kept having nightmares
and couldn't sleep, Ji Wook.

191
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:54,180
I didn't have any other agenda.

192
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,250
I didn't have an ulterior motive.
Don't misunderstand me. Okay?

193
00:21:58,819 --> 00:21:59,920
I don't know.

194
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,190
I still don't know even
if you glare at me like that.

195
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,259
Fine. I get it.

196
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:13,900
You are really okay, right?

197
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,009
Yes, I'm all right.

198
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,049
Ji Wook,

199
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,549
why did you become a prosecutor?

200
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,750
My dad...

201
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:32,960
was a prosecutor.

202
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,660
You wanted to be like your dad.

203
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes.

204
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,500
Your dad...

205
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,740
must be proud of you.

206
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:49,710
I don't know.

207
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,109
I'm not sure about that.

208
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,950
Why wouldn't he be?

209
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:08,589
What about you, Bong Hee?

210
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,990
Sorry?

211
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,059
Why did you become an attorney?

212
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:16,470
I...

213
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,269
became an attorney
because of one perverted judge.

214
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,440
I stopped being an athlete...

215
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,970
and started studying to become
an attorney.

216
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,680
As I studied deeper into the
subject,

217
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:30,480
I began to think that
I was fated to become one.

218
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,420
I think...

219
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:36,490
I became an attorney
to defend people...

220
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,789
like my dad.

221
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,490
What kind of people are they?

222
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,630
People like me.

223
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,299
Innocent people who were
misunderstood by the world...

224
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,869
and wrongfully framed.

225
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,809
Every criminal in the world...

226
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,980
Excuse me?

227
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
Nothing.

228
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,849
It's nothing.

229
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,140
I'm sorry.

230
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,380
I'm sorry, Bong Hee.

231
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:16,279
I put all the healthy
ingredients in this.

232
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,279
I can see that.

233
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,549
- The color...
- Doesn't it look healthy?

234
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:25,859
Exactly.

235
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:27,289
That really looks healthy.

236
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,470
Did you put the tea
for the insomnia in this?

237
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,029
No, I didn't.

238
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,509
Thank you for this.

239
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:53,220
Then give me a morning kiss.

240
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,299
I sweated a lot from exercise
and probably stink.

241
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:06,359
Let me wash up.

242
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:14,940
But that's the good part.

243
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,079
What's going on?

244
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:34,319
Goodness, darn it.

245
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,700
Is he...

246
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,369
upset because it tastes horrible?

247
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:50,640
Gosh, this tastes terrible.

248
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,839
I can see why he got upset.

249
00:27:58,579 --> 00:27:59,579
That's understandable.

250
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:03,619
This is probably why.

251
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:22,609
Ji Hye.

252
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,710
Yoo Jung.

253
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,640
What? Why are you here?

254
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,910
Then why are you here?

255
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,480
I live in this building.

256
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:30,880
I do too.

257
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,849
Since when?

258
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,079
Since last week.

259
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,480
Did you move here then?

260
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,789
I did.

261
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,220
You followed me all the way here.

262
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,190
Pardon? What did you say?

263
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,759
I'm glad I'm your role model
and everything.

264
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,829
You followed me
and moved into this building.

265
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,599
That's a bit creepy.

266
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,799
The more I get to know you,
my opinion of you is changing more.

267
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,000
You were putting on makeup
in the elevator,

268
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,109
which is a public space
like a bus or train.

269
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,769
I find it a bit out of line.

270
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,940
This is understandable
nowadays.

271
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,509
It's not like I do this every day.

272
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,809
"See one and you've seen them all."

273
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,119
How can you see all
after seeing just one?

274
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,990
It's hard to truly figure out a
person after seeing him or her once.

275
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,289
We call this...

276
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:13,319
the error of a hasty
generalization, Yoo Jung.

277
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,859
Hey, Ji Hye.

278
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,329
You are very
disrespectful these days.

279
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Do you know that?

280
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,710
Mr. Lee, wait.

281
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,079
I definitely saw him from somewhere.

282
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,250
Where did I see him?

283
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:46,220
I can't seem to remember him. Gosh.

284
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,960
Mr. Ji, you are distracting me.

285
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,200
He's been like this
for the last few days.

286
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,240
He's looking for someone
whom he doesn't know.

287
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,539
That guy who was with
Prosecutor Cha just now...

288
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,680
Do you know who he is?

289
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,910
He's an arsonist.

290
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,380
He's an arsonist? An arsonist...

291
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,190
The witness who testified
for Kang Sun Il's case...

292
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,690
- Ms. Eun.
- Yes?

293
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,589
You are truly amazing.

294
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,299
All right.

295
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:34,539
I found him.

296
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,009
His name is Lee Joon Hae.

297
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,539
May I approach the witness,
Your Honor?

298
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:43,410
(2 years ago)

299
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:46,650
Witness.

300
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,450
At the time of the incident,

301
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,089
you saw the person who got out
of the victim's house...

302
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,259
during the fire and ran away, right?

303
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,390
Yes.

304
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,529
I did.

305
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:01,660
The witness who stated that
he saw Kang Sun Il on the scene...

306
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:04,329
- was Lee Joon Hae.
- He's sitting right there.

307
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,970
It was that man.

308
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:11,769
He even attended the trial
as a witness.

309
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,609
But he happened to be
an arsonist himself.

310
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,849
Was it really a coincidence?

311
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,880
So to summarize it all,

312
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,190
an arsonist witnessed an arson
and reported it to the police.

313
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,519
It could've been a coincidence.

314
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:27,720
- However...
- It's possible that it wasn't.

315
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,059
If I was the prosecutor in charge,

316
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,960
I would've considered him
one of the suspects...

317
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,029
You probably would have.

318
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,569
I say that because many of those
who commit arson...

319
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:37,670
seek heroism,
and that's why they start fires.

320
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:40,569
"I'll start a fire and call the
police to become a hero."

321
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:42,170
- Something like that.
- That's right.

322
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:45,240
I've seen some of them
acting as if they're witnesses...

323
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,380
in the news.

324
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,180
That's right.
I've heard of such cases too.

325
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,720
That's why the police make sure
to film the scene for arson cases.

326
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,250
It's highly likely that the arsonist
is one of the spectators.

327
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,420
Then we should try to find
videos from the arson scene...

328
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,259
or news clips related to the case.

329
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,430
We should also go through the list
of petty arson cases in the area.

330
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,460
If our guess is right, his name will
very likely be on the list.

331
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,269
Mr. Bang, please take care of it.

332
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:13,000
Yes, you know a lot of people in
the police and the fire department.

333
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,140
- Please help us out.
- Gosh...

334
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,910
What's wrong?

335
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,440
The stab wound is achy and itchy.

336
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,940
I'm all right now.

337
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,480
- Just take it easy, then.
- I...

338
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
- We'll take care of it.
- I'll do it.

339
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,380
- I'll do it.
- No, what are you talking about?

340
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,019
It's my job to take care of such
laborious tasks. I'll...

341
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,660
I'm not getting a personal
secretary, driver,

342
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,160
or an office manager, but I'll...

343
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:37,289
- Let's find it ourselves.
- Okay.

344
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,730
- All right.
- I'll be back soon.

345
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,299
- Okay.
- Take it easy, Mr. Bang.

346
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:41,730
- Get some rest.
- I'm really okay.

347
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,130
See you guys soon.

348
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,339
I didn't think there would be
this many people who have...

349
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,710
committed or attempted arson.

350
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,880
I know, right?

351
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,349
If Lee Joon Hae really was
the arsonist,

352
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,349
Kang Sun Il, who's behind bars
right now, must be...

353
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,589
extremely upset
at being falsely accused.

354
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,529
He didn't even set the fire,

355
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,759
yet he's been turned
into an arsonist and murderer.

356
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,730
I'm not sure what to say. So far,

357
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:19,269
no evidence that can prove
his innocence has turned up.

358
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:20,940
We should dig more.

359
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:25,240
I know.
But now, there's a possibility...

360
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:27,480
that he may have been
falsely accused.

361
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,549
I know that, but I don't think you
should empathize too much.

362
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,250
I'm not empathizing with him.

363
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,960
I'm just trying to be fair
and keep all possibilities open.

364
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,019
Well, from the way I see it,

365
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:44,130
it looks like you're overly
empathizing with him.

366
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,799
As an attorney, I don't think this
much empathy is excessive.

367
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,630
- This is why attorneys...
- I know.

368
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:53,099
You don't like them.

369
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,380
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
I apologize.

370
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:07,619
Me too.

371
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:31,940
(Fire Station)

372
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,679
Where's the next fire station?

373
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,010
Haeim Fire Station.

374
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,320
Prosecutor Cha isn't here
at the moment.

375
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:51,530
(Cha Yoo Jung)

376
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,559
My gosh.

377
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,099
Hello, Mr. Ji.

378
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,769
Hello, Prosecutor Na.

379
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,170
We've been running
into each other a lot lately.

380
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,570
Yes, we have.

381
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,039
By the way,
have you seen Prosecutor Cha today?

382
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,409
Why do you need to see her?

383
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,110
Why do you think?
It's for work, of course.

384
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,989
Even if you don't emphasize
that it's for work,

385
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,949
I won't get the wrong idea.

386
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
Pardon me?

387
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,230
You have her number, right?

388
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,960
Yes, of course.

389
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:27,360
Yet you're making a point
of asking me about her.

390
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,269
Well... I have to take care of
something, so I should get going.

391
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:37,510
All right.
I'll see you some other time.

392
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,610
See you.

393
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,690
You had a long day today.

394
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,559
You should get some rest.

395
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,230
Actually,

396
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,639
is there something you're
hiding from me?

397
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:12,780
What?

398
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,650
So there is.

399
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,179
No, I'm not hiding anything.

400
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,349
I'll believe you.

401
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,159
Bong Hee.

402
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:32,090
I keep wondering if I've done
something wrong. Have I?

403
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:35,969
No, it's nothing like that.

404
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,340
It's about me, not you. It's
something I need to work out myself.

405
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:42,940
And I'm not allowed...

406
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,980
to ask you what it's about?

407
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:54,679
All right.

408
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,360
Is this another coincidence?

409
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,500
No, it's not. I tried calling you,
but you didn't pick up.

410
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,170
Oh, you did?

411
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:46,940
I don't check my phone often
because I rarely get calls.

412
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:48,269
What's up?

413
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:50,210
There's something I'd like to check.

414
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,510
What is it?

415
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,010
It'll only take five minutes.

416
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,949
I'm tired,
and my feet are killing me.

417
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,780
I want to take these heels off
right now.

418
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:04,119
- You can follow me if you want.
- What?

419
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,960
Hey.

420
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,480
What is it that you want to check?

421
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,989
Oh, right.
I'm working on an appeal case now.

422
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,219
The witness of the case is...

423
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:41,219
Lee Joon Hae?

424
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,829
Yes.

425
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,599
He's the one who attempted
the arson, isn't he?

426
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,869
And he's the culprit
of the case you're working on.

427
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,170
- What?
- He confessed.

428
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:56,539
But the high-ups want me to bury it.

429
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,139
That is complete nonsense.

430
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,079
Here.

431
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,980
What is this?

432
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,719
I dug up some intel
on Lee Joon Hae.

433
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,590
You can use it
for the trial if you'd like.

434
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:17,860
Can you do this though?

435
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,500
I don't even know.

436
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:23,469
It's getting late.
You should get going if you're done.

437
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:26,940
All right. Thanks for this.

438
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:28,599
You can stay overnight if you want.

439
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
What?

440
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,239
I was joking.

441
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,539
How can you make such a joke?

442
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,280
You think I'm a witch no matter what
I do.

443
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,079
Doesn't the joke suit me perfectly?

444
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,550
No.

445
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:43,550
Hey, Yoo Jung.
Stop beating yourself up.

446
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:45,889
It's not good for you.

447
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,300
Anyway,

448
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,869
why didn't you tell Ji Wook...

449
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:58,429
that nothing...

450
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,170
happened on that night?

451
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,940
Whether it was a mistake or not,

452
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:07,510
it is true that something
could have...

453
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,539
happened on that night.

454
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:12,179
I see.

455
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:15,519
Then what about you?

456
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,349
Why didn't you tell him?

457
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,289
Because it is true that I...

458
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,260
hurt him.

459
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,260
Yes, Mr. Bang.

460
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,940
I'm still a bachelor.

461
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,139
I can't believe I have a stab
wound on my stomach.

462
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:19,179
I'm so worried that I wouldn't
be able to meet someone.

463
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:25,619
What do you guys think about this?

464
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,360
Well, I think...

465
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:31,630
it's great.

466
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,829
I love it.

467
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,429
Right.

468
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:36,170
I think it's going to be okay.

469
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
What's great?

470
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,969
What is so great and will be okay?

471
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,010
I'm sorry.

472
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,880
Me too.

473
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,409
What are you two so worried about?

474
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,420
I'm not married, and yet I'm raising
four adults. I'm drinking...

475
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,090
soda because I was stabbed
in the stomach.

476
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,619
Why do you look so down?
Your lives are not that bad.

477
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,460
I think I made a mistake.

478
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:09,159
Everything is my fault.

479
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,170
It's my fault too.

480
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,199
Gosh.

481
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,170
Why are you apologizing?

482
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,139
To be honest, you two are in a bind.

483
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:23,250
Then...

484
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,250
what should I do?

485
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,179
It seems like I'm out of options.

486
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:31,619
Mr. Bang, you should tell
me what I should do.

487
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,659
- Goodness.
- Please?

488
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,559
Give me advice for me first.

489
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,260
I can't figure this out.

490
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,920
Unbelievable. Mr. Bang!

491
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:10,059
You got your stitches only recently.
How can you drink like this?

492
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Goodness,

493
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,059
why are you crying?
Are you that drunk?

494
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,170
I drank soda.

495
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:19,539
Do you think I'd believe that?

496
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:21,739
What kind of person cries
after drinking soda?

497
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,269
- Goodness, you are in trouble.
- Wait.

498
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,440
It's Bong Hee. Hey,
Bong Hee. Bong Hee!

499
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,139
Have a glass.

500
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,909
It is soda.

501
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:33,179
- Have 2 glasses.
- No, have only 1.

502
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:34,650
Bong Hee, have one.

503
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,090
- Take 2 glasses.
- No, have just 1.

504
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,519
Since she's late, take two glasses.

505
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:40,090
Since she's late, take one glass.

506
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,619
Fine. Take three then.

507
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,789
Goodness.

508
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,030
Gosh.

509
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:47,900
- Let's go.
- Okay.

510
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:49,030
- We're going.
- Another round?

511
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,099
- No, no.
- Don't do that.

512
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,630
- This way.
- It's my fault.

513
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:54,469
Be careful.

514
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,840
I'm all right.

515
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,510
Hold on. Just sit here for a while.

516
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,639
Let me bring you some water.

517
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:15,559
We...

518
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,829
should never break up, Bong Hee.

519
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,530
Even if I tell you to leave me,

520
00:44:25,769 --> 00:44:26,800
don't leave.

521
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:31,840
We...

522
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,940
should only think about ourselves.

523
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,050
Don't leave me.

524
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:44,619
Please?

525
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,090
I won't.

526
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,630
Don't worry.

527
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,840
Mr. Byun hid those because
he wanted to have them to himself.

528
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,150
I can eat them all in secret...

529
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,010
and pretend that I didn't eat them.

530
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,659
If that's the case,

531
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,530
I'll be an accomplice.

532
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:10,869
All right.

533
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,539
I'm ready for my session.

534
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:14,710
Tell me whatever is bothering you.

535
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:20,619
I...

536
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,150
won't consult you
about my relationship.

537
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:27,090
It's only between me and Mr. No.

538
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,559
I won't talk about it.

539
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:34,559
You have a problem with Ji Wook.

540
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:36,869
No, I don't.

541
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,670
Ji Wook...

542
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:42,000
is a bit weird these days, right?

543
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,409
Yes.

544
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,969
No.

545
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:52,409
You're right.

546
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:53,920
To be honest,

547
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,650
he's a bit strange.

548
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,250
I think the case he's
working on now...

549
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:04,059
must remind him
of his parents' incident.

550
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:06,730
By the way,

551
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,030
the same applies
for you too, Ms. Eun.

552
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,039
My dad also passed away in a fire.

553
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:15,670
But Ji Wook...

554
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,340
was in the fire with them.

555
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,010
So he might have been
traumatized deeply.

556
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:23,510
Whether he remembers it or not,

557
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,650
he witnessed the whole scene
with his own eyes.

558
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,050
Besides,

559
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,250
he was the lone survivor.

560
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,659
He must feel guilty about it.

561
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,159
I see.

562
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,900
Looking back,

563
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:43,670
how could I have not figured it out?

564
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:51,510
On the list of the arsonists
in the district,

565
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,079
Lee Joon Hae is only registered
for attempted arsons.

566
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:57,250
Lee Joon Hae was in the video...

567
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,280
of the fire on the day
of the incident,

568
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,449
That's right,

569
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:02,849
but it can't be used as evidence
to prove...

570
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,920
his guilt.

571
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:05,789
No.

572
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:08,360
Lee Joon Hae is the arsonist.

573
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,159
I have an informant.

574
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,630
That's great, but until the end,

575
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,469
we shouldn't conclude
whether he's guilty or not.

576
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,000
Let's take a look first.

577
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,940
I have the photos of the scene.

578
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,769
Will you be okay?

579
00:48:25,409 --> 00:48:26,409
Yes, I'll be.

580
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,820
There were countless hints.

581
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:42,619
Why...

582
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:44,760
hadn't I figured it out?

583
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:47,929
(Currently under trial)

584
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:00,880
Witness, I believe you know
quite a lot about xylene.

585
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,650
Excuse me? What is that?

586
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,280
According to my research,

587
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,420
I'm aware that your occupation
is related to producing...

588
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,019
paints, varnish, and
adhesives at Cheonho Chemicals.

589
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:13,019
Am I mistaken?

590
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,360
In the process of producing
these chemicals,

591
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:16,829
xylene is used.

592
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,030
Oh, that.

593
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:21,159
I think so.

594
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,469
Xylene is considered to be
a very strong inflammable material.

595
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:28,139
Moreover,

596
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:30,539
it was also used to cause a fire
in Doboo-dong two years ago...

597
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,239
by the arsonist.

598
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,210
By any chance, were you
aware of this fact?

599
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,650
No, I didn't know that.

600
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,119
Is that so?

601
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:43,389
Then how should I explain this?

602
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,690
Mr. Lee Joon Hae...

603
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,400
recently got arrested by the police
for...

604
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,369
attempted incendiarism.

605
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:01,239
But a female prosecutor
just told me to leave back then.

606
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:04,469
The police confiscated the flammable
material from Mr. Lee,

607
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:06,239
and they requested a
component analysis.

608
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:10,449
According to the analysis,
it contained a mixture of xylene.

609
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:12,579
They also did a comparative
analysis...

610
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,849
with the material that caused
the fire two years ago.

611
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,659
The result showed that the two
flammables were almost identical.

612
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:29,329
There are times when you come
to a sudden realization.

613
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,750
Excuse me. I have to go somewhere.

614
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,250
Hey, Mom.

615
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,750
I attended a trial today.

616
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,389
There was this man...

617
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,260
who was falsely accused of
murder and arson.

618
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,869
Fortunately, it looks like...

619
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:41,139
the appeal trial will lead to a
positive result.

620
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:44,010
So I think it'll all turn out well.

621
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,469
Really?

622
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,539
Yes. Really.

623
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,349
So I feel great right now.

624
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,050
I just wanted to tell you this.

625
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,159
But...

626
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:06,389
But Mom...

627
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,360
Yes? What is it?

628
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:13,130
Well...

629
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:15,599
Never mind.

630
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,239
I'm busy right now,

631
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:23,250
so I'll call you again later.
I'm going to hang up now.

632
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,789
How could I not have known?

633
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,849
("A Prosecutor Couple Died
in an Unfortunate Revenge Arson")

634
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:10,760
I read the article regarding my
dad's accident so many times...

635
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,960
that I practically memorized
the story of the victim's family.

636
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,329
(8-year-old son, involved in an
assault incident, prosecutor couple)

637
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,429
Ji Wook and his parents...

638
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,070
were supposed to go on
a family picnic...

639
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:24,309
on the day after his dad
had passed away.

640
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,110
The anniversary date of
both our fathers' deaths.

641
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,050
(No Young Suk, June 15, 1994)

642
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:32,110
(Eun Man Soo, June 15, 1994)

643
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:35,949
I lost both my parents in a
fire accident when I was young.

644
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,849
My dad passed away first.

645
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,960
My mom got transported to
a hospital,

646
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:44,960
but she passed away...

647
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:47,329
not too soon after that.

648
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:52,670
Ji Wook, why did you become
a prosecutor?

649
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:55,239
My dad...

650
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:57,369
was a prosecutor.

651
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,440
I guess you wanted to
become like your dad.

652
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:04,849
Yes.

653
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,329
Good work, Ji Wook.

654
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:26,170
- Thanks. See you.
- Okay.

655
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,039
Thank you. I think I'll win
this case thanks to you.

656
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,380
Of course.

657
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:39,880
Will you be okay?

658
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,789
Well, I didn't let go of the case
like they told me to,

659
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:45,250
so I'm guessing I'll just get
chewed out.

660
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,130
But I'm never going to quit
my job...

661
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,159
because you guys refused to
take me in.

662
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:06,239
Hey, Bong Hee.

663
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,780
I couldn't find you, so I was
wondering if you already left.

664
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,010
I was reminded of something urgent.

665
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,949
I see. It's nothing serious, right?

666
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,750
Okay. I'll wait for you at home.

667
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:31,570
Some people think...

668
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:35,570
they've achieved justice through
such petty cases like this.

669
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,510
But you see, in this world...

670
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:42,239
In this world, there's an order.

671
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,550
In order for this world to keep
that order in place,

672
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:50,489
there must be small sacrifices
made by people like you.

673
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,119
All I need is for you to become
a murderer.

674
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,159
I'm not wrong.

675
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,400
That means it is unacceptable to
make any kind of mistake...

676
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:06,530
that could harm the order of
an organization,

677
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,139
the order of the law,
and the order of power.

678
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,139
We cannot afford to make a single
prosecution mistake whatsoever.

679
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,639
Do you understand?

680
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:47,309
Excuse me. I have to go somewhere.

681
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:49,139
Okay.

682
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,860
Hey, where are you?

683
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,530
Oh, really? Then I'll go to
where you are.

684
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,599
I'll be right there. Okay.

685
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,750
I want to eat tteokbokki.

686
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,949
Tteokbokki?

687
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,320
Do you want to?

688
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,619
- Here?
- Of course.

689
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,489
- Just wait here for a little bit.
- What?

690
00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:36,389
I'll buy you tteokbokki, sundae,
gimbap, and everything else.

691
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:38,690
- I can...
- Wait here. I'll be right back.

692
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:53,610
How does it taste? Is it delicious?

693
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:54,610
It's delicious.

694
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,480
Eat up.

695
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:16,059
It's delicious,
but it's a little too spicy.

696
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,130
I almost cried.

697
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,960
Let's take a photo with that cat.

698
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:42,960
Shall we do that?

699
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:49,230
Here we go.

700
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,530
In 1, 2, 3.

701
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,400
Why isn't it working?

702
00:58:57,639 --> 00:58:59,010
- Bong Hee.
- Yes?

703
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,440
You're taking a video right now.

704
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,750
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

705
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:05,650
My gosh.

706
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:11,219
You were right.

707
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:12,550
Dummy.

708
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:22,429
Is it good?

709
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,800
Postponement.

710
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:05,639
My futile effort...

711
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,440
to postpone it to a moment...

712
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:10,239
and a step later.

713
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:07,639
Let's...

714
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:12,539
break up.

715
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:45,570
(Love in Trouble)
