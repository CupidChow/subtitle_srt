1
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,509
There was one more.

2
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,939
Was his name Jang Hee Jun?

3
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,179
Well... Initially,
I had no intention of killing him.

4
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,280
I ended up stabbing him
with a knife,

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,420
and he collapsed while crying.

6
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,960
"Dad."

7
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:58,259
"Dad, save me. Dad, help me."

8
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,670
"I'm terrified."

9
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,480
I'm calling from the HR department
at the Ministry of Justice.

10
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,450
I'd like to let you know
that you have...

11
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,150
passed the recruitment exam
for experienced prosecutors.

12
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,770
Yes, Prosecutor Cha.

13
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,409
I just wanted to let you know
that Jung Hyun Soo confessed.

14
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,310
Hold on. What did you just say?
He confessed?

15
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,009
Yes, he didn't confess
to all the murder cases.

16
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,180
He only confessed for Jang
Hee Jun's murder case...

17
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,379
and the water tank case.

18
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,449
- Are you there?
- By the way,

19
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,189
Was DA Jang Moo Young
present when he made the confession?

20
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,430
Yes, he was watching from outside
when he was being questioned.

21
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,930
Where is the DA?
What about Jung Hyun Soo?

22
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,639
Hey.

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,909
You're here.

24
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,310
Did something happen?

25
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,039
I just had to check something
at the prosecutor's office.

26
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,409
There's something that's been
bothering me too.

27
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:58,620
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,030
The DA apologized to you?

29
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,930
- Isn't that strange?
- Yes, definitely.

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,569
What I was going to check
involves the DA too.

31
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,800
Let me go with you then.

32
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,069
Okay, let's go.

33
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,289
(In Court)

34
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:02,180
Please check the footages
of the DA's parking area...

35
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,050
and the entrance
of the prosecutor's office.

36
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:05,349
All right.

37
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,419
Excuse me.

38
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,650
Hello?

39
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,159
Did you meet with the guard
that transported Jung Hyun Soo?

40
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,660
Someone took him an hour ago
under the DA's order.

41
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,230
Please show me the footages
from an hour ago.

42
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,139
Please stop it.

44
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,350
Right there.

45
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Get off.

46
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,810
Okay, I got it.

47
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:06,810
Thank you, Prosecutor Cha. Okay.

48
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,079
What did she say?

49
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,720
She said both District Attorney
Jang Moo Young and Jung Hyun Soo...

50
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,149
disappeared.

51
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:15,750
I knew it.

52
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,259
The DA disappeared
after taking Jung Hyun Soo.

53
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,589
Do you think he wants to take his
revenge on Jung Hyun Soo personally?

54
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,959
That's what I think he's up to.

55
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:31,399
Where could the DA have brought
Jung Hyun Soo?

56
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,610
We know nothing
about their whereabouts?

57
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,480
Yes, right now, the DA's
phone is turned off.

58
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,180
We're tracking the location with his
driver's cell phone number.

59
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,250
Hopefully, it might get
us somewhere.

60
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,589
If I were him,
where would I have gone?

61
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,660
What... What are you doing
all of a sudden?

62
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,769
Oh, it helps me
when I'm trying to think.

63
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,370
Seriously? Are you sure about that?

64
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,970
It probably makes it worse.

65
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,810
Oh, maybe...

66
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,779
It's just a thought.

67
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,519
It could be the place
Hee Jun got killed.

68
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,250
In other words, they might be
at my old place.

69
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,220
It's empty at the moment
because of the redevelopment.

70
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,550
They might be there.

71
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,529
Hey, Prosecutor Cha.
Do you have the location?

72
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,610
Get up, you scum!

73
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:50,720
This is where...

74
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,649
my son, Hee Jun, collapsed.

75
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,819
This is where...

76
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:59,560
you brutally killed my innocent son!

77
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:03,629
How can you utter the word,
"innocent"?

78
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:05,029
What?

79
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,470
Your son may be innocent,

80
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,170
but you're not.

81
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,740
What are you saying?

82
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,699
Because of you,

83
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,009
So Young...

84
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,620
So Young died because of you,

85
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,319
and I've turned out like this
because of you.

86
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,129
It's all because you acquitted
those scumbags...

87
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,529
who trampled all over her.

88
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,329
Do you know that?

89
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,699
Do you?

90
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,879
Stabbing your son...

91
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,480
was really unintentional.

92
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:54,779
But...

93
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,519
Everyone is shocked
by the murder of a trainee...

94
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,620
from the Judicial
Research and Training Institute,

95
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,620
which should be in strict
pursuant to law and justice.

96
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,019
The fact that the victim is the
current district attorney's son...

97
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:06,819
has caused a big stir.

98
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,430
The District Attorney,
Jang Moo Young,

99
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,060
has been hiding the fact that his
son was training at the institute.

100
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,060
He stated that it was because
he wanted...

101
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,300
to prevent any special treatment
and ensure fairness.

102
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,839
The prime suspect, Ms. Eun,
who has been arrested...

103
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,540
could not accept the fact
that the victim broke up with her.

104
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,540
Jang Moo Young?

105
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,610
I see, Jang Moo Young.

106
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,949
His father was the man who made
So Young die 13 years ago.

107
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,950
I...

108
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,519
I...

109
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,929
I thought about it...

110
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,230
and realized that
killing your son...

111
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,700
was a fair revenge,
not a coincidence.

112
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,570
What's this nonsense you're spewing?

113
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,409
Don't act like
you don't remember it.

114
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,279
You're disgusting me.

115
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,879
Shall I help you remember it?

116
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,519
13 years ago,

117
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,490
there was a girl.

118
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,490
That girl...

119
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,299
got severely injured because
of guys who were like beasts,

120
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,799
and you were the prosecutor
in charge of that case.

121
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,830
You got those scumbags acquitted
as if it wasn't a big deal at all...

122
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,500
and buried the case itself.

123
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:27,840
Can you remember that?

124
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,710
You...

125
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,580
didn't side with the injured girl
who was in pain.

126
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,250
Those jerks...

127
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,080
You sided with those jerks...

128
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,019
and their parents instead.

129
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,120
You still don't remember it?

130
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,889
Answer me.

131
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,659
Do you still not remember it?

132
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,590
Answer me!

133
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,490
Sir.

134
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,940
Bong Hee, stay here with him.

135
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,370
Okay.

136
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:41,049
Sir, are you all right?

137
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Jung Hyun Soo.

138
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Jung Hyun Soo!

139
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:52,419
Hey, Jung Hyun Soo!

140
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,360
Hey, Jung Hyun Soo. Gosh.

141
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,940
Why are you doing this to me?

142
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:11,639
Are you being like this
because I stabbed you?

143
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,509
You didn't die.

144
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,509
That guy, Mr. Bang,
didn't die either.

145
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,049
Why are you being like this?
You piece of...

146
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:20,320
- What's the problem?
- I'm the problem.

147
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,649
It's all my fault. I got you
acquitted, you piece of trash.

148
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,759
Hence, I must correct my mistake.
Aren't I right?

149
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,289
Try running away
thousands of times if you want.

150
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,529
I'll be sure to catch you each time.

151
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,970
Gosh, you're one tenacious jerk.

152
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,470
By the way, will you be all right,
Mr. No?

153
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:45,279
That hole my knife made in your
stomach probably hasn't healed yet.

154
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,450
What about you?
Will you be all right?

155
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:49,679
Are you okay with getting cuffed?

156
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,529
Darn it.

157
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,350
- Are you all right?
- Wait, Jung Hyun Soo...

158
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,529
Did you do that?

159
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,389
Sir, you're under arrest for
unlawful apprehension, confinement,

160
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,730
and attempted murder.

161
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,409
Don't work too hard.

162
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,710
This is where Jung Hyun Soo's
case began,

163
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:01,649
and it came to an end here.

164
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,419
You're right.

165
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,649
Can we talk?

166
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:23,470
I've been doing some thinking
on what you told me about my dad,

167
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,269
and I've realized that I was bad.

168
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,009
I was too harsh on you.

169
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,639
You didn't do anything wrong.

170
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,350
District Attorney Jang
who brainwashed and used you...

171
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,509
was the bad guy.

172
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,080
You were a victim in it too.

173
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,049
Knowing all of that,

174
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:45,789
I took it out on you.

175
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,889
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:50,830
It's okay.

177
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Don't be sorry.

178
00:14:58,539 --> 00:14:59,639
Your father...

179
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,110
saved my life.

180
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,440
After rescuing me,

181
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,909
he tried to save my parents,

182
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,919
but it didn't go well.

183
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,289
That's no one's fault.

184
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,730
You know that I'm hugely
indebted to you.

185
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,429
You had to leave the prosecution
because of me,

186
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,429
and you met Jung Hyun Soo
because of me.

187
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,799
You also got stabbed because of me.
You gave me a job,

188
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,570
and you've provided me
with food and a place to stay.

189
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,269
The list is endless.

190
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,179
So...

191
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,620
we should just...

192
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:46,419
call it even.

193
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:48,820
Let's just...

194
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,360
go back to before all this happened.

195
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,059
Let's go back...

196
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:55,690
to when we first met.

197
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,830
Great, that sounds good.

198
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,629
Okay.

199
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:03,799
Let's do that.

200
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,370
Yes, let's.

(Prosecutor No Ji Wook)

203
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,340
Congratulations on your first
day of work, Prosecutor No.

204
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,139
Goodness. Thank you all for coming.

205
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,679
But there isn't a single
person I've wanted to see.

(Prosecutor No)

207
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,490
Sir, I told you that it was
no use coming here.

208
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,259
I forgot how unfriendly he was.

209
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,720
So did I.

210
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,730
I handed over Jung Hyun Soo's
case for his sake.

211
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,829
So what, you punk?

212
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:06,630
Who is it that you'd like to see?

213
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,799
This is a difficult decision.

214
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,440
Whom should I see first?

215
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,920
You may wait outside.
It's all right.

216
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Yes, sir.

217
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,460
I was your attorney, and now, I'm
the prosecutor of your case.

218
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,339
Don't you think that
we have a long history?

219
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,039
You seem happy about it.

220
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,609
I guess you like it, but I don't.

221
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,410
Get used to it. You'll face
a number of things you won't like.

222
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,750
Since I have to follow the protocol,
let me cover the bases first.

223
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,519
Your name is Jung Hyun Soo.

224
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,289
You are being investigated on the
charges of fugitive of justice,

225
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:37,960
attempted murder of Bang Eun Ho,

226
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,220
and murdering Yang Jin Woo and
Jang Hee Jun. Do you understand?

227
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,529
No, I don't.

228
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,299
Mr. Jung Hyun Soo, you have the
right to refuse to answer that...

229
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,269
May incriminate myself.

230
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:52,599
I have the right to consult
to an attorney.

231
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,009
Aren't I right?

232
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,779
Oh, my. You know it so well.
You're an expert.

233
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,009
I was informed that you confessed...

234
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:04,049
to Prosecutor Cha who oversaw the
case before handing it over to me.

235
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:05,180
I did?

236
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,619
That's news to me.

237
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,230
First off, I killed them all.

238
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,029
Whom shall I start with?

239
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,829
We first met through
the Yang Jin Woo case,

240
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,170
so shall I start with Jin Woo?

241
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,500
No, no. I take that back.
Supa Apartment.

242
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,339
You've managed to confirm the
identity of only one body found...

243
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:31,779
in the water tank there, right?

244
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,480
Shall I tell you
who the other one is?

245
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,009
There's no reason for me to say no.

246
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,619
His name is Sung Jae Hyun.

247
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,650
He and Jin Woo went to the same
high school. Go ahead and check it.

248
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,789
What is it? I guess you can't
remember it fully yet, Mr. Jung.

249
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,400
I was recently in a car accident.

250
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,859
My memory isn't fully recovered.

251
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,799
In legal terms, they say that
I'm feeble-minded...

252
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,900
and that I'm not of sound mind.

253
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:59,569
- I'm not sure if you know those.
- No one knew...

254
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:01,240
the identity of the body
in the water tank.

255
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:04,440
You were the only one who identified
the body. How do you explain that?

256
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,039
Well... I see.

257
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,910
I think I heard it
when I was passing by.

258
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,279
Did I hear it in the toilet?
I think I heard it there.

Hey, Jung Hyun Soo.

262

Hey, you. You are so cool.

263
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,470
You did your hair perfectly. Do you
have a lot of time on your hands?

264
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,170
That's right. We do have
a lot of time on our hands.

265
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,269
Let's take this to the end.

266
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,180
I am going to make you remember.

267
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:40,579
Got that?

268
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,329
Are you doing okay?

269
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,069
Well... I'm okay as you can see.

270
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,740
How about you, Mr. Ji?

271
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:09,539
You know.

272
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,509
I guess you're not doing well.

273
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:18,079
So what's going on with you?

274
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:24,619
Everything is blurry.

275
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,390
Is it about Ji Wook?

276
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,430
What about your feelings?
Are your feelings blurry too?

277
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:38,140
Don't overthink it.

278
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,470
Do what your heart tells you.

279
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:45,109
Mr. Ji, are you doing
what your heart tells you?

280
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,250
Yes.

281
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,880

with this person...

I constantly fall in love with him.

What brings you here?

288
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,799
What do you mean? I'm here to work.

289

My client will be questioned
as a suspect.

Really? Which case is it?

291

Who is the prosecutor in charge?

292
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,680
I will take care of it on my own.

293
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,450
Besides, I can't tell you.

294
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,279
It's a matter
of my client's privacy.

295
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,920
You're right. Gosh, now you're
talking like an attorney.

296

That's right. I am an attorney.

297

Okay. Good luck with the meeting.

298

catch him. I need your...

306
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:43,589
No, I need everyone's help.

307
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:54,740
Mr. Bang, you will be reinstated
in the prosecutor's office?

Yes, the prosecution recruits
experienced investigators...

309

whenever there's a vacancy.

310

Mr. No... I mean...

311
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,410
Since Prosecutor is returning
to his seat, I should too.

20 percent.

313
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,690
I will increase your annual
salary by 20 percent.

314
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,990
You can't buy me with money.

315
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:16,759
- 50 percent.
- What a thief.

316
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,559
- Then what about 40?
- 30.

317
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,859
- No way.
- Hey,

318
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,029
don't think about scouting him...

319
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,170
or distracting us in the meeting.
Concentrate.

320
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,299
Let's focus. Please?

321
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,039
Mr. Byun, please focus!

322
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,039
Exactly. We are all here
because of Jung Hyun Soo.

323
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,380
Thanks to Mr. Byun,
our meeting isn't going anywhere.

324
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,009
Now she's scolding me too.

325
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,690
All right. As of now, Jung Hyun
Soo just changed his confession.

326
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:45,890
We have the evidence, don't we?

327
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,029
He's right. The murder weapon
I found at his house.

328
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:55,799
We will disregard the murder weapon.

329
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,829
Why?

330
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,170
Because it's fabricated.
In other words,

331
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,809
it's illegally acquired evidence.
Every evidence from there...

332
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:03,109
is a fruit of the poisonous tree.

333
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,640
(Fruit of the poisonous tree...)

334
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,279
(is an illegally obtained evidence
that is inadmissible.)

335
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,910
We don't have any other evidence?

336
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,779
Even if he didn't change
his confession and kept it,

337
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,549
according to the admissibility
of confessions,

338
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,890
unless we find additional pieces of
evidence, he won't be proven guilty.

339
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,920
(Without additional evidence,
the guilt won't be proven.)

340
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,519
Hey, he can be charged
with attempted murder though.

341
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,230
You two almost lost your lives
by Jung Hyun Soo's hands.

342
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,529
The charge for attempted murder
is too little.

343
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:30,029
He might get probation.

344
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,170
In addition to that,
he will claim he's feeble-minded...

345
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,240
and not of sound mind.

346
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,309
Gosh, what a scumbag.

347
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:39,380
That's why we have to find out
more about Jung Hyun Soo.

348
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,650
We have to find out more
about his past.

349
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,180
We have to catch the driver
who hit Jung Hyun Soo and ran.

350
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,680
I'm on that.

351
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,650
He's one of the people
on the list I got from Mr. Ji.

352
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,319
His name is Min Young Hoon.

353
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:55,160
He's on the run now, but I found
the mistress he's seeing.

354
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,460
I have officers on stakeout
to catch him.

355
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,430
They will arrest him soon.

356
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:02,099
Yes, let's keep up the hard work
for just a bit longer.

357
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,859
It feels like I haven't seen you
in quite a while.

358
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,990
Does it?

359
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:30,690
It's not true though.
It's only been a few days.

360
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,329
Really? Is that right?

361
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,200
Maybe it's just the way I feel.

362
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:40,539
I'll pour it for...

363
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,460
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

364
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,720
All right. Go ahead.

365
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,900
I'll get going.

366
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Okay.

367
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,349
(Attorney No Ji Wook)

368
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:18,769
Hello?

369
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Yes.

370
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:23,470
What's going on? Gosh.

371
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,410
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

372
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,309
I found him.

373
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,220
The police officer
who oversaw the case.

374
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,190
Seriously?

375
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,849
That's amazing. You rock, Mr. Bang.

376
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,019
It wasn't that much work.

377
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,029
I think I only had to reach out
to about 20 people.

378
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:54,900
Do you remember this girl?

379
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,609
You oversaw her case, didn't you?

380
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,779
I do remember the case,
but I don't want to do it.

381
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:08,890
Why not, Detective?

382
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,190
I caught those jerks
and sent them to the prosecution,

383
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,990
but the case was dismissed
for non-prosecution.

384
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,390
Non-prosecution?

385
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,559
Would we be able to find out
who the prosecutor in charge was?

386
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,710
How's it going in here?
Is it tolerable?

387
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,150
Cut to the chase.

388
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,680
Okay, I will.

389
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:42,849
Please apologize...

390
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,019
again.

391
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:49,930
I don't want an insincere apology
like the last time.

392
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,059
I want a proper, formal apology.

393
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,200
Looking at you sitting there
in that uniform...

394
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,670
doesn't make me pity you at all.

395
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,710
When I...

396
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:06,440
think about what you did...

397
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:11,309
to me, my dad, and Mr. No
when he was a little boy,

398
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,319
I think that this punishment...

399
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,019
is way too light for you.

400
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,029
Will an apology...

401
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
be enough?

402
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,329
Yes, it will be.

403
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,329
But I won't make it
that easy for you.

404
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,700
I found out that you were
in charge of the old case...

405
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,910
Jung Hyun Soo was involved.

406
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,039
You acquitted guys
who gang-raped a girl...

407
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,779
and set them free.

408
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,079
Tell me about that case.

409
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,089
Come in.

410
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,180
Hey, you're back.

411
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,480
I just visited
District Attorney Jang.

412
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,079
Oh, I see.

413
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,849
I was about to have dinner.
Do you want to join me?

414
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,190
What are you having?

415
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,190
Jjajangmyeon.

416
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,619
- Sounds good.
- Get the one with seafood.

417
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,789
- I'll get double portion.
- Double portion.

418
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:49,650
Why do you think it is?

419
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,250
Jjajangmyeon always
tastes the best here.

420
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,950
It never tastes this good
anywhere else.

421
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:57,089
Then you should come here
whenever you crave jjajangmyeon.

422
00:31:57,789 --> 00:31:58,789
Shall I?

423
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,170
By the way, why did you visit...

424
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,869
District Attorney Jang?

425
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,609
I found out that he was
the prosecutor...

426
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,240
in charge of the case
Jung Hyun Soo was involved in.

427
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:23,380
Our guess on the case was correct.

428
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,420
It was a special rape case.

429
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,279
A few of the assailants...

430
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,819
were from rich, well-connected
families,

431
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:02,690
and their parents obviously wanted
the case to be buried.

432
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:04,390
I'm sure they did.

433
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,789
They actually blamed
the victim, Park So Young,

434
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:09,430
for trying to ruin their sons'
future.

435
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,900
A little while after that, she...

436
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,269
took her own life.

437
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:21,970
The prosecutor who dismissed
the case for non-prosecution is...

438
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,539
District Attorney Jang Moo Young.

439
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,180
Jung Hyun Soo avenged her death
by killing the guys...

440
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,250
who didn't get punished back then.

441
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,990
Mr. No.

442
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,490
Until when are we going
to sit here like this?

443
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:43,190
I told you.
We have a lot of time on our hands.

444
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,730
Take your time.

445
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,430
Gosh.

446
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:55,069
Well...

447
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,140
I didn't kill Yang Jin Woo
and Lee Jae Ho,

448
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,079
but I do know those guys.

449
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,349
Those scumbags are
really horrible people.

450
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,480
But...

451
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,150
one of those horrible scums...

452
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,519
became a famous chef
that appears on TV regularly,

453
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,789
and other guys became a doctor...

454
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,389
and a police officer.

455
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:17,730
They were living great lives,
and they even got married.

456
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,000
Guys like them shouldn't be allowed
to live good lives, don't you think?

457
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,739
I don't know who killed them.

458
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:28,769
But whoever it was, I think
the killer did the right thing.

459
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,769
We should be grateful.
Aren't I right?

460
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,239
What will you do...

461
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,780
about the trial now?

462
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
I'll charge Jung Hyun Soo...

463
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,349
with rape.

464
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,360
What did you say? With what?

465
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,969
You're going to prosecute
me for what?

466
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,500
I'm going to prosecute you for...

467
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,539
raping an adolescent and gang rape.

468
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:08,039
Do you remember
the hit-and-run driver?

469
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,309
His name is Min Young Hoon.

470
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,320
He made a statement.

471
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,820
You were in on it too.

472
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:20,789
You bought him off, didn't you?

473
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,889
Did you give them money?

474
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,659
Gosh, can a prosecutor
buy off a witness?

475
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:31,300
I don't know.

476
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,969
I'll see you in trial,
Mr. Jung Hyun Soo.

477
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,329
(Currently under trial)

478
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,969
The defendants, Min Young Hoon
and Jung Hyun Soo,

479
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,800
with the deceased Yang Jin Woo,
Lee Jae Ho,

480
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,340
Kim Min Gu, Sung Jae Hyun,

481
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:11,809
and Ko Chan Ho who is missing,

482
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,539
lured the victim, Park So Young to
a warehouse in Hyunjin-dong,

483
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:17,110
Goyang around 5pm on July 11, 2003.

484
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:18,809
After they lured the victim,

485
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,219
they physically suppressed
her resistance...

486
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,690
and sexually assaulted the victim.

487
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,860
Ergo, I ask Jung Hyun Soo
and Min Young Hoon be...

488
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,360
punished for the sexual
assault charge.

489
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,489
I prosecute the defendants for a
violation of the law for the victim.

490
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,869
Defense counsel of Min Young Hoon,
do he plead guilty of the charge?

491
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,340
Yes, Your Honor.
The defendant pleads guilty.

492
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,840
Defense counsel of Jung Hyun Soo,
does he plead guilty?

493
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,539
No, Your Honor.
The defendant pleads not guilty.

494
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:14,500
Defendant, you admitted that you
sexually assaulted the victim...

495
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,340
in a private warehouse...

496
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,210
located in Hyunjin-dong...

497
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,349
in July, 2003 with your accomplices
as a group.

498
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:24,809
Yes.

499
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,119
Moreover, Defendant,
during the questioning,

500
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:31,449
you pointed out seven individuals
as the violators of the victim.

501
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,059
- Is this correct?
- Yes, it is.

502
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:36,230
You first pointed yourself,

503
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:38,329
a famous chef, Yang Jin Woo,

504
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,159
Lee Jae Ho who was
recently murdered,

505
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:42,900
Kim Min Gu and Sung Jae Hyun who
were discovered in the water tank.

506
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,570
You also pointed out
Ko Chan Ho who went missing...

507
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,000
and the last individual was...

508
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:50,239
To clarify, you said
the last accomplish...

509
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,210
who was involved in the activity...

510
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,309
is here.

511
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,409
Yes, he is here.

512
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,820
Who is he?

513
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:02,150
Please point him out.
Who is the violator?

514
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:13,559
(Witness)

515
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,369
Defendant Jung Hyun Soo...

516
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,300
Well, what do you think...

517
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,039
about Defendant Min
Young Hoon's testimony...

518
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,309
that you were an accomplice?

519
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:26,079
I think it is absurd.

520
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,340
I believe a prosecutor
fabricated evidence...

521
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,280
and manipulated the witness.
The prosecutor is breaking the law.

522
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,159
If so, how will you explain this?

523
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,829
Your Honor, this is the incident
report from the victim which I...

524
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,230
obtained from the detective who was
in charge of the case at that time.

525
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:54,900
As you can see here,
on the list of the seven violators,

526
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:58,469
Jung Hyun Soo's name is
clearly written here.

527
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,309
That's the report So Young
filled out 13 years ago?

528
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:09,219
Even if the report was
kept properly until now,

529
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:13,159
don't you think someone could've
easily fabricated the list?

530
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,260
Don't you agree, Prosecutor?

531
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:20,429
Or is that what you'd like to
believe?

532
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,039
All right. Now, let us revisit
the day of the crime.

533
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:30,809
Defendant Jung Hyun Soo,
at that time,

534
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:33,909
you were quite close to
the rest of the six violators.

535
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:36,010
It is known that you went
to different schools.

536
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,550
You met often
and spent time together.

537
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,849
July 11, which was
the day of the crime...

538
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,690
We weren't close.

539
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:47,920
Do you know how much
I despite and loathe them?

540
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,590
You're saying we were friends?

541
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,590
Come up with a better strategy.

542
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,599
Defendant, only speak
when I require you to answer.

543
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,730
- I mean...
- Defendant.

544
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,300
Defendant, only speak when the
prosecutor asks you a question.

545
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,469
Let us start again.

546
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,139
According to the report,
on July 11, 2003,

547
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:11,010
around 5pm to 6pm,

548
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,320
Yang Jin Woo who was
one of the assailants...

549
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,349
lured Park So Young...

550
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,750
and brought her to a private
warehouse in Hyunjin-dong.

551
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,820
Is this true?

552
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:23,360
It wasn't Yang Jin Woo.
It was Lee Jae Ho.

553
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,429
Lee Jae Ho?

554
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,159
Was it Lee Jae Ho? I see.

555
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,000
After Lee Jae Ho brought Park
So Young into the warehouse,

556
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,670
the victim wasn't in danger
in the beginning,

557
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,840
but Ko Chan Ho who consumed
alcohol built up the atmosphere.

558
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:41,079
It says that Park So Young
tried to escape.

559
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,079
Is this true?

560
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,679
No, you have it all wrong.

561
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:46,449
It wasn't Ko Chan Ho.
It was that jerk.

562
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,019
Min Young Hoon and Yang Jin Woo...

563
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:54,159
ran after So Young when she tried to
escape and dragged her back.

564
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,460
After that, Kim Min Gu...

565
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,929
Gosh, you keep getting it wrong.

566
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,429
It wasn't Kim Min Gu.
At first, Lee Jae Ho...

567
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:03,469
Defendant, you seem to know exactly
what happened on the scene...

568
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:05,670
as if you were there.

569
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,000
It's because...

570
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,510
It's because...

571
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,510
I heard everything from
other people later on.

572
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,679
Fine.

573
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:22,949
Then how many assailants
were on the scene?

574
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:25,219
There were seven.

575
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,090
That makes...

576
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,469
four people disappeared.

577
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:40,099
Now three more people
have to disappear.

578
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:42,000
Seven?

579
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,070
Then can you tell me the names
of the seven violators?

580
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,809
You're frustrating me.

581
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,079
Do I have to tell you the names?

582
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,809
Yes, please. Tell me the names.

583
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,820
Lee Jae Ho, Yang Jin Woo,
Min Young Hoon,

584
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:59,219
Kim Min Gu, Sung Jae Hyun,
Ko Chan Ho...

585
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,690
And?

586
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:09,030
Let me try again.

587
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,010
Lee Jae Ho, Yang Jin Woo,
Min Young Hoon,

588
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:18,670
Kim Min Gu, Sung Jae Hyun,
Ko Chan Ho...

589
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:21,309
And?

590
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:23,780
And then...

591
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,449
You can't remember?

592
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,380
Defendant.

593
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,349
Could it...

594
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,150
Who is the last assailant?

595
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,119
Defendant, answer the question.

596
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,730
Tell me who...

597
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,500
is...

598
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,869
the last assailant.

599
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:48,170
Hey, Jung Hyun Soo.

600
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:51,239
It's you.

601
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,179
Hey, it's you.

602
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,000
It's possible that...

603
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,070
Jung Hyun Soo could have
been the violator too.

604
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,909
(Hyunjin-dong Group Rape Case
in 2003)

605
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,179
This is the list of the assailants
the detective was keeping.

606
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,980
Jung Hyun Soo's name is on it too.

607
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,849
When I visited the victim's
mother to verify,

608
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:39,289
the result was the same.

609
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,690
As soon as she saw
Jung Hyun Soo's old picture,

610
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:46,099
she remembered him to
be one of the violators.

611
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,829
What on earth...

612
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:49,929
happened?

613
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,039
I...

614
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,570
thought and thought.

615
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,510
When people are in great misery,

616
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:03,750
sometimes, they get rid of their
memories or change them.

617
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,019
That's true. Just like my
memory of the fire accident.

618
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,989
Is it possible that he could have
distorted his own memory?

619
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,119
He couldn't stand the fact that...

620
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,989
he was one of the attackers.

621
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,230
That's why he distorted his memory.

622
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:31,610
You jerk. What are you
implying right now?

623
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,110
It wasn't me.

624
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:36,409
- It's you.
- No, it wasn't.

625
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,519
Do you think I'm a rapist
just like they are?

626
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:41,679
In the end, you are just like them.

627
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,690
You are one of those jerks,
aren't you?

628
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:48,119
Prosecutor, ask your
questions loudly...

629
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:49,630
so that the court can hear you.

630
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,659
I apologize, Your Honor.

631
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:56,269
I will continue.

632
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,769
Defendant Jung Hyun Soo,
who was one of the assailants...

633
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:02,099
I said I didn't do it!

634
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:05,170
With six co-assailants,

635
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,940
he lured the victim, Park So Young,
to the warehouse...

636
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,679
and physically abused her
because she resisted...

637
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:09,980
How dare you!

638
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,980
Defendant!

639
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,349
Let go of me!

640
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,659
You know me.

641
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:23,389
I'm not like those scums.

642
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:25,659
Let me make it clear. I...

643
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,659
judged and punished them.

644
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,429
You think so?

645
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,969
I killed all of those
trashy scumbags.

646
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:34,300
You know that.

647
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:37,039
Is that right?

648
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,010
Is there evidence?

649
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,380
Do you have evidence, Defendant?

650
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,780
Is there any evidence?

651
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:55,690
You little...

652
00:45:57,429 --> 00:45:58,460
This was your plan, wasn't it?

653
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:05,829
"Do you want to become one of them?
Or will you..."

654
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:08,670
"just admit that
you killed them all?"

655
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,909
That must've been your strategy.

656
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:13,309
What the defendant is saying has
no relevance to the trial.

657
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:14,510
I'll continue along.

658
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,210
Because Jung Hyun Soo violated
the Sexual Offenses Act...

659
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,909
and Victim Protection Act,

660
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:20,679
he has been charged
with gang rape...

661
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:21,679
Hyunjin-dong.

662
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,159
The underpass in Hyunjin-dong.

663
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,639
If you... If you go to the underpass
in Hyunjin-dong,

664
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,170
you'll find all the evidence
you're after,

665
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,210
so stop now.

666
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:50,980
I'll go with you.

667
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:05,460
I'll charge him with rape
so that I can provoke him.

668
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:09,059
Judging from the patterns
of behavior he's been exhibiting,

669
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:13,070
being charged with rape might
gravely insult him in and of itself.

670
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:15,869
When that happens,
I'll keep provoking him.

671
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,909
If we're lucky,
he might confess what he did...

672
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:19,840
and provide us with...

673
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:21,809
supplementary evidence as well.

674
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:37,159
That'd be all, Your Honor.

675
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,739
Defendant,
please go back to your seat.

676
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:52,670
Defendant.

677
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,829
(Ko Chan Ho)

678
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,639
Yes, Mr. Bang.
Thank you for all of your work.

679
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,070
Yes, please let Prosecutor Cha know
as well.

680
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:33,340
All right.

681
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,179
Did they find it?

682
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,050
Yes, they did.
Both Ko Chan Ho's body...

683
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:41,179
and the murder weapon
have been found.

684
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,780
That's good news.

685
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:45,289
That means we can charge him
with murder now, right?

686
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,190
Yes.

687
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:01,969
- Here you go.
- My gosh, thank you.

688
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:03,670
- Thank you.
- Here.

689
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:08,909
So? What's the truth
about Jung Hyun Soo?

690
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,380
Was he really one of the assailants?

691
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:16,349
He was a spectator.

692
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,449
What?

693
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:18,619
A spectator?

694
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:23,530
You know.

695
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:28,400
Those helpless boys who can neither
stop his friends nor join them.

696
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,800
I know that Hyun Soo
has killed all the other guys,

697
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,369
but back then,

698
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,400
he was a total loser.

699
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:37,539
He couldn't even talk back to me.

700
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,880
We only found out later
that he had...

701
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,380
a crush on So Young.

702
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,019
In summary, this must be
what happened.

703
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:51,889
He couldn't protect the girl
he liked.

704
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,989
Whether it was because
he was cowardly or scared,

705
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:56,789
he took part in the crime
and spectated.

706
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,860
Because he couldn't come
to terms with it,

707
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,929
he distorted his own memories
and retaliated. Aren't I right?

708
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:04,429
That's called cognitive dissonance.

709
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,929
That is true,

710
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,440
but it doesn't mean
he deserves pity.

711
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,269
What he did was wrong,
and nothing can change that.

712
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:12,610
You're absolutely right.
Retaliating is one thing,

713
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:15,679
but he also killed innocent people
for witnessing what he did...

714
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:17,480
or just getting in the way
of what he was doing.

715
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:21,679
Then what will happen
with the trial now?

716
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:24,989
I think it'll be merged with
the trial for the original case.

717
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:28,420
The confession he made during the
trial about killing the victims...

718
00:51:28,489 --> 00:51:30,130
is recorded in the trial report.

719
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,789
And we've now secured enough
supplementary evidence,

720
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,130
so getting him convicted of murder
won't be hard.

721
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,900
If that happens, will he...

722
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,199
also be convicted of murdering
of District Attorney Jang's son,

723
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:42,670
Jang Hee Jun?

724
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,539
That means...

725
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:48,840
Ms. Lack of Evidence.

726
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,780
Does it mean I should start calling
you Ms. Full of Evidence now?

727
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,320
Why are you glaring at me?

728
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,989
I'm just saying you now have so much
evidence to prove you're not guilty.

729
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:58,989
You're right.

730
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,690
You can finally
prove your innocence.

731
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,230
Congratulations in advance, Ms. Eun.

732
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,159
You put up a good fight,
Ms. Lack of...

733
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,000
I mean, Attorney Eun.

734
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:17,469
Gosh, seriously.
Why are you guys being like this?

735
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:18,510
You're making me blush.

736
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,510
Is it making you itchy?

737
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,880
Yes, it is.

738
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,550
You've been too focused on work.

739
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,050
Don't get the wrong idea, Mr. Bang.

740
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:06,619
I brought more dishes to be washed.

741
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,059
I hadn't lost the ladder game
for a long time.

742
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,159
With Ji Wook gone, the chances of
losing have gone up big time.

743
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,630
I can definitely feel the change.

744
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,969
I know, right?

745
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,130
Shall we suggest hiring
another attorney?

746
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:20,769
Someone who's handsome and young.

747
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:24,610
My gosh, aren't I enough?

748
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,780
Then are you not satisfied
even with Ji Wook?

749
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,349
How are things these days?

750
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:38,849
Are things still awkward
with Ji Wook?

751
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:41,260
Yes, a little bit.

752
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,030
That's why I told you
to follow what your heart tells you.

753
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,260
Hurry. Go on.

754
00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:27,469
What's going on?

755
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,010
Hey, I know that I can be slow at
taking hints, but you're really...

756
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,449
What did I do? You jerk.

757
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,510
What did you say?

758
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:39,650
- You little...
- Don't do that.

759
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,389
That milk has gone bad.

760
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:47,159
Darn it.

761
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,780
Some memories just pop
into my head suddenly.

762
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,800
When Defendant Eun Bong Hee's
boyfriend, Jang Hee Jun,

763
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,500
broke up with her,

764
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,769
she held a grudge
and planned the murder.

765
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:09,039
On May 11, 2015,
she lured the victim...

766
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:10,440
to her apartment.

767
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,880
She brutally murdered him
with a sharp weapon.

768
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,349
Ergo, I prosecute Defendant
Eun Bong Hee for murder...

769
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:20,280
according to Article 250
of Criminal Law.

770
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:23,519
You and I faced
each other in court...

771
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:25,150
as the prosecutor in charge...

772
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:26,789
and a suspect of the case.

773
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:28,460
She premeditated the murder.

774
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,860
She lied throughout the whole trial
and hasn't shown remorse.

775
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,500
Taking the request of the deceased's
family to punish her severely...

776
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,369
into account, according to
Article 250 of Criminal Law,

777
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,070
for the first-degree murder,

778
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,639
I ask that you sentence
her 15 years...

779
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,780
in prison.

780
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,880
You demanded that...

781
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,750
I spend 15 years in prison.

782
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,619
And...

783
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,389
If there are two murder weapons,

784
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,219
it implies one of them must be
a fabricated piece of evidence.

785
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:06,329
Which means this piece
of evidence is inadmissible.

786
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,730
Therefore,

787
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,269
according to Article 255
of Criminal Procedure Law,

788
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,809
the prosecution will
drop the charges.

789
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:21,039
You rescued me...

790
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:25,610
and I fell for you
who tried to save me.

791
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,730
Now that I think about it,
after that day,

792
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,900
my life was a series of days for me
to fall for you again and again.

793
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:48,670
Even at this very moment,
I fall for you again.

794
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:29,039
- Who is it?
- Is Ms. Eun inside?

795
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:30,809
- Bong Hee, get up.
- No, I can't.

796
00:59:30,809 --> 00:59:32,070
I haven't even washed my face.

797
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,139
I told you that you are still pretty
even when you are dirty.

798
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:36,739
Hey.

799
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,309
I think I'm drunk.

800
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:45,590
I came to work so early.

801
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:46,619
I'm going to be late.

802
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:48,389
- Have a good day at work.
- Oh, right.

803
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,389
Morning kiss.

804
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:06,469
(Love in Trouble)
