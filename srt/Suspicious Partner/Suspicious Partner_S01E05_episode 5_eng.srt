2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,350
Haruto.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,630
Long time no see.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,920
 Insensitive as I may be, a glance was all I needed to connect the dots. 

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,730
 She was the one who betrayed him. 

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,460
I haven't seen you since you quit as a prosecutor.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,420
I was wondering how you were doing.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,330
- I'm busy. 
 - I want to talk.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,290
We have nothing to talk about.

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,340
Please, leave.

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,700
Oh, what's going on?

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,390
You're from the cafe yesterday.

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,910
Hello! I'm dating him.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,750
You're dating him?

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, I am his girlfriend.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,540
- Really? 
- No, she's–

17
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,170
Yes. He passionately confessed to me with one hundred roses just last year.

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,670
Right, Haru-pyon?

19
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,300
"Pyon"?

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,370
- Now, if you'll excuse us. 
 - "Pyon"?

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,220
What was all that about?

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,150
I'm repaying the favor.

23
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,630
Favor?

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,780
You saved me back then.

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,540
 When I set eyes on her, it was love at first sight. 

26
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,790
I won't ever forget that day.

27
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,060
Just forget it.

28
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,020
No, I won't.

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,720
It's a precious memory to me.

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,340
Damn it, I'll be late.

31
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,950
And drop the "H-Haru-pyon," all right?

32
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,890
Have a great day, Haru-pyon.

33
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,700
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

34
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,160
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,710
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

36
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,900
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,050
♫  Here's the love that I long for  ♫

38
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,270
   

39
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,850
And there. Looking sharp, Sir.
    

40
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,140
Is this really necessary?

41
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,770
Absolutely. Well, Haruto's late, isn't he?

42
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,260
It's not lying flat.

43
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,570
- Stop fussing. 
 - Then fix it.

44
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,830
I apologize for running late.

45
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,570
You have some nerve, coming in late on my birthday.

46
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,160
Sorry, Sir, but why are we celebrating in the office?

47
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,700
You two wouldn't come to the party if we did it after hours.

48
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,790
- That's true. 
 - That's true.

49
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,020
Did you just agree with him?

50
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,210
Here's my gift! It's a bottle of wine from your birth year, sir.

51
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,870
Really? Thanks.

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,500
Jeez, you weren't kidding! Great!

53
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,480
You've got taste. You're amazing!

54
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,620
I'll be sure to enjoy it.

55
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,540
- And? 
 - Of course, I brought a gift as well. Here.

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,660
You were late buying this?

57
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,270
- Sorry, I snapped. 
 - It's okay.

58
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,200
- Sorry about that. Can I read this card?

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,940
Of course.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,460
"Letter of Resignation".

61
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,690
- Say what? 
 - I appreciated all your guidance, sir.

62
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,520
Then if you'll excuse me.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,440
Wait! What? I don't understand!

64
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,800
Haruto? Haruto!

65
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,830
Have some cake and think it over!

66
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,580
Ren? Ren! Ren, what're you looking at?

67
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,840
Hungry?

68
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,000
Sure!

69
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,950
Don't ask me any questions.

70
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,360
- I haven't said a word. 
 - Your eyes have.

71
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,480
Then I'll verbalize it.

72
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,950
What happened between you and the person who visited?

73
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,280
Please tell me.

74
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,040
Or else I'll be up all night wondering,

75
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,840
- and stuck in bed in the morning. 
 - That second one is your own issue.

76
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,600
Busted, huh?

77
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,810
I found her alone with another man in my house.

78
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,590
That's all.

79
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,130
Unbelievable. I'll punch her well next time I see her.

80
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,110
Want me to badmouth her for you?

81
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,960
She's a goddamn cheater.

82
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,930
Don't bother. And I'd never say that.

83
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,270
If you ever feel like cussing someone out, I'll handle it for you.

84
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
You're kind in the subtlest ways, aren't you?

85
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,780
I'm upfront with my kindness, mind you.

86
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,280
Oh, that means you like me?

87
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,670
No, it's just my love for humanity.

88
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,000
Love, you say?

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,090
Right, for humanity.

90
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,780
   

91
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,290
Love, for humanity.

92
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,500
Fine.

93
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,540
 This is my last day here, in this home. 

94
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,930
A letter of resignation?

95
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,490
I just wanted to let you know that, Miyashita-san.

96
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,190
In my opinion,

97
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,430
 this is Haruto's way of taking responsibility. 

98
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,120
 You see, 

99
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,580
our firm has made an enemy of various prosecutors.

100
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,320
What?

101
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,540
 The Chief Public Prosecutor despises Haruto. 

102
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,890
And recently, they got into another disagreement.

103
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,600
 He apparently told the Chief not to treat you like a criminal. 

104
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,000
You'll have seconds, right?

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,960
Absolutely. I'll eat every last dumpling you offer.

106
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,750
You're seriously a glutton.

107
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,660
- Is that so wrong? 
 - No. It makes cooking all the more worth it.

108
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,680
Hot.

109
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,990
 The longer he stays with me, the more he'll continue to lose. 

110
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:29,100
 Tateishi Haruto-sama. Thank you for allowing me to stay for as long as I have. 

111
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,340
 Although I cannot do much to show my appreciation, 

112
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,040
 I have left various gifts of gratitude around your home. 

113
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,790
 Nuts are a great snack for insomnia. 

114
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,660
There's too much.

115
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:01,900
 And on sleepless nights, please don't turn to alcohol. Drink this tea instead. 

116
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,330
This stuff is too bitter.

117
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,850
 I promise I'll repay my debts in full one day. 

118
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,450
She really cleaned the place up.

119
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,640
But she always forgets something.

120
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,770
   

121
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,350
Sakura, are you sure about this?

122
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,870
Yes. Watch me, I'll become a cafe pro in no time.

123
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,150
Oh my gosh.

124
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,910
Why don't you become a cleaning pro first?

125
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,130
- Yes. 
- Jeez...

126
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,380
Sorry, we're closed for lunch–

127
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,890
You'll quit working as a lawyer?

128
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,980
Yes.

129
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,630
My firm wasn't getting any decent clients anyway.

130
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,130
So I'm calling it here.

131
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,120
Why are you giving up so easily?

132
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,450
It isn't easy.

133
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,350
Giving up is a difficult ordeal.

134
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,140
That goes both for work...

135
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,950
and people as well.

136
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,990
Are you turning down my offer?

137
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,960
What?

138
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,400
I said to let me hire you, didn't I?

139
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,330
"Let me hire you"?

140
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,680
 Let me hire you. 

141
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,220
- You were drunk. 
 - But I meant it.

142
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,030
What?

143
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,040
I'll judge based on your expression.

144
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,700
You actually meant it.

145
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,040
Does that mean you remember the rest of that night as well?

146
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,080
N-Not in the slightest.

147
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Really now.

148
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,920
Come with me.

149
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,370
While I appreciate the offer, I'll have to decline.

150
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,510
Why?

151
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,320
Because I can't be causing you any more trouble.

152
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,630
That'd be brazen of me.

153
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,110
Thank you for coming to check in on me.

154
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,620
You're brazen.

155
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,650
But that's another charm of yours.

156
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,020
I'll be waiting.

157
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,990
That was a great one-liner, even for me.

158
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:52,590
 It took every bit of courage I had to give up on him, and my job. 

159
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,750
Twelve minutes. That's earlier than I thought.

160
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,640
They were a long twelve minutes to me.

161
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,640
 Even so, I want to stay with him. 

162
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,060
There's just one thing I forgot to mention.

163
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,560
You're now a hostage.

164
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,880
We'll have you lure out the culprit.

165
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,830
A hostage?

166
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,170
I'll open a firm tomorrow.

167
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,830
A hostage.

168
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,490
The office will be my first floor, and you'll be joining me.

169
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,420
A hostage?

170
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,290
No way!

171
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,800
A hostage... A hostage, huh?

172
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,930
- Are you listening? 
 - A hostage...

173
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,520
Humanity to hostage! That's an evolution!

174
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,000
What an upgrade!

175
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,450
Dad, I've become a hostage!

176
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,770
   

177
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,050
Why are you people here?

178
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,530
Because we've decided to work here as well.

179
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,370
You're the representative of your own firm, are you not?

180
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,660
I've shut that place down. I'll work here.

181
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,080
What, why?

182
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,310
Why? Because working here sounded more fun.

183
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,520
And you, Yoneda-san?

184
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,750
I've always wanted to work at a law office, so here I am.

185
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,040
What I'm more curious about, is why that woman is here.

186
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,320
She works here.

187
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,030
Are you insane? You're sentencing your own firm to its doom.

188
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,880
She killed the Chief Prosecutor's son!

189
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,640
I'll sue you for slander.

190
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,080
I'm speaking the "what-ifs," all right?

191
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,190
Rest easy, Sir. I'll rake in the dough for us.

192
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,420
You? No, never. Get out.

193
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,110
Haruto, let me explain–

194
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,160
It's not worth my time.

195
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,040
I know, but please.

196
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,430
You could at least listen to him.

197
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,330
I'm giving you five minutes.

198
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,300
We used to come here all the time, remember?

199
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,400
It was our secret base of sorts.

200
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,760
That's ancient history by now.

201
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,380
Mind if I reminisce a bit?

202
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,800
 "Would you go out with me?" 

203
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,360
 "I love you." 

204
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,310
 I think... 

205
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:02,790
 I might love you, Haruto. 

206
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:10,020
 I think... I might love you, too. 

207
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,410
 I thought I'd be able to give up. 

208
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,660
 I bring the sun. 

209
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,820
 So do I. 

210
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,410
 - The sun loves me more.
 - No, it loves me. 

211
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,840
 But... I just couldn't. 

212
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,840
 I couldn't fully let go. 

213
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,460
I have no excuses.

214
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,730
I never intended on forgiving you.

215
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,830
- I understand.
 - No, you don't.

216
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:06,640
 When my father passed away, you two were what kept me stable. 

217
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,910
 - Here. 
- Eat this. 

218
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,670
 You like sweet things, right? 

219
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,000
 - Don't cry.
 - Let's eat them, together. 

220
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,010
 It'll be okay. 

221
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,000
 - Let's study together. 
- Three heads are better than two. 

222
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,010
 - I can't concentrate. 
- Wait, what's that? 

223
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,220
 What are you doing now? 

224
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,210
 What does that say? 

225
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,080
 - Huh? 
- Too hard. 

226
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,740
 - Try this instead. 
- Guys! 

227
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,410
 And yet, you two betrayed me. 

228
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,540
Sorry.

229
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,070
An apology...

230
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,310
won't mend what's been broken.

231
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,620
You don't have to forgive me.

232
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,690
But I want to help you.

233
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,250
No, I know I can help you.

234
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,890
Because I think there are things only I can do as well.

235
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,910
Do what you want.

236
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,160
 Will something actually change from working together? 

237
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,960
Welcome back.

238
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,630
Thanks.

239
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,990
Starting a firm with the five of us is sort of exciting, isn't it?

240
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,640
Not really.

241
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,040
Don't misunderstand.

242
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,880
Misunderstand what?

243
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,410
I wasn't touching your face. I was supporting your head because you were sleeping in a bad position.

244
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,230
- Thank you. 
 - It's not something you have to thank me for.

245
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,090
You were just sleeping weird, so I -

246
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,290
I truly appreciate that you opened an office for us.

247
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,880
I don't need gratitude.

248
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,050
Pay me back with your hard work.

249
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,180
How adorable.

250
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,850
I'm truly grateful to you, Miyashita-san.

251
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,550
You're the reason Haruto reached out to me at all.

252
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,870
Not to mention I get to work here, of all places.

253
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,280
Why are you always smiling?

254
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:58,830
It's the only way I know how to deal with Haruto now.

255
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,790
Let me know if there's any way I can amend that.

256
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,560
You're a kind person.

257
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:12,930
Most would laugh at that, you know? The world thinks I'm a murderer.

258
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,500
I think that smile looked much more genuine.

259
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,060
- You think? 
 - Yes, it looks more natural.

260
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,910
But I can't tell myself.

261
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,590
I see those two get along quite well.

262
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,430
Do they?

263
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,120
Are you jealous?

264
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,420
No, I am not.

265
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,700
- You are. 
- Am not.

266
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,630
- Are. 
- Not.

267
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,080
You are.

268
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,490
My hand slipped, sorry.

269
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,800
- What the heck are you doing? 
- My hand slipped.

270
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,120
Stop it, Haruto!

271
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,940
- You're doing that on purpose! 
- I'm drenched!

272
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,830
 Everything was going smoothly for us. 

273
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:17,110
 Timing and subtitles by the Love &amp; Lawsuits Team @ viki 

274
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,190
We have our first client.

275
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,880
- Oh?
 - Oh?

276
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,310
Oh?

277
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,220
Who is it?

278
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:32,190
 Chef and owner of Ristorante Haneda, Haneda Ryujiro-san was found murdered in his home. 

279
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:38,930
 Police have arrested the delivery driver, Inaba Takahiko, aged 31, as the prime suspect. 

280
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:43,270
He is our first client.

281
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:48,250
 That is, until this man appeared before us. 

282
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,040
   
 He has requested you to be his defense attorney. 

283
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,970
 You are the only one who can save me now. 

284
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,130
 He may be innocent. 

285
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,820
 Don't let your empathy sway you. 

286
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,890
 Are you really dating Haruto? 

287
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,110
 Don't fall in love with me.
