1
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,289
Some memories just pop
into my head suddenly.

2
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,729
Ergo, I prosecute Defendant
Eun Bong Hee for murder...

3
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,700
according to Article 250
of Criminal Law.

4
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,140
You and I faced
each other in court...

5
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,140
as the prosecutor in charge
and a suspect of the case.

6
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,069
According to Article 250 of Criminal
Law, for the first-degree murder,

7
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:14,950
I ask that you sentence
her 15 years...

8
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,180
in prison.

9
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,219
You demanded that
I spend 15 years in prison.

10
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,420
Therefore, according to Article 255
of Criminal Procedure Law,

11
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:29,260
the prosecution will
drop the charges.

12
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,930
You rescued me...

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,569
and I fell for you
who tried to save me.

14
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:48,750
Now that I think about it,
after that day,

15
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,920
my life was a series of days for me
to fall for you again and again.

16
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:58,560
Even at this very moment,
I'm falling for you again.

17
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,490
(Return to the Daily Life)

18
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,699
Hey, you. Can't you wake up
like a normal person?

19
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,800
What time is it?

20
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,610
You should ask what date it is.

21
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,439
You've been lying down on that sofa
for the whole weekend.

22
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,539
You didn't even wash.

23
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,750
I see. The weekend is...

24
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,680
already over.

25
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,919
Hey, I think the sofa
is going to stink now.

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,520
Ji Hye, I...

27
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,960
am fickle.

28
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,330
What is she talking about now?

29
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,090
I suddenly came to my senses.

30
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,030
I wonder...

31
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,469
why I was reminded of that day.

32
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,129
Give me a morning kiss then.

33
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,569
What if something happens
between us again?

34
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,370
Our relationship is messy as it is.

35
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,240
- Can we start again?
- Bong Hee.

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,110
- Bong Hee.
- I suddenly realized that.

37
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,409
I forgot that I had
a trial to attend to.

38
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,719
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Wait.

40
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,189
I...

41
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,460
got really chicken-hearted
these days.

42
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,389
Ji Hye, I became timid and coward.

43
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,000
What is she going on about now?

44
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,560
It doesn't even surprise me now.

45
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:49,629
Just shower already. Will you?

46
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:54,669
Who is it?

47
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,039
Who is it?

48
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,710
- Goodness.
- Hey.

49
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,120
Hello.

50
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,250
I know that coming here
would mean disturbing you.

51
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,219
Is Ms. Eun inside?

52
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,319
Please come and disturb her.

53
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,030
Please get her off the sofa.

54
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,000
May I?

55
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,230
Please come in.

56
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,000
Bong Hee, get up.

57
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,740
Why... Why should I?

58
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,040
- Come outside. We need to talk.
- Hey, fix your hair.

59
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,279
No, I can't.

60
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,750
Why not?

61
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,550
I haven't even washed my face.

62
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,579
I've seen it before.

63
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,649
I haven't even washed
my hair either.

64
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:38,779
I've seen that too.

65
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:41,189
I mean... But still.

66
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:43,189
I told you that you are still pretty
even when you are dirty.

67
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,790
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,800
That's all right.

69
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,230
I called you
during the whole weekend.

70
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:26,129
My cell phone ran out of battery.

71
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,529
You weren't avoiding me?

72
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,170
That's not it.

73
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,670
Why are you avoiding me?

74
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,939
"Avoiding" isn't the right word.

75
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,680
I was scared.

76
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,750
Scared of what?

77
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,420
When I thought about us,
it was always like that.

78
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,519
After we got close, something
bad always happened.

79
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,259
When we started to date,
like each other, and kiss...

80
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,990
After these happy moments,

81
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,699
some things happened and
got messed up.

82
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,569
Someone always got hurt.

83
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,600
In the end, we broke up.

84
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,540
So you ran away?

85
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,009
That's why I ran away.

86
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,540
Okay. I can understand that.

87
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,449
Let's date each other nonetheless.

88
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,149
Sorry?

89
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,550
I just... I mean...

90
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,649
Were you even listening? It took
guts for me to tell you the truth.

91
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,060
Then what? Do you suggest that
we pretend nothing happened?

92
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,660
No, that's not what I meant.

93
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,399
Then should we date again...

94
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,129
just like this?

95
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,629
Yes.

96
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,970
Then why were you all over me...

97
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,339
in the sacred court?

98
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,709
No, that was...

99
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,610
I did it because someone told
me to follow my heart.

100
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,050
I did it without realizing it.

101
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,750
You should take responsibility
if you enjoyed your feelings.

102
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,750
What about me?
What should I do then?

103
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,459
I mean... It was only a kiss.

104
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,360
There's no need to
take responsibility for it.

105
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:02,959
Yes, there is.

106
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,160
Right, there is.

107
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Aren't you scared that something
bad might happen again?

108
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,410
I don't know.

109
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,310
Let it happen.

110
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,639
It doesn't matter to me.

111
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,079
How can you be so straight forward?

112
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,279
It's just that...

113
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,420
breaking up with you is scarier.

114
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,060
To me, that's the scariest thing.

115
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,970
So please answer me now.

116
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,100
What do you want to do?

117
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Should we date or not?

118
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Should we not?

119
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,709
Let's do it.

120
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,939
Well...

121
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,550
the worst thing that can
happen is us breaking up.

122
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,220
Let's date.

123
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,699
You said you became chicken-hearted.

124
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,110
You said you became timid.

125
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,540
He convinced me.

126
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,879
He makes a really appealing case.

127
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,680
Oh, my. I'm so nervous.

128
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,879
I'm going on a date.

129
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,549
You guys went out for long time.

130
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,690
Right.

131
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,320
But when we started dating,

132
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,789
someone got stabbed. So we didn't
get to go on many dates technically.

133
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:44,929
But you guys lived together
throughout the whole time.

134
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:46,830
But we only slept once together.

135
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,830
Hey,

136
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,870
I don't want to know the details.

137
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,639
Sorry.

138
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,139
Should I throw out
the blanket or not?

139
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,909
- Unbelievable.
- But...

140
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,009
what should I talk about during
our date?

141
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,649
Do I have perfume?

142
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,389
- No, you don't.
- You'll let me borrow, right?

143
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:08,820
- No.
- Thank you.

144
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,120
Hey, I said no.

145
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,220
Sorry.

146
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,929
Hey, how do I look ? Do I look okay?

147
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,929
Do I look pretty?

148
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,200
- Not really.
- I don't look pretty?

149
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,629
- No.
- You lost your eye sight.

150
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,940
I'm leaving now.

151
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,440
Hey, hey.

152
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,039
Sit down.

153
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,840
- Why?
- Sit down.

154
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,679
I can't believe
you call that makeup.

155
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,480
Come closer.

156
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,789
This is the trendiest makeup style
these days.

157
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,159
This is known as the Drunk Makeup.

158
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:52,129
What? What makeup?

159
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,529
Don't talk. Just sit tight.

160
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,669
So you'll let me use
your perfume, right?

161
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,409
Okay. Thank you.

162
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
You little...

163
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,440
Please finish up.

164
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,750
This is perfect.

165
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,879
- Do I look okay?
- Yes.

166
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,279
- You're not lying, right?
- No.

167
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,850
- Trust me.
- Okay.

168
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,500
What is it?

169
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,840
It's nothing.

170
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,700
Your cheeks look cute.

171
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,840
What should we do today?

172
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,509
There are so many things
I'd like to do.

173
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,679
Why don't we have a meal first?

174
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,450
Meal? Sure. What do you want to eat?

175
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,980
There are so many things
I'd like to eat.

176
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
What should we eat?

177
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,889
Instead of eating, how about
some drinks?

178
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,919
Drinks?

179
00:10:58,929 --> 00:10:59,929
Sure. I like it. Let's go.

180
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,070
What kind of drinks do you want?

181
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,210
(Goyang branch of the district
court)

182
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,350
(Defendant)

183
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,350
It was an excuse...

184
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,529
that I wanted to find out
the truth of my son's case.

185
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,129
As an officer of the law...

186
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,830
who should have followed...

187
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,330
and complied with the law
more than anyone,

188
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,639
I deeply regret for committing...

189
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,899
unlawful acts such
as illegal arrests...

190
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,539
and wrongful imprisonment.

191
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:44,509
However,

192
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,509
I'd like to tell you that I didn't
attempt to commit murder.

193
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,620
I only took the weapon
to the scene...

194
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,220
as a defensive measure
to protect myself...

195
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
against a dangerous individual.

196
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,960
I did not intend to kill anyone.

197
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,129
I hope...

198
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,659
the court will
acknowledge this fact.

199
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,200
How will they rule?

200
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,399
I'm not sure.

201
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,370
If the attempted murder charge
gets dropped,

202
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,210
he'll probably receive probation.

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,070
Personally, I hope that
our district attorney... I mean,

204
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,740
you're no longer our DA.
I hope that our former DA...

205
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,409
has some shame.

206
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,620
See you.

207
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,529
- He's coming out.
- There he is!

208
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,139
What's your thought
on the public's rage...

209
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:23,070
toward you, the former DA
who violated the law?

210
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,409
Do you agree that those with power
can get off any criminal charges?

211
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:27,750
There's a heated controversy
surrounding your personal revenge.

212
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,980
What's your thought on that?

213
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,779
How do you feel about
your dishonorable resignation?

214
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,879
Did you have murderous intentions?

215
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,879
- Please say a few words.
- Please say a few words.

216
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,049
- What's the truth?
- Please tell us what happened.

217
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:38,919
District Attorney Jang Moo Young
resigned dishonorably from his post.

218
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,029
The former head of Sunho
District Prosecutor's Office...

219
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,429
became a suspect...

220
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:45,730
and ended up being convicted
of the charges.

221
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,870
He remained silent when
reporters asked him questions...

222
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,669
How humiliating. He's too old
to be in that mess.

223
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:57,740
I've never been fond of him,

224
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,509
but I feel really bad for him.

225
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,080
Goodness.

226
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:12,190
Seeing the two of you
is upsetting me even more.

227
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,360
Do you think you're more
upset than I am?

228
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:18,730
Now, it's on me
to support the two of you.

229
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,730
I'll work hard, Mr. Ji.

230
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,970
Me too. I'll work very hard as well.

231
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:31,580
Goodness. I feel as if
I've become a daycare teacher.

232
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,679
Don't go anywhere, please.

233
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,850
We'll be good to you.

234
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,120
When is Jung Hyun Soo's final trial?

235
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,129
Defendant Jung Hyun Soo...

236
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,299
brutally killed the gang rapists
of the Park So Young case...

237
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,399
in the name of revenge
for her death.

238
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,029
He also killed the witnesses
of the case, thinking that they'd...

239
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,700
get in the way of his criminal acts.

240
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,309
Moreover, the defendant continued
to justify his crimes...

241
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:05,340
without feeling any guilt
or remorse.

242
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,509
He actually became enraged that
his murderous acts...

243
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,779
were stopped.

244
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,980
Considering the fact...

245
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,850
that he committed a series
of brutal first-degree murders...

246
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:19,690
and that he's not repenting
or regretting at all,

247
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:24,399
I demand that he receives
a life sentence...

248
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,899
in order to completely separate him
from the society.

249
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,720
(Currently under trial)

250
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,529
Considering how the defendant
violated the laws and committed...

251
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,200
a series of murders
under the name of revenge,

252
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,700
as well as the ruthlessness
and the violent nature...

253
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,600
of his criminal acts,

254
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,440
I sentence the defendant,
Jung Hyun Soo,

255
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,909
to lifetime imprisonment.

256
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:26,490
Congratulations, Ms. Eun.

257
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,190
You've finally proved
your innocence.

258
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,850
Congratulations.

259
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,099
Thank you.

260
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:17,470
Mom.

261
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:21,549
Bong Hee.

262
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,109
My daughter.

263
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:32,059
Mom, everyone now knows
that I'm not guilty.

264
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:34,630
I've finally proved my innocence.

265
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,630
Yes, I know too.

266
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,359
I know how distressed you've been.

267
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:42,670
Congratulations, my daughter.

268
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,400
I know it's been hard
on you as well.

269
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,319
Mom.

270
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,890
About Dad...

271
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,759
It'd be really great...

272
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,900
if I could prove
his innocence as well.

273
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:25,339
Bong Hee.

274
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,150
I wanted to resolve the issue
about your dad,

275
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,279
but there's nothing
that can be done legally.

276
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,650
Since he wasn't actually charged
back then,

277
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,289
there's no evidence to correct it.

278
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,759
And the statute of limitations...

279
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,460
for defaming the dead
is only three years long.

280
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,400
I'm really sorry.

281
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,279
It doesn't matter.

282
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,750
What matters is that those
who are alive should be happy.

283
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:07,549
But still...

284
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:11,460
You've cleared yourself of the false
accusation, so all is good now.

285
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,730
I wish for no more.
I'm sure your dad thinks the same.

286
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,700
"This is good enough."

287
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,529
I bet he's thinking that now.

288
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,839
Okay.

289
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,470
Let's go home. I'll make you
something delicious.

290
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,069
We should celebrate.

291
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:35,049
Oh, actually...

292
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,750
Gosh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

293
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:41,549
I'm supposed to meet up
with someone.

294
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,750
You are?

295
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:44,720
Gosh, are you...

296
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,329
Are you meeting up
with the handsome Mr. No?

297
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,329
(Prosecutor No Ji Wook)

298
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,369
Even if you just take a wallet that
is left behind, you'd be...

299
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,099
violating Article 360
of the Criminal Law.

300
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,839
Why did you take
someone else's belonging?

301
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,509
I apologize.

302
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:07,210
The victim has agreed to settle,
so please write a formal apology...

303
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,809
as well as a letter of appeal.
Got it?

304
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,880
- Yes, sir.
- You may leave now.

305
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,349
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

306
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,660
All right. Then I should...

307
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,859
leave for the day now.

308
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,460
Wait, where are you going?

309
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,630
We're done for the day, right?

310
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:29,529
No, wait. We got additional cases.

311
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:39,180
Well, when did we get assigned
to so many additional cases?

312
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,240
Earlier in the day.

313
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,609
I guess you didn't hear it as you
were too busy with the documents.

314
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,250
It happened earlier in the day.

315
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,250
- Darn it.
- Did you just swear at me?

316
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,420
No, I wasn't swearing.

317
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,460
Hurry up. Come on.
Tell them to come in right away.

318
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,359
Gosh.

319
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,329
Please hurry up.

320
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,670
I'm sorry. It looks like I'll be
a bit late. Will you be all right?

321
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:10,339
I love waiting.

322
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,779
That sounds so desperate.

323
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,950
I'll be fine. Take your time.

324
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,630
(Date spots)

325
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,599
(10 best date spots in Seoul)

326
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:50,309
I'm really sorry.
It'll take me a bit longer.

327
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,549
It's okay. You don't need to rush.

328
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:11,640
Name, Ko Min Soo.

329
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,269
Date of birth, July 13, 1975.

330
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:18,309
Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province.

331
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:20,940
Look. From the CCTV footage
to your DNA,

332
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,910
there's so much evidence.

333
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,049
Please just admit it.

334
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,049
If you don't,
I won't give you a chance...

335
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,750
to appeal to get
your sentence reduced.

336
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:30,250
I don't have time now,
so I feel very rushed at the moment.

337
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,390
Hence, I can't be understanding.
I have a very important appointment,

338
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,859
so I can give you
exactly 30 seconds.

339
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,829
I usually give people two minutes
when I'm not in a rush,

340
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:40,200
but I can't give you more than
30 seconds now. Please confess.

341
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,369
All right, here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4.

342
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,299
5. Come on. 6.

343
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,710
Just come with me, please.

344
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,380
Yoo Jung, do you have no one...

345
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,710
to eat and drink with besides me?

346
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,779
I have nobody.

347
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:58,650
Goodness.

348
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,380
Eat with me.

349
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:02,119
- Please?
- Yes, let's eat together.

350
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,690
Gosh, seriously.

351
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:05,819
Let's go.

352
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,259
Hey! Wait up.

353
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,500
He'll stand you up many times
from now on, Ms. Eun.

354
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:20,039
Prosecutors' workload is crazy,

355
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,299
and Ji Wook...

356
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,309
can be a workaholic.

357
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,210
Are you trying to advise me...

358
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,849
as his ex-girlfriend?

359
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:32,380
Gosh, is this a scene
from a bad drama or what?

360
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,690
Hey, my ex-boyfriend
cheated on me with you.

361
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,319
- Oh, right. Ji Hye.
- What?

362
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,029
Are you interested in Eun Hyuk?

363
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,900
What will you do if I say yes?

364
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,259
My gosh.

365
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,900
Why do you always fall
for guys that are taken?

366
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,430
- Please don't be like that.
- Hey.

367
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,440
I had no idea
that he had feelings for...

368
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:55,839
I really didn't know.

369
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,670
Hey, does Eun Hyuk like someone?

370
00:23:58,509 --> 00:23:59,609
Who?

371
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,680
Gosh, how obnoxious.

372
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:02,849
Yes, a little.

373
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,079
Why? Who is it? Tell me.

374
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:11,089
Gosh, who is she?
You guys have to tell me.

375
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,089
Have this.

376
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,289
- Who is she?
- Here.

377
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:18,089
Who is it?

378
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:23,170
Hey, Ji Wook!

379
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:26,269
Why are you here?

380
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,140
Oh, Ms. Eun must've called you.

381
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,579
Are you here because of Yoo Jung?

382
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:32,839
What?

383
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:35,549
Yes, and Prosecutor Na.

384
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,779
And Prosecutor Na?

385
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,289
It looks like you got the wrong
idea. It's not what you think.

386
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:45,759
You did get the wrong idea.
Hey, it's really not that. Ji Wook.

387
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,190
Goodness.

388
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,160
My gosh.

389
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,740
Mr. Ji.

390
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,640
Did you use me?

391
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,910
Pardon me?

392
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:07,839
Hey, Eun Hyuk.
Are you seeing someone?

393
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,910
What?

394
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:11,619
Gosh, what are you saying?

395
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,089
All right. Let's get out of here.

396
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:17,920
Hey, wait. Are you seriously...

397
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,490
leaving me alone here
with these two?

398
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,519
- Hi, Mr. Ji.
- Hi.

399
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,390
Eun Hyuk, you honestly
shouldn't live your life like that.

400
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,700
Got it? Behave yourself, please.

401
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,269
I didn't intend this at all.

402
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:47,079
Are you okay?

403
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,079
Yes.

404
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,259
Why? What's wrong?
Do you feel like throwing up?

405
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,859
Goodness.

406
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,559
Hey, don't tease me.

407
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,529
There! I'm going to cover your eyes.

408
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,970
Don't do that. I can't see anything.

409
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,809
Hey, I won't buy it this time.

410
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:12,180
No, it's real this time.

411
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,410
Are you serious? Then...

412
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,440
I was kidding.

413
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:18,519
Bong Hee, stop joking with me!

414
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,250
Be careful.

415
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,190
- Take your shoes off.
- Right, my shoes.

416
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,190
There.

417
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,500
Why did you drink so much?

418
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:35,329
- Eun Hyuk.
- Yes.

419
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:38,470
Ji Hye. Where did Ji Hye go?

420
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,210
Yoo Jung, we just took her home
before coming up here.

421
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,210
You remember, right?

422
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:46,410
That's right. We did.

423
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,410
You used to be able to drink a lot.
Why are you such a lightweight now?

424
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,720
That was back in the old days.

425
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,380
These days, my body changes
every year.

426
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,019
That is true.

427
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:57,789
You should wash up and go to bed.

428
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:58,990
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

429
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,460
Good night.

430
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:02,930
Hey.

431
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,640
Hey, are you all right?

432
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:21,180
Yes.

433
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:23,650
I'm fine.

434
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:26,849
Okay.

435
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,950
Hey, you should head off to bed.

436
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,960
I'll be off.

437
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:50,769
I'm sorry.

438
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:54,579
I must be really drunk right now.

439
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,680
Sorry.

440
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,440
Did you have a good sleep?

441
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,109
- Did you have a good sleep?
- Yes.

442
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,420
What happened?

443
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,460
Don't you remember?

444
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:20,529
You don't?

445
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:26,170
Goodness.

446
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,140
I'll bring you some water.

447
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,240
Last night, did we...

448
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,210
What?

449
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:37,680
What I'm asking is...

450
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,380
Among the things
that I can't remember...

451
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,190
What I mean is...

452
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,490
You know what I mean.

453
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:50,230
Well, you know. I'm...

454
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,900
not exactly...

455
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,359
a saint.

456
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,069
Why wouldn't I remember it?
I do, of course.

457
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,309
We got here so early.

458
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:12,049
I know, right?
I think I'll be a little late.

459
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,420
Get going. I hope all goes well.

460
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,420
Thanks.

461
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,519
- There's your morning kiss.
- Morning kiss?

462
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,500
Oh, really?

463
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,400
I love that too.

464
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,410
Yes, that's right.
I had such a crazy day today.

465
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,910
I had so many out-of-office
meetings,

466
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:42,410
then when I got back to the office,

467
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,250
I was greeted by a big pile
of paperwork.

468
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,720
By the way,

469
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:51,089
I must tell you that the office
feels so empty without you.

470
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,019
Of course it feels empty.

471
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,990
Tell me your favorite color.

472
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,099
I like blue.

473
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,799
No, I think it's red.

474
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,539
Goodness, I didn't know
you were such a girl.

475
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:09,369
We spent the whole night as
we talked about pointless things.

476
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:20,279
Instead of living at her house, why
don't you stay here like before?

477
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,789
No, then there's no tension.

478
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,990
Have a good day at work.

479
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,359
Tension, my foot.

480
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:35,930
It's sad to say goodbye
when we meet up.

481
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,700
- Look at his face.
- Poor him.

482
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:19,440
I am you,

483
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:21,710
and you are me.

484
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,009
Every day is perfect with you.

485
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,740
Hey, Eun Hyuk. Mr. Ji.

486
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,369
Hey, Yoo Jung.

487
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,410
The weather today is great.

488
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,710
No, it's hot and humid.

489
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,009
I see. Really?

490
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,279
I guess it's going to
be summer soon.

491
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,250
It's been summer
for quite some time.

492
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:02,150
Is that so?

493
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:03,750
You're right.

494
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,819
I've been busy. I don't even know
in which season we are in.

495
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,490
I'll get going. I'm busy.

496
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:09,829
Yoo Jung.

497
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:15,000
Let's talk about us already.

498
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,890
I'm sorry about the other day.

499
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,329
Please consider it as a mistake.

500
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:48,160
I was sort of feeble-minded
at that time.

501
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,170
It...

502
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,240
It was a mistake for you, wasn't it?

503
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:01,009
It wasn't for me.

504
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,750
I meant it.

505
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,650
Actually,

506
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,219
I had feelings for a long time.

507
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,389
Yoo Jung.

508
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,559
You are my heart. Goodness.

509
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,739
I tried to stop having
feelings for you.

510
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,409
I did everything
in my power to do that.

511
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,679
But I...

512
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,219
always ended up looking
at you just like now, Yoo Jung.

513
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,489
So even if it was a mistake...

514
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:48,889
and you were feeble-minded,
I don't care.

515
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,159
Please like me back, Yoo Jung.

516
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Well...

517
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:03,969
I don't know...

518
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,639
how I feel about you yet.

519
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:09,909
I really like you,

520
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:15,019
but I'm confused if I like
you as a friend...

521
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,690
or as a man.

522
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:20,090
Is that still okay with you?

523
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
That's enough for me.

524
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,530
Why do you want so little?

525
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,969
What are you talking about?

526
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:32,099
I got more than I deserve.

527
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:37,739
Eat up.

528
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:47,679
You hit your husband?

529
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,260
May I ask why?

530
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:55,829
That is...

531
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:05,769
Honey, your meal is ready.

532
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,010
Your meal is ready.

533
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,969
Okay. I got it.

534
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:12,739
Goodness.

535
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:35,329
You hit your husband's back
of the head with a bat?

536
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,630
Yes.

537
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,670
She only struck once.

538
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,440
Since bats are included on
the list of dangerous items,

539
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
according to Clause 2 of Article 258
of Criminal Law,

540
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,840
this is considered
as a felony assault charge.

541
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:52,579
With this charge, you may face
a minimum of one year...

542
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:54,019
to 10 years in prison.

543
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,920
Then do I have to go to prison?

544
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,349
You may get probation.

545
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:01,389
That may not happen as well.

546
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,329
So what was your reason?

547
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,070
My husband cheated on me.

548
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:14,199
I hit him in the back
of the head impulsively.

549
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:18,340
But still. That doesn't
justify your act.

550
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,710
I'm sorry.

551
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,409
The injury is minor.

552
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,550
He gave her the reason
attributable to her action.

553
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:26,750
We have the affidavit from him that
he doesn't want her punished.

554
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,719
Don't you think it's enough for her
to get probation, Prosecutor No?

555
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:34,190
That's for me to decide, Ms. Eun.

556
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,900
So when did your husband's...

557
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,530
affair start?

558
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:43,829
Well...

559
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,300
It started in July, 1987.

560
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,110
It started in July, 1987?

561
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:58,110
Did you say it started in 1987?

562
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:01,179
- Yes.
- It happened 30 years ago.

563
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,889
Due to the shock and anger
at that moment,

564
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:05,989
she lifted the bat without realizing
what she was doing.

565
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,389
I've been putting up with him
for a long time.

566
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,800
I see. The affair happened
30 years ago.

567
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,769
You put up with him.

568
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,300
30 years?

569
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,510
You can't understand her?
I understand her a bit though.

570
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,010
I don't know. I don't think
I can understand her.

571
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,750
Hear me out.
It happened 30 years ago.

572
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,280
If his affair traumatized
and hurt her deeply,

573
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:39,090
she should've solved it then whether
she divorced him or hit him.

574
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:42,590
She could have wanted to do that,
but perhaps, she wasn't able to.

575
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,190
Maybe she had to put up with him
for the sake of her children.

576
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,760
Or financially,
she wasn't able to do that.

577
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,699
Even if that's true,
it was her decision.

578
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,400
Come on. That's not her decision.

579
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,599
What? Then whose decision is it?

580
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,340
Anyway, think about how devastated
and sad she must've been...

581
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:03,710
for hitting him after 30 years.

582
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,679
I bet she was miserable.

583
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,820
Regardless of her reason, this is
an assault. This isn't right.

584
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,260
I don't mean to justify her action.

585
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,860
The point is that she must
have felt miserable.

586
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:21,699
Why did she hold a grudge
for 30 years to start with?

587
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,570
Say that she couldn't divorce him
due to a financial reason.

588
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,230
Then she should've
been angry at him.

589
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:29,070
It's not as simple as you say.

590
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,710
She tried to put up with him,

591
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,639
but she couldn't and went berserk.

592
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,309
Why did she go berserk?
She should've been up front...

593
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:38,250
Okay. I got it.

594
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,420
My client made a mistake.
She did a horrible thing.

595
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,690
What I meant to say was...

596
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,230
it could have developed into
a murder within the family.

597
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,659
I think you are jumping
to conclusions.

598
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,659
You're making my client
into a murderer...

599
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,199
because she struck the bat once.

600
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,969
No, I wasn't.

601
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:01,300
Hear me out. What I said was...

602
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,980
It's harder for me to understand
why we should be fighting over this.

603
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:15,619
Bong Hee, this doesn't concern us.

604
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,619
Besides, we don't keep hurt feelings
inside. We never fight due to them.

605
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,860
What makes you think that?

606
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,389
You do?

607
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,260
The other day, you didn't kiss me.

608
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,900
Give me a morning kiss then.

609
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,210
Do you know how hurtful that was?

610
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:40,110
Goodness. You know that day...

611
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,739
By the way, I can understand that.

612
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,079
I understand your feelings
at that time,

613
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,849
but whenever I think about it,
it still upsets me.

614
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,849
Watch your head.

615
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,889
My grudges might explode
in 30 years from now.

616
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,230
Bong Hee. Bong Hee, wait.

617
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:09,440
By the way, why is this one
looking so downcast today?

618
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:10,840
He does seem upset.

619
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,179
Did you and Ms. Eun have a fight?

620
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,239
Why?

621
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,150
Hey, what is it?
What did you do wrong?

622
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:23,849
It's...

623
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:27,320
I know what I've done wrong,

624
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,030
but I can't fully understand what
I've done wrong at the same time.

625
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:33,800
That's why I can't date anyone.

626
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,969
It's so hard to understand
what women want.

627
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:38,269
Hey, guys. Stop.

628
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,369
When it comes to things like that,

629
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:42,909
you should come to me for advice.

630
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,070
Has any one of you...

631
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:48,539
lived longer with a woman
than I have?

632
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,210
No, right?

633
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,179
My experience
of living with my wife...

634
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:55,449
for 30 something years taught me...

635
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,889
that there's only one right answer.

636
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,389
When your woman seems to be
in a bad mood, just be servile.

637
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,630
And say, "I'm sorry."

638
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:06,360
Then you guys will have
nothing to worry about.

639
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,900
- In any circumstances?
- Yes, absolutely.

640
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,599
"I'm sorry."

641
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,800
Okay.

642
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,840
- What are you sorry about?
- What?

643
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,710
Be specific. I'm asking
exactly what you're sorry about.

644
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,150
It's... I can certainly answer that.

645
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:30,250
I'm sorry about everything.

646
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,420
You don't even know what you should
be sorry about, do you?

647
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,690
I do. I know, of course.

648
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:41,730
Oh, right.
I drank a little bit last night...

649
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,070
You drank?

650
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,800
You said you didn't.

651
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,869
I just had one drink.

652
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:52,340
Let's talk about that in a bit.

653
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:56,780
I wasn't talking about that.
What else did you do wrong?

654
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:01,750
See? Look at you.

655
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,420
You have no clue.

656
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,750
Do you think saying sorry
will solve all problems?

657
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:08,360
Have you forgotten?

658
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,130
You didn't even tell me about my son
getting stabbed in his stomach.

659
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,329
Oh, that? Gosh.

660
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,969
That was because...

661
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:19,840
I didn't want to worry you during
your trip as you haven't been...

662
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,869
Be quiet!

663
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:23,070
My trip wasn't a big deal at all.

664
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,510
Gosh, you're seriously...
I hate you so much.

665
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,780
The injury wasn't that serious.

666
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,880
It's so hot.

667
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,260
Why are you making yourself sweat
so much this late? It's so hot.

668
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:43,429
I'm just so mad.

669
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,530
Why are you mad?

670
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,699
Mr. No and I had
our very first fight.

671
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,199
Really? That's good.

672
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:55,969
Indeed. Why is it making me happy?

673
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,179
I just really don't understand it.

674
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,849
We cared about each other so much
even while going through all that.

675
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,619
Why did we fight about something
so little and insignificant?

676
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:11,019
It's making me so upset
and confused.

677
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,889
It's because...

678
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,960
the mundane can be terrifying.

679
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:21,059
When people around you
are against your relationship,

680
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,900
the love between
the two of you deepens,

681
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,969
and you'd be glued to each other.

682
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:26,469
- Then...
- Then?

683
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:29,300
let's say that all problems
and hindrances go away,

684
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:32,909
and people are like, "All right.
Do whatever you two want to do."

685
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:36,480
That's when couples fight
and break up.

686
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:37,780
That's when problems arise.

687
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,380
- Why is that?
- I'm curious too.

688
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,820
When there's no external problems,

689
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,889
problems ought to arise internally.

690
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,460
Both of you will start noticing
each other's flaws...

691
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,119
and discover reasons why
you may not be compatible.

692
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,329
Then you'd get bored
of each other as well.

693
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:53,699
That's...

694
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,769
what will happen
in your near future.

695
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:00,869
Cut it out.

696
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,809
It's a fact. I'm being serious.

697
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,340
Can you hit her once more?

698
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,880
It's what awaits you in your near
future. It'll happen very soon.

699
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,119
What was that about?

700
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,699
Hey, Bong Hee.

701
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:36,639
I'm sorry.

702
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,710
What are you sorry about?

703
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:42,909
What?

704
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,320
Well, this isn't
how it's supposed to go.

705
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,550
What do you mean?

706
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,420
I'm sorry about everything.

707
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:52,650
I don't know.

708
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,889
Just like the prediction,

709
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,829
our peaceful day-to-day life
together gave us a gift...

710
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,260
called an internal conflict.

711
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,570
Bong Hee, Bong Hee. You're back!

712
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,170
You must've missed me so much and
realized you want to live with me.

713
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,469
That's why you're back, right?

714
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,539
No, it's not.

715
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,909
I have an interview
with the media today.

716
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,349
Everyone's talking about
how my innocence was proved.

717
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,849
I have to take photos,
so I brought all of my clothes.

718
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,760
You look stunning.

719
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,800
No way. I'm not happy
with this outfit.

720
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,010
Yes, this one is pretty good.

721
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,340
You look amazing.

722
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:49,409
You should be honest.

723
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,260
You look...

724
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,800
I don't know how I feel about
the bow being right in the middle.

725
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,739
The stripes might look
a bit too distracting as well.

726
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:17,340
This one is my favorite outfit
so far.

727
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,980
And discovering the sides we didn't
know about came as a surprise.

728
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,119
(1 year later)

729
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:32,050
Don't blame me.

730
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,789
Blame the chief prosecutor who keeps
assigning you to all cases.

731
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,530
And blame yourself because
you've been getting named...

732
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,460
the worst prosecutor every year.

733
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
This is... Gosh.

734
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,610
I have too much work to do.

735
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,550
Darn it.

736
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:58,809
Bong Hee, I don't think...

737
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,420
I can have dinner with you today.

738
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,920
What should I do?

739
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,030
Whatever.
He prioritizes work over me anyway.

740
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:15,860
My gosh, I apologize. Where were we?

741
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,369
- So I was...
- Yes.

742
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:19,800
And we fought about
such little, insignificant matters.

743
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,469
It's a little embarrassing
for me to talk about it.

744
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:25,239
It's really okay.
You can be open with me.

745
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:26,880
- My husband...
- Yes.

746
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,050
That's why I want to divorce him.

747
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,889
My eyes were glued to my phone
on my way to work,

748
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:40,690
but a woman started screaming
suddenly, calling me a pervert.

749
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:42,760
I can pick out perverts
from faraway.

750
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,960
I'm so glad you came to see me.

751
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,500
Could you please give me
the details of what happened?

752
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:02,679
How can she do this to me?

753
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,050
- What are you talking about?
- This girl...

754
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:08,320
has been missing in action for 3
days. She hasn't called me at all.

755
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,050
- Did you two fight again?
- It wasn't a fight.

756
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,590
I'm a victim.

757
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,659
She's not telling me
what I did wrong...

758
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,730
Hello, Ms. Eun.
What brings you here?

759
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm here to eat jjajangmyeon,
Mr. Bang.

760
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,269
Do you think this is a Chinese
restaurant or what?

761
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,800
Shall I leave?

762
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,900
No. Don't go, Bong Hee.

763
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:27,869
Sit. Have a seat.

764
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:29,969
Please have a seat.

765
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,539
Please come tidy this up.

766
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,639
I got it.

767
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,710
- Shall I give you a hand?
- No, it's okay. Just relax.

768
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,880
It's Golden Gate, right?

769
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:42,679
We'd like one double portion
jjajangmyeon with seafood...

770
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,590
- I want the regular size.
- and two regular sizes.

771
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:46,760
We also want sweat and sour pork,
spicy chicken, and chili shrimp.

772
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,090
We'll get every famous dish
your restaurant is known for.

773
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,260
My girlfriend whom I love so much
is here to see me.

774
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,860
Just send us
everything on your menu.

775
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,000
Thank you.

776
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,500
Yet our peaceful day-to-day life...

777
00:49:56,769 --> 00:49:59,469
still goes on
as if nothing happened.

778
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,050
Did something happen, Yoo Jung?

779
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,019
No.

780
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:21,960
Eun Hyuk.

781
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,989
You were out drinking last night,
yet you didn't even call me.

782
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:26,530
You didn't answer my calls either.

783
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:33,869
You know the company where
I act as an adviser, right?

784
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:35,639
They had a team dinner last night.

785
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:39,840
It went on until very late.
I thought you'd be sleeping.

786
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,579
And I crashed because
I drank quite a bit.

787
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:50,590
I won't do it again. Please?

788
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:52,019
Whatever.

789
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,489
Wait. I saw you smile.

790
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,900
Don't ever do that again.

791
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:02,230
Okay. Here you go. Eat up.

792
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:06,369
I was going to call you,
and I will from now on.

793
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:10,210
It's not even funny now.

794
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:16,480
It's better than them
laughing loudly.

795
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,789
Do you still get butterflies
and fall for him...

796
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,230
when you see Mr. No?

797
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,099
What are you talking about?

798
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,369
Are you drunk?

799
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,239
You don't, right?

800
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:45,469
It's crazy if you still have
butterflies and fall for him.

801
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:46,579
Sometimes, I still fall for him.

802
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,880
She's so annoying.

803
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,119
What's wrong with me?

804
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,659
(Prosecutor)

805
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,159
(Defense Counsel)

806
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:20,710
The statement and testimony of the
victim who witnessed Defendant...

807
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,610
Kang Jin Wook's inappropriate
show are consistent.

808
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:27,219
Since the statement and testimony
are identical to what happened...

809
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,150
There are no direct evidence such
as the CCTV or dash cam footages.

810
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:34,090
Your Honor, there isn't any
other witness as well.

811
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,889
However, the defendant has
a record of arrest for...

812
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:38,329
putting on an inappropriate show.

813
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:42,260
The order of how he took off his
clothes is exactly the same.

814
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,429
If I had to tell you the order
how he stripped...

815
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,639
He took off his jacket first
and his pants next.

816
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:51,239
He took off his shirt after that.
This was the order.

817
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:53,480
Don't you think...

818
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,250
it's cruel to condemn the victim
that he committed the crime...

819
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,010
because he has a similar record?

820
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:03,079
Besides, the order how he stripped
can't used as part of his claim.

821
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:05,849
The defendant is
receiving therapies...

822
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,690
since he is an exhibitionist.

823
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:10,590
Your Honor, according to the
records, just like in this court,

824
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,389
the bigger the crowd...

825
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:15,659
and the more attention
people give him,

826
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,900
his desire to put on an
inappropriate act got stronger.

827
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,900
He diligently went to therapies.

828
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:23,340
Because he did his best,

829
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,510
- Hey!
- today...

830
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,610
It's considered that
his condition...

831
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,909
- has been fully treated.
- His pants!

832
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,150
Also, the defendant...
Stop it. Don't move.

833
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,159
Goodness, how can
he try to strip in court?

834
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:46,599
I can't understand him.

835
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,559
I told you not to defend him.

836
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,230
I told you that he was
a complete pervert.

837
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,099
Mr. No, I'm trying to make
a living. That's all.

838
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:55,699
There are 20,000 lawyers. I can't
be picky about who my client is.

839
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,409
Yes, I wish you were picky.

840
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:02,409
By the way, your father, Mr. Byun,
accepted this case.

841
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:05,010
Goodness, Mr. Byun.

842
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:08,219
Oh, right. Today,
the defendant was a pervert.

843
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:12,289
But how can you always come at me
hard because you don't want to lose?

844
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:15,420
When did I do that?
Hey, what about you then?

845
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,630
You came at me harder than I did.

846
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:17,659
Let's break up.

847
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:20,900
Bong Hee, why do you always
say that after a trial?

848
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,300
- That's a habit.
- When did I say that?

849
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,170
- I didn't say that every time.
- Yes, you did.

850
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:25,730
You said that after the previous
and the one before too.

851
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:26,969
You just exaggerated.

852
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:28,800
What are you talking about?

853
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:32,210
- I hope...
- Do you want to have dinner?

854
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,340
Noodles or rice?

855
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,440
- I hope...
- Noodles.

856
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,579
How about cold bean
soup noodles? It's hot.

857
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:38,679
our normal and ordinary days
would...

858
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,420
continue.

859
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,289
We have more applicants
than we originally thought.

860
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:52,130
Let's choose the applicants
for the first round.

861
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:54,329
I will take the role for evaluating
for the first round.

862
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,559
No, you can't.

863
00:54:56,829 --> 00:54:59,099
You will pick the applicants
based on their looks.

864
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:04,739
She did talk about recruiting
a younger, handsome lawyer.

865
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:13,679
I wonder why you took
my joke so seriously.

866
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:15,679
I second that.

867
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:20,320
But why are the people who
aren't part of the firm here?

868
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,320
I know.

869
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:26,530
This is my house too.

870
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,000
Hey, this is an office.

871
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,230
That's right. I pay you
rent every month.

872
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,599
I'm going to raise the rent.

873
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:36,340
Gosh, aren't you one petty man?

874
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,210
Come on! Seriously.

875
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:42,710
Ms. Eun will evaluate the
applicants. What is our next agenda?

876
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:46,250
We did receive an offer about legal
consultations for a radio show.

877
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,679
- I think...
- The word "radio" jogs my memory.

878
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:51,019
Back in my old days...

879
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,719
There he goes again.

880
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:58,090
I proposed to my wife
through a radio show.

881
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,900
Who was the DJ of the show?
It's on the tip of my tongue.

882
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:07,039
At that time, I was quite romantic.

883
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:09,469
Now she's become a bit strange,
but at that time she was pretty.

884
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:11,670
Hey! Where are you going?

885
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:14,909
- Those punks.
- I'm so lonely.

886
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,409
Why aren't you leaving with them?

887
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:18,550
Should I leave as well?

888
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,550
Just stay.

889
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,989
Gosh, the weather is great.

890
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:27,860
Yes, it's great.

891
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,900
How can there be no one here?

892
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:52,909
Bong Hee.

893
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,019
Yes?

894
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,070
I love you.

895
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,710
I love you too.

896
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,829
I...

897
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:42,900
will love you forever.

898
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:54,610
Are you proposing to me now?

899
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:57,880
Yes.

900
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,989
Where's your song?
You don't have a song for me?

901
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:06,619
A song?

902
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,389
That... The song...

903
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,340
Even if you don't sing for me,

904
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,309
my answer is yes.

905
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
Yes!

906
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:38,989
I will...

907
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:41,619
love you forever too.

908
00:58:55,570 --> 00:59:01,579
There are so many reasons

909
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,780
Why I love you

910
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,550
- I'm so happy...
- I'm so happy...

911
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,550
- that I met you.
- that I met you.

912
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,090
- You, my love.
- You, my love.

913
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:45,610
(Love in Trouble)
