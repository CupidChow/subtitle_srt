1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,870


2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,620
You alone believed in my side of things, Miyashita-san.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,430
I would like to thank you somehow.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,670
You give me too much credit. I was only doing my job.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,590
No, not at all.

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,070
You flatter me.

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes? Oh, go ahead.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,950
Would you like to grab a meal with me sometime?

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,210
Yes, I'd love to.

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,980
Really?

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,000
 Of course. 

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,870
Then how about next Wednesday?

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,850
Great.

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,930
I'll contact you again.

15
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,350
Who was that?

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,220
Inaba-san. He invited me to go out for a meal to thank me.

17
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,080
I have every right to be thanked as well. I'm joining.

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,380
Schedule that meal on your own time.

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,010
You plan on going alone?

20
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,970
- Yes. 
 - You can't.

21
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,730
Why not?

22
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,470
I was also his lawyer.

23
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,710
Let's dine as a group.

24
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,960
I was the only one invited. I'll meet him alone.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,380
Look...

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,780
You're not my boyfriend. Please don't meddle in my affairs.

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,100
♫  Destiny is something  ♫

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,390
♫  That is so difficult to find  ♫

29
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,940
♫  But if you are my destiny,  ♫

30
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,140
♫  I call it a miracle  ♫

31
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:21,360
♫  Here's the love that I long for  ♫

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,340
   

33
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,050
Nice weather we're having today.

34
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,050
I suppose.

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,800
Aren't you being cold?

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,300
We're only coworkers, Sir.

37
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,030
 Don't smile in my presence ever again. 

38
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,900
I'd like to discuss something with you. Could I have a minute, Sir?

39
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,100
Please stay away from her.

40
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,290
What?

41
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,950
I understand you need someone to vent your anger at.

42
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,230
Even so, I ask that you show some restraint.

43
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,300
Unlike you, I've vowed to protect and uphold the law.

44
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,660
But if you choose to harass her regardless,

45
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,440
I may have to step off that path myself.

46
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,250
Is that a threat?

47
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,990
Yes.

48
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,630
 Why do you insist on protecting me? 

49
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,790
Your strife with the Chief Prosecutor is partially my business as well.

50
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,250
Tateishi-san, it was my fault you had to step down as a prosecutor.

51
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:37,700
As you say, we truly are tied by fate in a bad way.

52
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,890
- That was— 
 - Please just leave me be.

53
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,800
Can I really give up on him?

54
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,610
Maybe I'm asking the impossible.

55
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,360
Hey.

56
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,430
Why did they find a "button" I never dropped?

57
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,550
I don't know.

58
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,840
Sorry, I must've slipped up because I was in a hurry.

59
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,400
Slipped up.

60
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,320
I suppose everyone makes a mistake at least once.

61
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,490
But only once.

62
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,790
You're taking this the wrong way. It wasn't on purpose, I swear.

63
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,010
If you keep making these "slip-ups,"

64
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,050
they're no longer simple "mistakes."

65
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,030
I think you have intentions to betray me.

66
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,650
Help me until the end, all right?

67
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,150
Don't forget, you've got sins to atone, too.

68
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,490
Just one more.

69
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,990
I'll keep in touch.

70
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,870
Right.

71
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,400
What is it?

72
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,370
 I have to stop worrying unnecessarily about him. 

73
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,570
Nothing.

74
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,410
I looked into Inaba's connections and background.

75
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,700
He no longer has any family, nor does he have close friends.

76
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:51,570
Then could you check to see if any deceased family or old friend fell victim to some crime?

77
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,010
Yes, Sir.

78
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,650
Are you all right?

79
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,460
With Haruto and all that.

80
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,130
I've come up with a solution.

81
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,830
I'll think of him as my fave.

82
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,970
What do you mean?

83
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,910
I'll be satisfied just to gaze at him from afar because he's my fave.

84
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,060
I'm managing to detach all romantic feelings for him.

85
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,770
I believe I'm about 93% of the way there.

86
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,940
And now honestly?

87
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,900
I'm only at 30%.

88
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,530
I'll give you a hand, if you like.

89
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,220
What do you mean?

90
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,960
Come closer.

91
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,420
Now laugh.

92
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,390
Trust me, laugh.

93
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,640
More.

94
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,420
Nice smile.

95
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,030
Please don't act so immature.

96
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,610
I'll have to get going.

97
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,250
Where are you headed?

98
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,320
To have a meal with Inaba-san.

99
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,010
A date with Inaba-san? Sounds fun.

100
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,220
- Good luck. 
 - Thank you.

101
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,680
Did you quit your job?

102
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,330
Yes. I was only a contract worker, and being in custody... Well, you know.

103
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,410
I understand. I lost my place when I was let out as well.

104
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,130
Allow me to help with the job search.

105
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,980
Thank you, but it's all right.

106
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,170
I couldn't trouble you any more.

107
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,810
Still...

108
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,770
You truly are so kind, Miyashita-san.

109
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,040
I envy your significant other.

110
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,160
I have no such other in my life.

111
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,520
- You don't? 
 - No.

112
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,010
That's unexpected.

113
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,420
Then is there someone you have feelings for?

114
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:55,050
I'm sorry, I overstepped my boundaries with that one.

115
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,420
As a matter of fact, I confessed to them recently.

116
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,010
But...

117
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,850
But?

118
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:15,060
I was told not to love them and have decided to move on.

119
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,050
Personally, I would have said yes.

120
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,400
What?

121
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,850
I would go out with you, Sakura-san.

122
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,850
Stop making fun of me.

123
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,850
I'm being entirely serious right now.

124
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,420
Welcome!

125
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,350
A table for one, Sir?

126
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,730
- Are you all right? 
 - Y-Yes, fine.

127
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,210
My apologies, Sir.

128
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,010
Tateishi-san?

129
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,510
Oh? What a coincidence.

130
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,810
- Wow... 
 - Care to join us?

131
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,040
It's fine because it's just a coincidence.

132
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,440
Please get in touch.

133
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,290
- You wouldn't mind? 
 - Of course not.

134
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,980
We were rudely interrupted today, after all.

135
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,250
Then I'll reach out again for sure.

136
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,450
I look forward to it.

137
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,040
Have a good one.

138
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,710
Care to explain yourself?

139
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,290
- What? 
 - Why did you follow me?

140
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,830
I don't know what you're talking about.

141
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,480
Tell me why, now.

142
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,830
 No real reason. 

143
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,530
Don't just clam up on me, Tateishi-san.

144
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,500
 I want an answer. 

145
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,860
- Something's off with that guy. 
 - And your proof?

146
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,570
I'll tell you as soon as I have something concrete.

147
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,200
- Tell me now. 
 - I can't.

148
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,720
Not now.

149
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,660
Then no more tailing after me.

150
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,870
 I know he's involved in this somehow... 

151
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,610
 If the accused committed no robbery, 

152
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,960
 then the reason for this murder falls through completely. 

153
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,840
 That is all from the Defense. 

154
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:54,080
 I declare the accused, not guilty. 

155
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,870
What did you need from me, Sir?

156
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,870
Do you know of a "Haneda ryujiro-san"?

157
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,920
No, Sir.

158
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,720
Then what about a "Inaba Takahiko-san"?

159
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,330
I do not know who that is, either.

160
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,680
Then why did you come to every one of his hearings?

161
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,890
The case piqued my interest, Sir.

162
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,250
Your interest? How so?

163
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,790
I'm glad we spoke today.

164
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,960
I want to be of help to you.

165
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,510
If you need anything, please feel free to reach out.

166
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,500
I will aid you in any way I can.

167
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,600
What?

168
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,000
You were looking for the photograph that disappeared from Haneda-san's home, right?

169
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,710
Well we found it at his sister's place.

170
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,830
Send a picture of it to me.

171
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,400
No can do. This is evidence.

172
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,460
I'll be right over.

173
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,680
This was the photograph we found at his sister's house.

174
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,770
Someone was taking revenge.

175
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,560
Most likely.

176
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,270
Then our culprit could be one of his female victims

177
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:28,500
or perhaps someone related to them.

178
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,110
Hello?

179
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,540
This is Momoi from the forensics team.

180
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,170
Oh, it's been a while.

181
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,180
 Miyashita-san, there's something I wish to speak with you about. 

182
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,150
What is it?

183
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,540
I wanted to tell you

184
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,360
who bought those shoes you found at your office.

185
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,940
Who was it?

186
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,700
No, let's speak in person.

187
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,140
 I will head your way shortly. 

188
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,240
Thanks, this is a huge lead.

189
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,690
Don't go.

190
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:32,550
   

191
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,660
Hello?

192
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,560
 Where are you right now? 

193
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,760
Sorry, I'm out.

194
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,250
 Is that so. 

195
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,670
I'm a bit caught up in something. I'll call you back later.

196
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,890
 "Busy"? You're just standing around in a park. 

197
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,030
Found you.

198
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,100
Jeez, don't scare me like that!

199
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,520
I felt my heart leap up into my throat.

200
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,430
That's my line.

201
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,560
Why did you come here alone?

202
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,030
Use that head of yours.

203
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,260
What if something happened to you?

204
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,810
What'd happen to me?

205
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,950
Then what should I have done?

206
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,460
I had no choice because you didn't answer the phone.

207
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,000
- You should have wait until I arrived. 
 - I did.

208
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,100
That's why I never entered the park itself.

209
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,850
I thought you would get angry at me if something were to happen.

210
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,900
I never saw Momoi-san so I returned to wait out here, scared out of my mind.

211
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,240
Atone...

212
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,890
Atone your sins!

213
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,020
I... can't take it anymore!

214
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,690
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused today.

215
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,120
Likewise.

216
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,680
I'm sorry.

217
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,010
Was that a sincere apology?

218
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,660
It was.

219
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,370
I'll judge it from your expression.

220
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,750
♫  I do things like listening to your favorite songs like you do  ♫

221
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,100
♫  Or tucking a bookmark into a novel that I don't usually read  ♫

222
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,750
♫  The color of my hair and my fashion  ♫

223
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,960
♫  I changed everything for you, to suit you  ♫

224
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,970
You meant it all right.

225
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,940
♫  The cheesy lines like a drama  ♫

226
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,370
♫  Don't suit me  ♫

227
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,030
♫  But don't laugh at me even if I try to act like a grown-up  ♫

228
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,950
♫  All I wanna do is kiss your heart  ♫

229
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:01,430
♫  I want you more  ♫

230
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,700
♫  But you seem close and yet far away  ♫

231
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:14,040


232
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,760
♫  Under the flower lanterns that are cherry blossom pink  ♫

233
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,990
♫  In the spring with flower scent, what do you think about when you dream of the moon  ♫

234
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,580
♫  To hand you one of my earphones  ♫

235
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,620
♫  I try to get closer to you  ♫

236
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,390
   
 I've come to realize my feelings far too late.  

237
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,340
 Don't take away my freedom to think of you. 

238
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,910
 It's too late. 

239
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,420
 They found a body. 

240
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,220
 He strategically got close to see if I would catch on. 

241
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,610
 Don't get involved with Inaba anymore. It's too dangerous. 

242
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,280
 I will overcome this hardship together with you, Sakura. 

243
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,630
 I want you to fall for me right now. 

244
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,200
 Sakura, the choice is yours. 

245
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,250
 This will mark our first day together. 

246
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,800
 That's all for day one. 

247
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,920
 She's a worthy opponent.
