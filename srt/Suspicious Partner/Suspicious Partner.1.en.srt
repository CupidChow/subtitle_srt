1
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,020
I can write this
just like my cover letter, right?

2
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,090
(Eun Bong Hee)

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,859
I've seen it a lot, but this is
my first time writing one.

4
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:00,229
When I was young, I...

5
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,899
(When I was young, I...)

6
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,540
("My Dream Job")

7
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,959
Oh, goodness. My back hurts.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,590
Come here. This way.
Excuse us.

9
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,390
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

10
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:28,890
- I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

11
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,260
- Hurry.
- I'm glad we got a seat.

12
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,900
Goodness.

13
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,240
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,479
Was it you?

15
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,479
Excuse me?

16
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:27,189
I meet someone like you at least
once every 10 times on a subway.

17
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,490
It's nice to meet you.

18
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,159
We have met before?

19
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,729
- Do you know me?
- Yes, I do know you very well.

20
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,159
Thanks to you, I have
a trauma of perverts.

21
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,199
- What?
- He's a pervert?

22
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,930
- Gosh, seriously?
- Is he a pervert?

23
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,530
- I can't believe him.
- What a shame.

24
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,599
Do you really think I'm a pervert?

25
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,340
- Look.
- I'm looking.

26
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,639
Who do you think I am?

27
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,909
I think you are a pervert.

28
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,009
Why on earth am I a pervert?

29
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,750
You touched my butt.

30
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,210
You grabbed it, rubbed it,
and it felt disgusting.

31
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,780
Why would I touch your butt?

32
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,120
I should be asking you that.
Why did you touch my butt?

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,620
I didn't touch your butt.

34
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,620
I never touched anything.

35
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,659
What I'm saying is... Do you have
evidence? Why do you think I...

36
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,530
I've seen many white-collar
perverts dressed in suits like you.

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,460
Gosh, how dare you try to fool me?

38
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,129
I'm a pervert assessor.

39
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,300
Pervert assessor, my foot.

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,800
- Look.
- You know what?

41
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,409
The Article 13 of the Act on Special
Cases Concerning Sexual Crimes...

42
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,509
classifies this as sexual harassment
in public spaces.

43
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:27,409
You might face up to a year
in prison or a 3,000-dollar fine.

44
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,909
It's Article 11, not 13.

45
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,750
Get it right before you speak.

46
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,750
See? I totally knew it.

47
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:33,919
You must have done it a lot.

48
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,620
Hey, I wasn't going to tell you
who I am, but...

49
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,020
What is wrong with men?

50
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,919
Do you get aroused when you touch
a random woman's butt?

51
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,930
When did I touch...

52
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,229
Do you enjoy disrobing in public?
Why did you take off your underwear?

53
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,500
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,030
Why would you go to a hotel with
a woman who's not your girlfriend?

55
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,330
Hotel? When did I go to a hotel?

56
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,330
What on earth is wrong with men?

57
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,870
Why are you doing this to me?

58
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,400
Next stop is Sangsu Station.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,509
- Excuse me. Could you please...
- Doors will open on the right.

60
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,840
report him to
the subway security officers?

61
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,340
What? Sure.

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,780
- How disgusting!
- I'm not disgusting.

63
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,120
Why are you avoiding me?

64
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,319
Get out of my way!
I have to get off.

65
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,490
Hey...

66
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,919
You don't need to report me.

67
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,419
Stab me if you want!

68
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,930
I didn't do it.

69
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,259
I really didn't do it.

70
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,230
For goodness' sake.

71
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,529
Gosh, I have to get off too.

72
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,240
Doors are closing.

73
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,709
Please step back.

74
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,970
(Way Out)

75
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,709
I forgot all about it for a few
minutes thanks to that pervert.

76
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,810
The reason I came here.

77
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,800
An anonymous text message I got
an hour ago.

78
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:25,060
(Your boyfriend is
at The Juno Hotel.)

79
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,100
What is this about?

80
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,870
It's very likely to be just a prank.

81
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,680
I should just go in
since I came all the way here.

82
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,509
Bong Hee.

83
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:04,560
I'm sorry I'm late.

84
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,860
It's rush hour, isn't it?

85
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,399
Don't take the Sangsu Station-bound
subway on Line Six at this hour...

86
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,699
if possible.

87
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,339
You could meet a crazy woman there.

88
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,810
- A crazy woman?
- She's totally crazy.

89
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,139
Gosh,
she made me look like a pervert.

90
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,180
Pervert? Who?

91
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,180
Me.

92
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,420
I had no idea.

93
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,920
I didn't know you were into those
things.

94
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,819
I was wrongly accused
of being a pervert...

95
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,389
because of that crazy woman.

96
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,519
How did that happen?

97
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,329
I don't even know. She said she can
identify perverts right away.

98
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,800
- She can identify them?
- Why did she do that to me?

99
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,829
I'm not sure.

100
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,730
Here. Drink up.

101
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,889
Explain. What happened?

102
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,620
There's not much to explain.

103
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,019
I caught you with another woman
at a hotel,

104
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,589
and you have nothing to explain?

105
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,329
It's not what you think.

106
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,459
- Then what is it?
- This is what's important.

107
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,000
I still love you a lot, Bong Hee.

108
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,370
I did make a mistake.

109
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,740
But my feelings for you haven't
changed at all.

110
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,470
- That's what matters.
- How many times have you done it?

111
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,069
- What?
- What you did today.

112
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,410
How many times have you done it?

113
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:25,839
You won't believe me if I say
today was the first time,

114
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,649
and you'll be hurt
if I say I've done it a lot.

115
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:29,610
Why would you ask such a question?

116
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,620
Frankly, I already knew...

117
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:35,389
that something was up.

118
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,519
(Where are you? Are you busy?)

119
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,730
He took longer and longer
to check my messages.

120
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,870
- Was someone else in your car?
- What?

121
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,210
Oh, was there?
I can't really remember.

122
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,580
One day, it started feeling
so awkward to be sitting in his car.

123
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,750
(Hee Jun)

124
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,860
- Hey.
- Did you call me?

125
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,529
And he started taking longer
to call me back.

126
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:21,669
I knew that you've changed...

127
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,730
and that you have another girl.

128
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,440
I was aware of the fact that you're
a total jerk and a womanizer,

129
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,210
but I pretended not to know
about it.

130
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,139
I voluntarily let you fool me.

131
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,409
Anyway, I made a mistake.

132
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,149
I admit it. I'll never do it again.

133
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,750
- Shall I make a vow?
- Do you think this is a joke?

134
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,450
What do you want me to do?

135
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,159
Try to be serious and honest,
you jerk.

136
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,230
- I'm still young, Bong Hee.
- So?

137
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:51,330
Let's say that a nice girl
is outright trying to seduce me.

138
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,299
Not many men can resist
such temptation.

139
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,029
That's why I made such a mistake.

140
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,769
It was just a one-night thing.

141
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:01,539
So you're saying that you couldn't
help it...

142
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,139
because you're a young man, right?

143
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,009
I'm saying I'll never repeat
the mistake again.

144
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,580
You probably want to say
you'll never get caught again.

145
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,549
What you're saying is you'll be
more careful next time, you scum.

146
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,019
I said I'm sorry.

147
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,389
Am I supposed to let it go
just because you're apologizing?

148
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,889
Will your apology make everything
fine?

149
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,629
- Then what? Shall we break up?
- No.

150
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,730
- You need to wait.
- What?

151
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,830
I'll decide whether we should
break up or not.

152
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,600
So you just need to wait
for my verdict.

153
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,539
- Hey, Bong Hee.
- Oh, right.

154
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,500
Let's make things equal first.

155
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,639
I'm still young too, just like you.

156
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,809
I should have one-night stands too.

157
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,779
Let's get even before we talk
about breaking up.

158
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:43,080
You're a woman. How can a woman...

159
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,720
- What does that mean?
- What I'm saying is...

160
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Hey.

161
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,720
I'll sleep with the first guy
I run into on my way home.

162
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,149
- Bong Hee.
- Just watch.

163
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,590
I'll show you.

164
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:03,299
Goodness.

165
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,090
Stop being ridiculous, Eun Bong Hee.

166
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,799
Do you...

167
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:07,629
want to sleep with me?

168
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,039
Sure.

169
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,899
Let's do that.

170
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,909
Thank goodness.
You're young and good-looking.

171
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,580
Am I?

172
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:40,870
When did I touch your butt?

173
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,929
What are you talking about?

174
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,830
Hotel? When did I go to a hotel?

175
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,539
The pervert from the subway?

176
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,940
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

177
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,580
Gosh, wait. Just a second.

178
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,409
Hey, wait! Stop!

179
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,149
Hey, wait.
Stop right there, Bong Hee.

180
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,649
If you leave, I'm really going to
break up with you.

181
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,460
Let's go.

182
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,889
Wait.

183
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:15,299
That little...

184
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,169
My goodness.

185
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:27,950
I'm going to warn you just in case
you thought I was being serious.

186
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,379
I have a black belt in taekwondo.

187
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,080
I'm the one who wants to
seriously warn you.

188
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,649
- About what?
- I'm not...

189
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,549
a pervert.

190
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,590
- You're not?
- I'm not!

191
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,820
Did you drag me out here
to tell me that?

192
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,690
Do you think I actually wanted to
sleep with you?

193
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,590
- Didn't you?
- Then I would've gotten a room.

194
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,759
Why would I come outside?
Can't you use your brain?

195
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,200
That was a bit too mean.
How could you say that?

196
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,269
You think I'm the one who's mean?

197
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:51,340
You called me a pervert without
having any kind of evidence.

198
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,139
For the first time in my life,
I felt so embarrassed,

199
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,809
disgraced, and falsely accused!

200
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,809
If I could have things my way,
I would love to...

201
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,710
do the exact same thing to you.

202
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,980
But I'm a gentleman
so consider yourself lucky.

203
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:09,350
You really didn't touch me?

204
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,590
How many times do I have to
tell you that I didn't?

205
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,629
Anyway, stop accusing
innocent people from now on.

206
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,769
What's wrong with me?

207
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:31,679
And just for your safety,

208
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,549
don't purposely run into
random men from now on.

209
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:37,820
Some of them might actually
want to sleep with you.

210
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,789
My gosh, was I too cool?

211
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,129
Bong Hee!

212
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,970
(Premium Cab)

213
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,970
What? What are you doing?

214
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,669
- What's wrong with you?
- My gosh.

215
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,409
- What do you mean?
- What do you want from me?

216
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,240
Please help me out a little more.

217
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,850
Let's go, sir.

218
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,279
I'm really sorry for everything.
And thank you.

219
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:40,409
Whatever.

220
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,450
I don't want to accept your apology
nor gratitude.

221
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:44,649
I understand.

222
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,250
By the way,

223
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:53,990
I don't normally ask random men
to sleep with me.

224
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,090
I just did it to keep my pride.

225
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,389
You don't need to explain
everything.

226
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:03,000
Do you want to have a drink with me?

227
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,909
I'm not trying to do anything weird.
You just seem very trustworthy.

228
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:11,909
I just want to apologize
and thank you for today.

229
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:13,210
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

230
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:20,779
Sir, please drop me off...

231
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,850
anywhere over there.

232
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,190
Don't sit down.

233
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,819
I already did.

234
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:35,089
Stand up.

235
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:38,730
You're drinking alone, so I'm just
trying to be a nice drinking buddy.

236
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,200
Why do you keep rejecting?

237
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,269
When did I give you the permission
to feel sorry for me?

238
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,470
Normally, I'd be the one
feeling sorry for you.

239
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,599
You little...

240
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,539
(Taekwondo License)

241
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,539
Why aren't you leaving?

242
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,910
Should I leave?

243
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,160
I think...

244
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,490
you left this on purpose.

245
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,769
My gosh.

246
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,470
I'm so glad to see you.

247
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,910
Not a single person
called nor texted me.

248
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,349
I was feeling like an outsider
and so lonely.

249
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:33,680
I only met you today,
but I'm so glad to see you.

250
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,390
I guess you really did
leave this behind on purpose.

251
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,960
I could've done that.

252
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,329
I was just going to give you
this and...

253
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,000
What? Wait.

254
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,970
Cheers.

255
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:01,650
My gosh.

256
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,609
Do you want to sleep with me?

257
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,009
Sure.

258
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Let's do that.

259
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,720
(Soju)

260
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,349
No, wait.

261
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:47,319
You said your limit was 1 bottle.
This is your 3rd bottle now.

262
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,829
My limit is one bottle.

263
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,430
But only when I drink hard liquor.

264
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,269
My goodness, what is this?

265
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:02,910
Wait.

266
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,529
Do you live here?

267
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,069
Of course not.
I'm just taking a rest.

268
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,309
Just tell me where you live.

269
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,279
I don't have a house.

270
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,410
It's so expensive to buy a house
in Seoul.

271
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,710
I'll buy one when I start earning.

272
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,589
Wait.

273
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,730
This is nice.

274
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,700
Let's go.

275
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,670
My gosh, let go of me.

276
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,730
Did I make the first move?

277
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:31,490
What should I do? What am I supposed
to do in this kind of situation?

278
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:41,670
Should I say hi? Should I apologize?
Should I thank him?

279
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:17,470
Oh, my.

280
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:20,769
I really hate myself.

281
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,180
(I'm sorry.)

282
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,900
No missed calls.

283
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,730
No messages.

284
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,369
How could you not call me even once?

285
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,170
Even if we weren't
in a relationship,

286
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,609
you should've been worried about
me in a situation like yesterday's.

287
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,410
What good will it do?

288
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:06,920
He is the worst.

289
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:11,660
Did you sleep with her?

290
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,089
31 missed calls.

291
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,490
You slept with her, didn't you?

292
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,259
I had 31 missed calls
from 1 particular person.

293
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,430
Hey.

294
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,569
I really wanted to know.

295
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:24,230
I was wondering what happened after
you two left like that yesterday.

296
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,140
I couldn't get a wink of sleep.

297
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,509
Did you spend a passionate night?

298
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,680
Did you know her from before?

299
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,349
I don't think you met her
for the first time yesterday.

300
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,349
Well... That's a bit hard to say.

301
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,250
So did you sleep with her?

302
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,450
I don't know.

303
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:46,559
Hey, I'm just really curious.

304
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,289
You have never had any physical
or emotional exchanges...

305
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,400
with women after Yoo Jung.

306
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,730
Goodness. Look at you now.

307
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,500
You slept with her, didn't you?

308
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,799
I think it's time we hang up.
Bye.

309
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,809
(End of call)

310
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:30,859
That feeling...

311
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,269
I will be the one deciding
if we break up or not.

312
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,130
So just wait for my verdict.

313
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:39,839
- Hey, Bong Hee.
- Oh, right.

314
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,210
Let's make things equal first.

315
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,440
I'm still young too, just like you.

316
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,339
I should have one-night stands too.

317
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,609
Let's get even before we talk
about breaking up.

318
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:54,420
- Bong Hee.
- Just watch.

319
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,849
I'll show you.

320
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:12,299
I don't care who it is. I want
someone to take me away from here.

321
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,710
No, I want to disappear forever.

322
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,109
At that moment,

323
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:20,279
I knew her desperate feeling.

324
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:34,859
Do you...

325
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,630
want to sleep with me?

326
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,930
Sure.

327
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,759
Let's do that.

328
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,630
I've done a useless thing.

329
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,670
This is bothersome. Gosh.

330
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,140
You are here early.

331
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Hey.

332
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,809
Did something happen?

333
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,079
What? No.

334
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:00,849
Oh, I met Ji Wook yesterday.

335
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:02,619
He won't resign his job
as a prosecutor.

336
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,490
His dream is to die as a prosecutor.

337
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:07,019
Besides, I work here.
He won't work here.

338
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,690
Are you still not friends?

339
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,130
I'm going to take on a few more
pro bono cases.

340
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:15,930
(Pro bono: Providing free legal
services for the public good.)

341
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:19,799
Mr. Ji. Are you planning
to run for office?

342
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,670
That's right. I should
congratulate Ji Wook.

343
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,009
For what?

344
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,779
Korean Bar Association conducted
an evaluation of prosecutors.

345
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,819
Reviewing this year's investigations
and trials, the association...

346
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:36,619
released a list
of 10 best prosecutors...

347
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:40,059
and selected the worst prosecutors.
They plan to hand over...

348
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,430
the lists to the Minister of Justice
and the Public Prosecutor General.

349
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,029
Prosecutors are reviewed
by the same criteria...

350
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:48,130
and it's divided
into six categories.

351
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:49,500
Each category was...

352
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,400
- graded on a scale of 1 to 5.
- Great. Mr. No, you are the best.

353
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,769
What are you doing
this early morning?

354
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,640
Chief and Deputy.
What brings you to my office?

355
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,180
Gosh, you are the pride of
our district's prosecutor's office.

356
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,339
- I am?
- No.

357
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,009
You are the worst prosecutor.

358
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,319
- That's great.
- What?

359
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,019
- What?
- That little...

360
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,920
I'm honored. The fact that
lawyers hate me...

361
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,630
proves that I do my job well
as a prosecutor.

362
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,890
You are clueless.

363
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,700
You're missing the point.

364
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
You are a prosecutor who doesn't
care about human rights,

365
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,769
take coercive measures,
and are biased.

366
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,539
You're a prosecutor who is
associated with every negative...

367
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,000
word you can think of.

368
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,940
I really hate criminals.

369
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,539
I despise the attorneys who defend
them and claim their human rights.

370
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,009
And those people don't like me?

371
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,410
That's the best form of honor.

372
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,950
Do you think
only attorneys don't like you?

373
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,119
We don't like you too.

374
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,420
Hey, look.

375
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,789
How come there is no single letter
thanking your service on the board?

376
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,759
Other prosecutors receive
so many of those letters.

377
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:52,059
"Thank you, Prosecutor."

378
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,430
"Thanks to you,
I can lead a new life."

379
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,170
How can your board be so clean?

380
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,769
Did you put up
a new wallpaper yesterday?

381
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,240
Dear Prosecutor No Ji Wook.

382
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,339
Thank you so much.

383
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:09,910
This is my first time writing
a letter in my 70 years of life.

384
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,819
I am Jang Young Gam from Jincheon,
North Chungcheong Province.

385
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,619
Last time, you stuck
a drill in my land...

386
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:18,819
(Prosecutor No Ji Wook)

387
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:29,769
(Mom)

388
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:31,630
When did she change this?

389
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,900
- Hello?
- Ji Wook.

390
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,339
Chairman Byun told me.

391
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:39,380
You were selected
as the worst prosecutor?

392
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,380
I'm hanging up now.

393
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,180
Gosh, he's so cold and stubborn.

394
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:50,920
He was selected because
he plays by the book.

395
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,119
I heard that's not how they select
the worst prosecutors.

396
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,329
What do you know about that?

397
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,359
My daughter is in a legal profession
too, so I heard a few things.

398
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,700
I see some actions too.

399
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,730
Your daughter is in a legal
profession?

400
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,940
Didn't I tell you?

401
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:09,240
She's in her first year of Judicial
Research and Training Institute.

402
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,269
Why are there so many
of them these days?

403
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,910
Prosecutors, judges, and lawyers.

404
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:17,049
Anyone even insignificant
can be in a law profession.

405
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,880
How insignificant is he?

406
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,420
- What?
- You said insignificant people...

407
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,720
can become law enforcement officers.

408
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,220
- So how insignificant is your son?
- Hey.

409
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,690
My name isn't "Hey".
It's Director Park.

410
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:30,990
People with manners call me that.

411
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,660
I don't care what your title is.

412
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:37,170
Hey, you can't compare my son,

413
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,900
Prosecutor No,
to those insignificant people.

414
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:44,309
He was different from birth,
you know?

415
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,240
Even before his first day,
he walked and ran.

416
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,339
He even rode on a horse.

417
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,750
He learned Korean all by himself
watching TV shows...

418
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,950
when he was 3
or 3 and a half years old.

419
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:57,720
When he was five years old,
he played instruments perfectly.

420
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,789
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

421
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,259
Hey!

422
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,069
Hee Jun, that jerk
didn't even call me once.

423
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:16,109
Everything is a total mess.

424
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:20,640
I can't even remember if I slept
with the guy from the subway...

425
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,710
I heard you slept with someone.

426
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,849
You had a steamy night
with a stranger.

427
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,150
How did you know...

428
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,950
Did I make it that obvious?

429
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,119
I heard Hee Jun dumped you because
you had a one-night stand.

430
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,190
I didn't do it.
Hee Jun is the one who...

431
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,759
The word has already spread
through the group chat.

432
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,329
(- Is that why she got dumped?
- I'm so embarrassed of her.)

433
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:44,869
(Is that why she got dumped?)

434
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:46,869
Did she get dumped?
Did she get dumped?

435
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,599
(How can she cheat
on the district attorney's son?)

436
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,039
Gosh, this is crazy.

437
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,349
We're practically public officials
as we get paid with tax money.

438
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,579
Instead of being an example for
others, you're enjoying...

439
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,420
a promiscuous sex life.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

440
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,720
Anyway, those who have
one-night stands...

441
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,130
or go to brothels
should be doomed for life.

442
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,369
How did she know
that we went to those places?

443
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,099
She's not talking about us,
so be quiet.

444
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,299
It wasn't about us?

445
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,240
You have no shame.

446
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,640
Why is it that I have
to feel ashamed for you?

447
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,109
Stop it, Ji Hye.

448
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:27,980
Why? Are you guilty?

449
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:29,779
It's not like that.

450
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:31,910
Stop going on about it if you don't
even know what happened.

451
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,950
I can do whatever I want.

452
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:41,890
- Pork bulgogi with rice.
- Yes.

453
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,390
That's the best.

454
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:09,889
4, 3, 2, 1.

455
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,119
Ready, go.

456
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,949
Hee Jun,
we're really through...

457
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:16,349
Remember that day at the hotel?

458
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,989
I dumped you.

459
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:20,090
Things between us ended that day.

460
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,190
Well...
I was going to say it first...

461
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,929
I'm so disappointed in you,
Bong Hee.

462
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,170
Gosh.

463
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,440
Goodness, how can he have
the nerve to turn it on me?

464
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,380
Hey, you jerk!

465
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,579
What on earth.

466
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:10,840
It's so dark, just like my life.

467
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,739
Hey, this is why your boyfriend
dumped you. Do you know that?

468
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,579
You're such a moron!

469
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,750
Life is a real game, you idiot!

470
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:21,019
Hey!

471
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,289
I think he hit me.

472
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:28,989
You got hit? By whom? Who hit you?

473
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:32,329
Well, I had a dream and...

474
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,300
No. I can't figure out
whether it's a dream or not...

475
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,300
I knew it. I'd believe you more
if you say you punched someone.

476
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,909
When did you get home?

477
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,869
Let me see.

478
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:49,949
You were burning up with a fever.

479
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,179
You don't remember me waking you up
to feed you medicine, do you?

480
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,320
You did?

481
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,989
I'm fine now.

482
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,260
Mom.

483
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,690
What happened?

484
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:05,329
Nothing happened.

485
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,760
You can't fool me.

486
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,599
I did very badly on the exam.

487
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:14,769
That's why you got sick?
You?

488
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,639
When your classmates
went to the hospital a dozen times,

489
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,440
you didn't even see a doctor once.

490
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:23,150
Everyone in our neighborhood told me
that you're as strong as steel.

491
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,019
What are you talking about?
Studying is really hard.

492
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,519
I thought I just had
to pass the bar exam,

493
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,489
but I have to study even harder now.

494
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,789
It's never-ending.

495
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,420
You're right.

496
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:40,000
Nothing has a definite end.
Everything is never-ending.

497
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:43,769
Is Hee Jun giving you a hard time?

498
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,539
I dumped him.

499
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,309
Good. It's only right to dump
guys as soon as possible...

500
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:55,849
if they bring tears to your eyes.

501
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,719
Mom.

502
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:08,920
I'm going to focus
on studying and working hard.

503
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,230
I'll become a high-rolling attorney,
so that you can live a better life.

504
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,369
I should make you write a pledge.

505
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:18,929
Shall I notarize it for you?

506
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,940
That'd be great.

507
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,239
"That'd be great."

508
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,570
Gosh, this is nice.

509
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,650
(3 months later)

510
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:37,989
Yes, it's probationary.

511
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,820
Yes, I told you I'll receive
two-month training as a prosecutor,

512
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,360
judge, and attorney.
I'm starting as a prosecutor.

513
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:47,199
Yes. Right.

514
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,030
Okay. You too, Mom.

515
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,769
(Sunho District Prosecutor's Office)

516
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,739
It's crazy that we have to spend
this beautiful spring day here.

517
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:00,840
- Did you manage to sober up?
- Do I reek of alcohol?

518
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,150
- Alcohol isn't what's important...
- Hello.

519
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:04,280
Hey, you.

520
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,420
Look at that.
They're always together now.

521
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,389
They're testing the waters.
That's what they said.

522
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,260
You guys didn't know? They've been
like that for a while now.

523
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,989
What are you going to do?

524
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,400
Bong Hee, shall I go out with you?
What do you say?

525
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:20,900
Hey, I'll see you later.

526
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
She rejected me.

527
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,440
Just like that, I became a girl who
got dumped after a one-night stand.

528
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:35,010
It was almost impossible to stop
the rumor because it already spread.

529
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,909
Hence, I decided to actually
become a crazy woman.

530
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:39,920
- Isn't it so funny?
- Yes.

531
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,519
Excuse me!

532
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:49,690
Watch me cursing you

533
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,889
You'd better remember

534
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:55,360
Because I'll be sure to kill you

535
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:00,900
Gosh, that crazy...

536
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,119
(Prosecutor No Ji Wook)

537
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,260
It's time to forget
being the crazy woman.

538
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,630
As of this moment,
I'm starting afresh.

539
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,170
(Suggestion box)

540
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,869
It's nice to meet you all.

541
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:36,010
I'm the new probationary
judicial officer, Eun Bong Hee.

542
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,539
I look forward to working with you.

543
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:40,539
The new probationary
officer seems very enthusiastic.

544
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,960
Do you want to sleep with me?

545
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,960
Let's do that.

546
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,889
This world is a scary place!

547
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,860
Get your act together, seriously!

548
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,469
Hey!

549
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,469
So you're new.

550
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:15,510
You look familiar though.

551
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,619
Well, I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

552
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,150
Do you take the Line Six subway
often by any chance?

553
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,250
No, I usually take buses, walk
or bike.

554
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,619
I see. Do you go to hotels
from time to time?

555
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,230
No, I usually go to motels...

556
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:31,130
I usually go to motels.

557
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,159
She said she goes to motels.

558
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,260
Then why did you run off
in the morning?

559
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,869
Then was I supposed to
eat breakfast with...

560
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:41,940
I'm not sure. I don't know
what you're talking about.

561
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,110
Stop being so brazen.

562
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,670
You're worse than the suspects
I've interrogated.

563
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:49,949
Then is it okay to fool me like that
when you already know who I am?

564
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,210
I was just testing you.

565
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,079
I was testing your honesty,
transparency, memory, and so on.

566
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,019
- I do remember one thing.
- What is it?

567
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,920
There was this pervert
who touch my...

568
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,460
I told you that it wasn't me.

569
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,030
My goodness.
I never said it was you.

570
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:12,030
I've never seen someone
so ungrateful like you.

571
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,670
I do feel grateful,

572
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,570
but you don't really need to talk
as if you did something so grand.

573
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,239
I'm actually wondering if you know
that I'm your mentor...

574
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,940
and you're my mentee.

575
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,449
Yes, I already know that
I'm done for.

576
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,650
Since I'm already done for,

577
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,119
let me ask you a question.

578
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,119
Go ahead.

579
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,960
I'd like to ask you in private.

580
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,829
Just ask me.

581
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,929
Unlike you, I'm an honest person
who doesn't like to lie.

582
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:43,030
Did we sleep together or not?

583
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:52,510
Don't get mistaken.
She's not talking about us.

584
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,780
Don't write that down.

585
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:55,780
I can see that you're really honest.

586
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:58,179
I have one more question.
You hit me, didn't you?

587
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,579
- You hit me on both cheeks.
- I never hit you!

588
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,190
- Let's not spread rumors.
- I'll try my best.

589
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,329
What rumor?

590
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:15,300
You must be mistaken.
I never said such a thing.

591
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,199
- Did something happen to Ji Wook?
- No.

592
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:19,769
My gosh.

593
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:22,469
I told you. Nothing happened to him.

594
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,670
Plus, you already know that
you're not allowed to enter...

595
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,539
unless it's anything serious.

596
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:27,579
Ouch.

597
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,809
My gosh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

598
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,510
Don't ever apologize to him.

599
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,550
What? Of course I should apologize.

600
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,750
I'm your mentor.
Shouldn't you listen to me?

601
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,820
It's been a while.

602
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,190
I don't think we had any cases
that needed Lawyer Ji. Am I right?

603
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,530
But why is he in front of me
right now?

604
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,730
My goodness. This is why
you're so unpopular.

605
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:52,329
By the way, I voted you as the
best prosecutor, not the worst.

606
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:53,369
I'm being serious.

607
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:56,369
I'm going to introduce her to
the chief and deputy.

608
00:43:57,139 --> 00:43:58,139
Follow me.

609
00:43:58,639 --> 00:43:59,639
See you later, sir.

610
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,880
You got us in trouble.

611
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:16,730
Apparently, I was the craziest girl
at our training institute.

612
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:19,760
People think I'm crazier now because
they think I seduced my mentor.

613
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,099
This is all thanks to you.

614
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:24,030
I was already assessed as the
worst prosecutor.

615
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:26,739
But now, I've become worse than that
because they think I'm a pervert...

616
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:29,300
who touched your bottom and
slapped you, thanks to you.

617
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:30,440
Is that so?

618
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,039
So tell me.
Did we sleep together or not?

619
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:34,739
I really can't remember anything.

620
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,449
A woman seduces me and
begs me to stay with her.

621
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,920
On top of that,
I had a couple drinks that night,

622
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,090
and I'm not exactly a saint.

623
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,090
- I guess we slept together.
- I'm not a saint,

624
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,860
but I do have eyes that
work perfectly fine.

625
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:52,530
To me, you're not really
that attractive.

626
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,059
So what happened?

627
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
I don't know.

628
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,769
It's not that heavy, right?

629
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,650
Of course not.

630
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,250
It's not heavy at all.

631
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:18,590
Let me tell you.
There are two kinds of mentors.

632
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:22,489
The first kind is a fair mentor
who only gives his or her mentee...

633
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:24,590
just the right amount of workload.
It sounds nice right?

634
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,000
The second kind is the worst you
could ever imagine.

635
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,969
They're the kind who overloads
their mentee with all sorts of work.

636
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,039
If you get a mentor like that,
that'll be the end of everything.

637
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:37,070
They ask their mentees
to do everything for them.

638
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,739
Bong Hee, where are you looking?

639
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:45,510
Listen to me. Don't worry, okay?

640
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,119
Most of the mentors are
pretty normal like the first kind.

641
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,519
The worst ones are really rare.

642
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:52,050
I just wanted to tell you this.

643
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:08,170
I can do it.

644
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,449
Hello.

645
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,619
I'm calling from the Sunho
District Prosecutor's Office.

646
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:26,760
No, I'm not voice phishing.

647
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,090
You need to come to the
District Prosecutor's Office.

648
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,670
But keep in mind that the worst ones
are still very logical.

649
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:43,610
Love.

650
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,940
I'm showing you my love and care
by allowing you to...

651
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,510
broaden your experience.

652
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,719
Thank you.

653
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:55,019
Of course, you should thank me.

654
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:57,719
Until now, you've been working on
suspect interrogation,

655
00:46:57,719 --> 00:46:59,619
but from now on, you can also work
on learning the Consensus Model.

656
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:00,989
Sounds good?

657
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,159
- All right.
- Are you happy?

658
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:04,929
Do your best.

659
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,070
Why did you go into
the women's bath naked?

660
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:18,239
I don't know. I can't hear you.
I don't remember.

661
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:20,380
I know you can hear me, and I know
you remember everything.

662
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,909
I don't know. I can't hear you.
I don't remember.

663
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:24,550
- Sir!
- I don't know.

664
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,179
I can't hear you. I don't remember.

665
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:27,250
Please.

666
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:29,989
Do you call yourself a human?
How can you do this as my friend?

667
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:32,219
How can you secretly date
my younger sister?

668
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:34,260
Why can't I date her? I love her.

669
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,989
Excuse me. Excuse me.

670
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:38,230
You guys both got charged
with assault.

671
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,400
You shouldn't be fighting here!

672
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Let go of me!

673
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,900
- You little...
- Let go.

674
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,929
- Let go of me.
- You let go.

675
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,900
- I grabbed you first.
- Let go!

676
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,940
You should let go of me first!
Let go!

677
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,010
Excuse me. You shouldn't be
doing this here.

678
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,110
- You little...
- Excuse me.

679
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,280
- Please stop!
- Get out of my face!

680
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,250
- Let go of my hair!
- My goodness.

681
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:16,929
I'm not done yet.

682
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,599
Hello.

683
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,309
Thank you for admitting
to your crime.

684
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,449
But then again, you got caught in
the act, and you're an ex-convict.

685
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,519
- Yes.
- What is wrong with everyone?

686
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,719
What good comes from
being a pervert?

687
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,530
- But haven't we...
- I'm sure...

688
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,329
I've seen you somewhere.

689
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:50,400
Excuse me.

690
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:54,500
Could you please report him to
the subway security officers?

691
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,900
Sure.

692
00:48:56,739 --> 00:48:59,710
It was you. You're the one
who touched me, aren't you?

693
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:05,750
I didn't know you were a prosecutor.

694
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,619
What a coincidence.

695
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,389
My gosh, because of you...

696
00:49:12,389 --> 00:49:13,960
This is all because of you.

697
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,690
You're a habitual offender,
so you're going to go to prison.

698
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:23,400
But the judge never really sent me
to prison.

699
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,329
I always got fined instead.

700
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:27,440
Let's see about that.

701
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:33,280
I don't mind going to prison.

702
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:38,750
To be honest, I think...

703
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,920
I've witnessed a murder incident.
I'm in danger because of that.

704
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,219
I'm serious.

705
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:06,070
That day, like any other day,
I was...

706
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:08,840
observing the stars.

707
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,179
Sure you were.

708
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,280
But...

709
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,250
That's it.

710
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,980
Go on.

711
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:43,449
Ever since that day, I can't sleep
at night because I'm worried that...

712
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,280
he might come to kill me.

713
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,050
- Mr. Bang.
- Yes?

714
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:50,989
Please take him out of here.

715
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,559
If you ever get arrested again
for touching anyone...

716
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,559
or peeking through other people's
windows, I won't let you go.

717
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,530
Get out of here.

718
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:09,539
My gosh.

719
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,070
My goodness.

720
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,949
Goodness gracious.

721
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,590
What an ugly sight.

722
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,230
Watch me cursing you

723
00:51:32,929 --> 00:51:38,199
You'd better remember
because I'll be sure to kill you.

724
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:43,940
- Can you stop it?
- Why?

725
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,309
Is singing banned in this country?

726
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:49,179
I know that you are singing this
on purpose, so we hear you.

727
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,610
By the way, I heard...

728
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:53,750
you threw yourself on the prosecutor
to make a good impression.

729
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,280
What right do you have
to criticize us?

730
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:00,019
That's enough.
Her trick didn't even work.

731
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,659
Try to wash your hair regularly.

732
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,360
Let's go.

733
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,760
Ms. Eun, I've been looking for you.

734
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,500
I was about to go in.
Give me a minute.

735
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:17,110
I... I missed you.

736
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,650
It's only been couple of minutes.

737
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:31,920
Sorry?

738
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,590
Ms. Eun, you are...

739
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,460
How should I say this...

740
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:43,059
You are dirty, yet beautiful.

741
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,369
What?

742
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:50,070
Do people know...

743
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:52,309
that...

744
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,440
I...

745
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,380
fell for you at first sight?

746
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:58,710
What?

747
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:18,130
You are pretty.

748
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,239
You are dirty, but pretty.

749
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,210
Let's go.

750
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:34,880
Gosh.

751
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:38,349
You are so dirty.

752
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,460
Goodness.

753
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,989
I don't know what I'm doing.

754
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,000
Singing a song of curse isn't how
you take your revenge on your ex.

755
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,139
Just ignore him.

756
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:00,239
Be cool and live a good life.

757
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:04,079
Chew it.

758
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,360
What is it?

759
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,760
Why...

760
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:20,429
Why are you so good to me
suddenly? You're scaring me.

761
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,429
Did you really fall for me
at first sight?

762
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:26,130
I'm sorry. You probably didn't.
That's for sure.

763
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,940
Eun Bong Hee.
At least wash your face.

764
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,469
Wake up.

765
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:05,869
Hey, wake up!

766
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:10,610
When people are cheated on,
people are deluded.

767
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:13,650
They think they made a mistake
or it is their fault.

768
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,219
They think if they become
dull or boring.

769
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,150
They think it's something they did.

770
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,420
I understand what you are going
through. I was in your place once,

771
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:23,889
but...

772
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:27,900
It's not right. We didn't do
anything wrong.

773
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,599
It was them who betrayed us
and did wrong.

774
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:52,889
He didn't slap me after all.

775
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,670
He was betrayed just like I was.

776
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:13,610
That's why he was nice to me.

777
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,510
Ms. Eun.

778
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,579
I wasn't looking at you.

779
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:21,650
I know. You can go home
and sleep at your house tonight.

780
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:24,050
- I'm fine.
- Go take a shower.

781
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,190
I'd like to work in a clean-looking
environment free of smells.

782
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,119
I see.

783
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,500
You know that sometimes,

784
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:38,300
I find you so annoying that
I want to get rid of you, don't you?

785
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,070
I feel the same way.

786
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,940
If I manage to...

787
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,610
When this period as a probationary
judicial officer is over...

788
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,219
without you getting killed
with my hands during this period,

789
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,389
I'll treat you a meal.

790
00:56:57,389 --> 00:57:00,050
If you get through this without
killing anyone, I'll compliment you.

791
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:02,519
Can't you take a joke?

792
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,090
I meant your ex-boyfriend, not me.

793
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,360
You went around and sang a song
how you will kill him.

794
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,300
Stop singing that song
and threatening him.

795
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:12,630
- Yes.
- I am a harsh prosecutor.

796
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,369
Please don't come to my office
as a suspect.

797
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:17,670
- Yes.
- You're good at following orders.

798
00:57:23,409 --> 00:57:27,380
Thank you for helping me
get back at my ex-boyfriend.

799
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:29,079
Work hard if you want
to return the favor.

800
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:31,289
Sure, sure.

801
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:47,000
- Are you going home now?
- It's none of your business.

802
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:52,070
Is it hard to get over me?

803
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:53,579
- What?
- You...

804
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:56,639
I know that you are flirting with
the prosecutor to get back at me.

805
00:57:57,409 --> 00:57:58,409
What are you talking about?

806
00:57:58,750 --> 00:57:59,710
Hey, Bong Hee.

807
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:03,019
You know what? That's right.
I did it to get back at you,

808
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,920
but I am not doing that now.

809
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:08,489
You are just a drag of my numerous
past memories.

810
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:09,889
You're full of yourself. Stop it.

811
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,429
Right, I have some stuff
that belong to you at home.

812
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,670
Should I throw them out or will you
pick them up? Think about it.

813
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,300
Don't deny your feelings, Bong Hee.

814
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:24,710
What a nonsense.

815
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,079
When I was young, I wanted
to be someone greater.

816
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,679
However...

817
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:52,769
Gosh, this is refreshing.

818
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:03,280
I don't think I turned out that bad.

819
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,849
My opinion will change soon though.

820
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:30,409
What is this? A blackout?

821
00:59:37,579 --> 00:59:38,579
Can you ring it up?

822
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,679
Since the power is out,
you can only pay with cash.

823
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:43,349
All right.

824
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:46,619
It's 17 dollars.

825
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,760
This cash transaction
that left no record.

826
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,900
The surveillance cameras
that stopped due to the blackout.

827
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,860
The part-timer
who doesn't remember me.

828
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,369
No one will remember me.

829
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:09,809
Beer, beer.

830
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,380
Gosh!

831
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:19,719
Hee Jun?

832
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,929
Hey, Hee Jun. Hey!

833
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,789
What...

834
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:18,309
Therefore, my alibi...

835
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:19,909
has disappeared.

836
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:25,349
(Jang Hee Jun, who was
my ex-boyfriend...)

837
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,929
I'm pretty sure I told you...

838
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:41,139
not to show up before me
as a suspect.

839
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:42,139
I...

840
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:44,739
I'm a ruthless prosecutor.

841
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:46,210
I grew up...

842
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,409
and became a murder suspect.

843
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:00,519
(Love in Trouble)

844
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:02,389
You ended up killing him.

845
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:03,829
Come here. How could you...

846
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,030
Did you kill Jang Hee Jun?

847
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,400
What's important is that
Eun Bong Hee is the culprit.

848
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,730
I really didn't do it.

849
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:09,900
Things like that don't matter.

850
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,030
You're not going to give in?

851
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,400
You want to convict her
and lock her up?

852
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,539
What's your relationship with her?

853
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:16,539
- It's fate.
- I trust you.

854
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:18,239
The fact that you trust me...

855
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:19,739
and that you're on my side.

856
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:22,039
Hence, I demand a penalty.

857
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:24,510
According to Article 250 of
the Criminal Code, she should be...

858
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:28,050
sentenced to 15 years in prison
for the murder case.
