Cut, kill the gold

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,080
It's rare to kill the gold so fast

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,080
But he is faster

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,560

What are you hesitating about?

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,000
It is said that the one who gets the nine Yin Manuals is invincible

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,800
After the death of the emperor for ten years

56
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,720
Nine Yin Manuals are re-released

57
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,600

66
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,120

68
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,240
If you ruin this face for me

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,800
I will kill you

70
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,320
Come on, come on

71
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,440
Slow down

72
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,920

73
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,160
Today is a good day

74
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,040
I found you a good master

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,080
Also your old acquaintance

76
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,320
You just take care of me

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
So everyone is happy

78
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,160
Otherwise

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,800
Don't blame me for being cruel

80
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,480
Don't take this

81
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,680
If you hurt the guests

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,800
That's not good

83
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,400

84
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,360

86
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,040

87
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,480
Jingwen

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,020
Lost

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,720
Old brother

90
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,680
Quack

91
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,740
you think of people when they are away?

92
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,760

93
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,820

94
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,100

95
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,460
So you've been in this Mairuohua Entertainment for ten years?

96
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,940
Almost.

97
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,440
Are there такой girls

98
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,520

99
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,740
Yeah.

100
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,080
I don't know.

101
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,320
If I see you like this,

102
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,760
I'll be heartbroken.

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,560
Shameless.

104
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,200
You!

105
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
It's a long time.

106
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,160
Just take it.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,160
Are you afraid that I'll kill you?

108
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,720
I'll wait.

109
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,040

110
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,360

this is a gift from me.

112
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,120
I'll give it to you as a gift.

113
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,240
My heart is dirty.

114
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,600
You like it.

115
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,920
I'll leave it to you.

116
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,440
You're the one who's getting the better of me.

117
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,200
Come on.

118
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,280

I'll be gentle.

121
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,920
I won't hurt you.

122
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,160
You want to run away?

123
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,000
No.

124
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,360

I'm afraid.

135
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,920
Have you seen a red-clad woman?

136
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
No.

137
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240

She's in there.

143
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Search carefully.

144
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
She's going to be alive.

145
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
You're wasting your time.

146
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
I'll kill you.

147
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Go.

158
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Go.

159
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
The hero is good at martial arts.

160
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Ruohua is of a low level.

161
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Please take me as your disciple.

162
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Jingqi.

163
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
I'll teach you three moves.

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Look.

165
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,480

166
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Okay.

167
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
Have you learned it?

168
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
I...

169
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
I'll give you a kind of inner strength.

170
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
I wish you to achieve your dream.

171
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
You bitch.

172
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
How dare you come back?

173
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Qiu Yunhai.

174
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Come out.

175
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Xiao He.

176
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Little bitch.

177
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
You came to me yourself.

178
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Don't blame me for being rude to you.

179
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
Little bitch.

180
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
You've learned your lesson.

181
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Come with me.

182
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
Hurry.

183
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Don't hit me.

184
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
You hit me so hard.

185
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
What a pity.

186
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
Little bitch.

187
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
Okay.

188
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
You don't know how to practice martial arts.

189
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Get up.

190
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Little bitch.

191
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,480
I really thought you could do it in one night.

192
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
How dare you hit me?

193
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Stop.

194
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,480
How dare you bully a weak girl in broad daylight?

195
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
You're so annoying.

196
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
You can ask me to stop.

197
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
I can change it for myself.

198
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,480
I know how to practice martial arts.

199
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Okay.

200
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
I'll love you

201
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
as a lady.

202
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
You're pretty strong.

203
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
I like to ride horses.

204
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Hit me.

205
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
You'll be fine.

206
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Don't be afraid.

207
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
You're not afraid?

208
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,480
No.

209
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
Are you okay?

210
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
I'm fine.

211
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Let's go.

212
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Wait.

213
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Let's go together.

214
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
Come.

215
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Come.

216
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Come.

217
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Master,

218
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
you used your inner power to fight for your wife.

219
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
You used your inner power to fight for your wife

220
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
to resist the coldness in your body.

221
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
It's not a long-lasting solution.

222
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Is the Lie Yang Mind Skill

223
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
in conflict with your original inner power?

224
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
The Nine-Change Yin Wheel Pill

225
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
makes your wife's body cold

226
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
and can't produce the yang energy.

227
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Master Xu keeps using the Lie Yang Mind Skill

228
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
to inject the yang energy

229
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
and neutralize it.

230
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
It's not a good idea

231
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
to use the inner power

232
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
to fight for your wife.

233
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
The Lie Yang Mind Skill

234
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
neutralizes and neutralizes.

235
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
It can only be solved for a while.

236
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
If it goes on like this,

237
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
you'll be in trouble.

238
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
I know.

239
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
But what can I do?

240
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Master Xu,

241
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
please take me as your disciple.

242
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Get up, Miss.

243
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
My family members

244
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
were killed by the bandits.

245
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
I'm the only one left in the family.

246
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
I must learn the Lie Yang Mind Skill

247
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
and avenge my family members.

248
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Please.

249
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
Please take me as your disciple.

250
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Are you done?

251
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Yes.

252
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
I feel sorry for you

253
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
for all the hardships.

254
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
But I can't take you as my disciple.

255
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
You may leave.

256
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Master.

257
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
That girl

258
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
wanted to take you as her disciple.

259
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
You don't want her?

260
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
There are so many poor people in the world.

261
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
They can't manage it.

262
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
That's true.

263
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
After so many people

264
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
and so many things,

265
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
we're just leaves in the wind.

266
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Of course, I'm the lucky one.

267
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
I'm sorry

268
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
for what happened to you.

269
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
I'm sorry

270
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
for what happened to you.

271
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
When I was in trouble,

272
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
she came to protect me

273
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
without any reason.

274
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
I'm so sorry.

275
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
You've been away from the coffin

276
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
for half a year.

277
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
She's the same age as me.

278
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
She's not a woman.

279
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
That's true.

280
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
I know your personality.

281
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
I won't talk about her.

282
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
I'm sorry.

283
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
I'm sorry.

284
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Brother.

285
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
I'll die for nothing.

286
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Brother.

287
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Brother.

288
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Come in.

289
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Do you know

290
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
that person is Huang Yaoshi?

291
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
He was one of the five best

292
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
in the world when he was in the mountain.

293
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Then why did he

294
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
meet Mei Ruohua?

295
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
I don't know either.

296
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
So

297
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
that night,

298
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
he met Huang Yaoshi.

299
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
I saw him vomiting blood.

300
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
He must have been hurt.

301
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Xiaosi.

302
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
Find him.

303
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Kill him.

304
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
Brother.

305
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
That's Huang Yaoshi.

306
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
But he's sick now.

307
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Kill him.

308
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
We can make the world better.

309
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
The flowers

310
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
are blooming so beautifully.

311
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Not as beautiful as you.

312
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
Yaoshi.

313
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
In fact,

314
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
my whole life

315
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
is like this orchid.

316
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
After the blooming of the orchid,

317
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
I have no regrets.

318
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
I can't live

319
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
without you.

320
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
I can't live

321
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
without you.

322
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Don't think too much.

323
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Meeting you

324
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
is the best thing

325
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
in my life.

326
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
With me,

327
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,480
everything will be fine.

328
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
I don't want to go to the mountain

329
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
to see the sunrise.

330
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
I'm tired.

331
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Let's go home.

332
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Master.

333
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
That girl is still kneeling outside.

334
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
Master.

335
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
She's not afraid now.

336
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
Whoever can kill her

337
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
will be famous in the world.

338
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Don't move, girl.

339
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
If I just sent you the qi,

340
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
you need to rest now.

341
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
I'm not afraid.

342
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
I'm not afraid.

343
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
I'm not afraid.

344
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
I'm not afraid.

345
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm not afraid.

346
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm not afraid.

347
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
I'm not afraid.

348
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
I'm not afraid.

349
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Huang Xiaoshi.

350
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Come out.

351
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Lei Ruohua.

352
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Come out.

353
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
I'm fine.

354
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Huang Xiaoshi.

355
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Come out.

356
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Master.

357
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
Master.

358
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Qiu Yunhai.

359
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Kill him.

360
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
Master.

361
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Master.

362
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Ruohua is grateful

363
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
that you saved me twice.

364
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
She's willing to die for you.

365
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
In this life,

366
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
I'm not willing to be your teacher.

367
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
If there's a next life,

368
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
you must take me as your disciple.

369
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Master.

370
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Master.

371
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
Are you all right?

372
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
No.

373
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Wait for me at the dock.

374
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Master.

375
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Huang Xiaoshi.

376
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Huang Xiaoshi.

377
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
He's one of the five greats.

378
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
He's invincible.

379
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
But he's sick now.

380
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,400
Kill him!

381
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,520
What are you waiting for?

382
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,600
Guys,

383
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
the opportunity is here.

384
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
Surround him!

385
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:40,560
Jiole

386
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,380
Kill him!

387
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
You are awake.

388
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
We are fine now.

389
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Where's Shifu?

390
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
Don't worry.

391
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
You will be fine.

392
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
I can't see him.

393
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
He is still alive.

394
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
He is still alive.

395
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Where is Shifu?

396
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Where is he?

397
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Where is he?

398
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Where is he?

399
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Where is he?

400
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Where is he?

401
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Where is he?

402
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
Where is he?

403
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Where is he?

404
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Don't worry.

405
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
He is the pharmacist.

406
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
He is here.

407
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Master is back.

408
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Master, are you okay?

409
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
The pharmacist, Ruohua is injured.

410
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Why don't we take her back to the island to heal?

411
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
I don't know.

412
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Ruohua and I were in love.

413
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
She saved me once.

414
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Let's take her as our disciple.

415
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Let's go.

416
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
Where are we going?

417
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Home.

418
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Home?

419
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
To Peach Blossom Island.

420
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,480
Peach Blossom Island

421
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Master.

422
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Master is back.

423
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,480
What are you talking about?

424
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,480
Master took Shiniang to Mount Tai to see the sunrise.

425
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
I don't think he is here yet.

426
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Master.

427
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
It's really Master.

428
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
Master.

429
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Master.

430
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Master.

431
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
Master.

432
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
Master is back.

433
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Let's go.

434
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Where are we going?

435
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Here.

436
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Hurry up.

437
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Hurry up.

438
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Let's go.

439
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Let's go.

440
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
Go.

441
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
I won't go.

442
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
I won't go.

443
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
I won't go.

444
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
I won't go.

445
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
You go.

446
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
I...

447
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
You go.

448
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
You go.

449
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Don't drag me.

450
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
I won't go.

451
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
Stop it.

452
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Master will be here soon.

453
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
You go.

454
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Go.

455
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
You go.

456
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
I'm Qu Lingfeng.

457
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
May I ask...

458
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Is this sister of yours old?

459
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
How can you ask her at her age?

460
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Right?

461
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
Tao Hua Dao is older than her.

462
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
My junior brother shouldn't be here.

463
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Right.

464
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Right.

465
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Miss.

466
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
How old are you?

467
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
You didn't let me ask.

468
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Why are you asking?

469
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
You are young.

470
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
I'm twenty years old.

471
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,480
Why am I still the youngest?

472
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Let me introduce.

473
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
This is our senior brother, Qu Lingfeng.

474
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
This is our second brother, Chen Xuanfeng.

475
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,480
I am your fourth junior brother.

476
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,480
I'm also the most proud disciple of Master, Lu Chengmeng.

477
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,480
This is our fifth junior brother, Wu Mianfeng.

478
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
May I ask your name?

479
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Mei Ruohua.

480
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
Mei Ruohua.

481
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
All the brothers on our island are named Feng.

482
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,480
I guess Master hasn't given you a name yet.

483
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Not yet.

484
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Then you have to behave yourself.

485
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,480
I didn't behave myself last time.

486
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Master Sui didn't teach me martial arts.

487
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,480
He even asked me to watch the medicine.

488
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
It's obvious that you don't practice well.

489
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
Stop fooling around, Master.

490
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
Master.

491
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
You all know each other?

492
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,480
Yes.

493
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
My name is Mei Ruohua from Pingjiang.

494
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,480
I'm a teacher of Huang Yaoshi from Donghai Tao Hua Dao.

495
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
I'm the first disciple of Master.

496
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
I'm the second disciple of Master.

497
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,480
I'm Huang Yaoshi from Donghai Tao Hua Dao.

498
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
I'm a teacher of Tao Hua Dao.

499
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,480
I'm Master Chengmeng from Yunnan.

500
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,480
I'm willing to follow my disciple's order.

501
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,480
I'll follow my teacher's order.

502
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
I won't disobey my teacher.

503
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
If I break the promise...

504
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Mei Ruohua.

505
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,480
There are not many rules on Tao Hua Dao.

506
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,480
You can do whatever you want.

507
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,480
I hope you can find yourself on Tao Hua Dao.

508
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
And start over.

509
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
Don't be obsessed with the past.

510
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
I understand.

511
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
I understand.

512
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
The wind of the four seasons.

513
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Tao Hua Dao follows the blood.

514
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
It's a virtue of the superiors.

515
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
From now on,

516
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
you can be called

517
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Mei Chaofeng.

518
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
Master.

519
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Please accept Mei Chaofeng as your disciple.

520
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
The flowers in this room

521
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
are collected by your master.

522
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
The fragrance is made by cotton.

523
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,480
I picked these rouge and water.

524
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
I don't know if you like it.

525
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Get out.

526
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Go.

527
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Go.

528
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Your master said you have a lot of inner power.

529
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
You can find cotton first.

530
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
You can get three

531
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
nine-flower jade jade pills made by Tao Hua Dao.

532
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
It's a good source of training.

533
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
It's good for your practice.

534
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Thank you, master and master.

535
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
You're so quick.

536
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
See what you need.

537
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,480
You can tell me anytime.

538
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Chaofeng.

539
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
From now on,

540
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
this is your home.

541
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
I'll go to the bathroom.

542
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Take off your shoes.

543
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
I'll take them off later.

544
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,480
What do you think

545
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
of the new female disciple?

546
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
Tao Hua Dao

547
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
is a gentle girl.

548
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
I thought she would be a gentle junior.

549
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,480
But she's a cold beauty.

550
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
I think she's special.

551
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Especially when she looks at you.

552
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,480
She's so gentle and stubborn.

553
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
She's so hard to talk to.

554
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Brother,

555
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
are you in love at first sight?

556
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
Don't talk nonsense.

557
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
I think master broke your leg.

558
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,480
I'm afraid

559
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,480
women are hard to get along with.

560
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
You should be gentle

561
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
and gentle like your master.

562
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,480
You're right.

563
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
You talk the most.

564
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
Why don't you talk today?

565
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
I'm thinking

566
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,480
I should call her sister

567
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
or sister.

568
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Or sister.

569
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,480
Call her sister.

570
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Sister.

571
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
What do you think

572
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,480
she's got?

573
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,480
Why did you take her as your disciple?

574
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Master took her as a disciple.

575
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Of course she has her own reason.

576
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
Like I did.

577
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
My father was an official.

578
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
He was poor and poor.

579
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
He was killed by a villain

580
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,480
and was released.

581
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
Master saved me

582
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
and took me as his disciple.

583
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
He took me to the island.

584
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Loyalty is a big deal.

585
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,480
Master's most important

586
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,480
is loyalty and filial piety.

587
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
My parents were

588
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
the doctors of the army.

589
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
My parents were

590
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
the doctors of the army.

591
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
But they died

592
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
in the battlefield.

593
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
Is she

594
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
also a disciple of the master?

595
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,480
Maybe not.

596
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
I'm not a disciple of the master.

597
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
Are the three sisters' relatives

598
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,480
also master's old friends?

599
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
Don't guess.

600
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Since we're here,

601
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
we're family.

602
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
Exactly.

603
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
You're the only one who can guess.

604
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,460
The

605
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,460
The

606
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,460
The

607
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,460
The

608
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,460
The

609
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,460
The

610
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,460
The

611
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,460
The

612
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,460
The

613
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,460
The

614
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,460
The

615
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,460
The

616
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,460
The

617
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,460
Then

618
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,460
do you think

619
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,400
it's considered as right

620
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,800
Have some water.

621
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:36,460
So

622
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,400
there are five members of the enemy.

623
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,300
Mr.

624
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,460
You are the face that I've been longing for

625
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,460
The endless wish

626
00:43:53,460 --> 00:44:00,460
You are the thread that I've been holding on to

627
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:04,460
Since time has its own end

628
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,460
I'll give up my beauty and my beauty

629
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,460
Give myself and my brother back to time

630
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:21,460
You are the face that I've been longing for

631
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:28,460
You are the mountain that I can't cross

632
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:34,460
Even if we're wronged, we can't escape from love

633
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:41,460
You are the thread that I've been holding on to

634
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,460
