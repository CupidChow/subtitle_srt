00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Taobao Shankou invites you to watch the nine-unit true gold

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,920
Cut, kill the gold

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,080
It's rare to kill the gold so fast

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,080
But it's faster

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,480
Come on, afternoon tea is here

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,840
I am Meng Ziyi

7
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,440
I use Taobao Shankou to order takeout

8
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,120
More advantageous

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,040
Come here

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,920
You're shameless

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
I killed you

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
Vijaya!

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Vijaya!

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,840
Vijaya!

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,560
You bastard!

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,880
Mother!

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,200
Mother!

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Episode 18

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Father, mother,

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I will avenge you.

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Father, mother,

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I will avenge you.

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Father, mother,

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I will avenge you.

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Father, mother,

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I will avenge you.

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Father, mother,

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I will avenge you.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Father, mother,

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I will avenge you.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Father, mother,

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will avenge you.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Father, mother,

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I will avenge you.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I am in your heart.

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Chunfeng,

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
you should have been more lead.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I will cut you if you go.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You little party.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Junior?

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Senior,

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
what is your martial arts development?

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Could you teach me?

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Do you know?

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I have learnt sword dance.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,040
I practiced martial arts with you.

48
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,240
Yes.

49
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,160
I want to learn

50
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,160
the martial arts of killing.

51
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,400
The martial arts of killing?

52
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,920
Senior.

53
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
Is there anyone on the island who is good at music?

54
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,440
Music?

55
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,080
Are you talking about the sound of the flute?

56
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,040
Master's sound is the most important.

57
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,560
Master?

58
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,720
Our master doesn't care about the skill of martial arts.

59
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
He knows the heavenly culture and the geography.

60
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,840
He knows the martial arts of eight-storied pagoda, the Qimen, the Dunjia, the Qingqi, the Shugu.

61
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
He knows the calligraphy and calligraphy.

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,720
What kind of person is Master?

63
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
Actually, Master

64
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
is a very strict person.

65
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,240
No, no, no.

66
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,600
Senior, you are wrong.

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,920
Master

68
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,640
is a very kind person.

69
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,040
When did Master become kind?

70
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,320
Master is a weird person.

71
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,560
I didn't say anything.

72
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,680
I didn't say anything.

73
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,160
Junior sister.

74
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,520
Anyway, it's been a long time.

75
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,720
You will understand it naturally.

76
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,880
Junior sister.

77
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,600
I saw you didn't have breakfast.

78
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,000
I brought it for you.

79
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,520
What did you call me?

80
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,880
Junior sister.

81
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,360
This cake

82
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
was made by my teacher.

83
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,240
It can't be bought outside.

84
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,840
The Little Face

85
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,080
Look, your face is red.

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,120
Stinky girl.

87
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,080
You are fighting with me, aren't you?

88
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,400
You don't eat a good meal.

89
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,040
I will have a good wedding for you today.

90
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,200
Don't move.

91
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,840
Go.

92
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,600
Go.

93
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,480
Master.

94
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,920
Master.

95
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,760
Master.

96
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,040
Where is Xuan Feng?

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,400
Second Brother.

98
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,240
Second Brother.

99
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,920
You practiced late last night.

100
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,480
I think you got up late.

101
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
You said Chen Xuan Feng

102
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,440
practiced late.

103
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,640
You are lying.

104
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,080
I am lying.

105
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,920
Master.

106
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,800
I have been very serious recently.

107
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,000
I have been very serious recently.

108
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,640
I will be very careful.

109
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,040
You have been

110
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,720
working hard recently.

111
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,160
You have been drinking and playing.

112
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,840
And you have come up with such a little trick.

113
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,760
You are very happy, aren't you?

114
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,360
Master.

115
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,480
There are thousands of beautiful things in the world.

116
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,720
Spring has flowers, autumn has moon.

117
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,440
Summer has cool wind, winter has snow.

118
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,040
If you only care about practicing martial arts

119
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,680
and ignore the beautiful scenery,

120
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,280
isn't it a pity?

121
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Yes.

122
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,160
There are thousands of beautiful things in the world.

123
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,920
It's a pity

124
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,520
that you don't go to see them.

125
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,600
Master.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,760
I was wrong.

127
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,840
You were not wrong.

128
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,760
I was wrong.

129
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,800
Peach Blossom Island

130
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,200
is a free place.

131
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,000
Whenever

132
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,000
you don't want to stay,

133
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,920
you can leave at any time.

134
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,560
Why did Master leave?

135
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,280
Didn't he teach us martial arts?

136
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,360
It's the end of the class today.

137
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Master is so casual.

138
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,320
Okay, okay.

139
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,840
Master is wrong.

140
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,680
Don't hurt him, Second Brother.

141
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,960
Second Brother.

142
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,160
You are not a good person.

143
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,440
Second Brother.

144
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,960
Master didn't ask you to get up.

145
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,640
Kneel down for a while.

146
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Get up.

147
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,800
You kneeled down, didn't you?

148
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,200
You are the one who is lazy.

149
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,200
It has nothing to do with me.

150
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,720
Brother, I'll leave it to you.

151
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,240
No need.

152
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,200
You are not so obedient.

153
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,040
You can go to Master's house in Louria.

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,800
You think I dare not?

155
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,720
Because of you,

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,720
I can't learn martial arts from Master today.

157
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,440
You are really a bad luck.

158
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,320
Come on.

159
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,440
The horse of the sea.

160
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,400
What's the matter?

161
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,960
Master.

162
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,880
I want to learn the most powerful martial arts of Peach Blossom Island.

163
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Please teach me.

164
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,360
You have to start from the entrance.

165
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
The best way to learn

166
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,560
the entrance martial arts is the Xuan Feng.

167
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,240
Go find him.

168
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,840
But I want to learn from Master.

169
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,360
Go.

170
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,240
Go.

171
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,800
Second Brother.

172
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,280
Are you here to see my fun?

173
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm here to learn martial arts from you.

174
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,800
I'm a horse of the sea.

175
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,840
How can I teach you?

176
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,000
I offended you before.

177
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,640
I apologize to you.

178
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Master said

179
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
the best way to learn the entrance martial arts

180
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,320
of Second Brother is the hand-shake.

181
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
He asked me to learn from you.

182
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,800
I had toistic my power in объ

183
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,040
Older brother, please teach me.

184
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,480
Not to hide from the unknown?

185
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,880
Avoid thearkanant festival科

186
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,080
Martial arts of the Goddess.

187
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,920
The Shis are sitting under the Bodhi tree

188
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,120
for 49 days.

189
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,320
They are sitting under the Bodhi tree for 3 seconds.

190
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,520
Do you understand?

191
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,520
Clean it carefully.

192
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,840
Tip.

193
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,440
Why are there more?

194
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,400
The essence of a strong handshake

195
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,600
usually...

196
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Hit me.

197
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,600
Slip in and slip out.

198
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,440
A man of martial skills

199
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,960
The most important thing is patience.

200
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,040
Chen Xuan Feng, you're playing tricks on me.

201
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,160
You're so impatient. How can you play tricks on me?

202
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,880
I know you hate me.

203
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,880
You can stop teaching me if you don't want to.

204
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,520
Why do you make fun of me?

205
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,080
Who is it?

206
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,480
Coming.

207
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,880
Do you have a beggar's attitude?

208
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,760
I don't have time to play tricks on you.

209
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,880
You come to beg people in the daytime,

210
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,680
but you don't smile at night.

211
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,000
Are you from Kuizhou?

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You've changed so fast.

213
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,040
Say it.

214
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,480
Are you not going to force me to grow up?

215
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,040
I don't want to waste time with you.

216
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,080
I'll go and ask Senior Brother to teach me.

217
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,920
I don't want to.

218
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,760
I was going to give it to you.

219
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,400
Just put it there.

220
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,280
What a good-for-nothing.

221
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,760
I...

222
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,840
Mei Ruo Hua.

223
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,640
You want to kill me

224
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,840
just because you've practiced some tricks?

225
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,440
You're looking for death.

226
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,600
Senior Sister.

227
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,160
Senior Sister.

228
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,080
Are you all right?

229
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,760
Why can't you learn it?

230
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,440
I was too anxious, panic and confused.

231
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,120
Master said

232
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,600
I have to practice for an hour.

233
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,160
I can only practice

234
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,880
when I'm not in the mood.

235
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,880
I can't be too anxious.

236
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,480
Fourth Brother,

237
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,480
you're really good at

238
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,560
memorizing Master's words.

239
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,600
Sister Shi Min,

240
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
your movements are too rigid

241
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,680
and your expression is very serious.

242
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,360
You have to be as weak as you can.

243
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,680
I have to be as weak as I can.

244
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,160
I have to learn the moves

245
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,320
and then I can run as I want.

246
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,520
Sister Shi Min, don't worry.

247
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,600
I'll teach you.

248
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,080
You have to relax first.

249
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,320
Don't be too hard.

250
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,120
I'm as weak as a mountain

251
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,200
and I'm as soft as a stone.

252
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,440
Do you have any tricks?

253
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,240
No.

254
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,520
The Bibo Palm is simple,

255
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,080
but the first move and the first move

256
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,400
are all Master's new tricks.

257
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,080
They are the foundation of Taowa Martial Arts.

258
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,440
You can't learn it

259
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,680
in one move.

260
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,720
Practicing martial arts is about the progress of the world.

261
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,120
The disciples of Taohua Island

262
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,480
all practice from the Bibo Palm.

263
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,840
Even if you're a private,

264
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,920
you have to practice it a year later

265
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,880
to have the chance to get to know other masters.

266
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,160
I think you

267
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,720
have to practice for three years.

268
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,960
Less than a year.

269
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,240
I will definitely become the Bibo Palm.

270
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,480
You three go to practice first.

271
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,520
Sister Shi Min, come with me.

272
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,960
Senior, what are you doing?

273
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,720
Sister Shi Min, come.

274
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,440
Sister Shi Min,

275
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,680
every move of the martial arts

276
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,320
is like a lighthouse.

277
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,600
Every move of the martial arts

278
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,560
is like you walking into

279
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,520
a new dark room.

280
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,520
This room belongs to you.

281
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,560
But you don't understand.

282
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,040
Master means

283
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,120
you are the master of the dark room.

284
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,080
Master means

285
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,360
you have to

286
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,560
touch it by yourself.

287
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,040
Little by little,

288
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,120
inch by inch,

289
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
until you know

290
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,600
the sides and corners of this room.

291
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,920
You have to find out everything.

292
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,680
Then it really belongs to you.

293
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,160
Otherwise,

294
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,640
we are just

295
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,400
guests in this room for the time being.

296
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,880
But Senior,

297
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,920
if I don't know the order,

298
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,080
can't I see

299
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,360
the whole appearance of this room?

300
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,640
It's not easy to enter the room.

301
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
So you have to

302
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,720
spend time to repair it by yourself.

303
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,720
Master often said

304
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,920
that you can't do anything

305
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,040
without practice.

306
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,680
I can't remember.

307
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,040
Stop practicing.

308
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,120
There is a dragonfly in the mountains and seas.

309
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,440
You can do it with your hands.

310
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What dragonfly?

311
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,920
Dragonfly in the mountains and seas.

312
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,960
I can't understand.

313
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,720
Say something.

314
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,760
Seafood buns.

315
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,920
Master's favorite is

316
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,200
your favorite dish.

317
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,000
I'll send it to Master.

318
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,160
Senior,

319
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
we haven't eaten yet.

320
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,000
Senior,

321
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,920
I just brought it from Master.

322
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,760
He left it for us.

323
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,080
Seafood buns.

324
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,120
Pig ears.

325
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,480
Cow's kidney.

326
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,040
And...

327
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,720
And...

328
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,600
Legs and legs.

329
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,760
All kinds?

330
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,760
There are only five kinds of meat.

331
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,440
But the same foot

332
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,080
is 25 times.

333
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,040
25 times.

334
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,440
It's the same as the five-five plum blossom.

335
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,480
We should

336
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,040
write

337
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,680
the name of this dish.

338
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,640
The name...

339
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,200
I'll wait for you to write it.

340
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,760
Go to bed now.

341
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,840
Go to bed.

342
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,280
Where's the water?

343
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,800
Green lilies?

344
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,320
Bis K physique of notify.

345
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,400
Master,

346
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,320
my brother says

347
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,360
this is your favorite dish.

348
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,880
What's the matter?

349
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,960
Master,

350
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,240
I want to ask you

351
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,520
how to practice the Palm of Bibo.

352
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,080
Peach blossoms fall, not the sword of God.

353
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,080
The sword of Bihai is in full bloom.

354
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,200
The essence of it is the Palm of Bibo.

355
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,480
The Palm of Bihai is the song of God.

356
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,120
It's your master's creation.

357
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
The Palm of Bibo

358
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,960
is the foundation of our Taoist martial arts.

359
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,960
The Palm of Bibo

360
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,040
Zhuangzi, Tao Dejing, Shijing.

361
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,720
The martial arts of Peach Blossom Island are not important.

362
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Before you learn the martial arts,

363
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,480
finish reading these books first.

364
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,360
Maybe it will help you understand the Palm of Bibo.

365
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,640
Thank you, Shijing.

366
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,440
I will finish reading them as soon as possible.

367
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,040
It doesn't matter if you finish reading them.

368
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,560
What's important is to understand the art of palm.

369
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,280
It's easy to understand and doesn't need any etiquette.

370
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,680
This is the essence of our Taoist martial arts.

371
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,920
Thank you, Shijing.

372
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,440
Zhuangzi, Tao Dejing.

373
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,360
Why did you give her these books?

374
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,280
Weren't you the one who told me

375
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,320
that when she read herself or is too close to the direct world,

376
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,760
she will end up in a pontos.

377
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,600
Studying is more than teaching her to manage the world,

378
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,120
it's also for adjusting her personality.

379
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,040
My wife

380
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,040
sounds like a traditional people.

381

People call her gentle, but she would leave in fear when she hopped into her home Wait for a moment

389
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,240

394
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,420
After mastering this Martial Arts

one has to go to a very dangerous Bukkak

396
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,620
Spirituality cannot be known

397

Xuan Feng.

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,160
Is this how you protect your sister?

411
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,600

412
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,640
Senior.

413
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,640
It's not Senior's fault.

414
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,960
I was the one

415
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,200
who broke in.

416
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,920
Xuan Feng, you should go.

417
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
Let Chao Feng have a good rest.

418
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Yes, Senior.

419
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,160
Yes.

420
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,600
I will go then.

421
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,800
Your master

422
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,560
seiner than ever

423
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,400
I'm sorry.

424
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,840
Senior.

425
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Actually,

426
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,760
I know there's a formation

427
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,320
in the Peach Blossom Forest.

428
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,480
Senior Xuan Feng told me about it.

429
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Don't worry.

430
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,960
I'll be more careful in the future.

431
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,280
Senior.

432
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,560
I must learn martial arts.

433
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,480
Learn martial arts

434
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,520
for what?

435
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,160
I asked your master about it.

436
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,800
How did he answer?

437
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,720
He didn't answer me either.

438
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,920
But revenge is not the only meaning of learning martial arts.

439
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,760
You have to figure out why you live.

440
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,200
Go to sleep.

441
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,440
Sleep well.

442
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,160
You'll get better tomorrow.

443
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,080
Today,

444
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,400
I'm Daxi's wife.

445
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,920
Ugh!

446
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,600
What?

447
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,120
I'm asking your master

448
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,120
how to practice V recurrence palm.

449
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,500

00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,280
What are you looking at?

452
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,420
A wave?

453
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,460
What's that?

454
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,380
Metal is danmyâ?

455
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,540
A wave.

456
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,720
Lengthen and move multiple times,

457
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,960
but

458
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,620
why am I still danmyâ?

459
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
I don't know.

460
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Close your eyes.

461
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,120
Feel it.

He's doing well.

548
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,060
How could he be not well?

549
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,060
He's doing well.

550
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,060
He's doing well.

551
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,060
He's doing well.

552
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,660
He's doing well.

553
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,860

00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,260
I'm sorry.

577
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,060
I've seen the most gentle person.

578
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,860
Sometimes like a mother.

579
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,060
Sometimes like a friend.

580
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,260
You're the best person in the world.

581
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,260
But such a good person,

582
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,060
why should he suffer so much?

583
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,460
The world is unbearable.

584
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,660
You're the only one.

585
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,860
Master, we're saved.

586
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,660
What?

587
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,860
The West Jade White-Square Manor sent a letter.

588
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,260
How do you know it's saved?

589
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,260
You stole the letter?

590
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,660
The West Jade Wind.

591
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,260
Who?

592
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,260
The West Jade White-Square Manor sent me a letter.

593
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,060
The Jianghu Yuanchen sent me a letter.

594
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,260
What's it?

595
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,260
Brother Yao.

596
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
We've never met since we parted.

597
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,060
That day you said that you couldn't cure your illness.

598
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,660
I'm sorry.

599
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,660
Today I'm looking for the West Jade White-Square Manor.

600
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,060
I've found a way to cure it.

601
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,460
The Yin Wheel Pill

602
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,460
is the most powerful poison in the world.

603
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,260
I can use it to save you.

604
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,860
Fire Flower.

605
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,660
Fire Flower is a flower that can cure the disease.

606
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,660
It can cure the poison.

607
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,460
But this flower is rare in the world.

608
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,860
It grows in the mouth of the volcano.

609
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,460
It's located in the south of the East Sea.

610
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,860
Liu Bo Island.

611
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,260
Liu Bo Island?

612
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,260
Liu Bo Island?

613
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,260
Is she not going with us?

614
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,060
I didn't tell her to leave today.

615
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,260
Why did you leave her?

616
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,260
Liu Bo Island is very dangerous.

617
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,460
I'm afraid she'll be in danger.

618
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,460
She's injured.

619
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,860
It's not a good idea.

620
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:15,860
Sister.

621
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,060
Why are you here?

622
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:18,860
I'm going too.

623
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,060
Sister.

624
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,060
Isn't it just going to Liu Bo Island?

625
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,460
We're brothers.

626
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,660
I'm afraid that if I don't go,

627
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,460
you won't be able to get the Fire Flower.

628
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,060
You're so weak.

629
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,460
What are you talking about?

630
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,260
You're so stubborn.

631
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,660
It's better to go together.

632
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,260
Come back.

633
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,660
I will be your friend forever

634
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,660
I will be your friend forever

635
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,660
I will be your friend forever

636
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,660
I will be your friend forever

637
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,660
I will be your friend forever

638
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,660
I will be your friend forever

639
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,660
I will be your friend forever

640
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,660
I will be your friend forever

641
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,660
I will be your friend forever

642
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,660
I will be your friend forever

643
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,660
I will be your friend forever

644
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,660
I will be your friend forever

645
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,660
I will be your friend forever

646
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,660
I will be your friend forever

647
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,660
I will be your friend forever

648
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,660
I will be your friend forever

649
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,660
I will be your friend forever

650
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,660
I will be your friend forever

651
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,660
I will be your friend forever

652
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,660
I will be your friend forever

653
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,660
I will be your friend forever

654
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,660
I will be your friend forever

655
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,660
I will be your friend forever

656
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,660
I will be your friend forever

657
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,660
I will be your friend forever

658
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,660
I will be your friend forever

659
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,660
I will be your friend forever

660
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,660
I will be your friend forever

661
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,660
My eyes

662
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,660
Even if we are wronged

663
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,660
Even if we are wronged

664
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,660
Please don't be afraid

665
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,660
Please don't be afraid

666
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,660
You say you don't want to compromise

667
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,660
But you chase
