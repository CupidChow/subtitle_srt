1
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:08,742
I'm Mizuki Takino, 24 years old,
from Kofu University.

2
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,946
I haven't decided
which department to go to yet.

3
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:17,017
Rather, I don't want to decide now.

4
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:21,721
I want to see them all for myself
on-site and get to know people.

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,594
When I was a child,
there was no hospital in my neighborhood.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,497
I was healthy and didn't need much care.

7
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,799
It was my grandpa…

8
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:37,103
It was hard to take
my grandfather to a doctor.

9
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:44,644
That's why I decided to become a doctor
who can be there for people like him.

10
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:49,082
It is my dream to become
a doctor who can cure anything!

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,619
Saving people's lives.

12
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:57,457
I feel really happy
to have landed a job like that!

13
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,896
There's nothing more the hospital can do.

14
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,867
<i>My father is a carpenter.</i>

15
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:13,540
<i>He'd always work on site,</i>
<i>and he trained many apprentices.</i>

16
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,177
I'm one of them.

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,114
<i>He worked so hard all his life.</i>

18
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,583
<i>And yet…</i>

19
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:29,222
this is how it's going to end.

20
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:34,227
How would you like him
to spend the time he has left?

21
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:38,231
You now have
the option of home care for him.

22
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,138
<i>Tatsu Handa, 76 years old.</i>

23
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,474
Stage four, lung cancer.

24
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:51,478
The patient does not wish
to undergo further active treatment

25
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,380
and has requested home care
after consulting his family.

26
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,950
So, will we be making home visits now?

27
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:01,754
Due to multiple organ metastases,
surgery was off the table from the get-go.

28
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,890
Chemotherapy was also ineffective.

29
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,794
Given his age, there is a need
to examine his entire body.

30
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:12,332
That's why we saw it fitting
to consult with General Medicine.

31
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,002
Excuse me.

32
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,971
Your appointment, Dr. Tokushige.

33
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,439
Sorry, I'll be right there.

34
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,208
- Dr. Takino.
- Yes?

35
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,811
Can I assign Mr. Handa to you?

36
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,446
To me?

37
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,347
Yes.

38
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,416
Of course, I'll examine him with you.

39
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,352
Got it.

40
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,187
Excuse me.

41
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,993
How should I handle
Mr. Handa's prescriptions now?

42
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:42,996
Takino.

43
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,599
You never did deathwatch
at orthopedics, did you?

44
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,202
No.

45
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,071
That's why I'm thinking about…

46
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,575
end-of-life care.

47
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,279
That was quite a climb.

48
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:04,617
Fifteen minutes to the supermarket.
Carrying bags home is like hell.

49
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,053
Quite a lot of old houses here.

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,257
About 35% of residents here are elderly,
over the national average.

51
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,260
Mr. Handa's house is up there.

52
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,062
Let's go.

53
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,305
HANDA

54
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,773
I'll leave it to you now.

55
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,007
Thank you.

56
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,713
Come in.

57
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,847
Excuse us.

58
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,985
The doctors from Uotora are here.

59
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,190
Nice to meet you, Mr. Handa.

60
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,392
I'm Mizuki Takino from General Medicine.

61
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,730
I'll be in your care starting today.

62
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,499
You're going to be in his care?

63
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,802
Sorry, that's not what I meant…

64
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,438
Oh! It's okay!

65
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,106
It's fine.

66
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,380
Just lying around makes me feel old.

67
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,386
Dr. Takino was it?

68
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,587
Yes.

69
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,891
If you need anything, just let me know.

70
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,393
I…

71
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,632
want to go out with a bang.

72
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,967
With a bang?

73
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,573
Like a movie star.

74
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,376
Doctor,

75
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,411
by all means…

76
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,715
please help fulfill this wish of mine.

77
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,230
GENERAL MEDICINE

78
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,374
SEEING THE WORLD
THROUGH THE PATIENT'S EYES

79
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:14,047
<i>The past, the present,</i>
<i>and sometimes the future</i>.

80
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:18,351
<i>A general physician is to follow</i>
<i>the course of the patient's life.</i>

81
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,220
The future…

82
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,528
END-OF-LIFE CARE

83
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,263
Dr. Takino!

84
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,332
- Yes?
- Have you taken your summer leave?

85
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,833
Oh, no.

86
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,034
Figured.

87
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,969
There's no way we can!

88
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,639
We'll end up
with a huge backlog of outpatients.

89
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:43,076
I know that,
but our work style is being reformed.

90
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,111
I've taken mine.

91
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,112
What?

92
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:47,814
I have the right to.

93
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,450
Splendid! The director will be thrilled.

94
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,387
Sorry for bothering you.
Have you taken your summer leave?

95
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,722
- Yes, I have.
- Really?

96
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:56,789
Great.

97
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,690
END-OF-LIFE CARE

98
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,027
Have you taken your summer leave?

99
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,409
Ms. Takino. How can I help you today?

100
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,078
It can wait,
please finish what you were doing.

101
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,514
Your brows are furrowing again.

102
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,888
Is it about Mr. Handa?

103
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,990
Yes.

104
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,995
What we can do for him…

105
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,666
is still unclear.

106
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:47,340
The answer lies in the time
you'll spend together from now on.

107
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,410
From now on?

108
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:57,517
That's because
we just happen to be on his boat.

109
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,153
By chance.

110
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,862
No way…

111
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,909
Big Bro and Hina are here.

112
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,478
- Go.
- Are you sleeping, Grandpa?

113
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,014
Wow, you're looking well.

114
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,416
I'm glad you came.

115
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,419
<i>Dad's lost weight, hasn't he?</i>

116
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,990
If he falls ill at midnight,
the ambulance can't get here.

117
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,961
The Uotora doctors do home visits.

118
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,430
Even doctors can't always come right away.

119
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,435
Even Kumi is working full-time now,
so now what?

120
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,008
When will Grandpa get better?

121
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,481
No idea.

122
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,051
Hello there!

123
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,590
His blood pressure
has gone down, hasn't it?

124
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,459
I might need to fine-tune his medication.

125
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,429
I'll share this
with Dr. Kayama at Internal.

126
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,167
Hello.

127
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:26,806
The window sash replacement!
I'm sorry, I haven't been by…

128
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,915
May I examine your body, sir?

129
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,818
Sure.

130
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,621
I'll help you upright. Ready!

131
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,300
Let me help.

132
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,469
No, I'll do it myself.

133
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,071
Sorry.

134
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,439
It's okay.

135
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,853
You may go ahead.

136
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,091
Excuse me.

137
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,494
Take a deep breath.

138
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,070
Thank you.

139
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,013
You like movies, don't you?

140
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,352
They kill time.

141
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,091
"Okay, cut!"

142
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:56,629
They have a nice and clear ending.

143
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,569
My grandkids are still little.

144
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,105
Hey, Tatsu!

145
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,173
Mr. Yokobuki?

146
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,074
Jun…

147
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,543
He was around the corner when he called.

148
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,180
I heard you're about to croak.
I thought I'd come to pay my respects!

149
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,147
Stop that…

150
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,682
That's right.

151
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:21,253
I've got one foot in the grave,
and so do you.

152
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,323
No kidding! I'm not as old as you think.

153
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,192
That goes for every old man!

154
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,460
I'm sorry, Doctor.

155
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,361
It's fine.

156
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:32,898
You can count on Dr. Takino.
The famous, modern Red Beard!

157
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,166
Please, stop that.

158
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,207
Tatsu tried to look cool
in front of you, didn't he?

159
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,308
What?

160
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,112
You remind me of Acchan, Dr. Takino.

161
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,013
Acchan?

162
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,514
His wife.

163
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:53,819
He'd clown around with us,
but go all stiff in her presence.

164
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,790
- He sounds like a very lively person.
- No.

165
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,826
He's a carpenter, so he's really strong.

166
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,829
But you've seen him.

167
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,033
His arms are so scrawny now.

168
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,939
Over there, Tatsu built that house!

169
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,143
Hiro lives there, I think?

170
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,577
Over there too!

171
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,513
My bar too…

172
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:26,886
I was planning to laugh
at him for three more years,

173
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,988
that show-off.

174
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,533
Are you okay?

175
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,905
Dr. Tenpaku.

176
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,875
Caring for a terminally ill patient?

177
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,180
He's doing fine.
No signs of delirium or such.

178
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,951
Thanks for asking.
I'll consult with you if anything happens.

179
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,653
Dr. Takino, are you…

180
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:02,688
What?

181
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,892
Even doctors can book counseling sessions.

182
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,597
<i>I see…</i>

183
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,666
He does actually talk.

184
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,900
That's not the issue!

185
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,938
Do I look that depressed to you?

186
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,507
Yes, this is my first terminal care stint.

187
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,343
But, I'm just trying to do it right.

188
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,181
"A doctor who can cure anything."

189
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,816
Right?

190
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,619
Isn't that a cruel thing to say right now?

191
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,987
You think?

192
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,027
When the test results showed
what stage the cancer was at…

193
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,899
When we found out
that chemo wasn't working…

194
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:53,172
And when the family told us
the hospital can no longer do anything…

195
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,574
It frustrated me.

196
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,312
I'm a doctor after all.

197
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,085
Dr. Takino.

198
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,058
It's a violation of labor laws.

199
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,128
To call out an old man like this.

200
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:20,766
That's because you, my senior,
can't commission web tools!

201
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,403
I get it, I'm sorry!

202
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,538
Sign here.

203
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,277
You won't go see him?

204
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,078
What?

205
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,513
Tokushige.

206
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,685
I'm fine as long as he is doing well.

207
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,321
Is that so?

208
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,560
Can I come in?

209
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,964
Excuse me, sir.

210
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,333
Dr. Akaike!

211
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,040
End-of-life care…

212
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,312
Like a movie star,
he said he wanted to go out with a bang.

213
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,014
That's a tricky one.

214
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,553
As lung cancer progresses,
the phlegm gets tainted by blood,

215
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,722
there'll be chest pain…

216
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,625
shortness of breath…

217
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,694
<i>and fever.</i>

218
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:24,897
Need the toilet?

219
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,066
Just tell me.

220
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,403
<i>Even the simplest routines</i>
<i>will require assistance.</i>

221
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,306
As the end draws near…

222
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,210
they'll make a strange clattering noise,

223
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,747
one that you don't usually hear
coming from a person.

224
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,315
That's enough!

225
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,054
That's what it is to die.

226
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,523
Get out of here.

227
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,693
Don't discuss my pal like that here.

228
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,839
I understand.

229
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,442
You do?

230
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,545
Therefore…

231
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,348
it's hard.

232
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,186
Up until now,

233
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,956
I'd always been…

234
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,994
praying for my patients' future.

235
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,730
But…

236
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,336
Sorry, I ended up talking about work.

237
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,740
Everyone…

238
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,878
will die someday.

239
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,251
Going by what you said, Dr. Takino,

240
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,086
doctors…

241
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,924
can't save anyone.

242
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:05,965
Do terminally ill patients…

243
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,437
really have no future?

244
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:17,009
No matter how little time they have,

245
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:22,348
their life goes on
until the very last moment.

246
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:29,054
And, we'll be there with them.

247
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,933
I have to go up.

248
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,273
- Doctor, what happened to your knee?
- Yes?

249
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,744
Oh, I fell down.

250
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,278
What?

251
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,582
I was in a hurry to see you.

252
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:04,456
Mr. Yokobuki told me
that I looked like your wife.

253
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,428
My wife was more put-together…

254
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,865
I'm sorry.

255
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,503
So, which is your favorite movie?

256
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,273
The one at the very top.

257
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,675
This one?

258
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:24,676
Yes.

259
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:25,577
CHIVALROUS WANDERER

260
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,384
The actor here…

261
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,755
Don't I look like him?

262
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,390
Well…

263
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,526
you're right.

264
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,763
Doctor, you're bad at flattery.

265
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,964
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,971
This star got a good ending.

267
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,474
"Bang!",

268
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,444
hit by a bullet.

269
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:05,651
He slowly closes his eyes
in the arms of his sworn brother.

270
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,753
"Bang!"

271
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,757
That was kind of cool.

272
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:18,931
But all I can shoot
are painkiller injections.

273
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,900
Nice one!

274
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:31,376
So, if you're in pain,
please don't hesitate to tell me.

275
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,147
That's what I'm here for.

276
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:43,222
I know I don't have much time left.

277
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:49,528
My body is my livelihood, after all.

278
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,465
I can tell.

279
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,903
The houses you built,

280
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,541
I heard they're everywhere around here,
so I went to see them.

281
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,678
They're all worn out, right?

282
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:11,717
No, they're all fine and sturdy.
You know Hiro's place?

283
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,986
I love it. The color is cute too!

284
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:22,995
Doctor.

285
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:24,997
Yes?

286
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:35,374
Your workplace. Is it a workshop?

287
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,609
It's a studio.

288
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,578
A studio…

289
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,549
What?

290
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,386
Wow! Did you make all these?

291
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,758
This is your favorite, Hiro's house.

292
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,693
You're right!

293
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,397
Wow! Oh, it's Mr. Yokobuki's bar!

294
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:02,034
It's the most worn-out one.

295
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,070
Got to take good care of it.

296
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,977
Little by little…

297
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,881
Ideas come to me.

298
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:21,486
"I'd like to do it more like this."
"I should have done it this way."

299
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,189
You keep tweaking them?

300
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:29,728
Here, the ground is soft.

301
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,098
So, I had to…

302
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,401
drive the stakes deep inside.

303
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,805
The pillars' positions too.

304
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,443
I wanted the wind
to blow through from the south,

305
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,547
so I had them shifted little by little.

306
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,184
So the wind could blow through.

307
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,120
With a mallet…

308
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,425
hitting the pillars is like music.

309
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,161
Knock…

310
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,098
Knock…

311
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,934
Knock…

312
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,037
Knock…

313
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,540
<i>One, two!</i>

314
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,143
One, two!

315
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,779
- How is it?
- Just a bit more!

316
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:21,913
All right.

317
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:23,782
One, two!

318
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,084
Okay.

319
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,586
Amazing.

320
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,423
What?

321
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:37,562
You are all over this town.

322
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,333
It's no big deal.

323
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:48,473
But I've made many memories
having lived here for so long.

324
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,346
This shop is where my wife and I

325
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,882
used to eat parfaits.

326
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,050
Parfaits?

327
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:58,984
Yes.

328
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,487
Too bad its closed down since.

329
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,458
Where did you meet your wife?

330
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,362
At a disco.

331
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,230
A disco?

332
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,167
Those dazzling…

333
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,437
sparkling lights…

334
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:20,939
So, it's there…

335
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,709
<i>where you met.</i>

336
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,625
<i>As if I were in a movie.</i>

337
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,998
That's cool.

338
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,036
Mr. Handa, that's so cool.

339
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,274
Just call me Tatsu.

340
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,445
Now that I've shown you this…

341
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,684
you and I are now buddies.

342
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,356
Tatsu.

343
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,358
You're so cool!

344
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,677
RED BEARD'S CLINIC - SHUGORO YAMAMOTO

345
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,962
Oxygen saturation at 94.
Blood pressure at 84/52.

346
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,899
37.8 degrees Celsius.

347
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,101
His fever has gone down.

348
00:23:56,168 --> 00:24:00,272
His phlegm did catch blood,
but I've never seen it so red.

349
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,341
We gave him an anti-inflammatory drug.

350
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,410
I think it'll do him some good.

351
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,414
Dad!

352
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,450
He's bouncing back.

353
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:20,859
The sudden fever may be a sign
that his cancer is progressing.

354
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,932
It's very likely
that it will happen again.

355
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:32,170
So, how many times will this happen again?

356
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,339
I can't…

357
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,374
- How long will this last?
- Stop it.

358
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,711
I happened to be on a business trip,
so I made it over.

359
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,080
But I can't just rush back from Aichi.

360
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:46,218
If I could at least know
how much longer he has…

361
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:47,919
That's enough!

362
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,455
Dad is fighting so hard…

363
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:55,193
and you dare to ask when he'll die!

364
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,196
I know that!

365
00:24:58,897 --> 00:24:59,931
Both of you.

366
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,734
Please have a seat.

367
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,615
I understand how you feel.

368
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:23,221
I believe that each of you
have your own concerns.

369
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:25,991
But…

370
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,794
so does your father.

371
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:02,861
It's okay.

372
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,498
It's okay, Dad.

373
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,170
It's okay.

374
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,608
<i>I'd like to resume treatment.</i>

375
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:21,413
Are you considering
bringing him back to the hospital?

376
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,783
His coughing has gotten

377
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,253
progressively worse.

378
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,823
He's got phlegm stuck inside.

379
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,693
He's suffering.

380
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:41,032
If you're asking for another round
of chemo, given how frail his body is,

381
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,934
I wouldn't recommend it.

382
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,236
I'm sorry.

383
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,640
I understand that, logically.

384
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:54,245
But, when push comes to shove…

385
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,248
I freak out.

386
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,153
Same thing with my mom.

387
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:08,493
I didn't make it there in time
when she died.

388
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:14,366
So, I understand how my brother feels.

389
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,204
Maybe…

390
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:26,678
I'm just trying to take out my frustration
from that day on my dad.

391
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,781
That's not true.

392
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:35,153
I only visit once a week.

393
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:40,458
But, your family
has to live with this every day.

394
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,331
No matter how much you cherish someone,

395
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,135
it's natural to feel
overwhelmed sometimes.

396
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,958
I acted lame today.

397
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:21,666
A bunch of doctors,
much younger than me, comforted me.

398
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,604
I'm so…

399
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,908
uncool, aren't I?

400
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,458
I'm sorry.

401
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:52,897
I'm sorry.

402
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:07,712
Did you have a nightmare?

403
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,857
I'm…

404
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,027
right here with you.

405
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,400
Dad…

406
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,381
Excuse me.

407
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,886
Can we get Tatsu slightly stronger
topical medication?

408
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,455
I asked Internal about it.

409
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,792
Apparently, it hurts
when he tries to roll over.

410
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,227
It might ease his breathing…

411
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:03,268
Even just a little,
I want to do everything I can!

412
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:09,607
Dr. Takino.

413
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:10,675
Yes?

414
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:14,979
It's tough, right?

415
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:31,729
Tatsu shared a lot of stories with me.

416
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:37,202
About the houses he built, and his wife…

417
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,273
They all shone so brightly.

418
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,677
It was like…

419
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:51,249
I also stepped into that world.

420
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,555
This is how…

421
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,059
I've always wanted…

422
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,330
to talk to patients.

423
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,105
It's tough.

424
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,377
I know I shouldn't say that, but…

425
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,915
It's sad.

426
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,424
I want to heal.

427
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,763
That's why…

428
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,468
I became a doctor!

429
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:01,286
We're all on a voyage.

430
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,689
Across a vast ocean.

431
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:13,264
Like it or not, the ship sails on.

432
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,533
But…

433
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,070
to join our patients…

434
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:27,111
in looking ahead to their destination
and propel the ship at full speed…

435
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,381
that we can do.

436
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,520
Giving them a better journey.

437
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,623
Until the very end.

438
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:49,934
Since you happen
to be on board the same ship.

439
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,646
Make the best of it.

440
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,323
I will.

441
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,204
Don't be too surprised.

442
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,542
Tatsu!

443
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,477
Grandpa!

444
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:33,911
- Tatsu!
- Master!

445
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:34,912
- Tatsu!
- Master!

446
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,582
What master? So high and mighty.

447
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:42,553
Tatsu.

448
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,558
The doctor suggested
having a dinner party.

449
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,633
I wanted to meet them,
the people you told me about.

450
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,102
Doc…

451
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,107
You're getting better at flattery.

452
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,510
I mean it!

453
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,378
We're buddies after all.

454
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,914
Tatsu, you doing well?

455
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,783
Tatsu, it's been a while!

456
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,051
Long time no see!

457
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,219
You look good.

458
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,294
This guys screwed up the list.

459
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,596
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

460
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,437
He's cool, isn't he?

461
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,239
Yes.

462
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,077
Isn't that a bit loud?

463
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,779
This is a disco, is it not?

464
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,248
Sorry, they only had a small one.

465
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,883
Why a disco?

466
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,086
To commemorate the time he met his wife.

467
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:51,222
What a liar. It was during a folk dance!
Such a show-off.

468
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,123
That's not…

469
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,527
It's more or less the same, right?

470
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,896
Not even the slightest!

471
00:34:58,963 --> 00:34:59,797
Guys!

472
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,444
I wonder why…

473
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,314
Even in all this fun…

474
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,619
I can't help but cry.

475
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,384
Hello.

476
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,020
You're in my favorite spot.

477
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,657
I'm sorry. It's closer than my home.

478
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,365
Botox. You can do without it now.

479
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,507
RYUJI HANDA

480
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,762
If you have anyone

481
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,367
who you'd like to see him off,
please contact them.

482
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,408
Can he still hear me?

483
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,511
Until the very end.

484
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:31,215
Your voice is surely reaching him.

485
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,254
Father.

486
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,323
Wake up.

487
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,760
Father…

488
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,831
His breathing is labored.

489
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,332
His vitals are sliding.

490
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,235
Understood.

491
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:56,340
I'll give the family time
to say their goodbyes.

492
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,789
They said it's time.

493
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:13,924
<i>Really?</i>

494
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,496
<i>Even if I leave now…</i>

495
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,666
Yeah, probably.

496
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:26,437
<i>I'm sorry you had to take care of it all.</i>

497
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,675
It's fine. I know it was hard for you too.

498
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,677
<i>You know what?</i>

499
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,246
<i>It's funny.</i>

500
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,915
At a time like this…

501
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:42,653
I was just about to have some cup ramen.

502
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,657
Really, of all times.

503
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,627
That's how it is.

504
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,530
<i>Really?</i>

505
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,199
<i>Is that so?</i>

506
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,205
Is Ryuichiro coming?

507
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,606
He's on the phone.

508
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,912
RYUICHIRO

509
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:08,813
Dad.

510
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:11,115
He wants to see you too.

511
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,250
<i>Dad?</i>

512
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,720
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

513
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,422
<i>It's me, Ryuichiro!</i>

514
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,058
Talk to your Grandpa.

515
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,693
No.

516
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,462
Kotaro…

517
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,763
No!

518
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,801
Is Grandpa going to die?

519
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,472
I'm scared.

520
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,507
I'm scared, Grandpa!

521
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,024
I'll go in now.

522
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,363
Excuse me.

523
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,118
There is no sign
of a heartbeat or respiration.

524
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,221
<i>His pupils show no response to light.</i>

525
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:07,064
Therefore, now at 11:13 a.m.,

526
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,637
I hereby confirm
that the patient has passed away.

527
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:33,324
Papa, are you crying?

528
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:41,232
<i>Why? Why are you crying, Papa?</i>

529
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,340
Doctor.

530
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,847
Thank you.

531
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,349
My pleasure.

532
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,207
It was a pleasure serving you.

533
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,435
Thank you very much.

534
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,027
You did a great job.

535
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,468
The ship has been sent off.

536
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:28,839
But…

537
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,276
Tatsu is still here.

538
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,946
All over this town.

539
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,089
And inside me.

540
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:49,893
Yeah.

541
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,616
Dr. Akaike left?

542
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,351
Yes, a long time ago.

543
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,787
Dr. Akaike was here?

544
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,456
You didn't get to see him?

545
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,392
No, he didn't tell me.

546
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:26,030
But it's him, so I'm not surprised.

547
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,536
Dr. Tokushige?

548
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,072
Look.

549
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,476
There's nothing written
on the "End-of-Life Care" page.

550
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,846
I was hesitant to ask him about it.

551
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,286
END-OF-LIFE CARE

552
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,422
Dr. Tokushige?

553
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,199
I don't know why.

554
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,936
BRAIN FUNCTION MAPPING
CLINICAL NEUROLOGY

555
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,434
I took my summer vacation.

556
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,511
<i>Welcome back, Young Doctor.</i>

557
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,846
It's been a long time.

558
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,647
<i>Dr. Takino must be lonely.</i>

559
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:53,283
- Are you okay on your own?
- I'm not so sure.

560
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,086
Why is Dr. Takino in our Surgical meeting?

561
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:59,189
You are not alone, that's my opinion.

562
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,091
You can't save lives with only ideals.

563
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,227
<i>Sometimes, patients lie.</i>

564
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,896
You're the one who taught me that.

565
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:06,797
<i>Leave!</i>

566
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,133
I won't tell you!

567
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,134
