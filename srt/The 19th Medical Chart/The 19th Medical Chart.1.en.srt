1
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:10,744
The pain intensifies when I maintain
the same posture for a long time.

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,247
When it's really bad,
I feel tightness at the back of my neck.

3
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,615
I get a headache, too.

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,419
I then feel the pain go down
my spine to my lower back.

5
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,754
"To the lower back…"

6
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,258
I sit at my desk most of the time at work.

7
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,594
It's difficult to take days off.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,898
And I'm constantly thinking
about work deadlines,

9
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,467
so I haven't slept well recently.

10
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,603
Signs of insomnia.

11
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:37,937
Um…

12
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:43,109
I think it might be osteoarthritis
or possibly, rheumatism.

13
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,478
I've seen a physician and gynecologist…

14
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,147
I see. We'll run the tests again--

15
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:51,284
The tests came back normal as you can see.

16
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,055
Stress can cause
so many issues to the human body.

17
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:59,826
Psychological stress
can even cause phantom pains in your body.

18
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,327
Phantom pains?

19
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,664
So I'm imagining it?

20
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,434
I'm just saying it's a possibility.

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,871
If you still feel pain after a month,
come see us again then.

22
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,241
<i>I'll never come here again.</i>

23
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,711
I waited two hours
for a ten-minute examination.

24
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,413
On top of that,

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,816
they didn't even tell me
what my illness was.

26
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,551
What's the point of this hospital?

27
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,619
The doctors here suck.

28
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,988
Yes, I'll be there as soon as possible!

29
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:29,923
Hey.

30
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,593
It's always like this here.
Restless and hectic.

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,695
Can't even talk to them.

32
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,501
I felt bad asking for a day off
to go to the hospital.

33
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:49,409
But I guess doctors
can never understand my situation.

34
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:53,947
Patients find it hard
to understand this, but…

35
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,515
The mobility is so much better!

36
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,916
Yes. Thanks to you!

37
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,284
Keep it up!

38
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,819
I will. Thank you.

39
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,056
We cannot treat them
without being sure of the illness.

40
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,058
Misdiagnosis causes bigger problems.

41
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,526
Are you okay? Any pain?

42
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,760
I feel much lighter.

43
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,496
- I'm glad.
- Thank you.

44
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:14,667
And by law, health insurance only covers
treatment based on a diagnosis.

45
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,137
Looks like it's going well. Keep going!

46
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,473
Keep getting examined until
you know the illness, you say?

47
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,808
You must be kidding.

48
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,944
The initial examination fee
is about 2,910 yen.

49
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,746
Your second visit costs about 750 yen.

50
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:31,217
The price is the same regardless
of the length of the examination.

51
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,719
Good job!

52
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,021
Every part of my body hurts.

53
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,856
I shouldn't complain.

54
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,458
I'm just old, that's all.

55
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,359
It's okay.

56
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:43,163
Which means we need to see as many
patients as we can to make a profit.

57
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,566
My granddaughter
is the only one who seems to care.

58
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:47,934
Look.

59
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,571
Wow, she's very cute!

60
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,441
See you next time?

61
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,809
- Okay.
- Ready?

62
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,812
- Well done today.
- Great job.

63
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,851
Ten minutes, Takino.

64
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,921
That's all we have to examine patients.

65
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,758
- My apologies.
- Okay.

66
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,808
It's cutting it close.

67
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,145
Hello.

68
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,613
I'm scared!

69
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,790
- The director's meeting is starting!
- Sorry!

70
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,293
The Department of General Medicine
is opening next week.

71
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,462
<i>People of Uotora General Hospital!</i>

72
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,797
<i>Greetings.</i>

73
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,299
<i>The general physician's job</i>

74
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,970
<i>is to see patients who don't know</i>
<i>which medical department to go to.</i>

75
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,839
<i>They determine</i>
<i>which specialist they need to see.</i>

76
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:04,344
<i>Rather than focusing on specific organs,</i>
<i>the doctor will examine…</i>

77
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,079
General?

78
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,213
As in everything?

79
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,481
KEITA KAYAMA
INTERNAL MEDICINE

80
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,850
Jack of all trades, master of none, huh?

81
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,553
Like a gatekeeper who sorts patients.

82
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:17,423
Well, it might make our lives easier.

83
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:21,995
If it means I can go home earlier,
that's all I care about.

84
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,798
<i>Patients' condition will be analyzed</i>
<i>by taking many things into account,</i>

85
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,934
<i>including family structure.</i>

86
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,637
They have us, why do they need…

87
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,338
KOKORO CHAYASAKA
CARDIOVASCULAR SURGEON

88
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,606
…a General Medicine Department?

89
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,908
<i>It's gaining a lot of attention.</i>

90
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,610
<i>This is due to…</i>

91
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,279
You're taking your sweet time.

92
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,347
If you don't hurry up,

93
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,949
the patient will die.

94
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,717
The Japanese healthcare system

95
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,788
has developed through
advanced technology and diligent research.

96
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,824
<i>However, there have been some issues</i>

97
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,228
<i>due to Japan's medical specialties</i>
<i>being divided into 18.</i>

98
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,230
Orthopedics can't treat him.

99
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,766
Our department can't do anything
for the sore throat.

100
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,135
Just a cold right?
Send him to Laryngology.

101
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,305
Thank you very much.

102
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,205
No worries.

103
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,542
<i>When doctors see patients</i>
<i>beyond their expertise and can't diagnose,</i>

104
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,613
<i>patients get referred</i>
<i>from one doctor to another.</i>

105
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:18,918
<i>Which is why we created</i>
<i>the General Medicine Department</i>

106
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,221
<i>as the 19th medical specialty</i>
<i>to solve the issue.</i>

107
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,623
Let's do this.

108
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,328
- Oh, quit it!
- No, you can't.

109
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,330
I'll buy you a drink in return!

110
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,533
Mr. Yokobuki,
you're not allowed to be out!

111
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,835
I just want to get out for a bit!

112
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,539
You need to listen!

113
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,608
What are you looking at?

114
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,345
Just observing! Keep going, please.

115
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,615
I do not recommend this hospital.

116
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,616
Oh?

117
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,819
The doctors here can't even treat colds!

118
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,061
- Ow…
- Mr. Yokobuki!

119
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,063
What are you doing?

120
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,499
I told you, you need to rest!

121
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,101
Why would you do this?

122
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,903
How long have you been a doctor?

123
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,805
This is my third year.

124
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,408
I thought so. Here, have a candy.

125
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,845
You can't even treat a cold, huh?

126
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,046
Young lady?

127
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,418
I've asked the ENT Department
to do a check-up.

128
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,954
But you're my primary doctor!

129
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,022
I specialize in orthopedics!

130
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,526
Do you know the story of <i>Red Beard</i>?

131
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,495
<i>Red Beard</i>?

132
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,065
Doctors used to help
all sorts of patients.

133
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,435
They could cure any illness.
What happened?

134
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,774
Let's go back in, Mr. Yokobuki.

135
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,242
- Could you…?
- Yes.

136
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,309
Let's go.

137
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,112
- Fine.
- Seriously, what will we do with you…

138
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,216
A doctor who can cure any illness…

139
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,619
A doctor who can cure any illness.

140
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,228
Not a pleasant expression.

141
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,797
What?

142
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,699
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

143
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,801
Really?

144
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,136
Go ahead.

145
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,307
- Excuse me.
- Hello?

146
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,775
- That man…
- Heading back now!

147
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,676
Yes!

148
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,979
Oh, dear.

149
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,282
Strange he's not here yet.

150
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,150
We got the right date, right?

151
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,019
Is it really necessary?

152
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,122
The General Medicine Department.

153
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,392
AKIKO TOYOHASHI
NURSE

154
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,293
Ms. Toyohashi.

155
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,427
Long time no see.

156
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,129
The director's mad.

157
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,136
Since he's already mad at me,
I have a request.

158
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,172
What?

159
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,507
It's already past five.

160
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,942
Go home.

161
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,112
I haven't finished organizing
the patient records yet.

162
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,285
JUNICHI YOKOBUKI

163
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,654
Mr. Yokobuki! What's wrong?

164
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,922
Mr. Yokobuki!

165
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,824
I found him soaked in sweat!

166
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,259
To Laryngology, stat!

167
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,160
Yes!

168
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,230
Hang in there! I'll bring a wheelchair!

169
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,565
Don't move him.

170
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,466
Excuse us.

171
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,369
- Check his vital signs.
- Okay.

172
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,473
Excuse me.

173
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,078
Excuse me.

174
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,650
Mr. Yokobuki, can you talk?

175
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,718
What are you doing?

176
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:42,221
We don't have much time,
so allow me to ask you some questions now.

177
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,690
Have you ever had a serious illness?

178
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,996
Wow. That's amazing at your age.

179
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,632
I had to make sure
to keep the business open.

180
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,535
Do you perhaps own a bar?

181
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,571
- What?
- How did you know?

182
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,808
In which case,
I'm guessing you drink a lot?

183
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:06,913
Yes.

184
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,748
And your family?

185
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,249
Right now…

186
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,820
Dr. Takino?

187
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,191
He lives with his wife.

188
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,594
Did you injure yourself at home?

189
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:23,796
The stairs!

190
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,965
He lives above the bar he owns.

191
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,901
He fell down the stairs
and broke his left ankle.

192
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,503
Why did you fall?

193
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,538
How is that relevant?

194
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,541
My ankle's not the problem!
My throat hurts!

195
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,809
I know.

196
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,244
However…

197
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,647
this is important.

198
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,752
It was at night.

199
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:57,163
He was thirsty, so he went downstairs
with a cup to get some water.

200
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,401
<i>Was the cup in your</i>
<i>right hand or left hand?</i>

201
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,105
Left hand?

202
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,547
<i>He tried to pick it up</i>
<i>and lost his balance.</i>

203
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,550
Ouch.

204
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:19,685
Are you okay?

205
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,289
Why?

206
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,260
Why did you drop the cup?

207
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,163
Does it matter? He needs to go to ENT now!

208
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,600
Please, tell me…

209
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,039
your story.

210
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,441
That's enough!

211
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,045
I was in pain.

212
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:47,780
What?

213
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,690
Right here.

214
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,427
I felt a gripping pain.

215
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,562
And…

216
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,798
I…

217
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,175
It kept happening recently.

218
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,912
But I'm old.

219
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,116
So I thought it wasn't a big deal.

220
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:29,855
Sore throat.

221
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,592
Gripping pain in the left shoulder.

222
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,229
Dr. Takino.

223
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,900
Dr. Hirate will be here soon.

224
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,501
I was wrong!

225
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,670
Mr. Yokobuki has a myocardial infarction!

226
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,840
IV cannulation is complete!

227
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,376
Okay! Triple-vessel disease suspected!

228
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,343
We need to hurry!

229
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,378
Yes!

230
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,550
How are the vital signs?

231
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,351
- They're stable.
- Okay.

232
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,826
Dr. Kojiro,
are you here to hang out with us?

233
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,860
I'm on standby.

234
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,062
I heard there's a high risk of bleeding.

235
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,164
Do you know what a joke is?

236
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,267
He's an orthopedic patient, apparently.

237
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,302
Aren't you curious?

238
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,003
About what?

239
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,007
About the doctor who suddenly jumped in

240
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,677
and was able to diagnose
this patient's illness.

241
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,913
Not really. I'm just here
to do my job as a surgeon.

242
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,717
JUNICHI

243
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,056
The surgery's finished.

244
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,027
It went well.

245
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,835
He's in the ICU.

246
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,806
I think he should be able to talk soon.

247
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,244
- I can't see him.
- What?

248
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,679
I…

249
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,048
I almost killed him.

250
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,517
It wasn't your fault.

251
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,788
You did what you could as an orthopedist.

252
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,556
Right?

253
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,097
But there's no point…

255
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,733
in me seeing him now.

256
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,306
GENERAL MEDICINE DEPARTMENT

257
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:40,986
<i>Today is the opening day</i>
<i>of our new General Medicine Department,</i>

258
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:45,291
here at Uotora General Hospital.

259
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,962
I'm Akira Tokushige,
the General Physician.

260
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,464
Nice to meet you all.

261
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,006
Thank you.

262
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,010
You can't end it there.

263
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,745
They're here for you, right?

264
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,647
- Okay?
- That's true.

265
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,685
Well then, Dr. Kayama…

266
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,620
of Internal Medicine?

267
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,588
What?

268
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,757
Yes?

269
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,295
Regarding Ms. Aso,
who's staying in Room 602.

270
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,165
It says here that
she has atopic dermatitis.

271
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,733
Yes.

272
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,403
Does that have anything to do
with the treatment for gastritis?

273
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,407
Well, at this point, I don't know yet.

274
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,379
Apologies.

275
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,780
It just piqued my interest.

276
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,226
GENERAL MEDICINE

277
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,177
<i>How can we do our job</i>
<i>with him fussing over small things?</i>

278
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,049
He looks into every patient
we have like a detective.

279
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,619
Thank you.

280
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:24,990
Can I help you?

281
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,892
Just observing.

282
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,529
I'm Tokushige, General Physician.

283
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,034
But how did he figure out
the myocardial infarction?

284
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,035
Is he a psychic?

285
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,770
Don't be ridiculous.

286
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,605
I bet it was a fluke.

287
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,940
A fluke, huh?

288
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,443
<i>By the way, Tokushige.</i>

289
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,479
Other doctors have complained
that you've been acting creepy.

290
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:51,016
I haven't had any outpatients,
so I wanted to do what I could.

291
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,420
Your self-introduction
gave a bad first impression!

292
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,256
You should've introduced
yourself with a bang!

293
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,158
With a bang?

294
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,728
Look at this.

295
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,034
"The 19th medical expert,
the birth of a new specialist!"

296
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,135
Sounds cool, right?

297
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,871
Director, you're so photogenic!

298
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:13,906
You're not listening.

299
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:15,808
Stand up straight!

300
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,309
Yes.

301
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,613
Doctors at this hospital
have strong personalities.

302
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,749
Try not to get overshadowed.

303
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,551
Understood.

304
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,786
And get working and see more patients!

305
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,355
I understand.

306
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,689
Do you really?

307
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,359
Of course I do.

308
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,298
With a bang…

309
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,669
Dr. Tokushige.

310
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,237
Oh!

311
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,106
I'm sorry!

312
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,173
What?

313
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,075
About Mr. Yokobuki.

314
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,946
Thank you.

315
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,448
Thank you?

316
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,252
I must've startled you,
intruding like that.

317
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,856
No. I should've been
more thorough with the check-up.

318
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:10,262
Signs of myocardial infarction
aren't too obvious even to doctors.

319
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,036
Dr. Takino.

320
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,371
Can I ask you to do something for me?

321
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,312
Another weird exercise machine.

322
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,481
It's part of the employee welfare.

323
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,785
If they can spend money
on such things, I'd rather get a raise.

324
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:33,919
I agree.

325
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,089
Sorry to bother you.

326
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,491
Dr. Arimatsu, our pediatrician.

327
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,327
- Outpatient clinic reopens in ten.
- I only need three minutes.

328
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,897
I'm Tokushige, General Physician.

329
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,434
About this boy, Saku Okazaki.

330
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,702
You're his primary doctor, yes?

331
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,939
You've been his doctor for 14 years.

332
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,441
Now, about his family…

333
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,975
Feels like a questioning.

334
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:57,876
What?

335
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,246
I can take care of my own patients.

336
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,583
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,652
I got carried away.

338
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,988
I just want to be a part of this team.

339
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,424
Our team?

340
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,659
Yes.

341
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,032
Here, open up!

342
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,836
Open up!

343
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,873
Don't you want to be a part of our team?

344
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,146
Thank you. I'll take this instead.

345
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,485
Interesting.

346
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,619
What is?

347
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:41,787
What?

348
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,188
You, Dr. Takino.

349
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,156
What?

350
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,328
Wrinkles.

351
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,763
Getting Botox there is quite painful.

352
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,467
So how is he as a doctor?

353
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,202
Well…

354
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,506
Kind of normal. Nothing unusual, really.

355
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:05,511
Although he had prepared everything
we needed for the surgery.

356
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,979
<i>Ultrasound,</i>

357
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,248
<i>electrocardiogram, nitro.</i>

358
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:13,318
He might just be a normal guy,
or a very interesting guy.

359
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,287
I can't tell yet.

360
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,427
<i>A doctor who can diagnose</i>

361
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,497
<i>unexplained illnesses</i>
<i>just by asking questions.</i>

362
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,901
<i>General Physician, Noboru Akaike.</i>

363
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,571

00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:38,210
<i>with unknown pain and discomfort,</i>
<i>that other doctors could not explain.</i>

365
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,179
<i>Around your neck and lower back?</i>

366
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,248
<i>Something catches Dr. Akaike's eyes.</i>

367
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,152
<i>Could you open your mouth wide?</i>

368
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,522
<i>How is this examination</i>
<i>relevant to his symptoms?</i>

369
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,493
<i>Will he be able to make</i>
<i>a diagnosis correctly from this?</i>

370
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,563
<i>I feel so lucky I was able to meet you.</i>

371
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,064
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

372
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,299
<i>Not at all.</i>

373

00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,422
BARBER TSUJII

375
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,973
Ouch.

376
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,241
Are you okay?

377
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,909
I'm sorry, are you injured?

378
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,477
No, I'm fine.

379
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,145
It hurts!

380
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,281
Does it hurt?

381
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,849
Let's go to the hospital.

382
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,984
Don't touch me!

383
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,353
I'm sorry.

PATIENT REGISTRATION CARD

385
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,402
Excuse me.

386
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:20,379
Do I get on people's nerves?

387
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:21,847
I don't think so.

388
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,586
It's just hard to tell
what you're thinking behind that smile.

389
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:32,491
That mysterious aspect I think
is what's reflecting badly on you.

390
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,361
Apologies for the bluntness.

391
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,501
Well, I get that it's hard
to truly understand

392
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,436
what general physicians do.

393
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,407
If you want to keep
working at this hospital,

394
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,877
you should establish a good
relationship with the chief surgeon.

395
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,348
<i>Dr. Togo and the director</i>
<i>went to the same university.</i>

396
00:21:56,415 --> 00:22:00,986
<i>They seem like they're good friends,</i>
<i>but they often butt heads.</i>

397
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,220
GENERAL MEDICINE

398
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:06,191
People seem to think that it was
the director's arbitrary decision

399
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:10,462
to create the new department which
is something we should probably dispel.

400
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,599
Reminds me of someone.

401
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,535
Wow, you noticed already?

402
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:20,238
<i>Dr. Togo and Dr. Kojiro</i>
<i>are father and son.</i>

403
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,541
No, not them.

404
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,514
The frown with deep wrinkles
in between her brows.

405
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,417
Nothing abnormal was detected.

406
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,753
It could be related to stress. Or…

407
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,422
Phantom pains?

408
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,059
I'm imagining it?

409
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,294
Sorry?

410
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,898
At least some painkillers, please.

411
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,067
That's all I ask of you.

412
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,269
Nothing else.

413
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,681
Aren't you on the night shift?

414
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,152
May I observe how you examine patients?

415
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,222
Hmm…

416
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,592
You may not.

417
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,494
- I'm sorry for asking!
- Huh?

418
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,130
I think he said it as a joke.

419
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:18,864
What?

420
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,067
I know it's difficult to tell,
but this is him trying to fit in--

421
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,569
Please. Have a seat, please.

422
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,141
- Here. Please.
- Thank you.

423
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,378
How did you know
it was a myocardial infarction?

424
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,081
I want to learn your technics.

425
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:41,853
How can I identify patients' illnesses
like a detective or a psychic?

426
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,429
I can teach you,
but you'll be disappointed.

427
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,563
What?

428
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,331
It was all just a coincidence.

429
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,001
<i>A cough unlike a cold.</i>

430
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,704
<i>Rubbing a part</i>
<i>of his body that wasn't injured.</i>

431
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,707
<i>And the smell of cigarettes.</i>

432
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,075
Cigarettes?

433
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,077
Many patients hide that they smoke.

434
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:10,749
He knew doctors would tell him to quit,
and it wasn't related to his injury.

435
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,618
Patients can lie.

436
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,923
Sometimes knowingly,
and other times unknowingly.

437
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,858
I think it was knowingly in his case.

438
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:24,930
Smoking and drinking increases
the risk of myocardial infarction.

439
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,800
Exactly. Which then suggests
the pain in his shoulder and throat

440
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,369
was referred pain from his heart.

441
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,572
So I asked Ms. Toyohashi to help me.

442
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,409
See? It was all coincidental.

443
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,278
Then, how did you know instantly
that he owned a bar?

444
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,050
Because he was wearing
a lot despite this heat.

445
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,586
And he had an old burn mark on his finger.

446
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,122
I heard people who work with fire,
tend to get cold easily.

447
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,859
And because he mentioned
he has his own business.

448
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,161
Why did you ask me about his family?

449
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,096
Why was that important, and…

450
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,801
Sorry to bombard you with questions.

451
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,170
Not at all.

452
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:07,939
I want to…

453
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,576
be better at diagnosing
my patients by myself.

454
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,647
And I want to be dependable.

455
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,684
By yourself?

456
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,686
If I could do that, I--

457
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,489
Can be a doctor who can cure any illness?

458
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,796
I feel bad saying this,
but I don't think that's true.

459
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,737
Is it because of my unpleasant expression?

460
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,171
What?

461
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,140
You told me so when we first met.

462
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,308
You said that?

463
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,810
Did I say that? No, I didn't!

464
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,078
Oh, yeah!

465
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,347
I did, didn't I?

466
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,050
It's okay. I agree with you now.

467
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,318
You shouldn't.

468
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:58,123
At that point, I was ready to dump
all the work on Laryngology.

469
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,425
I'm a doctor…

470
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,896
And yet, I was relying
on others to help my patient.

471
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,067
Sorry.

472
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,003
But what if something
like this happens again?

473
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,540
It probably will,

474
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,677
as long as you're a doctor.

475
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,878
Unfortunately.

476
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:23,448
I do not possess
the ability to identify and cure,

477
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:28,119
any disease instantly like magic.

478
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,822
No one does.

479
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,524
Do you mean…

480
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,931
doctors who can cure any illness…

481
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,968
don't exist?

482
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,709
No, they don't.

483
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,447
I understand.

484
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,650
Thank you for your time.

485
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:01,886
Dr. Takino.

486
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:10,629
Is it such a bad thing to rely on others?

487
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,768
A half-day off again?

488
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,004
I'm sorry.

489
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,373
My hands feel terribly numb.

490
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,109
I don't mean to doubt you,

491
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,779
but you're not diagnosed
with anything, right?

492
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:32,183
I get how you feel,
but can you push harder?

493
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,453
Mind over matter, you know?

494
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,790
Do they really not exist?

495
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,127
Doctors who can cure any illness?

496
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:50,301
Doctors aren't detectives or psychics.

497
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,272
RED BEARD'S CLINIC

498
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,875
<i>Ideally, they would exist.</i>

499
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,646
<i>But realistically, they don't.</i>

500
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,188
It's just my imagination.

501
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,101
Are you okay?

502
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,137
You've been off work a lot recently.

503
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,040
S-Sorry.

504
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,876
I'll make sure to meet the deadline.

505
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,315
I get it.

506
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,421
You're looking for a new job, right?

507
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,524
What?

508
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:49,294
I imagined this industry to be exciting,

509
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,898
but we're just underlings torn between
clients' demands and our bosses'.

510
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,868
I'm registered
on a job search platform too.

511
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,503
Get out while we can, right?

512
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,342
Are you okay?

513
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,178
Momo?

514
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,115
Momo!

515
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,484
What's wrong?

516
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,156
EMERGENCY ENTRANCE

517
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,133
She's awake.

518
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,100
What?

519
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,205
Ms. Kuroiwa.

520
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,673
How do you feel?

521
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,910
Work.

522
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,612
I have to get back.

523
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,981
No, don't push yourself right now.

524
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,949
Get some rest.

525
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,584
The tests we ran last time,

526
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,888
have already revealed
this isn't something life-threatening.

527
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,456
So don't worry too much.

528
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,159
Don't worry?

529
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,761
I'm in so much pain.

530
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,863
Please calm down, Ms. Kuroiwa.

531
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,899
It's due to your mental stress that--

532
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,234
Are you saying that I'm lying?

533
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,669
No, that's not what I said.

534
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,638
You're doctors, right?

535
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,407
Why can't you tell what's wrong with me?

536
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,778
I'm sorry.

537
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,551
I'm fine now.

538
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,719
- What?
- Let me go home.

539
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,588
- No, Ms. Kuroiwa--
- It hurts!

540
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,623
Everything's normal, right?

541
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,562
- Ms. Kuroiwa!
- Takino!

542
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,197
- I've had enough!
- Wait!

543
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,801
The muscles and bones may seem normal,
but there may be other issues.

544
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,603
- Please move.
- I beg you!

545
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,406
Give us one more chance.

546
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,148
Please come in.

547
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,629
I'm Tokushige, General Physician.

548
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,966
Ms. Momo Kuroiwa.

549
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,440
I'm sorry to hear about your condition.

550
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,878
You've been to many hospitals.

551
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,554
Is it too bright?

552
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,326
We still don't have curtains in this room.

553
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,067
But it's not as bad today,
compared to yesterday.

554
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,603
It's a gentler light.

555
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,943
I'm never out around this time of day.

556
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,713
Do you work late hours?

557
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,683
Yes.

558
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,051
Working overtime?

559
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,257
Do you take any medications?

560
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,696
I'll check the chart.

561
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:45,964
My apologies.

562
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,866
You must be tired of answering.

563
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:51,936
But…

564
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,574
I want to hear it from you directly.

565
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,644
Do you mind?

566
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,743
Any medications?

567
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,278
Are you taking painkillers?

568
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,316
I am, but…

569
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,220
they don't work.

570
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,756
I see.

571
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,525
But you're still taking them?

572
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,398
Which part hurts the most?

573
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,505
I'm sorry to have to ask again.

574
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,076
My whole body…

575
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,213
hurts.

576
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,050
It's so painful.

577
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:17,188
So painful that even
just sitting like this is really…

578
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,158
Ms. Kuroiwa.

579
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,693
We'll admit you.

580
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:25,830
Huh?

581
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:32,303
Do you mean I have some kind of illness?

582
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,704
I don't know yet.

583
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:36,741
What?

584
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,945
Let me put it this way.
I now know that I can't identify it.

585
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,681
Which is why I want to run some tests.

586
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,920
Some of the tests
won't come back until tomorrow.

587
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:49,954
We can check properly--

588
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,322
I can't.

589
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,758
A few of my colleagues quit recently,

590
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,127
so it's impossible
to take days off right now.

591
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,297
Also, my boss gets on us
if we work overtime.

592
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,032
And--

593
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,266
I get it.

594
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:04,535
What?

595
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,072
Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.

596
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,341
It's fine.

597
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,212
I'm sorry too.

598
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,683
But…

599
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,155
I can't take any more days off…

600
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,992
without any proof that I'm ill.

601
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:32,997
Also, if people say I'm making
a big deal out of a small matter,

602
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:34,499
I…

603
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,569
I might have to quit my job.

604
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,973
It's not something small.

605
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,578
You're in pain.

606
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,581
And it's affecting your daily life.

607
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,483
I think…

608
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,522
that is a big deal.

609
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:05,463
Let's start with a blood test.

610
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,515
Is the right arm okay for you?

611
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,488
Sorry.

612
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,822
It's no problem.

613
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,562
You've done well.

614
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,842
You admitted her?

615
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:52,944
Yes.

616
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,113
A patient with no diagnosis?

617
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,151
The psychological stress
has really taken a toll on her.

618
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:04,455
Which is another reason
why her treatment shouldn't be rushed.

619
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,824
Internal Medicine?

620
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,492
Me again?

621
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,627
Look here.

622
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,129
She's developing a stomach ulcer.

623
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:16,534
She was taking some strong pain meds.

624
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,702
It may have caused it.

625
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,438
She's hospitalized
until tomorrow so please check--

626
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,608
What's the plan involving
this many departments?

627
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,177
Dr. Tokushige,

628
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,847
surely you know how inefficient
and costly this will be?

629
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,049
- I know.
- Do you?

630
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,387
She was doctor shopping, right?

631
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,457
Going from one hospital
to another to get a diagnosis.

632
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,560
I don't think
we should encourage such behavior.

633
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,863
I don't know Ms. Kuroiwa well enough,

634
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:50,167
to be able to say she did such a thing.

635
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,607
I need more time.

636
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,343
Please.

637
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,616
What's with that face?

638
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:09,553
No one's ever fought back
against Dr. Narumi like you did.

639
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,589
We weren't fighting.

640
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,591
Discussions are necessary.

641
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,960
I couldn't do what you did.

642
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:21,766
People talk in order
to understand others' feelings.

643
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,036
And their emotional state.

644
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,240
Emotional state?

645
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:35,680
Ms. Kuroiwa was taking pain meds.

646
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:36,847
Yes.

647
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:40,084
They didn't work, yet,
she kept taking them.

648
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,256
Why do you think she did that?

649
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,359
To suppress the pain?

650
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,264
No, wait. They weren't working.

651
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,732
But she kept taking them.

652
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,135
Ms. Kuroiwa…

653
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,539
was eager to get better.

654
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,941
So she wasn't lying about the pain!

655
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,419
You know, you said, "I get it!" yesterday?

656
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:19,824
That was good.

657
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,066
Take care.

658
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,703
Hello.

659
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,245
You're a graphic designer, right?

660
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,381
I was wondering if you draw.

661
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,149
Is it all on PC?

662
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,418
That's amazing.

663
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,920
Art was not my strong subject in school.

664
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:53,491
I once drew a cat
and my teacher thought it was an alien.

665
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,194
I personally thought it was quite good.

666
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,964
- Here? Oh, I'm sorry!
- Ouch!

667
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,934
I'm sorry for the trouble.

668
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,139
Everywhere hurts.

669
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:10,908
Please don't apologize.

670
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,046
There's nothing
for you to apologize about.

671
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,688
I can't remember the last time…

672
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,192
I felt this rested.

673
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:30,728
You know…

674
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:34,832
I've loved drawing since I was young.

675
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,369
So when I got my current job,

676
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,639
I was extremely happy.

677
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:49,346
However, work was much busier
than I ever could have imagined.

678
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:55,553
I wish I could handle things
more efficiently.

679
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,189
But I couldn't.

680
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,758
I was panicking.

681
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,328
But…

682
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,264
I wanted…

683
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,971
to keep chasing the dream
I've had since childhood.

684
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,777
I get it.

685
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,885
I'm from a really rural area.

686
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:31,222
We needed to take
the bus to go see a doctor.

687
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:35,659
So my parents used to tell me
not to catch a cold when I was young.

688
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,295
That's impossible, obviously.

689
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,867
That's why I wanted to become a doctor.

690
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:49,473
To help my mom, dad,
grandparents, and even my neighbor.

691
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,709
To become a doctor…

692
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,381
who can cure any illness.

693
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:01,785
That's sweet.

694
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,823
But right now…

695
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,394
this is all I can do.

696
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,132
I'm sorry.

697
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,104
Visiting doctors while juggling work.

698
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:25,543
Being in such pain
and not being understood.

699
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,145
That's awful.

700
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,816
I'm so sorry.

701
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,755
You're in a huge amount of pain.

702
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,660
And I can't do anything.

703
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,635
Thank you.

704
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:58,876
Being heard…

705
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,479
makes a huge difference…

706
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,417
mentally.

707
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,504
<i>Ms. Kuroiwa.</i>

708
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,641
The tests came back.

709
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:37,081
And everything
was within normal limits after all.

710
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,120
Thank you.

711
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,626
So it is just my imagination.

712
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,128
I'm glad that's settled.

713
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,597
It's not your imagination.

714
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,468
I know how hard you've tried,

715
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:01,672
to live your daily life
while enduring the pain.

716
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:08,612
The X-ray, MRI, blood test,
CRH stimulation test…

717
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,951
By running these tests,
something became clearer.

718
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:20,658
You started having symptoms
six months ago?

719
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,527
Yes.

720
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,397
That day,

721
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,401
I felt feverish in the morning.

722
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,603
You thought you caught a cold?

723
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,039
Yes, but…

724
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:46,350
ALARM

725
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,169
Not bad enough to take a day off.

726
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,805
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
SJÖGREN'S SYNDROME

727
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:12,309
<i>And you've been in pain</i>
<i>for the last six months.</i>

728
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:20,517
It's like my whole body
is being stabbed with broken glass.

729
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:34,364
And on bad days, headaches and dizziness.

730
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,166
But…

731
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,471
I kept telling myself
it's just my imagination.

732
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,573
Why?

733
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,908
I wasn't always in pain.

734
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,512
And I couldn't handle it all.

735
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,482
Otherwise.

736
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,390
Sorry to ask you this,
but could you fix this up real quick?

737
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:04,828
I can't!

738
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,098
I wanted to say so.

739
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:13,370
But, I had to endure it or otherwise…

740
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,107
I would've caused trouble for others.

741
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:22,146
Sure.

742
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,818
But the pain kept getting worse.

743
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,690
It doesn't make sense, does it?

744
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,263
Why was I trying to help others?

745
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,901
When I was the one needing help?

746
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,939
I see nothing unusual.

747
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,575
<i>It's probably from stress.</i>

748
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,411
<i>Rest for now, I'd say.</i>

749
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,726
Why can't they make a diagnosis?

750
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,629
Why?

751
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,299
Why?

752
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,100
PATIENT REGISTRATION CARD

753
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,107
Why?

754
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,059
Please tell me…

755
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,803
Your story.

756
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,041
Please, tell me it.

757
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:06,750
I'm not lying.

758
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,390
I really am in pain.

759
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:18,262
But, no one seems to understand.

760
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,832
They doubted me, told me I'm imagining it!

761
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:28,105
It's starting to scare me
because it feels like I'm going mental!

762
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,544
No one believes me.

763
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,249
What am I supposed to do?

764
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,155
I believe you.

765
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,830
Your pain…

766
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:58,869
is real.

767
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,724
<i>Your job's important to you.</i>

768
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:25,796
Why would you lie
and take days off to go see a doctor.

769
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,203
But…

770
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,208
the tests came back negative.

771
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,044
Yes.

772
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,616
The fact that none of the tests
showed any signs of abnormalities,

773
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,753
has led to a diagnosis.

774
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,091
That you have…

775
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,494
fibromyalgia.

776
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,298
Fibromyalgia?

777
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,267
The trouble with this disease is,

778
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:08,805
even if we test the body parts that hurt,
no abnormalities show up.

779
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:10,640
Which is why this time,

780
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:15,012
we checked the 18 tender points,
and asked you questions.

781
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:20,250
Rheumatism and connective tissue
disease were ruled out.

782
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,755
It's very unlikely
it could be another disease.

783
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,494
The pain you've been feeling…

784
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,464
is from a legitimate disease with a name.

785
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:50,580
You figured it out.

786
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,791
I can finally…

787
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,028
tell people I have a disease!

788
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,798
Finally!

789
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,000
Finally!

790
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,573
I'm sorry.

791
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:22,012
I shouldn't be happy
that I have a disease.

792
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,290
Thank you.

793
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:40,530
Thanks to you facing your pain
and not giving up,

794
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,500
we were able to make this diagnosis.

795
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,344
It's going to take some time,
but there are ways to minimize the pain.

796
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:00,684
Do you think
you can hang in there a little longer?

797
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,159
I'm sorry.

798
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,262
What?

799
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:14,898
I…

800
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,402
I almost ran you over with my bike.

801
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:24,808
That was you, right?

802
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,111
You noticed, huh?

803
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,818
I'm so glad you didn't get hurt.

804
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:38,155
I'm so thankful.

805
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,059
So thankful.

806
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,634
Here.

807
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,635
Thank you.

808
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,343
Thanks for everything.

809
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,678
Take care!

810
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,315
Mr. Yokobuki!

811
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:11,521
I have no candy
to give you today, young lady.

812
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,424
Apologies.

813
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,493
My husband can be so rude.

814
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,262
No, I'm the one who needs to apologize.

815
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,298
- I'm--
- That doctor with glasses.

816
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,201
- Huh?
- What kind of doctor was he?

817
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:26,970
General Medicine.

818
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:31,608
That doctor told me,
you collecting information,

819
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:36,813
about my work situation and my daily life,
properly on my regular checkups,

820
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,515
was what saved my life.

821
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:42,752
Mr. Yokobuki.

822
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,855
Good luck.

823
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:47,624
Quit smoking.

824
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,434
Dr. Takino.

825
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,571
Thank you very much.

826
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,252
<i>Red Beard</i>!

827
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:20,123
I've read it countless times!

828
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,559
I probably know it more than you!

829
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,695
Let's discuss it
over a drink at your bar sometime!

830
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,907
I'm so glad to hear about Ms. Kuroiwa.

831
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,075
Me too.

832
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,745
I'll create the treatment plan,

833
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:45,782
but I might ask for your help
in case of an emergency.

834
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,451
<i>- No problem.</i>
- Thank you.

835
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:49,753
Bye.

836
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,892
You do the primary doctor's work, too?

837
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:04,501
I like the view from this room.

838
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,709
Mister, congrats on being discharged!

839
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:16,346
I thought patients' lives outside
of the clinic were irrelevant to me.

840
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,350
But they're not.

841
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,019
They're connected.

842
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:31,161
What they eat, what they do daily,
and what kind of lives they've had.

843
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,831
If we don't know
about their life's journey,

844
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,833
it's hard to diagnose them.

845
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,137
After all, we're here for the people,

846
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,007
and not the diseases.

847
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:51,781
Understanding the patient's
whole life story before diagnosing,

848
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:56,086
I don't think I can do it.

849
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,723
Not by myself.

850
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,826
But I'm not alone.

851
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,328
As long as I don't forget that,

852
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,732
I can cure any illness.

853
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,871
Sorry! Was I making a face again?

854
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,342
No, you looked good.

855
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,080
I think it's great.

856
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,885
I believe in you.

857
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,676
Thank you for coming all the way out here.

858
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,678
I know you're busy.

859
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,681
It really was far.

860
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,550
And there aren't many ferries.

861
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:05,922
Well, aren't you happy
to see your great mentor again?

862
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:09,559
You shouldn't call
yourself great, you know?

863
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:15,432
I never thought
you'd be working at Uotora Hospital.

864
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,974
A doctor who can cure any illness, huh?

865
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,580
What a grand dream.

866
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,919
I know.

867
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:38,788
It's not an ideal world.

868
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,224
We need to be realistic.

869
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:44,027
Doctors who can cure anything don't exist.

870
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,629
I'm not a kid.

871
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:55,371
You have frown lines…

872
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,174
between your brows.

873
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:06,149
<i>Admitting a patient without a diagnosis.</i>

874
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,185
Was it necessary?

875
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,521
The patient was very satisfied.

876
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,289
Let's be realistic.

877
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:17,994
Our current system became the way it is
because it was necessary.

878
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,331
Unrealistic vision can be toxic.

879
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,533
Dreams are toxic?

880
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,370
It'll start affecting other departments
and the system will collapse.

881
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:34,677
I do wonder, if it was really necessary
to create the General Medicine Department.

882
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,915
Ambition is not enough…

883
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,951
<i>to save lives as a doctor.</i>

884
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:49,225
<i>Saku!</i>

885
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:51,227
Saku!

886
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,463
Don't worry, Saku!

887
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,164
I won't let you die!

888
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:58,101
The doctors will save you!

889
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:03,106
Saku! I'm right here!

890
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:06,209
- Saku and his brother were inseparable.
<i>- I'm a bad brother.</i>

891
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,711
<i>We don't know anything about him.</i>

892
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:11,548
You can tell me. I want to know.
