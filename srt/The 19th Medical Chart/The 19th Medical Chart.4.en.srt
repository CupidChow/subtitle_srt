1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,374
I told her that the food
there is delicious.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,544
But my daughter wouldn't listen.
She's always tapping away on her phone.

3
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,114
Why are the doctors' egos here
as big as the hospital?

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,216
Even my dog listens to me more!

5
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:19,185
Could you prescribe me
a higher dose of stomach medicine?

6
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,553
I see.

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,356
I will take that into consideration.

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:27,394
But first, why don't we try to determine
the cause of the stomach ache.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,597
I just need you
to prescribe a higher dose.

10
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,234
Oh, dear.

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,570
It's good that none
of them were seriously ill,

12
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,506
but did we need to know
all that unrelated stuff?

13
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:43,943
The truth is rarely easily discovered.

14
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,582
<i>This can't be right.</i>

15
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,985
The blood sugar has not improved a bit.

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,253
Why is that?

17
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:58,491
We cut down on calories, salt,
and fat, and even switched to brown rice.

18
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:04,264
But once here, we're told
that there has been no improvement.

19
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,667
How could that be? Where did we go wrong?

20
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,504
I recognize the effort you are putting in.

21
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,773
What about you, sir?

22
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,642
What?

23
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,611
Is that all you have to say?
You're the sick one.

24
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:19,712
Sorry.

25
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:23,983
Lots of people can't help themselves
and snack at work.

26
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:28,421
Some also keep quiet during checkups
because they fear their wives.

27
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:32,425
Mr. Anjo, you were able to detect it
early and have no obvious symptoms.

28
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:37,797
However, diabetes is often taken lightly,
with people thinking they're still fine.

29
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,165
Lightly?

30
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,534
You think we're taking it lightly?

31
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,436
It was a general statement.

32
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,139
So this is my fault, right?

33
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,040
Pardon me?

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,742
He's not getting better
because I'm not doing enough.

35
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,681
Since it's a lifestyle-related disease,
If I did…

36
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,688
<i>Listen to me, will you?</i>

37
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,156
Some doctor he is.

38
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,894
It annoys me when people
turn a deaf ear like that.

39
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,501
He always looks so apathetic.

40
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,004
Didn't he learn in school
to look people in the eye?

41
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,739
Some patients they are.

42
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,978
I can't stand people
who waste my time with idle talk.

43
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,416
You're in charge of your own mood.

44
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,720
Isn't that basic etiquette?

45
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,890
Worrying is a waste of time.

46
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:42,162
Aerobic exercises boost
dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline.

47
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,733
In the end, emotions are just
a balance of chemicals in your brain.

48
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:52,272
Even bad feelings, when put into words,
are little more than data.

49
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,241
Did you lose weight?

50
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,310
Not even a bit.

51
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,211
I see.

52
00:02:58,778 --> 00:02:59,679
Here.

53
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,715
What is it?

54
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,384
Thanks.

55
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,952
Sure.

56
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,454
I'm off.

57
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,722
Take care.

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,261
I have a bad feeling.

59
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,430
KABAYAKI EEL RICE BALLS
EDAMAME SHIBAZUKE RICE BALLS

60
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,900
Which will it be? Eel or <i>shibazuke</i>?

61
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,203
Can't you just take both?

62
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,171
Dr. Takino.

63
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,072
Yes?

64
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,776
That's not what this is about.

65
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:30,810
Excuse me?

66
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,713
You general physicians
sure have a lot of time.

67
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,882
Still going with your usual?

68
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,451
Choosing is stressful.

69
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,355
He's always cutting corners.

70
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,325
A routine.

71
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,226
Yeah.

72
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:51,598
Deciding for yourself and setting limits.

73
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:55,001
Isn't that what indecisive people do?

74
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,275
- Hello.
- Dr. Kayama.

75
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,177
About Moriyama's blood culture…

76
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,212
Both sets of Gram-positive
cocci were positive.

77
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,146
I've updated the chart.

78
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,481
You're a clever boy.

79
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,582
Thanks!

80
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,754
Impressive.
Working outpatients on your own?

81
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,623
It's a lot of work, you know.

82
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,724
No…

83
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,159
My work hasn't changed
from when I was an intern.

84
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,895
Nothing but watching surgeries
and studying every day.

85
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:26,099
Want to vent to me?
It's about time we all went for a drink.

86
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,001
- You're on. Okay!
- Yeah.

87
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:34,540
Even an elite's talent is wasted
if stuck working as the queen's underling.

88
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,311
You have to be smarter with how you live.

89
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,782
Dr. Kayama, do you have a minute?

90
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,550
It's a complaint.

91
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,386
It's from Mrs. Anjo.

92
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,455
"No improvement
in six months due to misguidance.

93
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,891
Cut short our checkup,
ignored our questions."

94
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,625
What?

95
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,794
Kayama.

96
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,164
HOW TO DEAL WITH MISTAKES

97
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,835
<i>Most people soften</i>
<i>when you apologize first.</i>

98
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,370
There's been a misunderstanding.

99
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,874
The wife is very positive.

100
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,809
But the husband showed no desire to…

101
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,880
<i>When seeking empathy,</i>
<i>saying, "I need help," works best.</i>

102
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,515
I got flustered.

103
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,650
I see.

104
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,254
It happens.

105
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,022
Yes.

106
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,158
So…

107
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,229
I was thinking of asking
General Medicine for help.

108
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,799
Kota Anjo, 42 years old.

109
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,301
Diagnosed with diabetes
during a company checkup,

110
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,136
he's been seeing
an internist for six months.

111
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:41,107
Type Two, with a family history.
Lives with his wife, no kids.

112
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,843
"His wife joins him for each visit.

113
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,046
She actively takes part in his treatment…"

114
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,514
Why us?

115
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:52,418
Like I wrote, "Patient shows
no motivation, blood sugar level stable."

116
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,453
Is that it?

117
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,689
I'm counting on you, general physicians,
for the support only you can provide.

118
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,192
It's very suspicious.

119
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,259
Come on…

120
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,929
Okay, we will examine him.

121
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,464
Dr. Tokushige!

122
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,566
Thanks! I'll leave it to you then.

123
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,303
First off, Dr. Kayama will examine Kota.

124
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,006
What? How is that you taking over?

125
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,842
- What?
- No, I…

126
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:21,180
And, Dr. Takino
will examine his wife, Sachi.

127
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,582
- The wife?
- Yes.

128
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,218
The disease and the illness.

129
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:29,856
Both make people suffer.

130
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,196
GENERAL MEDICINE

131
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,804
What's with him? "Disease and illness"?

132
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,639
I don't get it either.

133
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,208
Why did you go
to General Medicine, Takino?

134
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,545
Isn't it a mundane job
where you listen to patients every day?

135
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,546
It's not mundane.

136
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,814
What?

137
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,950
As mundane as it may seem to you,

138
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:01,754
each patient I see
has their own story to tell.

139
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,092
"Announcer goes public
with hypopharyngeal cancer…"

140
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,594
"Challenge."

141
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,131
Looks like General Medicine
is getting more requests.

142
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,368
Do you think that's a good thing?

143
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,771
Revolution.

144
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,643
<i>Revolutions always involve bloodshed.</i>

145
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,512
<i>He got us all involved</i>
<i>without us knowing it.</i>

146
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,414
That sneaky guy.

147
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,820
Kayama's looking down on us!

148
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,858
But, I finally told him,
"All patients have a story to tell.

149
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,961
That's why General Medicine exists."

150
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,565
He said our job
is merely to listen to patients.

151
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,866
Is that so?

152
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,767
- What?
- I mean…

153
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,671
We don't get paid
just for listening, do we?

154
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,240
Yes, but he keeps…

155
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,374
We are doctors.

156
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,946
What do patients come to us for?

157
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,586
I was right,

158
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,289
working alongside Dr. Kayama
will be a great experience for you.

159
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:15,328
About what you said earlier. What does,
"The disease and the illness" mean?

160
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,964
A disease is an anomaly in the body.

161
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,031
An illness…

162
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,469
Give it a think.

163
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,173
You're really passionate.

164
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,110
It's the first patient
I'm examining by myself since I got here.

165
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,181
Well, I'm only talking
to the patient's family.

166
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,950
You might not be able
to call that an "examination."

167
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,488
The wife is the one
who made a complaint to Internal.

168
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,257
- A complaint?
- Yeah.

169
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,591
That's news to me.

170
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,596
Good for you. You're going
to get to listen to a lot.

171
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,168
- Mr. Anjo.
- Yes?

172
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,104
Your terms sound good to me.

173
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,539
Thank you, sir.

174
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,074
But, it's hard to decide
on an empty stomach.

175
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,043
So, how about lunch?

176
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,017
I'd be delighted.

177
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,719
It was good.

178
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,055
Glad to hear that.

179
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,697
GENERAL MEDICINE

180
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,734
I'm Dr. Mizuki Takino,
and I'm here to listen to you today.

181
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,343
Without further ado,
Mrs. Sachi Anjo. I'd like to ask you--

182
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,079
I'm not the one who's sick. My husband is.

183
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,148
Of course…

184
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:46,352
Did Dr. Kayama tell you that
my husband won't talk when I'm with him?

185
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,020
He must have misunderstood.

186
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,723
My husband won't say a word,
whether I'm with him or not.

187
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,425
- That's how he is!
- Um, excuse me…

188
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,995
Are you asking
for my support again as his family?

189
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,031
I can't try any harder
even if you tell me to.

190
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,767
I've been studying nutrition
this whole time.

191
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,570
What?

192
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,872
It's nothing.

193
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,111
Please tell me.
I'll listen to everything you have to say.

194
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,280
Your blood sugar
is still stuck at a high level.

195
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,215
Yeah.

196
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,155
Your wife said
she makes lunch for you, didn't she?

197
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,224
And you usually have dinner at home.

198
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,360
I'm grateful to her.

199
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,697
Yet, it hasn't come down.
It's about time for a prescription.

200
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:38,371
But, if I start taking medicine,
I'm afraid I might…

201
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,973
Then, can't you try a little harder?

202
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,611
Changing your lifestyle.
That's the key to treating your diabetes.

203
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,181
Sorry about that.

204
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,785
I can't believe
yours was over in ten minutes!

205
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,122
Yours is more unbelievable!
You spent two hours gathering this?

206
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,393
Sachi is trying her best.
We should acknowledge her feelings.

207
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,995
Is that a doctor's job?

208
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,600
We're here to treat his diabetes,
not provide marriage counseling.

209
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,504
I'm only doing my job as an internist.

210
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,074
I can't believe my reputation
is taking a hit over this.

211
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,377
All you did was run some tests
and input the data.

212
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,148
You can't visualize
a patient's life that way.

213
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,117
Try to empathize more.

214
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,787
Why are you enjoying this so much?

215
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,321
What do you mean?

216
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,690
Stop it.

217
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,895
What you're talking about,
I don't see it going anywhere.

218
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,396
No…

219
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:43,135
Your differences in opinion
have no bearing on your patients.

220
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,138
You're right. Sorry.

221
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,242
Kayama.

222
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,646
I have more productive
conversations to have.

223
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:57,783
Yum.

224
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,686
So good.

225
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:14,800
I figured I should stay clear
of the break room.

226
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,871
Oh, wow? Is that your lunch?

227
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,475
Taking care of your body yourself
is the most efficient.

228
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,578
Is that enough?

229
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,921
I need carbohydrates for long operations.

230
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,291
You're like an athlete.

231
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,829
I couldn't do it.

232
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,432
Yum!

233
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,271
About Mr. Hotta…

234
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,476
He's doing his best.

235
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,311
But…

236
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,149
his voice still isn't what it was.

237
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,287
I'm sure he would be happy
to see you again.

238
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,825
I've already completed
my work as his surgeon.

239
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:22,768
Dr. Tokushige.

240
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,371
Huh?

241
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,910
I want to be left out
of Mr. Anjo's treatment.

242
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:39,051
I want to hand him over to you
because I'm not very good at this.

243
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,189
Really? You know his disease well enough.

244
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:48,093
Treating diabetes starts
with proper diet and adequate exercise.

245
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,095
You have thoroughly conveyed that.

246
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,130
Yes, but--

247
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,066
And, when you ordered the blood test,

248
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,169
you made the good decision
of also testing his cortisol levels.

249
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,170
Oh, no…

250
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,272
During his next visit,
you can discuss those--

251
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,240
No!

252
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,079
I can't empathize with patients.

253
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,618
I've always been taught
to focus on efficiency

254
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,354
and getting through as many
outpatients as possible.

255
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,792
But now I've gotten a complaint…

256
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:23,996
Sorry.

257
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:30,069
I also can't keep arguing
with Dr. Takino over this.

258
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,804
Indeed.

259
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,339
There's no need to argue.

260
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,506
Yes.

261
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,109
So, I'm sorry.

262
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,079
Can you hang on until his next visit?

263
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:40,980
What?

264
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,082
He's already made an appointment.

265
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,952
Besides, I believe…

266
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,590
that you're a good doctor, Dr. Kayama.

267
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,568
CASE CONFERENCE

268
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,982
The patient came in
with a fever and a cough,

269
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,451
their C-reactive protein level was 13.5.

270
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,488
A chest CT scan revealed an infiltrative
shadow in the right upper lobe,

271
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,723
diagnosed as atypical pneumonia.

272
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,693
Due to their age
and mildly impaired liver function,

273
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,029
we adjusted their antibiotic dose.

274
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,532
Their C-reactive protein levels
returned to normal within a week.

275
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,668
We're now arranging for their discharge.

276
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,069
Could you go back a slide?

277
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,103
What?

278
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,538
Oh, okay.

279
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,241
The aorta.

280
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,276
- Yes.
- What do you mean by "yes"?

281
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:45,978
What?

282
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,079
This bulge.

283
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,848
It's definitely a lump. Did you confirm?

284
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,318
We believe it to be an aneurysm…

285
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,285
Why?

286
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,554
He's elderly,
so we decided to observe him.

287
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,355
Why?

288
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,024
His blood pressure free-fell.

289
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,093
Prepare the clamp
and look for the bleeding point!

290
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,563
Well…

291
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,238
Why are you giving up?

292
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,242
Intern, I can't see the bleeding point!

293
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,948
What are you doing?!

294
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,087
Kayama!

295
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,421
<i>Kayama!</i>

296
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,657
Aneurysms.

297
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,660
How do we treat them regardless of age?

298
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,529
Uh, well…

299
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,799
A stent graft insertion…

300
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,102
A TEVAR procedure.

301
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,005
That's correct. Don't discharge him.

302
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,073
Got it. I'll go check the contrast CT.

303
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,277
And now, we move on
to Dr. Nakagawa from Internal Medicine.

304
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,923
Thank goodness
you didn't join Cardiovascular.

305
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,968
BAD FEELINGS

306
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,472
Good work.

307
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,979
It's no big deal.

308
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,583
And Dr. Chayasaka

309
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,487
probably wanted to use me
to motivate her subordinates.

310
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,023
Sucks, doesn't it?

311
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,692
But I can't do anything about it.

312
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,128
"Can't do anything about it"?

313
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,632
I might as well give up
if I'm not up to it.

314
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,867
That's the smartest thing to do.

315
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,141
Having a parent as chief surgeon,
or a genius cardio surgeon…

316
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,911
I don't have that kind of passion.

317
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,018
I'll build up my experience
and cases here for a while,

318
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,688
then land a job at a cosmetic clinic,
giving IV drips for a living.

319
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,659
Kayama.

320
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,830
I'm sorry.

321
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,399
What?

322
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,838
I was enjoying it.

323
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,644
Just listening is not enough
to cure an illness.

324
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,449
I was ignoring reality
and spouting ideals.

325
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,222
- As long as you're aware of it.
- But…

326
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,892
I don't want to give up!

327
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,897
I may waver, take time,
and even be foolish, but…

328
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,467
I want to understand Kota and Sachi.

329
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,471
I want to cure him.

330
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,245
You are foolish.

331
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,680
I know.

332
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,485
This is nice.

333
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,888
- Wait…
- How did you…?

334
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,391
Here. These donuts are super good!

335
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,693
You found the shop alone,
without getting lost?

336
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,928
No, it's another place.

337
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,497
I want to try that too.

338
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,565
What?

339
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,801
BAD FEELINGS

340
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,338
Take a step back
and visualize the invisible.

341
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:40,445
We are surrounded by
all sorts of unseen things.

342
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:48,921
Anxiety, stress, bad feelings, and such.

343
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,323
The bad feelings Kota has.

344
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,725
And those Sachi has.

345
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,594
When you examine a patient,

346
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:59,464
there're things you can tell right away,
and those you can't.

347
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,401
Tell right away…

348
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,369
As in test results and analysis?

349
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:09,775
However, some patients can't be
treated based on that alone.

350
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,946
See the unseen?

351
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:19,184
Was Sachi always someone who liked to nag?

352
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:25,123
Is Kota naturally apathetic
and reluctant to undergo treatment?

353
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,559
We can find out by talking to them.

354
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:31,496
And then, we write it down
and go through it.

355
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,999
By doing this…

356
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,434
It becomes data.

357
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:45,410
Those who put up an extremely strong front
often have something deep inside,

358
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,646
which they try to mask from us.

359
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,652
When you deal with patients,
the harder you try,

360
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,488
the narrower your perspective becomes…

361
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,226
and you tend to see things
through a tiny lens.

362
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,194
Yes.

363
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,430
So, take a step back and widen the lens.

364
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,303
We also need to take
a broad view of the circumstances,

365
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,107
that led them to come to the hospital.

366
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,511
Family, career, and community?

367
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,316
Watching the tree
while being conscious of the forest.

368
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,986
It's very important.

369
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,318
700 FOODS & MEALS FOR DIABETICS

370
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,753
Sachi…

371
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,899
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,014
Let's take a look at your cortisol level.

373
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,184
It's higher than usual.

374
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,154
It's most likely due to stress.

375
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,724
When you are under long-term stress,

376
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,728
insulin resistance increases,
making it hard to lower blood sugar.

377
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,863
Stress?

378
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:51,236
It's the same old story every time.
You're wasting our time…

379
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,239
Excuse me.

380
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,376
Please listen to me for a bit.

381
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:04,216
About his diet,
you've put a lot of thought into it.

382
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,654
But his blood sugar hasn't improved.
Why don't we seek the cause together?

383
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,256
Go ask him yourself.

384
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,660
I believe there are things
only someone's partner knows.

385
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,896
And no one is closer to Kota…

386
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:19,998
than you.

387
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,739
Please.

388
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,554
We first met six years ago.

389
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,824
My husband was transferred to my hometown.

390
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,128
But I ended up coming back here.

391
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:56,134
My wife quit her job and came with me.

392
00:23:56,201 --> 00:24:01,606
I was bored and didn't know anyone,
so I recently started working from home.

393
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,642
So, are you alone during the day?

394
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:11,016
My job involves a lot of field work,
it's hard having to talk all day.

395
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,821
But, I'm blessed
with good people around me.

396
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,490
Although…

397
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,726
They're all nice, so…

398
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:23,762
So?

399
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:32,204
I find myself unable
to refuse all sorts of things.

400
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,339
NICE PEOPLE
CAN'T REFUSE

401
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:38,844
I thought people became
more grounded as they got older.

402
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,914
Turns out, I was completely wrong.

403
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,951
Oh yes, let me write this down.

404
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:48,453
HATES VEGETABLES

405
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,723
Wait, his meals
are vegetable-based, right?

406
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,925
Yeah, but he's trying his best.

407
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:01,333
He's always been shy.
I wonder how he can do his job.

408
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,102
But…

409
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,338
he's a nice guy.

410
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,375
BUT HE'S NICE

411
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:14,346
Well, nice guys are indecisive.

412
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:18,617
At our wedding day,
he was so nervous that he got dead drunk.

413
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,684
Really?

414
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,924
I told you. If you can't refuse,
make it alcohol-free.

415
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,292
Sorry.

416
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,060
Oh, dear.

417
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,163
Will you really make me happy?

418
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,270
I will.

419
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,476
Sachi, I'll make you happy.

420
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,413
I'll totally make you happy!

421
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,084
I was glad to hear that.

422
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,821
I promised to make her happy.

423
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,891
What a great story.

424
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:01,993
Yes.

425
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,763
It's a great story.

426
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,168
Such wonderful…

427
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,271
memories.

428
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,978
Diabetes is a common disease.

429
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,948
I thought I could manage it
if I tried hard.

430
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:28,553
Lifestyle-related diseases are complex
and thus require persistent treatment.

431
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,355
Yeah.

432
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,391
It's a dreadful one.

433
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,501
"Can't refuse," "Can't speak up"…

434
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:48,106
I think Kota has many
"can't refuse" habits piling up in him.

435
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,075
Because he's nice.

436
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:53,511
But Sachi had a nice smile
when she talked about Kota.

437
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,946
- Really?
- Yeah.

438
00:26:55,447 --> 00:27:00,051
Sachi has paid
very close attention to Kota.

439
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,421
The fact that his blood sugar
hasn't gone down…

440
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,625
not speaking up is a stresser.

441
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,960
They seemed to be on good terms.

442
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,764
I think I get it.

443
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,533
What? The disease and the illness?

444
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,205
Yeah. Kota has a disease called diabetes.

445
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:24,909
And that caused cracks in their marriage.

446
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,546
So it's not only the patient
who feels anxiety and stress.

447
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,749
And all of that makes…

448
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,586
the illness!

449
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,056
So both the disease and the illness…

450
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,290
Make people suffer!

451
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,362
Such monstrously moving lines.

452
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,666
A break room is for taking breaks, okay?

453
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,068
Dr. Tenpaku is frozen in place.

454
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,936
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

455
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,205
KOTA  / SACHI

456
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:56,841
Huh…

457
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:00,945
It looks convenient.
Maybe I should try it?

458
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,280
- Oh?
- I mean…

459
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:08,186
From a bird's-eye view,
you can see things you couldn't before.

460
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,554
You're right.

461
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,790
DIABETES - DISEASE
CAN'T SPEAK UP

462
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,758
SOMETHING - STRESS

463
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,126
CAN'T REFUSE

464
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,629
ILLNESS

465
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,197
SHY - BUT KIND - SERIOUS

466
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,943
Kota.

467
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,185
Sachi?

468
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:55,333
My dad's legs need another checkup.

469
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:01,439
I may have to use
my savings to care for him.

470
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:05,643
I see.

471
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,248
Got it, okay.

472
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:17,589
I want to ask for help from my sister,
but she has a kid.

473
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,958
She had such a hard time
with infertility treatments.

474
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,461
She's subsidized,
but had to adjust her work schedule.

475
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:28,099
Besides, she's now struggling
to decide on a kindergarten.

476
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,102
Really?

477
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,843
Yeah.

478
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,248
But that has nothing to do with us, right?

479
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,498
Hello. I'm Tokushige, General Physician.

480
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,700
Another new character.

481
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,669
Are you the "final boss"?

482
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:08,673
No. I'm just here to observe,
so don't mind me.

483
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,848
What you've told us
has brought things to light.

484
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,152
Have either of you
come to any realizations?

485
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,622
Realizations…

486
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,992
I have one.

487
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:36,301
We shouldn't be together anymore.

488
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,404
You mean…?

489
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,642
We can both agree on this one.

490
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,111
Despite usually having
completely opposite opinions.

491
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:53,351
I thought about divorce for a long time.

492
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,786
But why?

493
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:59,891
I've noticed that my husband
feels annoyed by me.

494
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:05,396
I can't help that he dislikes me
because of my nagging.

495
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,432
Yeah.

496
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,105
I'm going to go now.

497
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,811
I'm sorry.

498
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,749
This is not a place
for marriage counseling!

499
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:31,723
It's a place to confront your illness.
I ask for your understanding in this.

500
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:34,993
Sorry.

501
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,397
Hey.

502
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,936
I don't like bad feelings.

503
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,205
So I'll be clear.

504
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,112
Kota…

505
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,081
is thankful to you.

506
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,324
I didn't think it'd be such a hassle.

507
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,725
APOLOGETIC - NICE - CAN'T SPEAK UP

508
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:11,729
During our one-on-one,
you were all about being grateful.

509
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,731
Tell me…

510
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,437
why did you always frown
when I gave you lunch?

511
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,540
Are you miserable?

512
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,312
Is it that hard being with me?

513
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,646
No, it's not that!

514
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,315
Then why?

515
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,321
Kota.

516
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:40,758
I think not speaking up
is causing your stress.

517
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:48,566
When your stress hormones are high,
you're prone to gaining weight.

518
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:53,504
So, you need to sort out your
marriage issues to relieve your stress.

519
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,206
We wouldn't be struggling
if we could do that.

520
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,521
At work…

521
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,025
At work?

522
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,132
At work…

523
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,771
I have to go out with people,
so I can't help…

524
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,474
but dine out.

525
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,643
You're a sales rep.

526
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:37,015
But you wrote down
your evening meals, right?

527
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,425
So…

528
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,294
what about lunch?

529
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,165
He has handmade lunchboxes.

530
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,540
You threw them out without eating them?

531
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,575
I do eat them.

532
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,144
But you dine out!

533
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,815
After dining out, I'd eat them.

534
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,652
So it's a double lunch.

535
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,722
That's why his blood sugar didn't go down.

536
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,590
Why didn't you tell me?

537
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:20,491
I couldn't.

538
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,392
Why?

539
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,794
Sachi…

540
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,696
You're trying so hard.

541
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,300
Besides…

542
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:33,337
May I ask, does your family
have anything to do with it?

543
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,508
Your father was a diabetic, right?

544
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,083
Yes, I watched my dad go through it.

545
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,219
Kota…

546
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,326
please tell me about it.

547
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,074
A life riddled with restrictions…

548
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,444
that my mom had to put up with.

549
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:19,150
I was afraid that Sachi
may suffer the same fate.

550
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,722
DAILY HIGHLIGHT
STEPS: 9,821

551
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,396
Having kids.

552
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,232
Growing old.

553
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,602
All of it.

554
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,604
Absolutely all of it!

555
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,574
I'm scared.

556
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,582
I thought I should
just tell them I'm sick.

557
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,717
Here you go.

558
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,654
But I feared no one would understand.

559
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:02,426
I feared that I'd ruin their mood.

560
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,064
I'll dig in.

561
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:08,799
<i>Honestly…</i>

562
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,503
I've grown to hate myself.

563
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,477
I've grown weak and sluggish.

564
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,349
I'm sorry, Sachi.

565
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,954
Sorry for what?

566
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,090
You always say that.

567
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:35,726
Even then…

568
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,895
Even then?

569
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,370
I'm sorry.

570
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:55,746
I'm sorry.

571
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,584
If only I hadn't had that health checkup.

572
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,121
Why do you think that?

573
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:09,427
Because I've caused her enough trouble.

574
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,196
I dragged her into it.

575
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,968
Because she married me.

576
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,007
Are we getting…

577
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:25,710
a divorce?

578
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:31,015
That's for your own sake.

579
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:35,253
You're despicable!
I hate it when you're like this!

580
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,893
I was always the one talking,

581
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:46,430
you just look confused and stay quiet!

582
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,968
You never tell me anything!

583
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,804
Why?

584
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,341
Why?! Just say something!

585
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:58,643
Hey!

586
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,579
But!

587
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,581
Sachi…

588
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,684
You get angry!

589
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,021
I don't want to make you angry!

590
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,225
I love you…

591
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,763
I don't want…

592
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,035
to be the one making you sad.

593
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,846
I don't want to make you sad…

594
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,887
I couldn't speak up.

595
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:51,762
Because it's all
my fault for getting sick.

596
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,732
That's why…

597
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:05,576
You have your own life to live, Sachi.

598
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,913
Yes, you're right.

599
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,051
I have a life of my own.
That's an obvious fact.

600
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,854
You're so annoying…

601
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,058
So,

602
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,095
let me just say one thing.

603
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,701
You are already…

604
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,637
part of my life.

605
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,913
Mr. Anjo.

606
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:51,722
When you get ill, your feelings
and thoughts become unstable.

607
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,694
Both you and your family.

608
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:04,902
When you live with someone,
you can pass each other by.

609
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,972
The hassles also grow.

610
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,841
However…

611
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:19,950
having someone beside you
can also give you warmth.

612
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:22,553
Even if…

613
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,592
it's only a little bit of warmth.

614
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,945
Please don't give up on speaking out.

615
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:55,586
Even the tiniest efforts
can make a huge difference.

616
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,794
Please tell us.

617
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:15,706
Tell me.

618
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,110
I want to hear…

619
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,647
your story.

620
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,490
I lied to you.

621
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:36,594
Sachi…

622
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,365
I said I'd make you happy.

623
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,934
I lied.

624
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,075
I'm sorry.

625
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,181
I broke my promise.

626
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:03,821
But…

627
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,423
But…

628
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,459
Even so…

629
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,662
Even so…

630
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,333
I want to be with you!

631
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,954
I'm sorry.

632
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,026
Stop that.

633
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:14,592
Kota informed
his company about his illness.

634
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:15,492
Really?

635
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,696
Their reactions
were apparently underwhelming.

636
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:22,399
Someone even came up to him
and said they had high cholesterol.

637
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:29,740
What patients expect from us doctors…

638
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:36,213
is for us to cure their illnesses.

639
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,652
Indulging in ideals can't heal anyone.

640
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,924
It is a very important step.

641
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,964
Kayama!

642
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:55,599
Hey.

643
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,302
Don't just throw it.

644
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,904
Thank you.

645
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,575
I'm glad we worked together.

646
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,514
Me too.

647
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:12,616
Kayama…

648
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:16,286
I'm glad I didn't get downrated.
That was close.

649
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:17,821
Can I have that drink back?

650
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,824
General Medicine is kind of a mundane job,
it takes a lot of time too.

651
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,193
I think you're foolish to join it.

652
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,135
But maybe…

653
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,271
I was kind of jealous of you.

654
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,116
Good work.

655
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,898
What kind of doctor do you want to be?

656
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,735
It's obvious.

657
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:12,142
I'm going to give IV drips for a living
at a brand-spanking-new cosmetic clinic!

658
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,113
What a nice dream.

659
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:23,053
<i>The atmosphere in this hospital</i>
<i>is clearly different from before.</i>

660
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,188
Take care.

661
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:28,892
Should this be seen
as a transformation or a distortion?

662
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,862
I'm still not so sure myself.

663
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,765
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

664
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,267
As the next Head of Surgery.

665
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,344
<i>You can go home if you want.</i>

666
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,912
There's an 80% chance you'll die.

667
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,748
<i>Dr. Chayasaka is a genius.</i>

668
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,616
She won't say anything about herself.

669
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,852
<i>- She said her daughter works at Uotora.</i>
<i>- Her daughter?</i>

670
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,653
<i>It's definitely affected her.</i>

671
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,589
<i>Why can't you do as you are told?</i>

672
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,291
To see things they are ignoring…

673
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,994
<i>Caring for patients</i>
<i>is all about technique.</i>

674
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,896
Insincere kindness.

675
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:08,966
Let's talk with all our cards
out in the open?

676
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:09,967
