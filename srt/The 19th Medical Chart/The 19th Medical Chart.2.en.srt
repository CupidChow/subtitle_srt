1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:04,871
GENERAL MEDICINE DEPARTMENT

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,973
<i>The general physician's job</i>

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,610
<i>is to see patients who don't know</i>
<i>which medical department to go to.</i>

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,013
<i>They determine</i>
<i>which specialist they need to see.</i>

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:16,082
<i>He looks into every patient</i>
<i>we have like a detective.</i>

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,984
<i>I want to learn your techniques.</i>

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:22,389
How can I identify patients' illnesses
like a detective or a psychic?

8
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,557
<i>Is it really necessary?</i>

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,127
<i>The General Medicine Department.</i>

10
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,964
Heart rate below 30,
can't read the blood pressure…

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,666
- Blood oxygen at 78 percent…
- Saku! I'm right here!

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:37,937
- Intubate, quickly!
- I will, but his heart's barely beating.

13
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,609
Saku…

14
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,477
- Chest compressions!
- Got it!

15
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,680
Saku, can you hear me?

16
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,382
- Saku…
- I've set it to 150!

17
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,717
- Adrenaline!
- Got it!

18
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,052
Saku…

19
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:53,386
<i>When Saku was born,</i>

20
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,924
<i>I became a big brother.</i>

21
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,028
Saku had a weak heart.

22
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,232
He fought off countless illnesses.

23
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,271
Still, he was always cheerful.

24
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,574
Everyone…

25
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,977
loved Saku.

26
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,816
And yet…

27
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,288
he caught a summer flu.

28
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,560
The gods are cruel.

29
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,363
But…

30
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,699
I guess it was inevitable.

31
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,504
I'm…

32
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,907
a bad brother, after all.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,115
How's Saku?

34
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,121
The nurses are cleaning him up.

35
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,389
Saku…

36
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,326
Why?

37
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,871
I've been treating Saku since he was born.

38
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,039
14 years.

39
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:25,278
Pediatric patients
are minors aged zero to 18.

40
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,249
Many of them graduate around age 15.

41
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:35,288
I would have loved to have
treated him until he came of age.

42
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,759
No matter how many operations he had,

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,295
he fought so hard,

44
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,565
always cheerful and frank…

45
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,638
I'll never see his smile again.

46
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:59,579
I am a doctor.
I have to do what I have to do.

47
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:04,951
I'm the no-nonsense Dr. Arimatsu,
Head of Pediatrics, a middle-level…

48
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:06,986
More like,

49
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,891
a middle-aged manager, aren't I?

50
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,563
Everyone lives
with the roles they've been given.

51
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,199
Don't they?

52
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,669
Saku Okazaki, aged 14.

53
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,838
He was admitted for a fever
and breathing difficulties.

54
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:29,042
His condition worsened
while awaiting his blood test results,

55
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,910
and he was taken to the ER.

56
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,379
He was administered oxygen and IV fluids,

57
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,648
but his blood pressure kept dropping.

58
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,785
When his heart stopped,
we tried to resuscitate him,

59
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,720
but to no avail.

60
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,621
Excuse me--

61
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,022
Can I ask one question?

62
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:43,923
Yes.

63
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:49,128
Saku's father, Koji, is taking opioids
to treat his lower back pain.

64
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,029
Given his mental--

65
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,032
Takino! That's orthopedics.

66
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,801
Nothing to do with Dr. Arimatsu.

67
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,637
I just wanted to let everyone know.

68
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,974
You got another mark against you.

69
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,942
And that concludes our conference.

70
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,444
Excuse me.

71
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm Tokushige, General Physician.

72
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,915
I know.

73
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,618
I'd like to go over the course of events.

74
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,353
He came in during the day--

75
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,721
Going detective again?

76
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,091
He had a congenital heart disease

77
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,226
and had undergone
two major heart surgeries.

78
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,663
But, he couldn't handle the infection.

79
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,165
Well, that is true.

80
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,601
You can look into it as much as you want.

81
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,205
The truth is, he couldn't be saved.

82
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,643
Despite that, I faced Saku Okazaki
during all his treatments,

83
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,545
right up until his death.

84
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,749
That's all.

85
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,285
- Dr. Arimatsu.
- Yes?

86
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,587
Oh, this is a port-a-cath…

87
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,222
- Yes.
- How is it?

88
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,933
3:00 p.m. is still within
normal work hours, right?

89
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,602
What?

90
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,239
Koji Okazaki, Saku's father.

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,744
His records suggest that he works
endlessly despite having lower back pain.

92
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,645
Yes.

93
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,516
He got divorced two years ago,
the mother is out of the picture.

94
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,553
So, who had been staying with Saku?

95
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,688
<i>His brother.</i>

96
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,792
<i>Saku and his brother were inseparable.</i>

97
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,161
<i>He's kind and very dependable.</i>

98
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,898
But is what you're asking
related to Saku's sudden deterioration?

99
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,966
No, it's not.

100
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,635
It's not, but…

101
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,106
I'm sensing something.

102
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,476
I'll look into this too. I can ask around.

103
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,144
That would really make you a detective.

104
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,279
But…

105
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,413
Thank you.

106
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,218
I appreciate your concern,
I know you must be busy with orthopedics.

107
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,821
Please don't push yourself.

108
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,595
Hm?

109
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm going…

110
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,103
to become a general physician!

111
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,674
Oh, I see.

112
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,743
"I see?"

113
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,946
I mean, changing specialties
is a big deal.

114
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,415
Take your time.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

115
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,916
Wait!

116
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,422
I want to be a doctor just like you!

117
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,259
What does that look mean?

118
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,828
Well, you see…

119
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,264
Yeah…

120
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,705
GENERAL MEDICINE

121
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,347
Saku

122
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,650
liked sweet rolled omelets.

123
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,288
Eat up.

124
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,857
You'll need the stamina to work.

125
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,661
Let's dig in.

126
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,532
I'm Tokushige, General Physician.

127
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,735
First, I'll go through your symptoms,

128
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,938
and then I'll refer you
to the appropriate specialist.

129
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,808
You're not going to treat me?

130
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,912
Here at General Medicine, we help those
who don't know where to go,

131
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,015
and also those with multiple symptoms.

132
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,519
If needed, I will refer you
to a headache specialist.

133
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,824
Could you tell me your story?

134
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:44,730
I'm sorry, but I'd like to see
a specialist from the get-go.

135
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,271
Arimatsu, the food fighter,
going straight for reflux esophagitis.

136
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,408
We have a board meeting.
I need to work on the expenses.

137
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:59,545
I don't have as much time
as the General whatever department.

138
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,514
He bothered you, asking about Saku.

139
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,785
It annoys me when unrelated questions
prolong a conference.

140
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,488
What was the director thinking.

141
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,857
- Whoa!
- My bad.

142
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,793
You're making the same face as Dr. Takino!

143
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,961
Takino?

144
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,563
Takino…

145
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,865
WITHDRAWAL LETTER - MIZUKI TAKINO

146
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,666
<i>He got away.</i>

147
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:25,605
What can I say?
General Medicine is not well-known.

148
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,508
If you keep looking through
other departments' records,

149
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:32,411
sooner or later, they'll call you
the "Phantom Patient Thief."

150
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,380
You've got too vivid an imagination.

151
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,617
It's only been a month.

152
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,520
I have to steadily work
on earning their trust.

153
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,924
How will you do that when you don't
even have any patients who trust you?

154
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,593
Here comes one!

155
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,563
Tokushige.

156
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,467
"Phantom Money Grubber."

157
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,569
You'll make Shigeru Mizuki mad.

158
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,803
Wow!

159
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:02,141
This unused break room
was given a marvelous makeover!

160
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,943
It's got curtains…

161
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,178
They block the sun--

162
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,246
They cost 30,000 yen.

163
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,147
What?

164
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,785
I presume you've been asked,
"Why a General Medicine Department?"

165
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,289
Please look at the long-term…

166
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,724
You should welcome Dr. Takino on board.

167
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,595
Since we don't have enough
general physicians to begin with.

168
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:27,266
Out of all medical school graduates,
only three percent choose this path.

169
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,436
I am grateful she feels that way.

170
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,239
Overseeing young doctors
is also part of your job.

171
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,741
You're of a good age now.

172
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,511
No…

173
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,713
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

174
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,418
Forget about General Medicine.

175
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,654
News really does spread fast.

176
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,791
Why would anyone
want to start from scratch?

177
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,428
Besides, it covers all 18 departments.
You treat everything.

178
00:09:56,295 --> 00:10:02,868
You'll only end up assisting
other doctors as a diagnostic clerk.

179
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,637
You don't get it.

180
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:08,908
General physicians engage
more deeply with patients' lives.

181
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,510
Saying "Yes" and "Sorry" to everything.

182
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,411
What?

183
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,780
That's our role as newbies.

184
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:19,118
If you stray from that, you're toast!

185
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,591
Roles…

186
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,166
Dr. Tokushige!

187
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,670
Can I join you to the station?

188
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,904
What?

189
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,740
I want to talk to you.

190
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,975
I don't want to intrude though.

191
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,145
Sure. Let's go.

192
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,648
Coming!

193
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,817
FOR PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS

194
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,387
This one's pretty fast, isn't it?

195
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,122
Will we make it?

196
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,325
Dr. Tokushige,
the station is the other way!

197
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,628
Where are we?

198
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,597
This is what I always do.

199
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:13,172
Finding things like this is why
I can't stop interacting with the town.

200
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,210
Are you free today? I'll get you one.

201
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,111
No, I can…

202
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:23,616
It's fine. I'm already of a good age.

203
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,588
Two cheesecakes will be 740 yen.

204
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,091
- Here's the exact change.
- Great.

205
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,361
I haven't seen Saku lately.
How has he been?

206
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,066
You should give him these!

207
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,335
Thank you.

208
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,804
- He likes them, right?
- Yes!

209
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,705
Good, here you go.

210
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,241
It's delicious.

211
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,944
I've never eaten
with anyone outside of the hospital.

212
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,013
They're all busy.

213
00:11:54,747 --> 00:12:01,020
There is that, but I'm new here,
and they are all in managerial positions.

214
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,955
We can't get over our respective roles.

215
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,358
Roles, huh?

216
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,261
Run away!

217
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,196
Transform!

218
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,502
Hey, you know those
children's shows with the heroes?

219
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,803
Yes.

220
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,606
They always make me wonder…

221
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,780
<i>Is a hero still a hero when they're alone?</i>

222
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:34,286
And is a villain
still a villain when they go home?

223
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:40,259
<i>People are not just one thing.</i>

224
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,899
A 24-hour pediatric emergency system?

225
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:47,800
Yes.

226
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,670
As you all know, Kamisaka Hospital
has closed its pediatric department.

227
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,842
If these cutbacks continue,
there will be even more cases

228
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,846
where children with sudden fever outbursts
are unable to seek treatment.

229
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,683
I know that pediatrics
don't generate much revenue,

230
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,486
but it is part
of our social infrastructure.

231
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:12,725
Wouldn't it be a complete loss
if the hospital goes under?

232
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:18,798
We cannot keep funding departments
that continue to incur losses.

233
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:25,070
All that matters for us is efficient
and accurate medical care.

234
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,442
Ideals alone cannot save lives.

235
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,014
I believe you have all heard that before.

236
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
- Stretch your back.
- Okay.

237
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,887
Looking good.

238
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,591
My old man often carries
heavy things at work.

239
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,993
What should he look out for?

240
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,263
You should bend your knees and squat.

241
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,166
Then, lift with your whole body.

242
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,701
You have a strong core, Doc.

243
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,169
I used to do judo.

244
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,804
Oh, really?

245
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,608
I'll go get some water.

246
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,576
Thanks.

247
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,778
Shall we do it again?

248
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,679
Yes.

249
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,369
Do you like them?

250
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,171
- What?
- Those.

251
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,673
Oh?

252
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,742
They're kind of nostalgic.

253
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:41,046
I used to love watching it
every evening after kindergarten.

254
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,184
But wasn't it a morning show?

255
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,789
It was a rerun, I guess.
I wasn't born yet during its first run.

256
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,693
- Unfortunately.
- I see, a rerun.

257
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:59,198
These stickers,
the cake shop near Heiwa Central Park,

258
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,600
is giving them away
as part of a collaboration.

259
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,571
Really? Maybe I should check it out.
I have a sweet tooth.

260
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,640
Saku…

261
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,177
My brother also had a sweet tooth.

262
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:18,951
We used to walk by there all the time.
We'd buy cake after going to the hospital.

263
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,225
My old man is waiting.

264
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,567
HERO WING RERUNS

265
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,304
HERO WING RERUNS AFTER 12 YEARS!

266
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,348
Dr. Tokushige. Can I have a moment?

267
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,350
Of course.

268
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,754
I heard from Dr. Narumi.

269
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,124
What issues do you have with my treatment?

270
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,492
That's not…

271
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,264
Please tell me if you know
a way Saku's life could have been saved.

272
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,335
Still, I may argue against it.

273
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,271
No, that's not it at all…

274
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,942
I don't have any doubts
about the way you treated him.

275
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,244
Then why are you asking around?

276
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,680
Doctor…

277
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:28,220
could you give me a chance
to speak to his brother for a bit?

278
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,089
Why?

279
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,125
Saku was rushed in at 3:00 pm.

280
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:39,598
At that time,
they should be at work or school.

281
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,435
There are jobs
where you can set your own hours.

282
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,339
I had a chat with him
about a <i>tokusatsu </i>show just now.

283
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,574
What?

284
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,811
And then, he told me
that he watched reruns in the evening.

285
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,413
When I looked into it…

286
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,219
This show's reruns were 12 years ago.

287
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,522
He said he was in kindergarten then.

288
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,225
He'd be around three to five.

289
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:13,098
How old is Saku's brother now?

290
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:20,472
<i>He lived his life in Saku's shadow.</i>
<i>We don't know anything about him.</i>

291
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,842
<i>Not even his job or age.</i>

292
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,548
I believe that his big brother,

293
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,219
is hiding something
behind his gentle smile.

294
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:41,126
But we can't meddle
in others' affairs if they didn't ask us.

295
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,995
I agree with that.

296
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,198
A doctor's job is to treat patients.

297
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:51,670
After that, social workers
will provide for their welfare.

298
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:53,705
But,

299
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,542
I saw it.

300
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,812
<i>His smile was so forced,</i>

301
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,448
<i>it read, "I've got to smile."</i>

302
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,712
Saku…

303
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:55,968
Mr. Okazaki!

304
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,736
Taku Okazaki!

305
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,080
Excuse me.

306
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,651
Are you okay?

307
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,556
You're looking better.

308
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,991
Can you drink?

309
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,632
I was told to check his kidneys.
Is it heatstroke?

310
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,170
I'm off today.

311
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,338
You go looking for patients
even on your days off…

312
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,239
Hey.

313
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,140
But…

314
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,379
Understood.

315
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,716
- An ER heatstroke patient is coming in.
- Got it.

316
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,587
TAKU OKAZAKI

317
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,389
Taku Okazaki?

318
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,394
Born on July 23rd, 2007.

319
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,396
(AGE 17)

320
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,097
He's 17.

321
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,403
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

322
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,873
Sorry for troubling you.

323
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,442
Heatstroke is scary.

324
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,945
A high fever causes muscle damage,

325
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,747
and in severe cases,
can lead to kidney failure

326
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,783
putting your life at risk.

327
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,621
I know. I'll be more careful.

328
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,225
The taxi fare--

329
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,261
It's okay. It was an emergency.

330
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,698
I'll bring it the next time
my old man has an appointment.

331
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,399
Mr. Okazaki…

332
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:39,838
So as not to confuse you
with your father, may I call you Taku?

333
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:41,640
I don't mind.

334
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,475
So, Taku…

335
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:50,249
Would you mind dropping by
once or twice a month?

336
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,287
I'd like to speak with you.

337
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,426
Why? I'm not sick.

338
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,864
Thank you so much. I'd better get going.

339
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,104
Are you okay?

340
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,908
Sorry, I stumbled.

341
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,915
Why?

342
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,618
My legs…

343
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,754
I can't move them…

344
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:30,822
I'll call your dad--

345
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,190
Please, don't!

346
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,164
I don't want to make my old man worry.

347
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,170
We'll call him.

348
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,610
You're still underage.

349
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:58,150
Those who care for you
are obliged to know your health status.

350
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,528
Is it a residual effect
from the heatstroke?

351
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,930
Not according to the blood test.

352
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,333
No obvious abnormalities
at the bones or joints.

353
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,734
Neurologically speaking,

354
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:19,338
both his lower limbs' muscle strength
has fallen to about MMT One or Two.

355
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,074
No other abnormalities were observed,
including deep tendon reflexes.

356
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,144
There's a low chance
of orthopedic disease.

357
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,014
Then it should come under neurology.

358
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:30,782
I'm concerned.

359
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,883
What?

360
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,953
When he's alone…

361
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:39,291
it's as if he's not even there,

362
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,527
letting his presence vanish into thin air.

363
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,897
When he's with someone,

364
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,934
he does all he can
to act like a big brother.

365
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,303
To the point of…

366
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,905
calling his dad "old man."

367
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:59,211
Dr. Tokushige, can we just focus
on the patient's symptoms?

368
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,446
You're right.

369
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,554
Excuse me, let me clear this up.

370
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,690
It's okay. Leave it.

371
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,403
Dr. Tokushige…

372
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,073
could you check on him?

373
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,112
Perhaps I've been…

374
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:38,083
turning a blind eye to Taku all along.

375
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,652
Since there's nothing I could do.

376
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,524
I've known him since he was little.

377
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,196
"As if he's not there"…

378
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,167
Even I am at fault
for making him feel like that.

379
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,475
Please.

380
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,648
Okay.

381
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,387
Thank you.

382
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,125
I've always eaten alone.

383
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,295
I'm really happy.

384
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,097
Your sandwiches look delicious.

385
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:32,270
Dr. Arimatsu, would you
like to join me for the checkup?

386
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,972
But, I…

387
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,809
There is someone worrying about him.

388
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,414
Taku needs to know that now.

389
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,689
Can I come in?

390
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,129
Are you sure you don't want me
to come with you to the hospital?

391
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:03,101
Go work hard. I'm fine.

392
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,804
I see.

393
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:07,806
Sorry.

394
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,191
Today, allow me to speak to you
as a general physician.

395
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,628
Once again, I'm Tokushige from--

396
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,662
When…

397
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,532
will I recover?

398
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,537
I have to get better quickly.

399
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,439
You have to get better?

400
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,441
Yes.

401
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,012
My old man is still depressed over Saku.

402
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,948
And now me…

403
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,151
We understand what your father
is going through.

404
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,120
We also understand about Saku.

405
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,791
So, Taku…

406
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,530
How have you been?

407
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,602
Well, I…

408
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,741
I…

409
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,986
That day, it was really hot, right?

410
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,725
One might hesitate to go out.

411
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,895
Did you have any plans?

412
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,699
No plans?

413
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,237
Even when I'm alone at home…

414
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,741
I don't know what to do.

415
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,480
I used to go on walks with Saku.

416
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,118
It's how I spent every day.

417
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,089
And so, that…

418
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,857
What about the cake shop?

419
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,802
Yes.

420
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:24,442
Their cheesecake was Saku's favorite.

421
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,080
He loved the lemon flavor.

422
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,451
The staff were also nice to him.

423
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:36,655
Saku…

424
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,825
was a very popular person.

425
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:48,299
He could get along
with anyone with just a smile.

426
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,037
He was really…

427
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,412
loved by everyone.

428
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,652
Taku.

429
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:10,955
You've…

430
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,025
always worked really hard.

431
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,629
I'm sorry…

432
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,568
for never saying anything to you.

433
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,574
Doctor…

434
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,877
you don't have to apologize.

435
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,014
I'm…

436
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,817
a bad brother.

437
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,621
But, Taku…

438
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,391
Because…

439
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,697
deep down…

440
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,907
I was relieved when Saku died.

441
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,731
I'm sorry.

442
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,709
It's okay to say that.

443
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,416
Tell me…

444
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,420
your story.

445
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,727
When Saku was born…

446
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,197
I was so happy.

447
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,982
Hello. I'm Taku.

448
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,252
So little.

449
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,087
But…

450
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,391
why are there so many machines?

451
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,826
Is he in pain?

452
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:28,927
Taku…

453
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,097
You must protect him.

454
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,999
Promise me.

455
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,435
I promise.

456
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:48,880
That's when I became a big brother.

457
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,720
He kept going under
the knife all his life.

458
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,590
Both Mom and Dad
were busy working all the time.

459
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,794
That left me together with Saku.

460
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:08,066
Such was my everyday life.

461
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,136
I'm not going to be
the only one who accompanies him

462
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,105
and foots the medical bills!

463
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,808
We can't cut back anymore!

464
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,009
I know…

465
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:22,380
The hero comes
to beat up the evil monster.

466
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,582
Wham!

467
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,517
"Stop it!"

468
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,286
Thump!

469
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,188
<i>But…</i>

470
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,060
I'm no hero.

471
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:39,831
STUDENT WITHDRAWAL LETTER

472
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,766
Is he sure about this?

473
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,303
Couldn't you think this through, ma'am?

474
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,973
I know he's skipped lessons
and can't keep up…

475
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,608
I'm a monster.

476
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:53,878
Monster?

477
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:59,517
Because I wished
for everything to be destroyed…

478
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,488
Taku, I'm sorry.

479
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,130
My mother…

480
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,266
never came back.

481
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,477
Why?

482
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,513
Why did she run away?

483
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,817
Leaving everything to me?

484
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,186
I'm…

485
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,188
I'm…

486
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:12,890
No…

487
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,403
I'm relieved that you've told me…

488
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,840
your true feelings.

489
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,285
Please tell me.

490
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,224
I want to hear

491
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,094
your story.

492
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,241
I suffered the whole time…

493
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,345
I wanted to get away!

494
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,249
But…

495
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:13,985
But!

496
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,157
I…

497
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,727
I loved Saku.

498
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:32,270
He was adorable and precious.

499
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,406
And yet…

500
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,709
I dared to think that.

501
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,749
To feel relief that Saku died…

502
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,659
I'm a monster.

503
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,533
I was his big brother.

504
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,570
I was his big brother!

505
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,573
A big brother has to do all he can!

506
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,641
Why…

507
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,112
Why?

508
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,382
Why did I…

509
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,321
You're not a big brother.

510
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,392
You are…

511
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,063
Taku Okazaki.

512
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,869
Taku, the hero.

513
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,171
Taku, the monster.

514
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,975
Together…

515
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,511
they make Taku Okazaki.

516
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,550
That's enough.

517
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,855
The hero

518
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,191
and the monster,

519
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:01,926
are me.

520
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,664
<i>Taku!</i>

521
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,219
Taku!

522
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,505
Saku…

523
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,760
Saku…

524
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:54,739
Hands trembling when nervous,
or freezing out of fear.

525
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,440
Do you have any of those?

526
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,978
You may not think of it,
but a person's feelings,

527
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:05,149
mind, and body are very interconnected.

528
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,855
That also applied
when your feet stopped working.

529
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,860
Your brain was unconsciously
putting the brakes on your body.

530
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:20,598
We call this
Functional Neurological Disorder.

531
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,968
FUNCTIONAL NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER
PARALYSIS, ETC. CAUSED BY MENTAL CONFLICT

532
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,270
Can you try to stand up?

533
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,121
It's okay.

534
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,933
Repeat after me.

535
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,938
My legs are here.

536
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,409
My legs are here.

537
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,415
Good. You're getting stronger.

538
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,185
Here we go.

539
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,455
I can stand up.

540
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,524
I can stand up.

541
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:39,276
When you're scared,
think of it as hitting the brakes.

542
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,213
It's important to be aware of it.

543
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,861
My legs are here.

544
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,530
Yes.

545
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:02,933
I can…

546
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,369
stand up.

547
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,112
Taku Okazaki…

548
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,849
is here.

549
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,821
Taku Okazaki…

550
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:26,824
is here!

551
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,642
Don't forget the words you recited today.

552
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,179
Let's talk again.

553
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,715
It can be about the smallest things.

554
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:56,587
Where you want to go, what you want to do,
no matter how trivial.

555
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,290
Next time…

556
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,994
let's talk about the future.

557
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,874
He stood up?

558
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:17,808
Yeah.

559
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,809
Wait, are you…

560
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,983
I've gotten good at crying
without anyone noticing.

561
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,187
Here.

562
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,628
- You okay?
- Yeah.

563
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,066
- I found him to be a good doctor.
- What?

564
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:47,872
As Head of Pediatrics,
I don't approve of him.

565
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,341
But…

566
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,777
I, Shiori Arimatsu…

567
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,216
considered Dr. Tokushige a good doctor.

568
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,458
RENEWED PETITION FOR
24-HOUR PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY SYSTEM

569
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,404
I'm taking a day off next Wednesday.

570
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,106
What?

571
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,378
It's your birthday. You'll be 18.

572
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,017
Is this place okay?

573
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,421
I wanted to come here as a kid.

574
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,792
I'm sorry, Taku.

575
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,664
You've been deprived of your childhood.

576
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,303
Yeah.

577
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:55,940
I can't get it back…

578
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,209
no matter how much I wish for it.

579
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,281
So,

580
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:06,850
Dad.

581
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,757
Can we talk about the future?

582
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:18,996
Moving forward…

583
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,932
what do we want to do?

584
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,302
How do we want to live?

585
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,373
Let's talk a lot.

586
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,252
Let's welcome Wing onto the stage!

587
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,292
<i>I see, a young caregiver.</i>

588
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,462
<i>Yes, he's pretty upbeat about his future,</i>

589
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,998
but he'll still face some uncertainties.

590
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:59,069
Okay, I'll get to it.
That's what social workers are for.

591
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:04,141
It's hard to rely on others these days.

592
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,478
It can be important to rely on someone.

593
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:09,913
You too, Dr. Tokushige!

594
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:12,750
I'm counting on you.

595
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:14,218
Let's go.

596
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,388
Right?

597
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,396
I'd like to talk.

598
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,932
I've thought about it--

599
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,269
- The crepe food truck… Do you remember it?
- What?

600
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:37,141
I want to go there again,
but I can't find my way.

601
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,942
I think I'll go straight today.

602
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,880
I don't want to be a doctor like you.

603
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,417
What's with that look?

604
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,385
Nothing much.

605
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,154
Okay.

606
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:52,456
I see now.

607
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,158
I'm…

608
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:58,128
going to become the doctor
that only Mizuki Takino can.

609
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,233
From now on,
as a fellow general physician,

610
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,235
I look forward to your guidance!

611
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,640
I see…

612
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,180
You want crepes, they're this way.

613
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,917
I knew I could count on you!

614
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,754
<i>Cancer…</i>

615
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,857
Hypopharyngeal cancer.

616
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:31,495
Luckily, it was detected early,
so the tumor is barely two centimeters.

617
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,064
It's at stage one.

618
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,834
Surgery…

619
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:40,904
on my throat?

620
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:44,374
We'll excise the affected part completely.

621
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,278
<i>Will I get my voice back?</i>

622
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,980
I'd like a second opinion.

623
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,149
He must understand
the necessity of General Medicine.

624
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,217
No other alternatives?

625
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,019
I'm not asking for a discussion,
I need you to persuade him.

626
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,555
<i>We don't have time</i>
<i>to waver with the patient.</i>

627
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:01,692
If I lose my voice,
it's the same as me dying.

628
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,963
We clash because we share
the same desire to help as they do.

629
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,866
That's the kind of doctor I want to be.

630
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:09,900
