1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,605
Next up,

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:09,676
actor Kyoji Tachibana has announced
that he will suspend his activities

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:12,412
to focus on cancer treatment…

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,681
This announcer
has a nice voice, doesn't he?

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,850
Yes, I agree.

6
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,786
<i>…He is doing well</i>
<i>and has already begun--</i>

7
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:22,756
Are you okay, Mr. Hotta?

8
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:24,491
<i>My apologies.</i>

9
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,494
<i>Don't push yourself too hard.</i>
<i>You have the World Athletics coming up.</i>

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,528
<i>Okay.</i>

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,299
There is a tumor on the left side
of the hypopharynx, in the pyriform sinus.

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:38,038
Our tests have confirmed
that it is malignant.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,941
The tumor is located
close to the vocal cords.

14
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,612
Cancer…

15
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,147
Hypopharyngeal cancer.

16
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:53,286
Luckily, it was detected early,
so the tumor is barely two centimeters.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,356
It's at stage one.

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,062
However, in your case,
it's a mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

19
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,930
A very rare type of cancer.

20
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,965
MUCOEPIDERMOID CARCINOMA
A TYPE OF CANCER TISSUE

21
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,234
A MALIGNANT TUMOR
THAT MAINLY OCCURS IN SALIVARY GLANDS

22
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,070
Do I need surgery…

23
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:12,806
on my throat?

24
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,274
Yes.

25
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,445
We'll excise the affected part completely.

26
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:20,647
Excise?

27
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,085
What about my voice?

28
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:29,355
Because of long-term effects,
you might not be able to return to work.

29
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,128
Mr. Hotta, I understand how you feel.

30
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:40,400
But, we have a great chance
of completely removing it through surgery.

31
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,508
This type of cancer is rare
and does not respond well to radiation.

32
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,213
You should undergo surgery
before it grows or spreads.

33
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:54,547
That is the--

34
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,384
This hospital has a General Medicine
Department, does it not?

35
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,922
I'd like to consult
with a general physician.

36
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,227
I'd like a second opinion.

37
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,731
Yes, the voice-over in
the World Athletics ad is my dad.

38
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:20,273
He's on a lot lately, and you can hear him
on jumbo screens everywhere.

39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,210
But he hardly talks at home,
I can barely tell when he's around.

40
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,679
<i>Wow, I didn't picture him that way.</i>

41
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,983
People ask me things like,
"Is your dad an announcer?"

42
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,453
<i>Huh? Koto, behind you.</i>

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,621
What?

44
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,357
You were home!

45
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,894
He's so quiet, like no one is there.

46
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,129
You're home.

47
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,497
Yeah.

48
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,399
This is my dad, whom I'm so proud of!

49
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,303
<i>I'm cheering for you</i>
<i>and the World Athletics.</i>

50
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,638
Thank you.

51
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,540
Oh, did you know…

52
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,743
<i>Noboru Akaike, General Physician.</i>

53
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,579
<i>Alongside his patients,</i>
<i>he searches for light</i>

54
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,714
<i>among the darkness of uncertainty.</i>

55
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,418
<i>He's a doctor who treats the person,</i>
<i>not just the disease.</i>

56
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,719
Please…

57
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,556
<i>Patients suffering from diseases,</i>
<i>other hospitals couldn't diagnose…</i>

58
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,759
What kind of person do you think
makes for an excellent surgeon?

59
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:17,363
That would be someone who does not waver.

60
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,467
A swift decision maker
who doesn't waver upon their decision.

61
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,871
That's what I've been teaching him.

62
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:30,009
Not with words, but by having him
silently watch and memorize the images.

63
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,782
So, without me telling him,
he figured out where to look on his own.

64
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,386
He's my pride and joy.

65
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,990
He has a bright future.

66
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,093
The General Medicine Department?

67
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,595
Yes.

68
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,930
He wants a second opinion.

69
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,035
Surgery is best
for tumors in the early stages.

70
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,105
- I don't need third-party opinions--
- Wait.

71
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,008
Why not try a different angle.

72
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,047
Come in.

73
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,187
- You're from the Surgical--
- My patient wants a second opinion.

74
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,093
Hypopharyngeal cancer.

75
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,162
Yoshikazu Hotta, 53 years old.

76
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:24,931
An announcer?

77
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,499
He's refusing surgery.

78
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,670
Considering his job,

79
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:35,808
to undergo throat surgery would take
a significant amount of resolve.

80
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,911
Got it.

81
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,682
Whether it's surgery,
or some other option,

82
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,919
I will speak with the patient,
shining a light on all available paths

83
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,921
so he can come to a decision.

84
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,391
There's only one path.

85
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:57,597
In his case,
surgery is the most reliable option.

86
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,166
There are no other alternatives.

87
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,168
No other alternatives?

88
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,906
I'm not asking for a discussion,
I need you to persuade him.

89
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,278
He needs to get the surgery
as soon as possible.

90
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,926
GENERAL MEDICINE

91
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,701
You've really got it easy, huh?

92
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:35,601
Are you jealous?

93
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,005
You bet. General Medicine
doesn't have any patients.

94
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,808
Yes, we do.
A surgical patient wants a second opinion.

95
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,409
- Surgical?
- Dr. Kojiro.

96
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,878
Togo Junior? That's scary.

97
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,448
He must understand
the necessity of General Medicine.

98
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,150
His dad publicly stated his intent
to shut down General Medicine.

99
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,852
Sounds like a conspiracy.

100
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:53,986
Conspiracy?

101
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,957
Something's different with you.

102
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,894
General Medicine…

103
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,864
Was it working with Dr. Tokushige?

104
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,901
"Renewed petition for 24-hour
pediatric emergency system."

105
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,737
Even though it was rejected…

106
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,407
How adorbs.

107
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,575
- What?
<i>- In one second…</i>

108
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,844
- Adorbs!
- Please stop.

109
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,545
<i>…the world changes.</i>

110
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,646
What a nice voice.

111
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,050
<i>The world will witness</i>
<i>a new chapter in history.</i>

112
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,552
- Good work.
- Good work, sir.

113
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,421
- Good work, sir.
- Good work.

114
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,489
Oh, thanks.

115
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,724
Are you all right, sir? You look unwell.

116
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,793
It might be a lack of sleep.

117
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,428
Should I reschedule this afternoon?

118
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,531
No, I'm fine.
Sometimes you have to push yourself.

119
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,299
Take care.

120
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,334
Thank you.

121
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,583
GENERAL MEDICINE DEPARTMENT

122
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:02,855
Come in.

123
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:12,498
Have a seat.

124
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,702
Nice to meet you.

125
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,704
I'm Tokushige, General Physician.

126
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,240
And I'm Takino, also a general physician.

127
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,909
Nice to meet you.

128
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:27,113
First of all, how is your throat?

129
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,684
It stings when I swallow saliva, and…

130
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,989
the longer I talk,
the more uncomfortable it gets.

131
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,860
I see. That must affect your work.

132
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,764
I watch your afternoon show.

133
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,133
Thank you.

134
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,702
I watched Dr. Akaike's documentary.

135
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,637
You're the narrator, right?

136
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:56,075
That show gave me the push I needed
to become a general physician.

137
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,343
What? Really?

138
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,912
Yes. "The Modern Red Beard."

139
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,948
I'm not sure about that…

140
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,249
Excuse me?

141
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,184
Sorry about that.

142
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:09,222
Dr. Akaike is like a mentor to me.

143
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,691
- Mentor?
- Yes.

144
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,060
Can we go back to the topic at hand?

145
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,361
Yes, you're right.

146
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,997
I'm glad.

147
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,300
"Treating people, not diseases."

148
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,572
At first, I wanted to go see Dr. Akaike.

149
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,375
But I didn't know where to find him.

150
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,711
I see.

151
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,448
Doctor.

152
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,482
Yes.

153
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:42,088
About conservative radiation therapy…

154
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,723
I already explained it to him once.

155
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:50,263
There are patients who lived
five to ten years without recurrence

156
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,198
while keeping their voices.

157
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,535
That's true,
there have been cases like that.

158
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:01,274
Limiting the irradiation range
can also minimize tissue damage.

159
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,977
It's less strain on the vocal cords
compared to surgery.

160
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,747
What you have
is a mucoepidermoid carcinoma,

161
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,549
which is resistant to radiation.

162
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:13,719
We must also consider the risk
of major surgery if it gets worse.

163
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:19,292
If you decide to undergo surgery now,
you can expect a full recovery.

164
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,829
I don't want surgery.

165
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,868
I understand the impact
it will have on your job.

166
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,038
But if you hesitate any further…

167
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,041
the cancer will worsen.

168
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,713
If I lose my voice…

169
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,084
it's the same as me dying.

170
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,355
It's my voice.

171
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,191
I've nurtured it all this time.

172
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,860
I'm afraid if I do this…

173
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,065
I might not get my voice back.

174
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,672
Mr. Hotta.

175
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:13,212
Have you told your family about this?

176
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,521
If I tell them
before I've processed everything

177
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,758
it will only confuse them.

178
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:33,065
Mr. Hotta, we will help you to organize

179
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,435
your thoughts and feelings.

180
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,404
But…

181
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,174
please remember this one thing.

182
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,412
Whichever path you choose…

183
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,084
your life will carry on.

184
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:03,429
I asked you to persuade him
to undergo surgery.

185
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,732
Did I have to explain in more detail?

186
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,167
No.

187
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,804
He's lucky the cancer was detected early.

188
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:16,942
He ought to have surgery
as soon as possible for a full recovery.

189
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,644
Exactly.

190
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:25,418
But the reason it was detected early
was that he took his voice seriously.

191
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,689
The slightest anomaly
lead him to get examined.

192
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,390
"If I lose my voice…

193
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,994
it's the same as me dying."

194
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,231
Sit down.

195
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,268
Dr. Kojiro,

196
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,772
I understand why you chose
the path that leads to saving his life.

197
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,912
However, you cannot perform surgery
without considering the patient's wishes.

198
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,148
The chances of losing
all vocal cord function

199
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,551
and becoming unable to speak are low.

200
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:03,055
Giving in to patients
who fear this remote possibility

201
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,959
and postponing surgery increases the risk.

202
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,164
While we're wavering,
the cancer will get worse

203
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,600
and chances of his voice
deteriorating further increase.

204
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,138
I understand how you feel, Dr. Kojiro.

205
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,941
However,

206
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,778
no matter what treatment it is,
don't you need…

207
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,614
his acceptance?

208
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,184
Acceptance?

209
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,758
Dr. Togo.

210
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,294
Has the date for the surgery been decided?

211
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,798
My apologies,

212
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,968
we should have been able
to resolve this without involving you.

213
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,970
<i>Shall we cool down…</i>

214
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,139
It's no problem.

215
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:58,811
If we had, we could have avoided
giving the patient any false hope.

216
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,546
What?

217
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,650
We are the specialists for this case.

218
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:11,624
All you have to do is understand
our plan and convince the patient.

219
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,994
That's your job. Am I wrong?

220
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,462
You don't have to…

221
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,333
You're right.

222
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,406
I'm glad you agree.

223
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:34,547
I'm counting on you to take the fastest
and best path to save the patient.

224
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,316
- Yes, sir.
- Good day.

225
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,487
What's up with him?

226
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,388
Come on…

227
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:43,589
You too!

228
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,557
What?

229
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,359
If you are going to be that loud
why bother closing the door.

230
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,129
Seriously?

231
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,402
The Surgical Department is not wrong
in suggesting surgery as the best option.

232
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,838
- I can understand.
- But…

233
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:04,877
Go ahead.

234
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,249
Isn't it a general physician's job…

235
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,353
to talk with patients and support them?

236
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,859
I wanted you to talk back.

237
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,002
It's difficult, isn't it.

238
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,137
Really difficult.

239
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,480
Dr. Tokushige is
a smarter doctor than expected.

240
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,184
If he had emotionally reacted
and rejected our opinion,

241
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,654
we could have claimed
he works poorly with other departments.

242
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:53,058
General Medicine is dangerous after all.

243
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,195
Can't we all just get along?

244
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,964
Wasn't it you who started

245
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,435
the General Medicine Department
without consulting Dr. Togo?

246
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,337
You know what, Toyohashi?

247
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,406
Sometimes, the truth hurts--

248
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,242
The truth is the truth.

249
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,880
But it is surprising
that the Surgical Department

250
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,249
would allow a second opinion
from General Medicine.

251
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,285
"We respect you,"

252
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,154
and, "We're not excluding you
based on our feelings."

253
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,323
They have to make gestures like this.

254
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,460
So, if Tokushige made
even the slightest mistake,

255
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:32,131
they could argue that the department
wasn't necessary after all.

256
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,001
I'm stumped.

257
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,872
Everyone has their own idea
of what's right.

258
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,839
Yeah.

259
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,613
Tokushige, whose fault do you think…

260
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,784
Dr. Akaike!

261
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,885
Sir!

262
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,954
Can I borrow money?

263
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,464
Come in.

264
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,768
The director was crying.

265
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,104
Because you don't listen.

266
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,574
You mustn't lie to a general physician.

267
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:32,224
You could use
your mentor's advice, don't you?

268
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,127
You shouldn't say those things yourself.

269
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,429
What?!

270
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,430
Why?

271
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,401
Stop looking like you just saw a ghost.

272
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,636
You do look like one.

273
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,705
Boo…

274
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,310
What's that for?

275
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,748
The island is still lacking in everything.

276
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,450
It hasn't changed since you were there.

277
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,020
There are no nurses.

278
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,958
No transport helicopters, and no boats.

279
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,061
You came to talk to the director about it?

280
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,464
What I could use now
is an excellent subordinate.

281
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,768
You're just saying that to get your way.

282
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:20,706
Well, I'm almost done doing that, too.

283
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,141
What?

284
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,521
Tokushige.

285
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,688
Yes?

286
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,624
How wide is this path?

287
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,392
You're right…

288
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,129
An ambulance can't get through here.

289
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:45,831
There too.

290
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,600
Huh? Excuse me…

291
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,135
The diner's this way!

292
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,073
They're going to get lost again…

293
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,846
Talking to the street.

294
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,785
Wait! If you go any further,
you can't turn back!

295
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,755
This way, Doctor. This way.

296
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,757
It's this way!

297
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,397
It's now obvious to me
that you're master and disciple.

298
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,365
Sorry.

299
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,503
I also finally understand.

300
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,809
A master and disciple resemble each other.

301
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,710
What?

302
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,880
Furrowing eyebrows.

303
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,382
Mr. Yokobuki!

304
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,584
Here's your order!

305
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,751
- Thank you.
- Sure.

306
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,589
His did that a lot on the island.

307
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,491
Dr. Tokushige too?

308
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,527
He was so eager
to become a general physician

309
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,761
he came looking for me.

310
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:50,662
Really?

311
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,331
Let's not bring up the past.

312
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,032
- I want to know!
- I'm good.

313
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,968
You can talk about it while I'm gone.

314
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,836
- He ran off.
- Can I use the restroom?

315
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,104
- Sure.
- Yeah.

316
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,642
Tokushige hasn't changed a bit.

317
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:11,583
He's all smiles on the outside
and burning brightly in the inside.

318
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,755
Here you go.

319
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,262
You're in a dispute with Surgical, right?

320
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,698
I guess you could say that.

321
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,969
We want to respect the patient's wishes,

322
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,674
but as doctors, we can
also relate to Surgical's opinion.

323
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,277
It's difficult, right?

324
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:46,485
I totally understand Mr. Hotta's fears
about losing his voice.

325
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,386
Yeah.

326
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,720
I want to be there for him.

327
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:53,225
But he might end up dying by your side.

328
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:01,967
The role of a hospital's general physician
is supported by three pillars.

329
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,469
- Three pillars?
- Yeah.

330
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,640
The first one is that of a gatekeeper.

331
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:14,813
A hospital gatekeeper identifies a disease
and diagnoses based on consultation.

332
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,049
The pain you've been feeling…

333
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,886
is from a legitimate disease with a name.

334
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,822
Next is family medicine.

335
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:29,394
<i>You'll work with local communities</i>
<i>to watch over patients post-discharge.</i>

336
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,432
Okay, I'll get to it.
That's what social workers are for.

337
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,401
Last but not least, conductors.

338
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,470
This applies to your case.

339
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,075
Collaborating with specialists
to treat the patient.

340
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:48,313
Specialists tend
to have strong personalities.

341
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:54,886
It's not uncommon among
surgeons to be "scissor-happy."

342
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:02,861
We clash because we share
the same desire to help as they do.

343
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,164
Desire to help…

344
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,568
Her face looks all squished up.

345
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,236
Really?

346
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,872
I wouldn't call her a young lady.

347
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,208
This is on the house, Doc.

348
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,109
Thanks.

349
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,846
I think Rokuro feels the same way.

350
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:22,381
Rokuro?

351
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,582
Togo Senior.

352
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:29,021
His approach is a bit rigid.

353
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,390
This is on the house.

354
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,460
Dr. Tokushige.

355
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,499
I think you're overdoing it
with the diplomacy.

356
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,566
Oh, really?

357
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,870
Things won't go smoothly.

358
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,106
I don't believe it. No way.

359
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,411
Tokushige.

360
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,147
What do you want?

361
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,417
What do I want?

362
00:21:59,017 --> 00:21:59,951
Yeah.

363
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:06,091
What the patient wants
and what the doctor wants…

364
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,162
a general physician…

365
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,265
stands in between those two.

366
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,734
That's why…

367
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:21,106
what I want the most?

368
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,977
I can't lose sight of it.

369
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,785
You're a greedy one, aren't you?

370
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,756
I don't want to hear that from you.

371
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,029
Let's eat.

372
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:46,531
Yum!

373
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,104
UOTORA GENERAL HOSPITAL

374
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,310
Let's go out and eat, Osu.

375
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,711
No, thanks.

376
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,980
But it's sushi.

377
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,181
Sushi…

378
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,984
Hey! No, thank you!

379
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,122
That look of scorn is so adorbs!

380
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,157
- I'll sue you someday.
- Oh, really?

381
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,892
- Let's go.
- Dr. Chayasaka.

382
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:17,062
Can you summarize Mr. Tanaka's
pre-op IC and cardiac records?

383
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,298
Okay, I'll do it.

384
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,199
Good.

385
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,907
Why don't you mess with Dr. Kojiro?

386
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,544
He's no fun.

387
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,847
<i>He's only parroting his father.</i>

388
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,816
<i>A daddy's boy.</i>

389
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,519
Say, "ah."

390
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,257
Dad.

391
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:48,927
Can I post this?

392
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,028
WORLD ATHLETICS! GO JAPAN!

393
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,029
Sure.

394
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,368
You're back! It must have been
a long meeting.

395
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,536
Your dinner…

396
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,271
It's fine, I had a bit at work.

397
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,941
Dad hardly talks at home.

398
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,644
He's taking care of his voice.

399
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,852
Speech therapy, immune system…

400
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,322
ARE THERE HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS
THAT WORK AGAINST CANCER?

401
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,558
Supplements…

402
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,837
It's spreading
slightly faster than expected.

403
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:36,608
As the tumor grows,
the area to be excised will also increase.

404
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,878
Mr. Hotta has a family.

405
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:43,815
Could they help in convincing him
to get the surgery?

406
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,218
Apparently, he hasn't informed them.

407
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,719
Oh my…

408
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,388
During his next visit,

409
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:53,058
I'll bring it up again
while going over the results.

410
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,593
Please do.

411
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,595
Tell him, he doesn't have a choice.

412
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,265
Neither do you.

413
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,369
We don't have time
to waver with the patient.

414
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,172
I'm not wavering.

415
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,243
- Then…
- But…

416
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:16,414
I need to discuss something with
Mr. Hotta before we rush him into surgery.

417
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:20,719
"Treating people, not diseases"?

418
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:27,759
A doctor's job is not so easy
as to save people with ideals alone.

419
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,497
Stop it, you two.

420
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,368
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

421
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,206
I think we're in the same boat.

422
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,074
Really?

423
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:49,581
Indeed, a doctor who only says
what people want to hear

424
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,517
may be being indulgent, but…

425
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,556
one who imposes his version of reality

426
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,725
without listening to his patients…

427
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,094
is no better.

428
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,653
May I sit here?

429
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,122
Go ahead.

430
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,892
It's not like it's my property.

431
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,295
That's true.

432
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,533
All right.

433
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,244
I'm not going to apologize.

434
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,887
Neither am I.

435
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,596
I meant what I said.

436
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,465
So…

437
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,602
thank you.

438
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:25,310
I'm glad I got the chance
to speak openly with you, Dr. Kojiro.

439
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:34,386
Saving his life
while preserving his voice.

440
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:39,157
That's just empty rhetoric.

441
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,965
No matter how much you worry…

442
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:52,537
it probably won't change
the outcome of the surgery.

443
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,974
However…

444
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,878
it doesn't end with the surgery.

445
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,784
Mr. Hotta's life will carry on.

446
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,621
Is that why you're saying
we need his acceptance?

447
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,855
Yes.

448
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,191
And the same…

449
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,760
goes for you too.

450
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,937
Even if you push your opinion
just to get that lesion out,

451
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:30,775
you cannot say
that you've cured the disease.

452
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,180
Wouldn't that be sad?

453
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:42,120
It may be hard
to get both the patient and doctor…

454
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,458
to take the same path.

455
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:53,331
But I believe that it's
our responsibility as doctor's

456
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,600
who deal in life and death.

457
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:05,176
My father once told me something similar.

458
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,615
"What kind of work does a doctor do?"

459
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,019
When I decided to study medicine…

460
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,924
You can be whatever you want.

461
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,462
But it's not easy being a doctor.

462
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,632
You'll be dealing with lives every day.

463
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,934
That's a responsibility…

464
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,670
you can't run away from.

465
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,508
Our methods may be completely different,

466
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,511
but we're both talking
about the same life.

467
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,983
Surgeries…

468
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,820
are the responsibility
of the Surgical Department.

469
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,991
I fully understand that.

470
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,029
Therefore…

471
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,334
I'd like you and Mr. Hotta…

472
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:08,907
to talk again without fear.

473
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,713
To gain both sides' acceptance?

474
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,321
We connect patients with specialists.

475
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:29,394
We work together to ensure that
everyone moves in the same direction.

476
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,230
That…

477
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,236
is the job of a general physician.

478
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,626
Kotoha.

479
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,765
I didn't see anything.
I don't know your password.

480
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,567
Yeah?

481
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,974
You can't just come in like this.
I have my work stuff here.

482
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,113
Tell me.

483
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:27,118
I know that you've been
feeling down lately.

484
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,191
I need to prepare
for tomorrow's recording.

485
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,598
This place…

486
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,235
When I failed my entrance exam,

487
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,871
you took me there.

488
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:01,686
Mr. Hotta.

489
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,689
Based on the test results,

490
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:11,562
I believe that surgery
is the best option for you.

491
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:18,870
Please, allow me to explain
the post-op recovery process to you.

492
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,544
Depending on the severity
of post-op long-term effects,

493
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,815
you'll have to stop speaking for a while,
so you'll need to take time off work.

494
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,920
Should any long-term effects remain
such as vocal cord paralysis,

495
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,624
you might require long-term rehab
or additional surgeries.

496
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,260
But…

497
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,197
will my voice completely recover?

498
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,334
I cannot say for sure.

499
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:55,206
The tumor is located
near your vocal cords, but…

500
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,945
given its current size,
the odds of total removal are high.

501
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:07,518
The speed of your decision
will heavily influence your future.

502
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:18,029
I understand that it may seem scary.

503
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:23,835
That being said,

504
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,438
you can only do your job
because you're alive.

505
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,776
If you lose your life,
you lose your voice too.

506
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,811
I know that!

507
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,383
You don't have to tell me that!

508
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,786
We all know that!

509
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:44,989
Nevertheless…

510
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,525
Are you okay?

511
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,426
I'll get you water.

512
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:49,360
I'm fine!

513
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,709
I have a wife and a daughter.

514
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,550
Sorry.

515
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,921
As I thought.

516
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,725
When you go all out,
you're voice is very powerful.

517
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,129
My voice…

518
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:30,234
is my treasure.

519
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,404
Treasure?

520
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,176
No one has ever called it that, but…

521
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,946
It's the only thing…

522
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:46,818
that I've been able
to nurture well all my life.

523
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:02,633
<i>I was nervous the first time</i>
<i>I stood in front of a mic.</i>

524
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,969
My voice trembled.

525
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,407
But it was my moment of truth.

526
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,944
If I took the step,

527
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,413
my world would change.

528
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,050
Noboru Akaike, General Physician.

529
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,587
Alongside his patients,
he searches for light

530
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,889
among the darkness of uncertainty.

531
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,923
That's a wrap!

532
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,528
A lowly man like me
opened up a path with my voice.

533
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,465
I was so happy.

534
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:40,771
After lots of hard work,
my dream finally came true.

535
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:44,108
<i>I wanted to tell my family right away.</i>

536
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,078
I'm working the World Athletics.

537
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,012
What?

538
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,181
- As a commentator.
- What?!

539
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,782
That's amazing!

540
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,986
I'm so proud of you, Dad!

541
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,032
I won't be the dad she's proud of…

542
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,802
for much longer.

543
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:17,875
Why?

544
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,048
What?

545
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:28,653
I'm sorry.

546
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,856
It's unrelated to the treatment.

547
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:33,391
Go ahead.

548
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:36,994
Carry on.

549
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:49,674
My father is a doctor.

550
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,514
But, even if he quit…

551
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,519
he will still be my father.

552
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:15,700
We both looked at the sea.

553
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:17,969
Without saying a word.

554
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,305
Just sitting side by side…

555
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,548
Dad.

556
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:31,649
Yeah?

557
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,253
For some reason…

558
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,290
you look so cool today.

559
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,900
Thank you.

560
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:06,884
Doctor.

561
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,555
Yes?

562
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,731
I've used my voice…

563
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,237
to care for my family.

564
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,577
Doctor…

565
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,318
I'm scared.

566
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:55,166
As for your voice,
we cannot guarantee it'll make it through.

567
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,837
Be it surgery or treatment,

568
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,074
neither are easy paths.

569
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,610
However…

570
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,681
whichever path you choose,

571
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,184
I promise…

572
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:18,589
to be by your side to the very end.

573
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,594
That's the kind of…

574
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,899
doctor I want to be.

575
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,773
From now on,

576
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,444
your story and your voice…

577
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,483
Let me hear them.

578
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,564
<i>Once again, I'm Yoshikazu Hotta.</i>

579
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:05,169
Today, I have something to tell you.

580
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,406
Please bear with me.

581
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:13,778
<i>I have been diagnosed</i>
<i>with hypopharyngeal cancer.</i>

582
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,248
Hence, I will be taking a break

583
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,484
<i>to undergo surgery and treatment.</i>

584
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,622
<i>To be honest, I'm scared.</i>

585
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:29,193
It's hard for me to say that
I cannot guarantee that I'll be back.

586
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,496
A MESSAGE FROM OUR ANNOUNCER, MR. HOTTA

587
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,031
This decision…

588
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,702
Whether or not…

589
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,506
I made the right choice.

590
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,743
The answer to that…

591
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,915
will need time to be revealed.

592
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,584
<i>Should…</i>

593
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,221
<i>Should…</i>

594
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,658
<i>Should the worst happen.</i>

595
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,763
Even if I lose my voice.

596
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,266
We can still communicate.

597
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,670
That's how I've come to feel.

598
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:15,940
At last…

599
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,443
I've taken a step forward.

600
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:25,950
I…

601
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,753
want to live to the fullest.

602
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,896
SALINE DRIP

603
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,044
Thank you in advance.

604
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:56,981
You see, I…

605
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,048
Yes?

606
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,852
I'm a specialist in head and neck surgery.

607
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:04,588
Yes.

608
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:09,326
I have performed
this procedure 15 times before.

609
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,730
Is that a lot?

610
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,372
I have faith in my surgical skills.

611
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,018
I can count on you,
because you don't lie, Doctor.

612
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,423
Now, please inhale the oxygen.

613
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,196
We're now applying anesthesia.

614
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,432
UOTORA GENERAL HOSPITAL

615
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,934
Dr. Akaike!

616
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,071
What took you?

617
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:59,209
How could you do this
to your dearest mentor?

618
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,945
You can't call yourself that--

619
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,747
Mr. Hotta's operation was a success.

620
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:04,915
Really?

621
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,618
It's been nice meeting you, sir.

622
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,686
Yeah.

623
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,658
Good work.

624
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:20,698
No matter how long you live,
you will always have doubts.

625
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,299
No matter…

626
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,105
which path you choose,
there'll be regrets.

627
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:36,513
Everything is right
and wrong at the same time.

628
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:44,154
GET WELL SOON, MR. HOTTA!
THE LA 2028 OLYMPICS ARE WAITING!

629
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,759
Family members, please come this way.

630
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,794
I have paperwork to take care of.

631
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:52,429
Thank you.

632
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,632
Please be careful not to talk.

633
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,868
Take some time off.

634
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,574
<i>In one second…</i>

635
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,745
<i>the world changes.</i>

636
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:11,548
<i>The world will witness</i>
<i>a new chapter in history.</i>

637
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,486
<i>The Tokyo 2025</i>
<i>World Athletics Championships.</i>

638
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:16,620
<i>Tickets now on sale…</i>

639
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:19,823
Before the surgery, we spoke a little.

640
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,628
He gave me a chuckle.

641
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,865
Words alone cannot save lives.

642
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,770
Are the numbers for next month's OR
utilization rate out yet?

643
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:34,805
If you don't check the numbers,

644
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,041
you have no ground
to stand on during negotiations.

645
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,043
Understood, sir.

646
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,645
There are 18 departments.

647
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:46,650
All sorts of rights and wrongs
in the hospital.

648
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:53,090
That's why they have us,
the 19th department.

649
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:57,928
Yes.

650
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:58,996
What's this?

651
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,734
You still had such
an adorable side to you.

652
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,570
Stop that.

653
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,639
See you around.

654
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,510
Take care!

655
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:14,445
I will.

656
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:25,055
Dr. Tokushige,
do you like traditional sweets?

657
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:25,956
Of course.

658
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:29,460
There'll be a week-long
fair in front of the station.

659
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:30,427
Really?

660
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,077
<i>Diagnosed with diabetes,</i>

661
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:48,979
<i>he's been seeing</i>
<i>an internist for six months.</i>

662
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,982
<i>We're here to treat his diabetes,</i>
<i>not provide marriage counseling.</i>

663
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:56,453
Dr. Kayama will examine Kota,
and Dr. Takino will examine Sachi.

664
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,988
Try to empathize more.

665
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,057
I can't empathize with patients.

666
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,426
<i>Take a step back</i>
<i>and visualize the invisible.</i>

667
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,963
- Why are you giving up?
<i>- I want to understand Kota and Sachi.</i>

668
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,066
<i>People suffer from both</i>
<i>the disease and the illness.</i>
