1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,039
Doctor.

2
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,341
Please tell me…

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,812
the truth.

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,080
I won't!

5
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,516
I won't tell you!

6
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,387
Doctor!

7
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,855
Dr. Akaike!

8
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,959
<i>I'm Dr. Tokushige from General Medicine.</i>
<i>Requesting emergency transport.</i>

9
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,697
- We need to hurry to the CT room.
- Got it!

10
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,467
<i>Blood pressure at 78 over 46,</i>
<i>heart rate at 140.</i>

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,569
Oxygen maxed, oxygen saturation under 90.

12
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,739
Fluctuating consciousness, abdominal
distension, edema in the lower legs.

13
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,374
Acute heart failure?

14
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,842
Cause of distension unknown.

15
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,978
With his blood pressure, a same-day op--

16
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,781
I suspect it's Budd-Chiari.

17
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,616
Budd-Chiari?

18
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,585
Toda, it's not heart failure.

19
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,822
We'll do a thrombectomy.
No time to explain.

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,591
- His inferior vena cava is blocked.
- We start with an angiography.

21
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,094
- Prepare catheters and guidewires.
- On it!

22
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:05,365
Now I know why you brought him to Uotora.

23
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,234
He's in your care, Dr. Chayasaka.

24
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,637
Leave it to me.

25
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,045
Dr. Tokushige,
is there anything I can do to help?

26
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,047
We can't do anything.

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,085
Not yet.

28
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,825
For the Uotora General Hospital
directorial elections,

29
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,528
does anyone object
that incumbent Dr. Eikichi Kitano

30
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:40,733
and the Head of Surgery,
Dr. Rokuro Togo, are the only candidates?

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,536
- No objections.
- You have my approval too.

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,875
Thus, the final debate will be held
next Monday as scheduled.

33
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,579
Sorry for interrupting the meeting.

34
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:56,950
It's Dr. Akaike.

35
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,351
Akaike?

36
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,397
Akaike.

37
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,801
Your surgery went well.

38
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,638
<i>Budd-Chiari.</i>

39
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,574
"Blocked inferior vena cava
and hepatic veins

40
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:26,479
prevent blood return, resulting in liver
swelling and malfunction."

41
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,582
Toxins spread through the body,
quietly destroying it.

42
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,318
Toxins…

43
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,787
I've treated acute forms of it in the US.

44
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:38,291
I think the chronic symptoms
were present from the start.

45
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,028
They are what caused
the swollen abdomen and visible veins.

46
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:47,433
A fresh blood clot caused changes
that made him go into shock.

47
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,235
Yes.

48
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,706
There are cases like this in Japan too,
but very few.

49
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,913
A venal pattern on the abdomen
resembling Medusa's head.

50
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,717
Liver fibrosis has progressed,
leaving the organ barely functional.

51
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,986
He is 75 years old.

52
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,156
He's barely still eligible, but…

53
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,725
You're suggesting a transplant?

54
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,561
It's a drastic solution.

55
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,736
Excuse me.

56
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,407
Dr. Akaike.

57
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,152
I am here from General Medicine.

58
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,520
I'm Dr. Tokushige.

59
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,856
Mr. Noboru Akaike.

60
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:49,562
I can confirm that you've been diagnosed
with Budd-Chiari syndrome.

61
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,702
A blood clot in your IVC vein

62
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,805
has greatly impaired
blood flow to your liver--

63
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:08,715
At the moment, you've been given
one month to live.

64
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,683
Dr. Tokushige!

65
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,054
I apologize for telling you this
right after your surgery.

66
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:20,059
However, we need to discuss
your further treatment options--

67
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,160
Tokushige.

68
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:28,334
For a general physician,
the hardest thing to handle…

69
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,507
is when a patient falls silent,
am I right?

70
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,976
What do you mean, sir?

71
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,779
I'm saying my farewells.

72
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,016
See you.

73
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,688
I'm not going to…

74
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,826
say another word.

75
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,342
GENERAL MEDICINE

76
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,521
Dr. Akaike.

77
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,456
Good morning.

78
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,700
Wow, the sun is still dazzling.

79
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,269
But it's a bit cooler now.

80
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,907
Also, the breeze feels a little nicer
now when I'm on my bike.

81
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,081
Would you like to go out for a while?

82
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,650
I don't have to see outpatients
until this afternoon.

83
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,492
<i>He's just turning down treatment?</i>

84
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:05,098
This man has dedicated his life
to establishing general medicine in Japan.

85
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,501
He fought harder than anyone else,

86
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,505
struggling to fix our nation's
fragmented healthcare system.

87
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,678
When he said he'd close his clinic,
I should have asked for more reasons.

88
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,414
If only I had realized sooner.

89
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,284
Acute exacerbations are extremely rare,

90
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,787
so I don't think
anyone could have predicted it.

91
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,757
Even Dr. Akaike himself.

92
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:31,991
Tokushige.

93
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,626
Yes?

94
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:40,600
We must carry on Dr. Akaike's will.

95
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,636
Sir.

96
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,774
You're face is scary looking right now.

97
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,708
Huh?

98
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:54,147
With that face, your closing argument
won't work on anyone.

99
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,081
Hey, you…

100
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,884
Sir, you have a lovely smile.

101
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,721
Well then, let's both do our best.

102
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,825
What's with that carefree attitude?

103
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:06,926
Excuse me.

104
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,365
BUDD-CHIARI SYNDROME

105
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,638
Your body won't hold up without a meal.

106
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,773
Help yourself if you want.

107
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,109
Don't mind if I do.

108
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,751
Eat up, okay?

109
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,270
Come on in.

110
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,874
The finest snacks in town,
pediatrician-approved.

111
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,943
Thank you so much!

112
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,479
But what brings you here?

113
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,516
Are you all right?

114
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:11,624
At times like this,
the older you get, the less you can say.

115
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,026
Because no one will listen anyway.

116
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,567
I wouldn't say that I'm okay.

117
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:28,241
Doctors can't do anything
unless they're asked.

118
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,278
Dr. Akaike taught me that.

119
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,782
However…

120
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,755
we can't just stand still.

121
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,227
I'll make some coffee.

122
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,502
The directorial election
is also troubling me.

123
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:02,341
If Dr. Togo takes the top spot,
he said he'll downsize Pediatrics.

124
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,947
But, we have to think
about what we can do.

125
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,385
For now, we must focus
on treating our patients!

126
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,095
Doctor?

127
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,865
It's nothing.

128
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,403
I think you're right.

129
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,040
All right!

130
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,108
Let's fill up and get to work!

131
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,276
Okay.

132
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,377
I'm leaving these here.

133
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,278
Okay.

134
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,447
Please don't hog them all for yourself.

135
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,515
Understood!

136
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:44,951
Excuse me.

137
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,633
Hello.

138
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,601
Oh!

139
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,003
Want some? They were a gift.

140
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,004
Sure.

141
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,042
Wow, I'll take this one.

142
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,012
GENERAL MEDICINE QUESTIONNAIRE

143
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,282
Come in.

144
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,222
Nice to meet you.

145
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,825
I'm Dr. Mizuki Takino
from General Medicine.

146
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,893
Nice to meet you.

147
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,261
Have a seat.

148
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,030
You too, please.

149
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,398
Thank you.

150
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,205
You're Emi Takaoka?

151
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,240
What brings you here today?

152
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,945
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

153
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:47,880
Sorry.

154
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,583
I can't stop coughing.

155
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,653
Coughing… since when?

156
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,422
Beginning of last month.

157
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,991
I caught a cold.

158
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,559
It's been over a month…

159
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,595
It never stopped?

160
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,299
I have a band competition next month.

161
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,169
I want to…

162
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,974
Does it hurt? Are you okay?

163
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,275
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,613
<i>She had asthma as a kid?</i>

165
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,715
<i>There might be a predisposition.</i>

166
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,550
But she's not wheezing.

167
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,253
- What about cough-variant asthma?
- No response to steroids.

168
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,989
Whoa! You scared me.

169
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,291
What about environmental factors
or stress?

170
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,561
It could be. Her band has a competition.

171
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,997
Coughing makes you very self-aware, right?

172
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,065
Yes.

173
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,769
Dr. Narumi!

174
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,871
UOTORA GENERAL HOSPITAL

175
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,641
Hey!

176
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,781
The coughing causes muscular pain
at the solar plexus.

177
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:59,118
It typically goes with tenderness
and worsens with deep breathing.

178
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,219
That's what I thought.

179
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,521
But no apparent orthopedic abnormality.

180
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:03,489
Excuse me.

181
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,057
Dr. Narumi!

182
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,693
I…

183
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,400
Don't just stop me! Say something!

184
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,468
Sorry.

185
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,406
Did you become one?

186
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,475
What?

187
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,112
A doctor who can cure anything.

188
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,214
Not yet, sir.

189
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,248
Oh, really?

190
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,852
"Yet" means that you will one day, right?

191
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,259
Do your best, Takino.

192
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,832
Gosh, I wasted 11 minutes on this!

193
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,938
Thank you, sir!

194
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,411
- Is it plugged in?
- Yes.

195
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,314
Alexa, switch on.

196
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,651
Excuse us.

197
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,387
This is how you'll watch
my closing argument.

198
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,823
Technology is so convenient.

199
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,659
Please make sure to watch.

200
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,928
I'll give my best speech.

201
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,864
I'll be lonely
if I'm just talking to myself.

202
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,137
I've decided to take the equivalency exam.

203
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,141
So you managed
to talk to your dad about it?

204
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,309
Yes.

205
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,879
I wasn't sure about it,
even after talking it over.

206
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,150
But I consulted with Dad many times,

207
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,154
and had Mr. Kariya
look into various things for me.

208
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,225
I want to give it a go.

209
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,096
I'm happy for you.

210
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:57,002
Taku, you've started exploring
your own future.

211
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,676
Taku, wasn't there something else
you wanted to say?

212
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,447
What is it? Tell us.

213
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,082
It's nothing…

214
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,154
If I pass and go to college…

215
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,591
I'd like to study medicine.

216
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,192
Really?

217
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,694
Oh, wait a second.

218
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,930
I haven't decided to become a doctor
or anything like that yet.

219
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,900
I'm not good at studying after all.

220
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,437
But…

221
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,510
I can afford to worry and hesitate…

222
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,381
because I met you, Doctor.

223
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,586
I still get very scared at times.

224
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:54,693
Sometimes, I still freeze up,
wondering if this is right.

225
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:00,399
But when I come here, you're here.

226
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,708
I want to be a presence
like you for someone.

227
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,884
Thank you.

228
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,220
What?

229
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,458
I mean it…

230
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,663
Thank you.

231
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,542
Taku Okazaki is here!

232
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,077
Yes.

233
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,981
And Akira Tokushige is here too. Right?

234
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,183
Yes!

235
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,736
What brings you here, traitor?

236
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,838
What harsh words.

237
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,875
That's because
I haven't forgiven you or Uotora.

238
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,911
- Get me the pulse oximeter.
- Okay.

239
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,517
Here.

240
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,990
I enjoyed working in the ER.

241
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,592
I know.

242
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:39,765
But, you're one
helplessly selfish knucklehead.

243
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,102
That's harsh.

244
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,738
I did you one more favor.

245
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,075
I even signed it.

246
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,711
Thank you.

247
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,884
Now get moving. I'm busy here.

248
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,520
I know, sir.

249
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,258
In return,
I'll come to help you out next time.

250
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,661
I'm not counting on it!

251
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,206
What a complete idiot.

252
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,275
What is he thinking?

253
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,819
RESIDENCE CERTIFICATE

254
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:46,365
When I was away,
you took care of Dr. Takino.

255
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:51,470
It was in my own interests.

256
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,643
Doctors are to team up
for their patients' sake…

257
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,448
I wanted to try it out for myself.

258
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,351
I wanted to tell my father that.

259
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:14,626
To that end, I meddled in a Cardio surgery
and got General Medicine involved.

260
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,597
I see.

261
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,534
However, I only made things worse.

262
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,470
Oh my?

263
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,840
He told me to get out.

264
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,247
I did something unnecessary.

265
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,182
No, you didn't.

266
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,086
I was told the same thing.

267
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,257
By Dr. Akaike?

268
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:51,163
Our mentors are a handful, aren't they?

269
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:04,143
We could just let things
take their course.

270
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,292
I can't give up.

271
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,396
I don't want to give up.

272
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,901
Yes.

273
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,576
EMI TAKAOKA
ASTHMA, WHOOPING COUGH, ESOPHAGITIS

274
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,314
Guess I'm no psychic.

275
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,086
Excuse me. Is Dr. Tokushige here?

276
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,423
His conference
with Internal is running late.

277
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,960
Please tell him I've booked a slot
for the test he requested.

278
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,395
- A test?
- Yes.

279
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,330
The time can be checked in the system.

280
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,065
- Got it.
- Okay.

281
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,242
I'm back.

282
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,177
Ms. Seto came just now.

283
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,245
Oh, the test.

284
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,547
- For Dr. Akaike?
- Yes.

285
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,450
He's about to be discharged, right?

286
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,220
Yeah.

287
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,423
The puncture site is healing up nicely.

288
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,124
He has no trouble walking either.

289
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,408
AKIRA TOKUSHIGE

290
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,348
<i>The Japanese medical system</i>
<i>is now at a breaking point.</i>

291
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,050
Demand continues to surge,

292
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,487
and both manpower and budget
are struggling to keep up.

293
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,858
In order to safeguard
Uotora General Hospital,

294
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,127
I shall propose some necessary revisions.

295
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,796
Concentrating limited personnel

296
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,100
in departments that can balance
specialization and efficiency

297
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:14,306
such as ORs, perioperative care,
and health screening centers.

298
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,811
Ideals alone cannot sustain healthcare.

299
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,051
This is unlikely to get interesting.

300
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,586
What?

301
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:31,890
I mean, everything he says is right.

302
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,960
Call me cold-hearted if you like.

303
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:41,566
Nevertheless,
I will uphold my duty and go down

304
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,169
this path.

305
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,777
Well then, any questions?

306
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,082
Let's move on to the next candidate, then.

307
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,255
Dr. Kojiro Togo.

308
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,156
Go ahead.

309
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,530
Your current policy proposal

310
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,768
involves downsizing Pediatrics
and abolishing General Medicine.

311
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,669
Yes.

312
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,706
Pediatrics is the bedrock
of community healthcare,

313
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,240
despite the falling birth rate.

314
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,377
Do you know how much
Pediatrics loses in a year?

315
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:30,015
The hospital is not a charity.

316
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,222
I understand that.

317
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,763
But even with a growing aging population,
there are still children.

318
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,167
I admit that Pediatrics,
and also General Medicine,

319
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,202
are not profitable yet--

320
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,371
To look at things from a broad
perspective, without rushing.

321
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:55,040
You're all well aware that such services

322
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:58,210
are underappreciated
in the current system.

323
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:03,382
Proposing ideals that don't fit the system
will only burden those on the ground.

324
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,350
Am I wrong?

325
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,386
No.

326
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,488
Not about any of it.

327
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,192
Japan's healthcare system
has many wonderful aspects.

328
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,230
<i>But the system is designed</i>
<i>to protect the masses.</i>

329
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,100
<i>What about those</i>
<i>who fall through the cracks?</i>

330
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,607
Can we pretend they don't exist?

331
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,512
I know that kindness alone won't do.

332
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,647
That's the reality.

333
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:41,219
But if we lose our kindness…

334
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,090
then we cannot remain doctors.

335
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:18,957
Well…

336
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:24,796
I feel like most of what I was
going to say has already been said…

337
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,364
However, let me say one thing.

338
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,735
It is a hassle to make changes.

339
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,606
It took years of debate

340
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:38,910
before ambulance paramedics
were authorized to perform intubations.

341
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:43,748
The same goes for nurses
performing airway suctioning.

342
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,585
What is the right answer?

343
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,955
Is there even a right answer?

344
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:56,895
We will always be faced
with such questions.

345
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,334
Truly, there's no end
to what we can talk about.

346
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,705
<i>Sorry, I've been dragging on.</i>

347
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:11,610
<i>But I'll keep having these conversations.</i>

348
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:18,116
I won't stay silent
because it may be troublesome.

349
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,589
Everybody.

350
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,292
Please, lend me your hand.

351
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:33,932
I will do all I can.

352
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:53,151
The election has been called off
because Dr. Togo pulled out.

353
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,320
Things won't change that easily.

354
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,523
Yeah.

355
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,260
But I think he got through to him.

356
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,768
Rokuro!

357
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,404
How humiliating!

358
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,939
Oh, come on.

359
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,841
We're still old pals, aren't we?

360
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,878
My son rebuked me in front of everyone.

361
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,815
Kids will grow up,
even as we hold them back.

362
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,117
They'll gain their own voice.

363
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,920
Sorry for making that decision
without consulting you.

364
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,389
The General Medicine Department…

365
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,293
Even if we clashed,
we should've found the answer together.

366
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,663
I'm really sorry.

367
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:41,933
It's fine!

368
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:46,338
I'll raise tons of money,
so together, let's make Uotora--

369
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,806
You're a money-grubber!

370
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,307
Oh, come on!

371
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,076
I won't expect anything.

372
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:54,045
But if you properly
consider the insurance system,

373
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:58,083
having a General Medicine Department
can have us break even in ten years.

374
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,951
You're getting way ahead of yourself!

375
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,922
It's not that far, just ten years…
They will go by in a flash.

376
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:09,227
I'm seeing a patient
whose coughing just won't stop.

377
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,130
A 17-year-old girl.

378
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:21,006
Asthma, whooping cough, and esophagitis.

379
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:27,178
I've looked at various possibilities,
but I can't find the answer.

380
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,319
The reason I became a general physician

381
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:38,189
was because I was frustrated
at not being able to cure a cold.

382
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:44,062
I still feel that way to this day.

383
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,033
But…

384
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,138
When I'm face-to-face
with patients like this,

385
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,375
I'm not too concerned
about myself or such.

386
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,310
I just…

387
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,313
I really…

388
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,884
want to do something.

389
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,188
That's all.

390
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,030
You don't have to try to name the disease.

391
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,038
What's ailing this girl,

392
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:33,545
you may not know its name,
but you can already tell what it is.

393
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:36,781
Doctor.

394
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,660
Can I talk to you for a bit?

395
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,067
I'm Dr. Tokushige from General Medicine.

396
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,536
Thank you for coming.

397
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,841
Mr. Noboru Akaike.

398
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,578
Well…

399
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:10,148
There's no point in being so formal,

400
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,184
so shall I just address you as usual,
Dr. Akaike?

401
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:21,192
Do you still insist on your stance
to refuse treatment?

402
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,702
Dr. Akaike, why won't you answer?

403
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,339
I want to hear more--

404
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,707
Dr. Takino.

405
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,410
Sorry.

406
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,647
At this point,

407
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:48,086
medication can no longer
stop it from spreading.

408
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:53,424
As for a drastic solution,

409
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,095
a liver transplant is your only option.

410
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,698
How, you ask?

411
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,301
That's right.

412
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,772
You don't have a family.

413
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,041
Therefore…

414
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,145
I'll be your donor.

415
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,655
Of course, it's anything but simple.

416
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,492
The Japanese Transplantation Society's
ethical guidelines

417
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,197
generally state that living liver donors
should be limited to relatives.

418
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,169
As for non-related donors,
they'll undergo screening

419
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,040
to prevent organ trafficking or coercion.

420
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,243
Therefore…

421
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,947
I even signed it.

422
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:52,884
<i>My proof of identity.</i>

423
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:53,852
EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATE

424
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,286
LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION

425
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:00,091
<i>Official records,</i>
<i>showing we lived together.</i>

426
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,893
RELATIONSHIP: COHABITOR

427
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,595
Let me roll up your sleeve.

428
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,964
Here you go…

429
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,433
<i>If I am a match to be your donor.</i>

430
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:13,371
Also, I'll no longer be your doctor.

431
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,075
To avoid
any ethical conflicts of interest,

432
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,978
I will hand you over to the surgeons.

433
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:25,850
From now on,
there'll be various tests and interviews.

434
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,656
It may take some time.

435
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:36,828
But I just wanted to let you know now.

436
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:52,110
How about we go over the benefits
and risks of a transplant.

437
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:59,217
First of all, I, the donor,
will undergo a laparoscopy.

438
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:03,121
The left lobe will be used
for the transplant.

439
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,490
Left lobe?

440
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:10,461
It will surely leave a burden on my body.

441
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:15,400
But the liver
has a high regenerative capacity,

442
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,769
and its function will recover.

443
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:26,377
And now, you, as the recipient,
will undergo a laparotomy.

444
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:31,349
Your liver will be almost totally removed.

445
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,553
Therefore it will take time to recover.

446
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,259
As I mentioned, as you are now,

447
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,396
you only have one month to live.

448
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:51,436
But if the transplant is a success,

449
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:57,942
you'll have the chance
to live out your natural lifespan.

450
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:05,149
How does that benefit me?

451
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,020
The lifespan of an old man.

452
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:16,160
I've done all I can do.

453
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:22,834
I've struggled and fought.

454
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,908
There is nothing more I can do.

455
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:37,415
There's nothing more you can do?

456
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,251
What will I live for?

457
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:58,002
I've fought in my own way.

458
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:05,777
To unravel my suffering…

459
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,449
Helping those who slip through the cracks

460
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,820
between specialties.

461
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:27,198
The 19th medical specialty,
General Medicine.

462
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,540
The best day ever…

463
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,376
THE 19TH SPECIALTY DEBUTS

464
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,344
<i>One that I'll never forget.</i>

465
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,784
At last, we'd made it
to the starting line.

466
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,787
Or so I thought.

467
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,690
But…

468
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,296
"I truly understand what you're saying."

469
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:04,769
What would come right
after that sentence was always

470
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,739
"But you see, Doctor…"

471
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,678
"I'm sorry, Dr. Akaike.

472
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:18,850
Our hospital cannot afford to maintain
a General Medicine Department."

473
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,420
Dr. Akaike!

474
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,030
<i>Ideals are ideals.</i>

475
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,300
<i>Reality is reality.</i>

476
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,005
<i>Blazing a trail where none existed.</i>

477
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:45,810
<i>Alone on the night sea,</i>

478
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,948
<i>aiming for the faint glow in the distance.</i>

479
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,089
<i>I did all I could.</i>

480
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:11,402
No matter how hard I grasp it,

481
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,607
it just slips away through my fingers.

482
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,980
An endless dream.

483
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,352
One I've clung to for dear life.

484
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,024
Whether…

485
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:42,633
that was the right move or a mistake…

486
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,337
I don't know.

487
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,109
Tokushige.

488
00:36:55,046 --> 00:37:01,485
I never wanted
to have this conversation you!

489
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:21,405
So, we've all been living a dream?

490
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:30,448
All I see is a patient pleading,

491
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,717
"Help me."

492
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:41,626
For me, that's reality.

493
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:53,704
The one who taught me that,
is you, Dr. Akaike.

494
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,447
Doctor.

495
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,285
Tell me.

496
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:16,227
Why did you plant seeds

497
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,497
in the field back then?

498
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,005
Why…

499
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:35,313
did you answer
when Dr. Takino spoke to you?

500
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,021
Why?

501
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:51,495
Why?

502
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,500
Why are you giving up?

503
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,243
I'm giving up?

504
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:21,325
I believed in you.

505
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,396
That's why I went after you.

506
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,444
Doctor.

507
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,854
The General Medicine Department…

508
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,292
is only just getting started, isn't it?

509
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,033
Yeah.

510
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,373
See it through, okay?

511
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,647
Whether what you started…

512
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:26,924
was the right move or a mistake.

513
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:39,203
Whatever the outcome,
as a fellow general physician,

514
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:47,812
I am right here,
prepared to carry it all with you.

515
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:00,691
So…

516
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,797
from now on…

517
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,204
Let's struggle.

518
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:15,840
Let's fight.

519
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,579
Let's furrow our brows.

520
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,784
Let's keep on living.

521
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,333
You, Dr. Akaike…

522
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,670
and me.

523
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,110
And me too.

524
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,750
A doctor who can cure anything.

525
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:05,523
I am not going to give up on that.

526
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:17,368
I've learned that with help
I might be able to become one.

527
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,019
Are you sure about this?

528
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:40,925
Yes.

529
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,631
In exchange,

530
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,902
I'm going to have you work hard.

531
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:59,677
You are truly selfish.

532
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,186
I got that from you.

533
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,226
Yes.

534
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:31,308
RESEARCH PROPOSAL

535
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,344
The donor is one of our physicians.

536
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,280
I am aware of the ethical concerns.

537
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:43,153
As long as there are options, we believe
we should thoroughly consider them.

538
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:47,658
Dr. Akaike has opted for treatment.

539
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:48,626
Yeah.

540
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:49,760
RESEARCH PROPOSAL

541
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:54,231
It's a rare case,
but if it makes sense, we'll proceed.

542
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:58,302
As long as it's open and honest.

543
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:02,239
First, we do a resection
centered on the left of the liver,

544
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,942
temporarily blocking
blood flow to the hepatic artery

545
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,544
to preserve the donor's liver function

546
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:10,481
as we ensure the recipient
gets the needed function.

547
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:13,651
I'll handle any bleeding during surgery.

548
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,020
The risks will be shared by all.

549
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,255
What about the blood transfusions
and anesthesia?

550
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,690
We'll prepare in advance.

551
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,263
I find your smile a little uncomfortable.

552
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,266
I'm just happy.

553
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,767
So, this is how it feels…

554
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,841
Please keep a close eye
on the fluid balance.

555
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,077
I felt a bit dehydrated yesterday.

556
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:16,447
It's going to be all right.
Please lie down already.

557
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,383
Sorry.

558
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,927
I'm all yours.

559
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,732
Vitals stable.

560
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,500
Inducing anesthesia.

561
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,235
Got it.

562
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:46,009
I'm confident in my surgical skills.

563
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:48,812
I know.

564
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,951
Excuse me, I'm placing the mask.

565
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:57,387
Breathe in.

566
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,859
Electrosurgical unit.

567
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,834
Forceps.

568
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,772
Come for some fun, Dr. Chayasaka?

569
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,909
I see you've learned to joke around.

570
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,519
Thank you for seeing me.

571
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,090
No need to force yourself to talk.

572
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,058
Sorry.

573
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,402
Does it settle after drinking water?

574
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,809
I just had a look at the extent
of the inflammation in your throat.

575
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,378
It's looking a lot better.

576
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:59,550
But there is still a small amount of
inflammation in the back of your throat.

577
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,619
Everything else is fine.

578
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,722
So, why…

579
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:14,164
You cough while talking,
when you wake up or in dry conditions.

580
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:20,070
The mucous membrane in your bronchial tube
may have become hypersensitive.

581
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,708
You're also worried about
your band competition, right?

582
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:28,879
Yes.

583
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:34,084
Trying to speak while healing,
might have strained your throat a bit.

584
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:38,455
So, to summarize what we've discussed,

585
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:43,760
the cause of your cough, Emi, is a cold.

586
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:46,997
What?

587
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,333
A lingering cold.

588
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:55,205
I checked thoroughly
and found no other problems.

589
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,074
Nothing to worry about.

590
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,948
I'm sorry, I made such a fuss over a cold…

591
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,320
You've been anxious.

592
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,960
It's exhausting
when it never seems to get better.

593
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:25,636
For the sake of your competition,
as well as yourself, please rest.

594
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:30,641
Will I get better?

595
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,678
Eat well and get plenty of sleep.

596
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,948
That should make you better.

597
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,052
Okay.

598
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:46,823
I'm so glad.

599
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:11,248
Here you go.

600
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:17,788
Here.

601
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:05,102
It appears I'm still alive.

602
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,308
Yeah.

603
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:02,893
Mr. Yokobuki.

604
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,362
Dr. Takino.

605
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,232
It's gotten much cooler
these days, hasn't it?

606
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,133
Yes.

607
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,235
How time flies.

608
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,705
It'll be harder for me to wash the dishes.

609
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,541
Chillblains.

610
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:20,110
Be sure to keep warm
all the way to the wrists.

611
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,645
It will improve your circulation.

612
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:23,613
And don't forget to moisturize.

613
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,650
You're one great doctor,
treating everything.

614
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,652
Not quite yet.

615
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,268
You're a slowpoke, aren't you?

616
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:49,372
But, you've gotten three seconds faster.

617
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,210
Do you have a minute, Dr. Arimatsu?

618
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,412
- I have outpatients in ten.
- Just three minutes.

619
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:59,149
So, let's take our time
going over it once I'm done.

620
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,418
Thank you so much. I'll share my chart.

621
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,452
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

622
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,821
Dr. Hirate, may I get your advice?

623
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,723
- Okay.
- Sorry. Um, yesterday…

624
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,859
It's gotten noisy in here.

625
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,927
- What?
- They aren't in any pain.

626
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,362
I see.

627
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,831
I guess it's nice from time to time.

628
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,074
Did you have lunch?

629
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,143
- I did!
- You did?

630
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,612
Really? I'm not sure it's enough.

631
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,447
Please eat up.

632
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,819
- I'm off!
- See you later!

633
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,188
PETITION TO CREATE
A GENERAL PRACTICE SUPPORT PROGRAM

634
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,624
Let's go.

635
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:41,591
Yeah.

636
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,867
All right, that's it.

637
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,303
Sorry, thank you for seeing us so quickly.

638
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,071
- It's nothing.
- Let's go.

639
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,873
See you around.

640
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,608
Say "Goodbye, Doctor."

641
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,644
- Red Beard.
- Huh?

642
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,979
Where are you going, all dressed up?

643
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,917
Where am I going? Somewhere nice.

644
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:13,523
We in the General Medicine Department
treat people, not organs.

645
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,159
That's why our department was established.

646
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:21,097
That explanation may be
a little confusing.

647
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:22,933
Well…

648
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:32,142
By seeing someone other than ourselves,

649
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:39,382
we become just a little kinder.

650
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:47,090
By seeing someone other than ourselves,

651
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:52,295
we become just a little kinder.

652
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,469
That's all that matters.

653
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,621
I knew it.

654
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,023
It's narrow here.

655
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,435
They made it even.

656
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,906
It's Dr. Tokushige.

657
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:38,942
Good morning, Doctor.

658
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:42,479
- Good morning, Dr. Tokushige.
- Good morning.

659
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:43,947
Good morning!

660
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,363
How's your pain now?

661
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,868
I still feel pain sometimes.

662
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,937
But I exercise and stretch.

663
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:12,242
And once I found the right meds,
I improved quite a lot.

664
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:18,548
At work, I'm still busy as ever.

665
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:24,821
But I've come to realize that it's okay
to take a break once in a while.

666
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:29,225
That's what matters most.

667
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:37,233
It's all because of your words
and your help back then.

668
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:43,907
I'm so glad I didn't give up.

669
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:50,280
That was before
my curtains arrived, right?

670
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,750
Yeah, it was really bright.

671
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,823
Ms. Kuroiwa, you were the first patient,

672
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:04,694
whom I examined,
right after I joined Uotora.

673
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:06,663
Really?

674
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:07,630
Yeah.

675
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:14,537
Back then,
when you smiled for the first time…

676
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,976
I think I will remember
that smile forever.

677
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,720
I'm glad…

678
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,724
I got to speak with you.

679
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,062
It's also my pleasure.

680
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:44,734
Well, see you around.

681
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:45,935
Yeah.

682
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,204
Take care.

683
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:14,364
<i>Currently, there are 320,000</i>
<i>active physicians in Japan.</i>

684
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:20,003
Among them, there are only
about 1,000 general physicians.

685
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:23,840
We're just getting started.

686
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:29,446
It takes time for new things
to gain acceptance.

687
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,083
But that's how healthcare has evolved.

688
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:38,888
Every doctor wants to save
as many patients as they can.

689
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,991
There isn't a single doctor
who doesn't wish for that.

690
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:46,029
Healthcare that leaves no one behind,

691
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:50,567
medical staff working together
to care for patients,

692
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,837
and a system where we join forces

693
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,706
not just within hospitals,
but across the entire community.

694
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:02,712
I believe we can
make this ideal a reality.

695
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,181
That's why…

696
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,253
I'm here again today.

697
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:15,925
Good morning, Dr. Tokushige.

698
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,895
Good morning. Shall we start our day?

699
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,763
Yes, I'll get the patient now.

700
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,134
GENERAL MEDICINE DEPARTMENT

701
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:26,603
Come in.

702
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,840
I'm Dr. Tokushige from General Medicine.

703
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,510
What brings you here today?

704
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:42,886
Please tell me…

705
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:47,257
your story.
