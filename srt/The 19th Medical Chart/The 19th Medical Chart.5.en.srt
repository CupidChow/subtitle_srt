1
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:09,075
Where do you think the soul is?

2
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,010
Huh?

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:14,114
I've operated on countless patients
and examined them internally,

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,883
but I've never seen it even once.

5
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,086
Dr. Chayasaka is a genius.

6
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,223
There are several qualities
that make for an excellent surgeon,

7
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,659
such as extensive
case experience and dexterity.

8
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:32,966
But the most important skill of all
is rational decision-making.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,503
When something unexpected
occurs during surgery,

10
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:40,507
a surgeon must choose
the best out of multiple paths.

11
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:45,345
Her speed and accuracy
is what makes her great.

12
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,253
No comment.

13
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:58,324
Do you know who scouted
Uotora's biggest star?

14
00:00:58,992 --> 00:00:59,993
That's me!

15
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,795
Me!

16
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,064
Thanks to me,
the Cardiovascular Department

17
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,832
has received a lot of bookings.

18
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,567
How exciting!

19
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,772
I told you,
I'll go to another hospital tomorrow!

20
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,041
- I'm not in pain anymore!
- Lie down--

21
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,342
Let me out of here!

22
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,911
No abnormalities on the X-ray.

23
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,712
- Hey…
- Please lie down.

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,052
Could you kick your feet a bit?

25
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,153
What?

26
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,056
Huh?

27
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,125
Can you feel me?

28
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,629
No feeling due to motor paralysis.

29
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,665
It's pale…

30
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,967
Loss of pulse.

31
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,703
Please give me a minute.

32
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,139
A 47-year-old man

33
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:49,309
came in with acute pain
in his left lower limb.

34
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:53,079
The five Ps were all present,
such as paralysis and pulselessness.

35
00:01:59,085 --> 00:01:59,919
Okay.

36
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:04,457
Can you check if the leg
was really where the pain started.

37
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,494
And if he has a record
of high blood pressure or diabetes?

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,529
Your mother is a tea ceremony master.

39
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,731
Has that helped your surgical skills any?

40
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,199
Not at all.

41
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:16,669
Excuse me.

42
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,272
Toda speaking.

43
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,174
- Is it an emergency?
- Yes.

44
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:22,942
- But…
- Understood.

45
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,679
Relax. My résumé is pretty impressive,
no matter how you look at it.

46
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,149
I knew it, no atrial fibrillation.

47
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,717
How did you know?

48
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,353
The monitor beeped regularly
over the phone.

49
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,789
You could tell just over the phone?

50
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,558
The CT scans are in.

51
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,267
My leg isn't hurting anymore.
I want to go home.

52
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,201
You can't, sir.

53
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,437
You've been diagnosed
with aortic dissection.

54
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,107
Huh? Who the hell are you,
showing up out of nowhere?

55
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,976
- I'm out of here!
- Please stop moving!

56
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,044
Wait…

57
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,815
A specialist will now explain
everything to you.

58
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,485
You can go home if you want.

59
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,655
But… from the looks of it,

60
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,590
there's an 80% chance you'll die.

61
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,426
- Die?
- But you're lucky!

62
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,962
I'm a super cardiac expert.

63
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,232
I've treated many patients
with what you have,

64
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,701
including some who didn't make it.

65
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,469
Leave it to me!

66
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,074
Quit flirting with the monitor.

67
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,642
Sorry, Doc.

68
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,711
The survival rate drops by the hour.

69
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:35,415
We must cut now,
or the base of his heart might burst.

70
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:44,023
Man, I'm so glad you were around,
Dr. Chayasaka.

71
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,260
As well as Dr. Tokushige.

72
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,463
He handles everything so smoothly,
like with the scan,

73
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,832
it's as though he can
predict your next move.

74
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,802
Are all general physicians like that?

75
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,639
You know something,
the General Medicine Department…

76
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,476
Akira Tokushige, General Physician.

77
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:07,480
I wonder how many people are actually
interested in going into General Medicine.

78
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:12,619
The state seems to be promoting it,
yet taxes on healthcare are decreasing.

79
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,521
No one will come to our rescue.

80
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,458
It's up to us to defend our hospital.

81
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,793
The Director is also
aware of that, isn't he?

82
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,966
I'm not interested in politics,
so I'll pass on the complicated stuff.

83
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,701
This concerns Uotora's future--

84
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,669
But…!

85
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,507
Why is the Director so supportive of him?

86
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:40,213
What does that nice guy
with the glasses have?

87
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,816
That intrigues me a little.

88
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,765
"Uotora Hospital…

89
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,566
part-time physician."

90
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,937
Seven years ago,
he served as an ER doctor for some time.

91
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,844
There are two types of revolutionaries.

92
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,546
Revolutionaries?

93
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,381
Messengers of justice.

94
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,517
And…

95
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,119
charlatans.

96
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,125
I wonder which one he is.

97
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,263
Good morning.

98
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,907
GENERAL MEDICINE

99
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,117
I heard you were very helpful last night.

100
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,485
Not at all.

101
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,455
But I'm glad he was able
to have the surgery right away.

102
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,258
Don't get too far ahead.

103
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,229
If General Medicine earns more,
it will make my department stand out.

104
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,499
We can't have that.

105
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,276
Shall we begin?

106
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:19,912
We don't need Toda.

107
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,948
It's drinks with those
from our year, right?

108
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,549
Is that day still bugging you?

109
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,650
Hell no!

110
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,120
There's no way an elite
would want to drink with us.

111
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,490
He's directly under Chayasaka,
the Queen of Hearts.

112
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:33,993
What?

113
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,963
I don't hate the sound of
"Queen of Hearts." So, I'll forgive it.

114
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,799
But you're in my way, so go away.

115
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,700
Yes, ma'am!

116
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,337
Dr. Chayasaka,
I'd like to observe a surgery.

117
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,641
Can you guess what
the biggest waste of time in life is?

118
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,675
Huh?

119
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,744
Worrying about others.

120
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,983
CARDIO SURGERY
TRAINING ROOM

121
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,419
You got a death wish!
That was irreverent of you.

122
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,922
<i>After Dr. Osu…</i>

123
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,491
it could be your turn.

124
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,427
Turn for what?

125
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,232
Dr. Chayasaka has her eye on you.

126
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,401
You'll have a hard time.

127
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,639
It's a great thing to have someone
from another department

128
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,040
show interest in me.

129
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,877
General Medicine is finally
starting to take shape.

130
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,713
She’s more tenacious than a snake.

131
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,848
A snake?

132
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,118
She always follows
anyone she's interested in around,

133
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,921
but won't say anything about herself.

134
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,658
We know little about her
besides her flashy career.

135
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,028
Does she even go home?

136
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,130
That's if she even has one.

137
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,202
If she doesn't open up about herself,

138
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,839
we'll never really understand her.

139
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,106
Yeah.

140
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,777
Have you heard about Taku?

141
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,945
No.

142
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,215
He plans to take the equivalency exam,

143
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,851
yet he hasn't told his father about it.

144
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,087
Can't even tell his family.

145
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,591
Maybe because they're family.

146
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,826
<i>But who knows?</i>

147
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,907
I have an ashtray.

148
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:39,452
MATSUKAGE STYLE TEA HOUSE

149
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,007
You could have just mailed it
if you wanted my seal.

150
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,679
That'd be too much trouble.

151
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,288
How is it at the hospital?

152
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:16,989
It's all surgery.

153
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,991
I do nothing but cut.

154
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:32,104
I've gotten used to you
not doing what I want you to do.

155
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,616
Won't you stay for some tea?

156
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,588
I've forgotten it all.

157
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,298
"Once I start studying for exams,

158
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,701
I'll have to cut back on my part-time job.

159
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,104
I'm not sure
if I really need this or not."

160
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,642
It's scary to live for yourself, isn't it?

161
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,348
He says that every time
he tries to make a move,

162
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,083
his younger self appears to him.

163
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,052
"Can I really say that?"

164
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,357
"I must not be selfish and cause trouble."

165
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:26,892
Taku…

166
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,962
He's moving forward.

167
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,134
If he has become aware of his inner child,

168
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:39,572
then maybe he has
moved on to reassuring that child.

169
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,112
Yes?

170
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,246
You have a delivery.

171
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,981
- Oh?
- Thank you!

172
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,617
It's so heavy!

173
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,386
There are ten more boxes.

174
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,920
- Huh?
- What?

175
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,456
They're from Dr. Akaike.

176
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,333
DO IT. - YOUR MENTOR

177
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,901
- Thank you.
- Sure.

178
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,540
Seriously, who doesn't hate being on call?

179
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,743
Some things can only be enjoyed
by experiencing them live.

180
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,878
That may be so.

181
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,481
Your good friend, Dr. Chayasaka,
and I will be live with you tonight.

182
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,287
But I don't really get her.

183
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,824
It's like she can't
keep a conversation going.

184
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,426
And she sees others…

185
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,362
as insects.

186
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,436
I guess geniuses are just like that?

187
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,471
Yum.

188
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,979
This is for the other day.

189
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,519
Do you think eel and <i>shibazuke</i>
are good enough?

190
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:02,822
Come on.

191
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,590
It's delicious.

192
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:06,892
In that case…

193
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,931
How about this or this?

194
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,899
STEAMED BREAD WITH EGG
BREAD STICKS WITH CHOCOLATE CHIPS

195
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,834
And this?

196
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,002
Looks like a boys' sports club lineup.

197
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,339
I was in the cultural clubs.

198
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,441
- Really?
- Yeah.

199
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,243
Is it that surprising?

200
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,345
No. Remember that patient?

201
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,750
You pinned him down so naturally,
I thought you had done martial arts.

202
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:34,186
You don't say! I'm terrible at sports.

203
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,354
Then, how?

204
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,556
How, you ask?

205
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,627
Must be from my ER days.

206
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:46,565
I'd often deal with drunk people
and those in a panic.

207
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,467
- I naturally picked it up.
- Wait…

208
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,536
You used to work in the ER?

209
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,938
Yes, at the Mitsuzawa University Hospital.

210
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:57,042
But it seems my body still remembers.

211
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,112
Why?

212
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,547
Hm?

213
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,483
Why did you move to General Medicine?

214
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,384
Yeah.

215
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,553
Why…

216
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,357
Why…

217
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,959
Was there maybe a patient
you couldn't forget?

218
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,494
No…

219
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,030
Sorry.

220
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:23,903
It would be cool to have
a clear turning point that led me to it,

221
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,005
but that's not the case.

222
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,140
It just…

223
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,010
sort of came to me.

224
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,582
I felt an overwhelming passion
to treat patients till the very end.

225
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,851
That's when I came upon it.

226
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,719
That's all.

227
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,423
<i>Really?</i>

228
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,059
He sent some to General Medicine too?

229
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,696
It was you who introduced
Dr. Tokushige to Dr. Akaike.

230
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,498
- Am I right, sir?
- Yes.

231
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,768
It was when he worked here
at Uotora as a part-timer.

232
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,137
The patients I save…

233
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,607
I wonder how they're doing now.

234
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,145
Are they doing well,

235
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,648
or are they still hurting?

236
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,621
I don't know anything about them.

237
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,892
His words really struck me.

238
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,797
In today's medical world,
that's just wishful thinking…

239
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,065
an ideal.

240
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:31,270
But dreams will go to waste
if no one pursues them!

241
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,941
Someone has to wave the flag.

242
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:41,213
If that's what it takes,
I don't mind being the fool.

243
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,688
Sorry, it wasn't that interesting.

244
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:55,227
An ER doctor's task is to keep
the heart beating, no matter what.

245
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,229
Yes.

246
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,532
The same goes for us at Cardiovascular.

247
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,770
Treating organs,
doing all it takes to save patients…

248
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,274
Such doctors are old-fashioned!

249
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,643
Old-fashioned?

250
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,278
General physicians…

251
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,215
I mean, doctors like you…

252
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,485
May make some doctors feel

253
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,689
their medical practices
are being dismissed.

254
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,559
Dismissed?

255
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,530
Their medical practices?

256
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:36,835
What?

257
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,540
Do you feel that way, too?

258
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,443
That I'm dismissing your practices?

259
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:53,786
I believe that both types
of doctors are necessary.

260
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:03,095
My time in the ER remains precious to me.

261
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,930
But…

262
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,500
I couldn't take my eyes off

263
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,270
the path I wanted to take.

264
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,241
You're selfish.

265
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,377
Yes.

266
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,681
I'm quite selfish.

267
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,824
Making eye contact
makes people feel secure.

268
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,559
I'll rephrase that.

269
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,594
Repeating the patient's words

270
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,898
has the effect of helping them
organize their feelings and thoughts.

271
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:41,967
And…

272
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,004
Mirroring?

273
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,172
Mimicking movements.

274
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,576
Achieving intimacy and harmony
at an unconscious level,

275
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,779
to tell the person you engage
that you're not their enemy.

276
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,486
Caring for patients
is all about technique.

277
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,555
Insincere kindness.

278
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,258
Insincere?

279
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,739
Bingo!

280
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,078
Not many people can see through me.

281
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,781
You see the big picture.

282
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,818
Seeing all from a bird's eye view.

283
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,719
What?

284
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,421
Oh, my.

285
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,356
I had fun!

286
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:38,690
Hey…

287
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,225
Oh, sorry.

288
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,428
What do we have?

289
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,098
Suspected acute aortic dissection,
barely conscious upon retrieval.

290
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,566
Cerebral ischemia?

291
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,469
She said her daughter works at Uotora.

292
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,937
- Her daughter?
- Yes.

293
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,372
This way, please.

294
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,279
AI CHAYASAKA, AGE 68

295
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,413
Chayasaka…

296
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,450
Is it an aortic dissection?

297
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:05,984
Yes.

298
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,989
Is there a vacant OR?

299
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:11,890
Let's go.

300
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,092
Uh… yes.

301
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,460
Wait!

302
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,897
We don't operate on family members
on ethical grounds.

303
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,934
Then, who'll do it?

304
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,909
He's never done a solo surgery
and you expect me to assign him this?

305
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,646
Just get your neuro dad down here!

306
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,648
She's barely conscious.

307
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,617
I wouldn't…

308
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,389
perform surgery on my dad.

309
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,259
So?

310
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,863
Your judgement will be impaired.

311
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,700
Let's go.

312
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:01,440
Family or not, a heart is still a heart.

313
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,476
Dr. Chayasaka is performing
her mother's surgery?

314
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,084
Her vitals are stable.

315
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,452
Artificial blood vessel size?

316
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,720
28.

317
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,588
I set aside a 26 just in case.

318
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,523
Okay.

319
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,359
Let's do this.

320
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,495
Yes, ma'am.

321
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,130
Scalpel.

322
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,880
- If I stop… the water will get cold.
<i>- If you stop the water will get cold.</i>

323
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,316
Fold the <i>fukusa </i>cloth.

324
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,052
Hold the ladle.

325
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,355
You can't master it
if you still need to think about it.

326
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,960
Keep practicing and practicing
until your body

327
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,696
<i>naturally remembers.</i>

328
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,087
<i>During a tea ceremony,</i>

329
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:26,825
your hands have to act
ahead of your thoughts.

330
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,960
Unclamping.

331
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,365
<i>One step at a time,</i>
<i>without mixing them up.</i>

332
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,101
<i>You can't stop.</i>

333
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,605
Cooper scissors.

334
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,609
Check the ACT.

335
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,611
ACT is at 338.

336
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,314
Is the graft complete?

337
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,817
All replacements have been made.

338
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,052
I'm about to take her off bypass.

339
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,290
The Queen of Hearts…

340
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,828
Good morning.

341
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,099
Where…

342
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,470
am I?

343
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,172
The hospital.

344
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,444
Doctor…

345
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,979
Doctor…

346
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,517
My daughter.

347
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,621
Get her here.

348
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,626
My daugh--

349
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,062
Come in.

350
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,765
Excuse me, sir.

351
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,440
Should I take my coat off?

352
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:00,379
You're speaking to me
as the patient's family, right?

353
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,426
The left frontal lobe.

354
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,529
There's still ischemia
in the precentral gyrus.

355
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,298
Based on her current response
and physical findings,

356
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:24,536
your mother's right side
remains paralyzed.

357
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,305
She's also experiencing memory loss.

358
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,775
It'll be hard for her
to live independently.

359
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,878
So, she can't be left alone?

360
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,047
Are you going to go on leave?

361
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,017
You need time to think it over.

362
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,355
We have a care plan
that works with home care services.

363
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,758
Facilities are also an option.

364
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,795
I never thought I would be told

365
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:53,432
that I had the option of giving up
my career as a cardiac surgeon.

366
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,803
She has no one else to turn to.
It's just the two of you.

367
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:02,340
You're actually kind, Dr. Togo.

368
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,746
So the revolutionary…

369
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,714
is Director Kitano.

370
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,919
He wasn't deceived by Dr. Tokushige.

371
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,355
But you know that already.

372
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,926
A facility application form, please.

373
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,229
Surgeons must be able
to make quick decisions.

374
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:26,731
Right?

375
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,336
For higher brain dysfunction
and hemiplegia patients,

376
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,905
we provide round-the-clock
recovery care experts.

377
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,342
The environment… It's a small
group of people, and the staff--

378
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,511
Do I sign here?

379
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:40,412
What?

380
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:41,813
Oh, yes.

381
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,820
PATIENT'S NAME: AI CHAYASAKA

382
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,423
<i>You're really…</i>

383
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,526
gone down the path
I didn't want you to go.

384
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,894
REPRESENTATIVE: KOKORO…

385
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,846
<i>Doctor.</i>

386
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,248
If you please.

387
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,491
No. This would cause it to detach.

388
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,592
Yes, doctor.

389
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,997
<i>Please get…</i>

390
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,966
my daughter here.

391
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,349
<i>Could you reach out to Dr. Chayasaka?</i>

392
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,853
She wouldn't admit it,
but it's definitely affected her.

393
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,157
It's gotten to the point
where she can't hide it anymore.

394
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:03,328
She's trying to ignore
that part of herself.

395
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,432
Uotora needs her and her team.

396
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,267
Yes, sir.

397
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:15,140
Please examine her,
as a general physician.

398
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,312
Understood.

399
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,355
Excuse me.

400
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:43,268
I'm here to talk
with Ms. Kokoro Chayasaka.

401
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,476
I'm Akira Tokushige, General Physician.

402
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,380
Interesting.

403
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:01,419
I happen to have time to spare.

404
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,658
What will you do?

405
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,061
You can't fool me with cheap tricks.

406
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,765
Insincere kindness will backfire.

407
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,634
I might close myself off.

408
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,670
I'm aware of that.

409
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,039
So today,

410
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:25,243
let's talk with all our cards
out in the open.

411
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,346
Out in the open?

412
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,215
Yes.

413
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,896
HERE LIE MY THOUGHTS
AS A GENERAL PHYSICIAN

414
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,801
"A general physician's consultation…"

415
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,136
First off,

416
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:56,141
Dr. Chayasaka, this movement
I've seen you do over and over…

417
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,447
By tracing your movements,

418
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,550
we can find clues
that point to a diagnosis.

419
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:11,022
Do you have a headache?

420
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,397
No?

421
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,601
In that case,
it's not a biological problem.

422
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:28,406
Thus, it's either psychological or social.

423
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,142
Huh?

424
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,879
"A general physician's consultation
is different from counseling…"

425
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,982
<i>Which is simply listening to the patient.</i>

426
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,485
<i>It involves using various methods</i>

427
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,322
<i>to diagnose illnesses</i>
<i>and guide patients toward treatment.</i>

428
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,993
Dr. Chayasaka, you are aware
of these three words, are you not?

429
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,198
Biological, psychological, social.

430
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,367
Body, mind, and society?

431
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,535
That's correct.

432
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:03,508
These three factors interact
to cause physical and mental problems.

433
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:09,647
It is from these three angles
that general physicians examine patients.

434
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,183
And?

435
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,918
And now,

436
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:19,958
let us look at your situation
from a social angle.

437
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,164
You are an excellent
cardiovascular surgeon.

438
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:30,468
You have a long, distinguished career.

439
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:34,939
Moreover, you have a mission
to train young doctors.

440
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,543
That is something
you cannot allow to come to an end.

441
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,715
Because it is something
that only you can do.

442
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,452
Let us look at it…

443
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,022
from a psychological angle.

444
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:57,395
You are your mother's only daughter.

445
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,133
You're worried
about leaving her on her own.

446
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,002
ONLY DAUGHTER
WORRY

447
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,737
Is that what you're thinking?

448
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,741
Worried?

449
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,218
Carry on.

450
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:26,157
To be a doctor, or a daughter.

451
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,061
Now,

452
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,932
you must choose one of them.

453
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:42,073
Putting things off
won't solve the problem.

454
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,708
I know that!

455
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,348
You know that?

456
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,916
- But…
- But?

457
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:06,998
You are currently confronting
an issue about your own life.

458
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,536
However, it appears to me…

459
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,107
that you're unable to face it calmly.

460
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,180
I'm unable to face myself?

461
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:32,790
Face myself?

462
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,897
Shall we stop here?

463
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,000
What?

464
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,968
I'm sorry.

465
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,006
I think I've put you through enough.

466
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,075
Let's talk another day.

467
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,986
She's my mother!

468
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,492
She's your mother?

469
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,765
I can't cut her out.

470
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,805
I can't just abandon her, can I?

471
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,608
If…

472
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,344
If I did that…

473
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,483
I'll be yelled at.

474
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,230
Yelled at?

475
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,970
By whom?

476
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,140
<i>Mom.</i>

477
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,408
I'm sorry.

478
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:58,910
I'm sorry.

479
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,081
So…

480
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:08,820
will you take care
of your mother on your own?

481
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,122
I mean…

482
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,359
it's the right thing to do.

483
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,030
As human beings,

484
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:24,669
we have a need for rules
like ethics and morals.

485
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:30,008
However, if we let them consume us,

486
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,611
telling us how we should live,

487
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,215
or how to be good children,

488
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:41,519
they become shackles that bind us.

489
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,793
The tighter they bind us,

490
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,499
the stronger we may resist or fight back.

491
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,842
I hate you, Mom.

492
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,579
<i>I hate you so much.</i>

493
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,584
You're not Mr. Nice Doctor, after all.

494
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,261
You're making me face things
I don't want to.

495
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:28,966
I thought,

496
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,437
Dr. Chayasaka,

497
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,742
you might have been
struggling with something

498
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,511
you can't confront.

499
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,552
And what that something is,

500
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,424
you should already know.

501
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,604
Therefore…

502
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,312
Ms. Kokoro Chayasaka.

503
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,085
Please tell me…

504
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,322
your story.

505
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,195
My mother…

506
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,865
kept telling me,

507
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,835
"Why are you like this?"

508
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,472
"This is for your own good."

509
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,286
My mother…

510
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,788
- Not like this.
- She was strict.

511
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,291
Extend your elbow. Good.

512
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,325
Okay.

513
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,562
Why can't you do as you are told?

514
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,198
I'm sorry.

515
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:14,605
I'm sorry!

516
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,606
I'm sorry!

517
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:19,377
Next time, work harder
and get a perfect score.

518
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,379
This is for your own good.

519
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,551
When she caught me smoking
for the first time.

520
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,954
I'll never forget the look she gave me.

521
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,422
Why?

522
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,759
I'm an adult.

523
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,963
How could you do this?

524
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,601
You've really gone down
the path I didn't want you to go.

525
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,439
Nothing was said after that.

526
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,808
How "lucky" for me.

527
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,417
If only there were a clearer reason.

528
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,722
We just don't get along.

529
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,392
You don't get along?

530
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,597
I can't answer her "whys" and "how comes."

531
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:18,803
Little by little, feelings weighed us down

532
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,439
until they just burst.

533
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,077
And we became like this.

534
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,385
As mother and child,

535
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,890
your blood ties help you
to understand each other.

536
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,362
But that may just be a fantasy.

537
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,002
Being family…

538
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,940
doesn't mean it's best
for you to live life together.

539
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,512
But, Mom needs help now.

540
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,418
I can't bear to see her all alone.

541
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,624
This happened…

542
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,397
because I wasn't a good child.

543
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,967
I…

544
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:32,777
was an awful daughter.

545
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,714
It's possible,

546
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:42,820
your mother went through a difficult time.

547
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:50,194
But, that's all on her.

548
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:58,169
You don't have to take the blame for that.

549
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:03,974
You've been…

550
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:21,492
hurting yourself to such an extent
for someone else's sake.

551
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:26,630
That makes you…

552
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,101
a very nice person.

553
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,481
Are you hurting?

554
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,323
I can't bring myself to hate her.

555
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,498
If you take a step back,

556
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,002
you will see things more clearly.

557
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:13,511
If you want to get closer to her again,

558
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,615
you should be able to do that.

559
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:29,627
I have a question.

560
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,166
Go ahead.

561
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,703
I'll ask…

562
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,773
once it's all over.

563
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:51,482
Mom.

564
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,157
I can't live with you.

565
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,330
I'm sorry.

566
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,732
I'm an awful daughter.

567
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,478
Thank you.

568
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,687
My heart…

569
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,493
Thank you for saving me.

570
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,403
Thank you.

571
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,531
Answer me.

572
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:15,733
Yes?

573
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,673
Where do you think the soul is?

574
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:25,776
Hmm…

575
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,847
I don't think we have one.

576
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:38,155
That's because, medically speaking,
there's no such organ as a soul.

577
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,927
What a terrible answer.

578
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,731
Nevertheless, people still connect.

579
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:59,643
When you see someone you like,
your chest pounds.

580
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,813
When someone hurts you,

581
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,549
your eyes well up.

582
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,224
Between us,

583
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:19,063
a soul is formed.

584
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,633
That's what I believe.

585
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,820
Care for some sushi?

586
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,321
Sounds good.

587
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:46,924
When is a good time?

588
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,192
Now, of course.

589
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,427
- What?
- Sorry.

590
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,529
I have plans today.

591
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,164
- What? Hey!
- If you'll excuse me.

592
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:59,336
We plan to renovate this area
to integrate the operating room and ICU.

593
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,907
Impressive as always.

594
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:09,013
This is our chance
to taste cutting-edge medical care!

595
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:11,515
<i>I've made up my mind.</i>

596
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,653
I'm running in the next director election.

597
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,336
It seems Dr. Chayasaka made up her mind.

598
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,139
Yes.

599
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,908
You spoke with her.

600
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,581
How nice of you.

601
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,261
A patient here gave me these.

602
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,097
It's against the rules.

603
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,034
But…

604
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,538
Life can't be all bitter.

605
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,608
At times, we could use a little sweetness.

606
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:33,030
Let me go…

607
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,032
home.

608
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,502
Let me…

609
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,373
go home…

610
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,910
Stage four, lung cancer.

611
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,179
There's nothing more the hospital can do.

612
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,581
<i>He has requested home care.</i>

613
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,883
Can I assign him to you?

614
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,886
I have one foot in the grave.

615
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:59,723
<i>I'd always been praying</i>
<i>for my patients' future. But…</i>

616
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,024
That's enough!

617
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,626
<i>Dad is fighting so hard…</i>

618
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,695
That's what it is to die.

619
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:05,896
<i>What can we do?</i>

620
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,133
The answer lies in the time
you'll spend together from now on.

621
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,134
