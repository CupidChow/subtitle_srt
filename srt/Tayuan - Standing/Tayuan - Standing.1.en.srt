717
01:07:03,942 --> 01:07:05,110
And where will you go?

718
01:07:05,135 --> 01:07:06,637
I needed to borrow some cash.

719
01:07:06,637 --> 01:07:08,262
But you’re not here.

720
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:11,230
I’ve already given countless
promissory notes to Cindy’s school.

721
01:07:12,518 --> 01:07:14,425
I already borrowed from your cousin.

722
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:16,230
Just pay Nigel back.

723
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,492
You shouldn’t have
waited for the due date.

724
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,526
I know the principal.

725
01:07:20,657 --> 01:07:22,825
I should have just talked to him instead!

726
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:24,852
I’ve already done my part
and yet you’re still mad?

727
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:28,367
My point is, you should have waited for me!

728
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:30,327
That’s exactly what I’ve been doing!

729
01:07:30,327 --> 01:07:32,829
And I’m so sick and tired
of waiting for you!

730
01:07:32,829 --> 01:07:35,207
I stopped living the life
I had for nothing!

731
01:07:35,207 --> 01:07:37,253
You have a family!
You have a house to live in!

732
01:07:37,278 --> 01:07:38,776
Under the roof of your aunt!

733
01:07:38,801 --> 01:07:42,005
Relying on the help of your cousin,
of neighbors, or anybody else

734
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:44,241
- while you’re not around!
- They are my family!

735
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:46,590
We are such a burden to them!

736
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:49,323
- But they are doing it willingly!
- Just because they pity us!

737
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:50,630
Don’t you feel ashamed?!

738
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:52,658
Don’t you have any pride left?

739
01:07:52,683 --> 01:07:54,518
You’re the only one
who’s ashamed of me!

740
01:07:54,518 --> 01:07:56,372
What do you think of yourself?

741
01:07:56,397 --> 01:07:57,690
Do you know what others
are saying about you?

742
01:07:57,715 --> 01:07:59,731
That you’re such a trash! Worthless!

743
01:07:59,731 --> 01:08:00,774
- That’s enough!
- You’re such a burden!

744
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,509
- Useless!
- I said enough!

745
01:08:28,927 --> 01:08:33,515
Have you noticed that you keep on asking,
“Who am I?”

746
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:37,114
Who damaged you for you
to belittle yourself like that?

747
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:46,372
Let’s meet tomorrow.
I have something important to tell you.

748
01:09:24,986 --> 01:09:28,406
Bro, I'm not coming to the terminal.
I’ll get off at the next bus stop.

Hello? Nigel, what is it?

751
01:09:42,723 --> 01:09:45,503
Cousin, it's Bing.
She's in the emergency room right now.

752
01:09:45,528 --> 01:09:46,488
What?!

753
01:09:46,513 --> 01:09:47,981
But we're about to go home.

754
01:09:48,256 --> 01:09:50,778
Okay! I'm on my way.

755
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:53,512

757
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:07,359
Nigel, cousin, where is Bing?

758
01:11:08,393 --> 01:11:09,859
She’s upstairs.

759
01:11:10,245 --> 01:11:13,123
The doctor said she’s already stable.

760
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:14,441
Why? What happened?

761
01:11:15,382 --> 01:11:17,180
She had a bleeding.

762
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:20,003
But the doctor said the baby is fine.

763
01:11:21,112 --> 01:11:22,822
What? She’s pregnant?

764
01:11:36,656 --> 01:11:37,699
Bing…

765
01:11:40,449 --> 01:11:42,826
I’m sorry, I didn’t know.

766
01:11:44,283 --> 01:11:47,036
If you had known earlier,
would it make any difference?

767
01:11:47,292 --> 01:11:48,502
Of course.

768
01:11:48,877 --> 01:11:52,005
Are you just going to be responsible
whenever I’m pregnant?

769
01:11:52,005 --> 01:11:54,883
Don’t worry, I won’t let that happen.

770
01:11:54,908 --> 01:11:57,869
It’s still early,
I can do something about this.

771
01:11:58,345 --> 01:12:00,764
You’re having an abortion?

772
01:12:00,764 --> 01:12:02,641
But I can provide for this baby.

773
01:12:02,891 --> 01:12:04,309
I’ll do everything I can.

774
01:12:04,768 --> 01:12:06,686
That’s beside the point, Rico.

775
01:12:06,686 --> 01:12:09,022
This is my body, my future.

776
01:12:09,022 --> 01:12:11,608
I don’t want to be stuck again

Whichever gives you a peace of mind.

780
01:12:19,074 --> 01:12:20,305
Bing,

781
01:12:20,784 --> 01:12:22,994
do you really hate me that much?

782
01:12:23,537 --> 01:12:25,664
Don’t you feel anything for me at all?

783
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,917
Before, maybe there’s something left.

784
01:12:29,501 --> 01:12:32,170
But now, I don’t know anymore.
I’m so confused.

785
01:12:32,373 --> 01:12:38,463
But if you still have feelings for me,
you will respect my decision.

786
01:13:16,737 --> 01:13:18,578
Good morning!

787
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:24,227
Miss, it’s you again?

788
01:13:24,806 --> 01:13:25,599
Yes.

789
01:13:26,266 --> 01:13:28,226
You’re looking for Rico?

790
01:13:28,226 --> 01:13:29,802
Where is Rico Salas?

791
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:32,081
Oh, he’s on leave!

792
01:13:32,216 --> 01:13:37,165
He’s probably excited even if
it would take nine more months.

793
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:40,296
What?

794
01:13:41,156 --> 01:13:45,284
His live-in partner is pregnant.

795
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:51,625
Maybe the woman is having gestational
cravings, so he has to go home.

796
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:56,296
I’m not sure when he'll be back.
Probably next week.

797
01:13:56,296 --> 01:13:57,774
Why don’t you just text him?

798
01:14:00,383 --> 01:14:01,593
Do you want to have some coffee?

799
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,634
No, thanks.

800
01:14:06,306 --> 01:14:07,307
Alright.

801
01:14:31,355 --> 01:14:35,977
I even begged and stooped down
to that level…

802
01:14:36,002 --> 01:14:37,419
but for what?

803
01:14:37,921 --> 01:14:39,709
For a conductor?

804
01:14:41,193 --> 01:14:43,886
You know, no one is belittling you.

805
01:14:44,002 --> 01:14:46,264
You just did what you had to do.

806
01:14:46,971 --> 01:14:48,472
And that’s okay.

807
01:14:50,058 --> 01:14:52,022
It’s not okay, Mags!

808
01:14:52,047 --> 01:14:56,022
I really should just stick
to what I normally do,

809
01:14:56,047 --> 01:14:57,533
to my rules!

810
01:14:58,166 --> 01:15:00,388
No hooking up
with the same guy,

811
01:15:00,743 --> 01:15:03,168
no sharing of personal information
and no kissing,

812
01:15:03,193 --> 01:15:05,292
so that there’ll be no expectations.

813
01:15:06,765 --> 01:15:08,851
But you’re forgetting something.

814
01:15:10,621 --> 01:15:12,039
It should be discreet.

815
01:15:17,919 --> 01:15:20,016
So, what do you expect?

816
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:22,293
He already has a family.

817
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:26,720
You already know right
from the start that it’s all wrong.

818
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:30,997
That’s why you kept it
a secret even from me.

819
01:15:31,433 --> 01:15:36,951
He told me that they are
just living together just because.

820
01:15:39,107 --> 01:15:42,402
But now, they even
have another child!

821
01:15:42,427 --> 01:15:46,295
He just used me to satisfy his needs
while they are in LDR!

822
01:15:47,115 --> 01:15:48,950
That makes you even.

823
01:15:50,157 --> 01:15:53,285
You also used Rico
to satisfy your needs.

824
01:15:53,747 --> 01:15:56,124
Are you on my side or what?

825
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,920
You know what?
I’m just stating facts.

826
01:16:00,945 --> 01:16:04,857
Now, if you’re hurting,
you better endure the pain.

827
01:16:05,341 --> 01:16:08,389
So that you would easily
come to your senses.

828
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:10,638
What’s your plan?

829
01:16:13,644 --> 01:16:15,521
I'll find someone else!

830
01:16:17,076 --> 01:16:18,703
For me to be able to forget him.

831
01:16:18,728 --> 01:16:20,354
Past is past.

832
01:16:20,379 --> 01:16:21,826
I should move on right away.

833
01:16:23,234 --> 01:16:26,146
Obviously, it won’t work.

834
01:16:26,451 --> 01:16:27,731
Why?

835
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:30,508
Because you fell head over heels for him!

836
01:16:30,533 --> 01:16:31,826
Screw that!

837
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,550
I never fall.

838
01:16:33,575 --> 01:16:35,494
I don’t fall, never.

839
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:38,391
They should be the one running after me!

840
01:16:38,416 --> 01:16:40,794
They should be the
one falling for me!

841
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:44,998

There’s no need.
I just dropped by to return this.

861

You owe me at least that!

At least they’ve told me.

866
01:19:16,941 --> 01:19:20,246
Ella, I also don’t know
how did that happen.

867

But Bing needs me right now.

Then, how about my needs?

You two are different.
You’re a lot stronger.

You’re always playing the victim!

You're always trapped
in an inevitable circumstance!

878

what was right for you back then?
