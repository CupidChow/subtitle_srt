00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:13,002
I was hired
to find a gunman to kill the former mayor.

Who is he?

9
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:16,177

Whatever Olarn did

11
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:21,586
someone in the shadow is manipulating it.

12
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:23,298
But he never says who that is.

13
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:28,573
There's only one person in this whole town
who can order Olarn.

14
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:34,854
Everything that happened
was your plan from the beginning.

15
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:38,054
The day you were ordered
to kill Lawyer Boripat.

16

A woman helped him, right?

17
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:43,713
That was decades ago. I don't know who she is.

18
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:45,729
Just one woman, why do you care?

19
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:48,007
Because she might be my mother.

20
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,815
I promise.

21
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:51,845

a talented person like Olarn.

Don't you really know that
Olarn is just pretending?

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,317
He might not be as good as you think.

37
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,483
If he's not good.

38
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:47,017
Why would Chalinee support him?

39
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,017
Judge Chalinee is a good person.
Therefore, she could support a good man.

40
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,950

<i>Is that enough?</i>

48
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:55,183

00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:50,983
I was so shocked. You're sleeping here.

182
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:54,017
I passed the market today.

183
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:56,717
I bought your favorite honeycomb cookies.

184
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:58,517
Aunt Lam Chiak was just closing her shop.

185
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:16,103
Mom… Mom… Mom…

186
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:25,493
- Mom… Mom… Who did this to you?
- Sargent.

187
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:27,117
The evidence will be damaged.
Take him out of the scene.

188
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:27,862
- Sargent.
- Sargent.

189
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:29,526
- Sargent.
- Mom, Mom.

190
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:36,922
Mom, Mom.

191
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:41,920
Mom, Mom.

192
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,317
His mother would never commit suicide.

193
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,883
She waits for Sargent to come home every day.

194
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:57,117
Why did you kill her!

195
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:32,430
<i>[Mrs. Riam Kaew Udon, 79 years old]</i>

196
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:43,602
<i>[Mrs. Riam Kaew Udon, 79 years old]</i>

197
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,383
Sargent.

198
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,017
I know this is not the right time to say this.

199
00:20:58,483 --> 00:20:59,683
But we have to move on.

200
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:09,617
I want to take care of
my mother's matter first.

201
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:12,150
Then I will pay for everything,

202
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:20,017
including your mother.

203
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,183
Sargent.

204
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,550
If you know anything about my mother.

205
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:32,950
You have to tell me.

206
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,650
One day, you will know the whole story.

207
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:41,650
I won't hide anything from you.

208
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:45,517
Sargent.

209
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,883
Please join with us.

210
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,283
Olarn won't let you go.

211
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:55,183
I won't run away.

212
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,650
If you want revenge, do it now.

213
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:23,150
Even though I can't be a good cop for you,

214
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:30,217
I'll do what… I should do.

215
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,083
May the good intentions I will do
to repay this city

216
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,450
become a protective shield.

217
00:23:15,232 --> 00:23:19,550
Whoever wants to destroy me and this city,

218
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,917
may they perish.

219
00:23:57,764 --> 00:23:59,950
I want you to think carefully.

220
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,650
At least the police uniform
and the police station

221
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,383
can protect you, Itt.

222
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,598
I have something to do, chief.

223
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:12,950
Everyone knows you are not guilty in the case.

224
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:18,326
It's not over. You should stay
and finish this case.

225
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:24,825
I don't dare to be a police officer
anymore, chief.

226
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,717
Thank you for your good wishes.

227
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:33,950
I'm sorry about your mother.

228
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:36,750
Don't even think to fight against them.

229
00:24:37,483 --> 00:24:39,150
Stay still, and you'll be safe.

230
00:24:41,584 --> 00:24:44,950
I'm warning you with good intentions.

231
00:25:05,285 --> 00:25:06,629
Do you need my hand, brother?

232
00:25:07,642 --> 00:25:11,183
Oh, it's okay. There's not much.
I'll manage it.

233
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:42,150
Hello, everyone.

234
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,250
This is the "Tam Tueng Tee" show.

235
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,150
We're honored to have two leaders of this city.

236
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,850
They will solve all doubts with us today.

237
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,917
The first leader,

238
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,817
our mayor, Mr. Olarn.

239
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,700
Hello.

240
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:02,956
And another one, Judge Chalinee.

241
00:26:02,956 --> 00:26:04,364
- Hello.
- Hello.

242
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:10,325
Let me start with the issue
that is very popular right now.

243
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:12,383
Let me go straight to the point.

244
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:16,850
Will your support of Mayor Olarn this time

245
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,250
affect your ideology of justice?

246
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,417
And how?

247
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,823
I'd rather answer this question.

248
00:26:24,823 --> 00:26:28,023
I want to clarify to the audience.

249
00:26:28,023 --> 00:26:31,415
<i>Right now, I am Tulakham's mayor.</i>

250
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:41,183
I will perform my duties as mayor worthy
of the townspeople's trust.

251
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,717
Of course.

252
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:46,683
I wouldn't be the mayor,

253
00:26:46,683 --> 00:26:51,517
if I did not receive support
from the beloved judge.

254
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:56,817
I must say that
I am happy to serve Judge Chalinee.

255
00:26:56,817 --> 00:27:05,150
So that she can successfully fulfill
her commitment with everything I had.

256
00:27:05,978 --> 00:27:08,217
This means

257
00:27:08,217 --> 00:27:11,350
all the businesses of Olarn Group

258
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,740
have caused doubts

259
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,150
and problems for Judge Chalinee and me.

260
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:28,156
Therefore, I am ready to transfer
all the businesses to show my sincerity.

261
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:39,683
Your determination for Tulakham's people
is impressive, Mr. Olarn.

262
00:27:39,683 --> 00:27:43,200
Now, let's hear from Judge Chalinee.

263
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,217
And for my beloved citizens.

264
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:50,751
Whatever I promise,

265
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:57,718
I guarantee it with my position as the mayor.
It will happen, for sure.

266
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:02,817
If the judge can bring Olarn to the light.

267
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:06,183
Sargent Itt could pull him back into the dark.

268
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:10,945
They'll get rid of Itt
unless he'll be one of them.

269
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:14,785
Sargent Itt will never escape this city.

270
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:35,417
Today, both of you give a great speech.

271
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,283
You talked too much.

272
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:45,383
Don't try to upstage me.

273
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:49,175
And don't say anything I didn't tell you to.

274
00:29:12,153 --> 00:29:13,583
<i>I told you to be quiet!</i>

275
00:29:17,617 --> 00:29:18,650
<i>Help me.</i>

276
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:25,283
<i>Shut up!</i>

277
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,650
<i>Stay still.</i>

278
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,217
<i>Ouch!</i>

279
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,423
<i>- Hey, where are you going?
- Let me go.</i>

280
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:51,717
<i>Let me go. Let go of me.</i>

281
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,950
<i>Let go of me.</i>

282
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,050
<i>Let him go.</i>

283
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:07,283
<i>Hey, where are you going?</i>

284
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:14,050
<i>Go!</i>

285
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,083
<i>Run away!</i>

286
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:16,783
<i>Go, hurry up!</i>

287
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:17,983
<i>Go, kiddo! Go!</i>

288
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:45,974
<i>Please don't hurt me. My kid is still young.</i>

289
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:49,558
<i>Let me go, please. I beg you.</i>

290
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:03,048
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

291
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,317
<i>Remember, you're dead.</i>

292
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,417
<i>You're dead.</i>

293
00:31:17,117 --> 00:31:18,283
<i>You have to get out of here.</i>

294
00:31:18,883 --> 00:31:21,817
<i>Get away from here. And don't come back.</i>

295
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,517
<i>I won't go. I'll stay with my daughter.</i>

296
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:30,175
<i>If you don't go, I'll kill your daughter.</i>

297
00:31:31,711 --> 00:31:35,217
<i>I'll hunt down your family.
Kill your entire family.</i>

298
00:31:35,217 --> 00:31:38,083
<i>Did you hear that? Go!</i>

299
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:51,403
I'm so proud of you, Lawyer.

300
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:55,051
You helped an innocent person
like Sargent Itt walk away from this.

301
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:59,231
I never thought this story would be
this complicated and mysterious.

302
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:03,327
Dad, that's enough.
You've talked about this many times.

303
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,317
My girl is fantastic.

304
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:12,183
You stunned the prosecutor.

305
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:15,383
Hey.

306
00:33:15,383 --> 00:33:18,717
This means you helped Judge Chalinee

307
00:33:18,717 --> 00:33:20,417
to uphold justice, don't you?

308
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:25,350
It's no wonder you're her scholarship student.

309
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,383
I really want you to work alongside her.

310
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:34,817
Dad.

311
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,117
What if she's not what we think?

312
00:33:40,092 --> 00:33:41,983
How come, sweetie?

313
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,117
From what we're seeing,

314
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,517
it is already proven by itself.

315
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,598
Let's eat.

316
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,650
You guys came so fast.

317
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,750
Sorry for bothering you.

318
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,663
I actually wanted to go to your shop.

319
00:34:38,663 --> 00:34:40,983
But I'm so busy.

320
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:42,326
I'm really sorry.

321
00:34:42,326 --> 00:34:43,283
Oh.

322
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:44,550
It's totally fine.

323
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,650
I'm so glad you called.

324
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:50,283
Prao must be pleased, too.

325
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:53,317
Here's the thing,

326
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:58,717
I'd like you to collect old photos of Tulakham.

327
00:34:59,644 --> 00:35:02,550
I'd like to collect and exhibit them.

328
00:35:03,217 --> 00:35:05,983
So that the new generation
can learn about the town's history.

329
00:35:06,654 --> 00:35:08,750
I have some of them.

330
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,283
I think you will be able to find more.

331
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,583
Getting photos from
10-20 years ago would be great.

332
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,700
You're very welcome.

333
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,076
Could you frame old photos from my home?

334
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:26,875
Oh, okay.

335
00:35:28,687 --> 00:35:30,850
I really have to thank you.

336
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:32,842
Also…

337
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:34,850
I owe you a lot of favor.

338
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:37,417
It's okay.

339
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,717
We owe each other something,

340
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:41,317
so we gradually repay.

341
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,916
As for the lawyer's license, I lobby for you.

342
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,516
It's going to be fine.

343
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,383
Thank you very much.

344
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,642
If I had a good lawyer like Prao to help me,

345
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,183
I would feel more comfortable.

346
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:07,776
If Prao's mother had been here,
she would probably have been proud.

347
00:36:07,776 --> 00:36:10,383
Let's make an appointment
to pick up the pictures.

348
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:13,783
Okay, may I be excused?

349
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,317
Kitti,

350
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,550
I feel guilty about Prao

351
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:24,117
that I can't find her mother.

352
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,683
I'm really sorry.

353
00:36:30,516 --> 00:36:31,550
It's okay.

354
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:34,383
As in the past,

355
00:36:35,252 --> 00:36:37,783
you have been very grateful to my family.

356
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:40,917
Excuse me.

357
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,423
320.9593.

358
00:37:24,156 --> 00:37:26,717
Got it. This row.

359
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,783
There you go.

360
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:31,239
<i>[Thank you]</i>

361
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,583
Hello, Sargent Itt.

362
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:50,750
Where are you now?

363
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:53,317
I gave them all to you

364
00:39:53,317 --> 00:39:55,250
for taking care of my mother.

365
00:39:57,715 --> 00:39:59,250
I hope you find your mother soon.

366
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,436
Oh, one more thing.

367
00:40:01,436 --> 00:40:04,700
Remember, I owe you nothing.

368
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:08,104
Wait, Sargent. Where are you now?

369
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:09,704
We need your help.

370
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:14,317
You got my stuff, so leave now.

371
00:40:14,317 --> 00:40:16,083
I don't want to be involved
with you guys anymore.

372
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,317
Prao, let's go.

373
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,817
Itt won't leave Tulakham.

374
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:47,250
He lives here, and I know him well.

375
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:53,083
Olarn gave a thank you party
to all the villagers.

376
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:57,650
I guess he wants you to know that
people love him.

377
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,517
If Olarn acts like you,

378
00:41:05,517 --> 00:41:07,083
how will you handle it?

379
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:21,483
You have to remember the rules.

380
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:24,517
To come here, you must be deaf or mute.

381
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,372
You should practice being mute, too.

382
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:46,150
Ever since Lawyer Prao joined the team,

383
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,717
you seem more like a lawyer than ever.

384
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:51,700
I don't believe Lawyer Prao
doesn't have any effect.

385
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:56,450
I'm sorry to bring you to risk.

386
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,917
Hey, bro.

387
00:41:58,917 --> 00:41:59,983
You didn't bring me here.

388
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:02,150
I followed you.

389
00:42:03,848 --> 00:42:07,083
If you hadn't brought me out of
that vicious cycle of drug dealing,

390
00:42:08,183 --> 00:42:10,683
I wouldn't have followed you
to do something fun.

391
00:42:13,704 --> 00:42:15,304
I will follow you everywhere.

392
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:20,409
Tan, I have never seen you as a minion.

393
00:42:22,137 --> 00:42:23,865
You are my brother.

394
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,883
<i>But even if he wins the election,</i>

395
00:42:36,717 --> 00:42:38,817
<i>I will not stop trying to take him down.</i>

396
00:42:43,745 --> 00:42:46,140
<i>By law, don't forget.</i>

397
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,183
<i>By law.</i>

398
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,359
<i>[Central Prosecutor's Office]</i>

399
00:43:02,596 --> 00:43:05,817
I can't believe that Lawyer Boripat
has many connections.

400
00:43:06,372 --> 00:43:08,517
You even know someone here.

401
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:10,450
You are truly admirable.

402
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,517
He's a real corruption fighter.

403
00:43:14,756 --> 00:43:17,060
Don't tell me that it's Prosecutor Arnat.

404
00:43:19,428 --> 00:43:21,988
Unbelievable. You have friends of such a level?

405
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:26,020
Not exactly friends.
He's a bit more like an enemy.

406
00:43:27,932 --> 00:43:29,183
Hello, Attorney Arnat.

407
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:34,130
I'm Praochanok. I'm secretly your fan.

408
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:38,990
How did you end up becoming this guy's tool?

409
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,975
You even graduated with honors.

410
00:43:41,975 --> 00:43:44,317
I'm disappointed with your scholarship donor.

411
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:52,332
I heard you helped
that police officer acquitted.

412
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:01,283
More importantly, anything related to this guy
always interests me.

413
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,817
For the record.

414
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,883
No matter what you ask me to do, I won't do it.

415
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:09,893
I just want to propose something fun.

416
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:13,221
In case you want to do something exciting.

417
00:44:14,816 --> 00:44:16,217
Ms. Lawyer.

418
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:18,090
Let me tell you something.

419
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:22,824
This guy likes to use people around him

420
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,850
to achieve his goals.

421
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,150
Be careful, Lawyer Prao.

422
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:31,483
Sargent Itt gave me a set of documents.

423
00:44:32,117 --> 00:44:34,317
This document is reliable.

424
00:44:34,317 --> 00:44:37,817
I can't trust anyone in
the prosecutor's office in Tulakham.

425
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,783
Even your senior prosecutor, Charoen.

426
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:50,283
I think the most unreliable person is you.

427
00:44:51,052 --> 00:44:55,468
And I repeat, I don't want to get involved.

428
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:56,817
Oh, wait…

429
00:44:56,817 --> 00:44:59,083
Wait a minute. Aren't you going to look
at this document?

430
00:45:01,752 --> 00:45:05,250
Why? Are you afraid of going to Tulakham?

431
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:21,250
Do you think the Prosecutor Arnat
will cooperate with us?

432
00:45:23,892 --> 00:45:24,983
It isn't easy.

433
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,917
He had never trusted me
since I had worked with my uncle.

434
00:45:32,145 --> 00:45:35,617
But at least he cares about Tulakham's justice.

435
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,817
Hello.

436
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,083
Okay, see you.

437
00:45:49,423 --> 00:45:50,617
Oh, hey, wait.

438
00:46:45,089 --> 00:46:47,389
<i>[Olarn Khampituk, Mayor]</i>

439
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:23,517
He'll come to me.

440
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,215
I know him well.

441
00:47:34,675 --> 00:47:36,583
You don't have to deliver it yourself.

442
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:38,340
I can send someone to get it.

443
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,550
There are so many items.
If it gets damaged, it'll be tough.

444
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,383
Oh, that's okay.

445
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,883
I intended to deliver it myself.

446
00:47:46,883 --> 00:47:49,450
In case something goes wrong,
I'll be able to fix it.

447
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,717
Thank you very much, Kitti.

448
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:01,783
You're welcome.

449
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,983
I should thank you

450
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,450
for taking care of my family all along.

451
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:10,683
Prao also respects you like a mother.

452
00:48:12,987 --> 00:48:15,250
I love Prao like a daughter.

453
00:48:15,995 --> 00:48:19,250
This is a gift for Prao.

454
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,983
Thank you very much, ma'am.

455
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:30,150
I'm delighted.

456
00:48:30,772 --> 00:48:33,017
Prao must be very happy, too.

457
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:35,217
Goodbye.

458
00:48:54,523 --> 00:48:57,783
Oh, there you are, Praochanok,
my talented lawyer.

459
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:02,417
Wow. They're my favorites, Dad.

Oh, wait.

461
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,417
A gift for a great lawyer.

462
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,250
Is it mine?

463
00:49:20,192 --> 00:49:22,017
This is my lawyer's license.

464
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,017
She asked me to help her with some work.

465
00:49:25,017 --> 00:49:28,729
She asked me to collect old photos
of this city to exhibit at the art gallery.

466
00:49:30,023 --> 00:49:31,883
She lobbied for you.

467
00:49:33,283 --> 00:49:34,328
Do you know?

468
00:49:34,328 --> 00:49:36,650
She has done our family a great favor.

469
00:49:40,096 --> 00:49:41,283
What's with the face?

470
00:49:43,802 --> 00:49:47,130
Hey, don't speak anymore, Mr. Kitti.

471
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:49,198

<i>[Next Episode]</i>

00:51:07,893 --> 00:51:12,491
Do you mean Judge Chalinee
is involved with this case?

476

I feel like ripping it off you.

477
