5
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:07,514
Now, your uncle's gang is in Chalinee's hands.
<i>[Previous Episode]</i>

6
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,779
Are you afraid of being trashed?

7
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:26,049
Since we have the same enemy.

8
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:30,092
Why don't we keep the peace
and expose Chalinee?

9
00:02:31,674 --> 00:02:34,584
You testify for Win to be acquitted.

10
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:37,807
So he can get out and deal with Judge Chalinee.

11
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:41,264
My minion's name is Pued.

12
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:44,272
Then, Pued was furious at the defendant.

13
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,182
So he killed Mr. Prem.

14
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:52,123
Lawyer Boripat had someone send me
these pictures to threaten me.

15
00:02:56,027 --> 00:03:00,402
The one who truly protects Tulakham
must not be a traitor.

16
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:04,308
Don't do anything behind my back.

17
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,728
Have your man take Prangthip
to search this place.

18
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:22,817
I need to check if there is something
I need to clean up.

19
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:24,888
Shin.

20
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,617
Yes, please follow me.

21
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:48,850
Lawyer Boripat had someone send me
these pictures to threaten me.

22
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:57,759
He needs me to testify.

23
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,650
Otherwise, he'll use these pictures against me.

24
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:07,961
You probably want Lawyer Praochanok
to win the case.

25
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:14,240
Oh, of course.

26
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:20,850
I have to drive justice
in all forms in Tulakham.

27
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:27,492
And you must support my orders.

28
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:31,475
Which I have done all my life if you remember.

29
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:49,150
And if you are worried about me,

30
00:04:50,383 --> 00:04:52,317
what can I do to protect myself?

31
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:23,150
The one who truly protects Tulakham
must not be a traitor.

32
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,501
Don't do anything behind my back.

33
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:23,000
What did you get?

34
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,728
The businessman who came to talk to the judge

35
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,917
was involved
in the international tour business.

36
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,117
And what is this tour, sir?

37
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,317
They bring their own people
to work at every step.

38
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:41,483
Such as a tour bus, a tour guide,
a restaurant, and a souvenir shop.

39
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,000
This tour doesn't provide any benefits
for the townspeople.

40
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,217
You check who is running this kind of
business in this city. Tell them to stop it.

41
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:53,250
And if they don't stop, I'll shut them down.

42
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:55,350
Yes, sir.

43
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:01,517
<i>Breaking news. There was a murder
on a cruise ship.</i>

44
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:06,867
<i>The deceased was a 14-year-old girl.
The body was found floating in the sea.</i>

45
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:11,817
<i>Initial assumptions are that the deceased
was raped and thrown from the cruise ship.</i>

46
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:16,483
Sorry, I'm late.

47
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:18,917
Hurry up. She's been waiting for you
for a long time. Go.

48
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,583
Prangthip.

49
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:34,825
Yes, Madam.

50
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:39,350
You should check the security cameras
in this house. Don't be careless.

51
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,017
Yes, Madam.

52
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,617
Your eyes look like someone I know.

53
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:10,250
I can't help but miss her when I see you.

54
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,150
Yes.

55
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:33,818
<i>[Mr. Lee]</i>

56
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:36,817
Can you hand me the phone?

57
00:08:57,832 --> 00:09:01,050
Hello, are you going to ask me
to play golf again?

58
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:04,650
How did you know? I want a rematch.

59
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:06,383
Didn't you learn a lesson?

60
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:09,817
Aren't you afraid of history repeating itself?

61
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,583
I'm not afraid of losing again.

62
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:15,117
Because I received good advice
from the judge of Tulakham.

63
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,783
How much do I have to prepare for this time?

64
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:34,450
I'm glad you're here.

65
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,650
I've come to tell you some important news.

66
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:44,350
I heard that Judge Chalinee would make an appointment
with the prominent businessman, Chairman Lee.

67
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:49,883
<i>Sure, I'll prepare a press conference for you.</i>

68
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:53,522
<i>Goodbye.</i>

69
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,917
Where is it?

70
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:01,983
From what I've heard.

71
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,650
There will be a meeting at the golf course.

72
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,417
There might be a press conference as well.

73
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,117
Hello, Lawyer Win.

74
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,483
She came to inform us that

75
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,683
Judge Chalinee…

76
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,150
is about to meet Chairman Lee,
the businessman who came last time.

77
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:40,383
But this time, There will be
a press conference.

78
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,450
I'll take my leave now.

79
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:54,425
Goodbye.

80
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:55,705
Thank you very much.

81
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:56,709
Yes.

82
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:14,250
Chairman Lee is a big businessman.

83
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,450
There will be an appointment
with Judge Chalinee.

84
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,017
And there will be a press conference.

85
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:24,350
First, I'd like to tell you
how significant this visit is.

86
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:29,683
Tulakham has developed significantly
in the past few years.

87
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:33,019
If we can get funding from the city
to invest here,

88
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,299
it should develop this city faster.

89
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:36,950
But that's just a front.

90
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,330
The real appointment
will be at the golf course.

91
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,817
<i>Which area do you want to invest in first?</i>

92
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:52,379
<i>We are most interested in food and tourism,</i>

93
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,650
<i>which are the highlights of this city.
Thank you very much.</i>

94
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,850
<i>Let me take a picture.</i>

95
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,583
<i>- This camera.
- This camera too.</i>

96
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:04,450
Kom, investigate Chairman Lee.

97
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:06,250
Yes, sir.

98
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,998
We're surely going to win this time.

99
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:28,836
Hey, we got a job now.

100
00:12:28,836 --> 00:12:30,828
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

101
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:50,719
Wow, flawless accuracy.

102
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,850
The skills of someone very familiar
with the field.

103
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,050
You're exaggerating.

104
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:59,770
But now everyone's focused on Chairman Lee,

105
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,717
<i>who will invest in the food
and travel category.</i>

106
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,617
I have a good advisor.

107
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:11,266
Thank you.

108
00:13:19,862 --> 00:13:21,517
Changing the signal to the golf cart.

109
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,750
Hey.

110
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,950
It's too late. Hey, go, go, pack up.

111
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:42,483
Hey, take my bag too.

112
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:43,683
I can't even take my bag.

113
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,150
What the hell am I doing here?

114
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,583
We've already signed the contract.

115
00:14:02,928 --> 00:14:07,017
<i>It seems like some people
are trying to hinder me.</i>

116
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:09,840
If you don't clear up these things,

117
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,783
it might make our work more difficult.

118
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,050
Since my father passed away,
I've been caring for this city.

119
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,608
There's nothing to be afraid of.

120
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:22,150
Since your father passed away,
I have not been to the city before.

121
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,648
At that time, the New Tulakham project
was just starting.

122
00:14:27,217 --> 00:14:31,250
Now, New Tulakham is ready to grow.

123
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,183
In this shocking case,

124
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:41,050
the defendant committed
the audacious and cruel act

125
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,550
of deceiving the victim
and raping her on a cruise ship,

126
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:48,917
and murdering a 14-year-old girl,

127
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,083
including concealing the body
by throwing her into the sea.

128
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:56,783
In the name of the law and justice
of Tulakham city,

129
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,117
because the defendant committed a cruel act,

130
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:08,550
the court imposes the highest sentence,
the death penalty.

131
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,417
Your honor!

132
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:19,417
Please reduce my son's sentence.
It was his first crime.

133
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:21,650
He's not that kind of person.

134
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,517
Please help my son, your honor.

135
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:26,148
Be quiet, man.

136
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:29,312
This is the first death sentence in Tulakham.

137
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:31,083
Do you want to say something?

138
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,084
This is a shocking case.

139
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:37,125
It's not just in Tulakham,
but it's the whole country.

140
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,683
You've decided to use the maximum penalty.

141
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:41,283
How difficult was the decision?

142
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,183
It was the hardest decision ever.

143
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:48,725
As you know,

144
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:53,750
Our city has never had an incident
that required such severe punishment.

145
00:15:55,017 --> 00:15:57,550
But I want the people to feel comfortable

146
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,117
that I will do everything
for the Tulakham people.

147
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:06,278
Are you afraid that your image will look cruel?

148
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:07,283
No.

149
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:12,983
Justice must come first. Excuse me.

150
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,950
- Madam, Can I have an interview?
- Madam, Can I ask more?

151
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,583
Hello.

152
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:21,917
Do you have time to talk
to the mayor of Tulakham?

153
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:25,383
I don't want to talk to a big shot.

154
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:29,519
Well, Chairman Lee was so welcoming.

155
00:16:30,543 --> 00:16:34,447
Didn't you watch the news?
He came to seek business opportunities.

156
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:36,017
They should welcome him.

157
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:39,417
He's going to invest money in your city.

158
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:44,687
Aren't you surprised?
Normally, he does real estate.

159
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,383
Suddenly, he gave an interview, saying he
was seeking an opportunity in food and tourism.

160
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,017
Hey, if you have something to say, just say it.
No need to beat around the bush.

161
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:02,883
President Lee is definitely coming
to talk about New Tulakham.

162
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:10,317
You've invested a lot.
Are you going to let others take it?

163
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:17,517
The only person who can decide
on New Tulakham is the judge.

164
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,520
If she wants you to benefit from this project,

165
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:26,824
she must have told you herself.

166
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:53,083
Where are your subordinates?

167
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:56,517
Is there no one protecting the mayor now?

168
00:17:57,711 --> 00:17:59,483
Here's the mayor's office.

169
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,050
Welcome to Tulakham's people. Go on.

170
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,250
Seems like the mayor is about to be abandoned.

171
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:18,850
I feel like Mr. Olarn is not
Judge Chalinee's favorite anymore.

172
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,209
<i>We've already signed the contract.</i>

173
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:36,729
<i>It seems like some people
are trying to hinder me.</i>

174
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:38,969
<i>If you don't clear up these things,</i>

175
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:41,017
<i>It might make our work more difficult.</i>

176
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:46,217
<i>Since my father passed away,
I've been caring for this city.</i>

177
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:48,170
<i>There's nothing to be afraid of.</i>

178
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,747
<i>Since your father passed away,
I've never been to this city before.</i>

179
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:55,395
<i>At that time, the New Tulakham project
was just starting.</i>

180
00:18:56,035 --> 00:19:00,003
<i>Now, New Tulakham is ready to grow.</i>

181
00:19:03,445 --> 00:19:04,783
Hey,

182
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:09,350
if you think this can destroy
the relationship between me and Judge Chalinee,

183
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,450
then keep dreaming.

184
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:17,850
But I think you remember this guy well.

185
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,209
I heard he's been involved
with Kamnan Chot for a long time.

186
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:24,683
He also knows the New Tulakham project well.

187
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:28,650
I don't see any problem with that.

188
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,583
The New Tulakham project is huge.

189
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:33,550
Everyone wants to be a part of its success.

190
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,717
It depends on the people here
and this city's people

191
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,998
whether they will let him do it.

192
00:19:38,998 --> 00:19:41,550
Okay, just to deliver the news.

193
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:46,017
If you think it's normal,
then that's up to you.

194
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:48,412
But I think that

195
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,817
it's related to your policies
when you were campaigning.

196
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,290
So I just brought you some news.

197
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,683
Oh, what exactly is Olarn planning to do?

198
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:11,493
He'll throw a big event at the shrine.
But not inviting us.

199
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:14,717
Not inviting us is not so bad.

200
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,017
But not inviting the judge

201
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,350
is clearly disrespectful.

202
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:27,217
Attorney Charoen,

203
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,450
I have someone I'd like to introduce to you.

204
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,083
You're welcome.

205
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,583
You can tell me when you want me to meet them.

206
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:48,250
Please feel free.

207
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:57,683
No need. Keep on eating.

208
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:06,483
Is there anything I should know
about her lately?

209
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:09,245
No.

210
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,017
What is she doing?

211
00:21:14,217 --> 00:21:18,569
Oh, I mean, we should share her burden.

212
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,983
Aeri, don't be distant from her.

213
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:25,047
Yes.

214
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:38,317
If it didn't have anything to do
with my daughter, I wouldn't have come here.

215
00:21:39,094 --> 00:21:40,617
You really love your daughter, huh?

216
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,917
That's what I like about you.
You have some goodness.

217
00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:56,383
Do you know that Judge Chalinee

218
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,883
handed over the New Tulakham project
to Chairman Lee?

219
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:02,983
He will benefit greatly from this project.

220
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:06,140
He is doing on tourism and food?

221
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,099
It is a front to deceive others
to trust completely.

222
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,783
How did you know about this?

223
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:20,183
Lawyer Win gave me the wiretapped audio clip.

224
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:24,883
They already signed a contract.

225
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:29,850
You know I invested almost
all my money in New Tulakham.

226
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,750
I must have the right
to collect the stall rent.

227
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,175
This is so bad, a real mess.

228
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:35,217
You see?

229
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,917
That's what you need to help me.

230
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:42,983
Never let the New Tulakham project
fall into someone else's hands.

231
00:22:45,217 --> 00:22:47,617
We don't know about this.

232
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:55,550
Because we are definitely going to be ditched.

233
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,950
You gave these photos to the reporters.

234
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:37,683
I will deal with Olarn.

235
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:08,450
How did you get it?

236
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:12,921
I can't share my source.

237
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,883
How can you be sure that I'll be up for it?

238
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:22,017
I'm confident in your journalistic ethics.

239
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:26,117
You will do a great job like before.

240
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:43,235
<i>[Jaibun Than Khun Phaendin Foundation]</i>

241
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:28,150
Hello, everyone.

242
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:37,783
Since I became the mayor of this city,

243
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:43,283
my intention has been to resume
the New Tulakham project until it is completed.

244
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:54,317
Everything is about to begin,
and we want a transparent contract.

245
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:58,983
<i>This merit-making</i>

246
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,217
<i>is to ask the gods to help eliminate the evil</i>

247
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:06,850
<i>that will destroy us,</i>

248
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:11,083
including those not from Tulakham

249
00:26:12,123 --> 00:26:15,017
who want to exploit this city

250
00:26:15,017 --> 00:26:17,683
and take advantage of our planned projects.

251
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:25,650
I hope everyone will help me
to complete this job successfully.

252
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:27,283
Thank you.

253
00:26:38,283 --> 00:26:40,150
Olarn is now fighting with full force.

254
00:26:53,887 --> 00:26:56,417
The judge didn't attend the event.

255
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,317
What does that mean?

256
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,383
Our group's situation has changed now.

257
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,250
We can't just sit around and do nothing.

258
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,017
Do you think which side we should be on?

259
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:18,717
The winning side.

260
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:27,317
Madam.

261
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,450
That businessman, Chairman Lee.

262
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:35,156
Does he want a seafood or tourism business?

263
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:38,783
Let me guess.

264
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:42,117
He definitely wants a seafood business,
right, Madam?

265
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:50,183
And today, at today's event,

266
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:51,383
if you weren't busy,

267
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:56,850
you would give an interview making Olarn
look even more superb, Madam.

268
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:01,083
Get out of my face.

269
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,625
Yes.

270
00:28:23,956 --> 00:28:27,717
<i>Hello, Our news team has now obtained</i>

271
00:28:27,717 --> 00:28:31,300
<i>secret evidence of a murder case
from 18 years ago,</i>

272
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,983
<i>which is related to Mr. C,
a high-ranking executive</i>

273
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:40,683
<i>who at that time held the position
of our prosecutor for Tulakham City.</i>

274
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:42,732
<i>If you look closely at this picture,</i>

275
00:28:42,732 --> 00:28:46,150
<i>it should be related to
the death of Kamnan "C",</i>

276
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,450
<i>the famous former village chief
of Tulakham City.</i>

277
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,417
<i>And if you look even closer,</i>

278
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:55,650
<i>you will see that another person in the picture looks familiar,
which we should all know well.</i>

279
00:29:05,616 --> 00:29:08,850
Is this like killing two birds with one stone?

280
00:29:31,826 --> 00:29:32,750
Is it true?

281
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,383
- Please answer.
- Please answer the question.

282
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:37,604
- So what's the deal?
- I'm not ready to give an interview about this yet.

283
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:42,980
As for the picture, I haven't investigated
where it came from. Excuse me.

284
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
- Madam, can I have an interview?
- Can I have an interview?

285
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,417
- Madam.
- Please answer my question.

286
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:53,517
- Madam, Madam.
- Madam, I need an answer.

287
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:02,975
What?

288
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,950
Is the TV clear, Mr. Mayor?

289
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:09,683
You called just for that, Mr. Lawyer?

290
00:30:11,634 --> 00:30:15,717
The picture you gave me doesn't clarify
who else is in the picture.

291
00:30:17,842 --> 00:30:19,317
In case you can't remember.

292
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:23,980
I suggest you find a partner to help you think.

293
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,617
For example, Prangthip.

294
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:30,117
Because I see that
she's about to be ditched, too.

295
00:30:50,383 --> 00:30:51,383
Why did you call?

296
00:30:52,448 --> 00:30:54,317
Gosh! Please talk to me nicely.

297
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,850
Because we'll be kicked out anyway.

298
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,550
Don't talk nonsense.
If you have something to say, just say it.

299
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,050
You have to cooperate with me.

300
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,728
Otherwise, you won't get anything
from New Tulakham.

301
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,445
Plus, your daughter's future will be ruined.

302
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:10,750
Aeri has nothing to do with it.

303
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,250
Hello.

304
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,717
Hello, hello.

305
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:40,346
To our boss, who released the news
and caused chaos for them.

306
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:44,974
Hey, but I think the brave is her.

307
00:31:44,974 --> 00:31:47,083
It's Lawyer Prao, bro.

308
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:51,525
I think your plan is really amazing.

309
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:52,783
I didn't even catch up.

310
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,868
Oh, but I didn't expect that
the legal profession

311
00:31:57,868 --> 00:32:00,180
would have some kind of complicated plan
or something like that.

312
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,332
Oh, that's for sure.

313
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:07,650
May they be defeated.

314
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:11,789
- Defeated, defeated.
- Defeated.

315
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:25,283
I want to know how those two are doing, though.

316
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,917
<i>Regarding the case in which the malefactor…</i>

317
00:32:34,183 --> 00:32:38,183
<i>sent a picture to a TV station to broadcast,</i>

318
00:32:38,883 --> 00:32:40,950
claiming that my picture was in it.

319
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:44,250
There is no truth at all.

320
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:49,083
Moreover, it is a photoshopped picture
to destroy my reputation.

321
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:54,250
<i>Actually, I've been getting pictures
like this all the time.</i>

322
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:57,017
<i>But I've never told anyone.</i>

323
00:32:58,217 --> 00:33:02,017
So, will this have any impact on your work?

324
00:33:02,954 --> 00:33:04,050
No.

325
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:08,717
I'll continue working here.
For Tulakham's people.

326
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,175
So, there is no impact at all?

327
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:13,250
No.

328
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:37,265
Hello.

329
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:20,050
You've asked me to come out alone,
so you must have something important, right?

330
00:34:21,258 --> 00:34:22,258
Yes.

331
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,764
What do you owe my uncle?

332
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:28,812
Why didn't you come to me
if you want to repay me?

333
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,085
Why did you go to see Prao?

334
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:35,617
I don't want you to see Prao again.

335
00:34:37,557 --> 00:34:39,517
I can't do what you ask.

336
00:34:43,117 --> 00:34:45,417
Why? I don't understand.

337
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:50,650
Because I have to protect my daughter.

338
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:01,689
- Let go of me.
- Let him go.

339
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:02,713
<i>Let him go.</i>

340
00:35:02,713 --> 00:35:04,317
<i>Let him go, I said let him go.</i>

341
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:06,417
<i>I said let him go.</i>

342
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,417
<i>Hey! Where are you going?</i>

343
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,972
<i>Go!</i>

344
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:25,050
<i>Run away!</i>

345
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,250
<i>Go, hurry up!</i>

346
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,417
<i>Go, kiddo! Go!</i>

347
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,050
<i>Go!</i>

348
00:35:34,743 --> 00:35:36,442
<i>Please don't hurt me. My kid is still young.</i>

349
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:39,750
<i>Let me go, please. I beg you.</i>

350
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:42,883
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

351
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,823
<i>Remember, you're dead.</i>

352
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:52,787
<i>You have to get out of here.</i>

353
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:55,539
<i>Get away from here. And don't come back.</i>

354
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:01,050
I had to get plastic surgery
so people wouldn't recognize me.

355
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:13,317
<i>I don't want to run away anymore.</i>

356
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:26,817
I'm worried about Prao.

357
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,350
I beg you.

358
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,850
Please don't let Prao get involved
in this anymore.

359
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,583
As for Chalinee, I'll help you.

360
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:42,783
I know how cruel she is.

361
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:45,883
Please don't let Prao
get involved in this again.

362
00:36:46,517 --> 00:36:48,850
Please, please, I beg you.

363
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,350
<i>There is no truth at all.</i>

364
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:24,417
<i>Moreover, it is a photoshopped picture
to destroy my reputation.</i>

365
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:29,217
<i>Actually, I've been getting pictures
like this all the time.</i>

366
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:33,050
<i>But I've never told anyone.</i>

367
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:37,935
<i>So, will this have any impact on your work?</i>

368
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:39,283
- Hello, Prao.
- Hello, Prao.

369
00:37:39,283 --> 00:37:39,850
No.

370
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:40,583
Let's go, Tan.

371
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:45,083
<i>I will continue to work here.
For the Tulakham's people.</i>

372
00:37:46,928 --> 00:37:48,183
Where are you going?

373
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,183
- Do you know?
- Where are you going?

374
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:52,150
Where they're going?

375
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,617
I don't know. I just asked.

376
00:37:53,617 --> 00:37:54,617
- Get out of the way.
- You…

377
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,820
Did I miss something?

378
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:09,417
Gentlemen,

379
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,183
this is Chairman Lee.

380
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,917
Chairman of Industry who is interested
in investing in our Tulakham.

381
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:23,257
This is Attorney Charoen Sitthikarn,
the Attorney General of Tulakham.

382
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:29,450
This is Lawyer Koson Saisin.
He's a lawyer in our city's law office.

383
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:34,265
Chairman Lee, nice to meet you.

384
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:41,750
No wonder Tulakham is called
the city of law and justice.

385
00:38:42,324 --> 00:38:46,780
In fact, justice is the judge.

386
00:38:49,267 --> 00:38:52,283
I feel like you've surpassed
Kamnan Chot quite a bit.

387
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:55,219
The law your father is trying to avoid.

388
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:58,675
You can hold it all in your hand.
It's Interesting.

389
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:03,717
Don't ruin the mood by talking
about the old days.

390
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:11,617
Chairman Lee, Maybe you owe me some debts.

391
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:18,083
Whether it's old or new debts,
it can all be paid off with money, right?

392
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,283
It's like she intentionally didn't let me
join the meeting.

393
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:36,807
Why did Chairman Lee come to see the judge?

394
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:40,135
How many times has he come?
Why don't you know anything?

395
00:39:40,673 --> 00:39:43,297
Oh, how would I know?

396
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,473
She doesn't need to tell me everything.

397
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:50,750
I want you to investigate Chairman Lee
and the judge.

398
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,150
Hey!

399
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,817
Am I interrupting you?

400
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:12,450
I just happened to hear the judge's statement.

401
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,650
I really feel worried for you.

402
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,417
Oh, did the judge know?

403
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:22,017
The two of you are in a confiding mood.

404
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,550
What do you want?

405
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:30,283
I just want to give encouragement to the mayor.

406
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:34,150
I'm terrified.

407
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:39,583
I'm scared you'll drop
before you can accomplish the policy.

408
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,250
Come on, go ahead.

409
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:10,047
Shoot me.

410
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:24,183
Save the best for last.

411
00:41:29,035 --> 00:41:31,283
You better protect the people around you.

412
00:41:54,748 --> 00:41:56,796
<i>Start by spreading your legs to fit your body.</i>

413
00:41:56,796 --> 00:41:58,652
<i>Now, keep your guard up.</i>

414
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:03,483
<i>Now, A jab punch is like this.</i>

415
00:42:04,557 --> 00:42:06,669
<i>A straight punch,
go all the way with your arms.</i>

416
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:07,757
<i>A straight punch, bang.</i>

417
00:42:09,584 --> 00:42:10,650
<i>Look at me.</i>

418
00:42:11,184 --> 00:42:12,184
<i>One, two.</i>

419
00:42:12,705 --> 00:42:13,705
<i>One, two.</i>

420
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:15,561
<i>Go.</i>

421
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,250
<i>Thank you.</i>

422
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:33,017
<i>Then… why did you suddenly
teach me how to box?</i>

423
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:43,317
<i>I'm worried. At least you can use it
to protect yourself.</i>

424
00:43:12,698 --> 00:43:14,144
What's wrong with you lately?

425
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,417
I want you to learn how to use a gun.

426
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:22,337
Don't put your finger on the trigger.
Keep it like this.

427
00:43:23,126 --> 00:43:26,217
Look, pull, and release.

428
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,943
You can see there are three points here.

429
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,817
You make them parallel.

430
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,980
Then you look at the center point.

431
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:51,117
If you're ready, shoot.

432
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:53,223
Surprised?

433
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:58,815
Oh, or maybe you don't offer legal advice here?

434
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:06,750
Just wondering…

435
00:45:08,283 --> 00:45:10,317
A princess prosecutor like you,

436
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,450
can walk down the street like others?

437
00:45:16,028 --> 00:45:17,617
Well, Lawyer Win is here.

438
00:45:21,383 --> 00:45:25,017
I have an appointment with him
to consult about the law.

439
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,150
I think we should talk outside.

440
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:46,183
Oops, I'm not making anyone
uncomfortable, am I?

441
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,455
Please.

442
00:46:11,513 --> 00:46:14,350
I know you can't avoid Chalinee's orders.

443
00:46:15,383 --> 00:46:16,650
But if it's about Olarn,

444
00:46:18,517 --> 00:46:19,717
I'll just go along with it.

445
00:46:20,843 --> 00:46:24,283
No matter what,
I will pull off everyone's masks.

446
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:28,917
<i>Just answer me now.</i>

447
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:34,283
<i>Are you ready to help me make Tulakham better?</i>

448
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:39,350
<i>Yes, I have been waiting
to be by your side for so long.</i>

449
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:42,372
<i>I am ready to give you my whole life.</i>

450
00:46:46,408 --> 00:46:48,917
I don't know. What's the whole story?

451
00:46:50,463 --> 00:46:51,683
As a prosecutor,

452
00:46:53,717 --> 00:46:55,150
I'm happy to cooperate with you.

453
00:46:57,539 --> 00:46:58,539
Thank you.

454
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:06,850
But I think you should step back from this.

455
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:13,568
Are you worried about me?

456
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,450
You're Prao's friend.

457
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:55,983
I'll tell Tan to drive you home.

458
00:47:57,113 --> 00:47:58,517
Is there anything I should know?

459
00:48:37,683 --> 00:48:38,817
Be patient, dear.

460
00:48:45,606 --> 00:48:46,617
Shin.

461
00:48:48,617 --> 00:48:50,383
Why are you still here?

462
00:48:50,984 --> 00:48:53,150
Because I believe in your dream.

463
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:57,883
I know you're lying.

464
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:01,117
Anyway, you're still on my side.

465
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:15,983
Do you know why people
want to change themselves?

466
00:49:22,255 --> 00:49:25,317
When we want to protect someone.

467
00:49:38,012 --> 00:49:40,217
My New Tulakham project…

468
00:49:41,317 --> 00:49:44,317
means to protect someone.

469
00:49:59,322 --> 00:50:03,617
Do you know how lucky you are working for her?

470
00:50:07,282 --> 00:50:10,850
If you have nothing to do, then go home.

471
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:15,550
If not, be quiet.

472
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,917
I don't want to hear anyone's voice.

473
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,183
<i>This collaboration</i>

474
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:30,817
<i>will improve the quality of life
of Tulakham's people.</i>

475
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,920
<i>We will start with the education system.</i>

476
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,783
<i>Will this affect Mayor Olarn's
various projects he previously announced?</i>

477
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:39,850
<i>No.</i>

478
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,650
<i>It would be even better
if there was another group of investors…</i>

479
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:46,083
<i>reaching in to help with development.</i>

480
00:50:47,317 --> 00:50:50,450
We need to be open to all support.

481
00:50:51,983 --> 00:50:53,750
- Hey.
- Madam, Madam.

482
00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:55,901
Catch him.

483
00:51:22,414 --> 00:51:25,578
Right now our beloved judge…
<i>[Next Episode]</i>

484
00:51:25,578 --> 00:51:28,742
is in a coma.

485
00:51:28,742 --> 00:51:32,219
I feel uncomfortable about
my daughter working here.

486
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:34,094
Dad, but my work…

487
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:37,550
It's fine. All debts are over.

488
00:51:39,074 --> 00:51:41,535
I had two best friends.

489
00:51:41,535 --> 00:51:44,257
One is a lawyer.

490
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:47,095
Another one wants to be a reporter.
