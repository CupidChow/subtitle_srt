<i>[Previous Episode]</i>

5
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:11,239
You're protecting the wrong person.

6
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:13,442
Olarn!

7
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:15,286
Do you think you can protect anyone?

8
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:31,937
Are you from Korea?

9
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:35,390
Expertise in a Korean spa,

10
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:38,468
massage, and make a tea.

11
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:41,203
You got the job.

12
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,578
Yes, thank you.

13
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:44,742
Can you really do it?

14
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,625
You knew that…

15
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,749
He raised me since I was a kid.
I'll never hurt him.

16
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,289
But now you're in jail.

17
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,414
How could I believe you?

18
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:57,734
If you can't prove it,

19
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,250
I'll kill you with my own hands.

20
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:09,183
Prao.

21
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:16,950
You look depressed.

22
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:19,183
What's wrong?

23
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:20,317
Let's sit down and talk.

24
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:22,883
Come on.

25
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,150
Is there something wrong?

26
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:31,603
I mean…

27
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,350
I would like to ask you
to release Lawyer Boripat temporarily.

28
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:39,417
So that he can go to his
uncle's funeral for the last time.

29
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:47,583
If you would like me to do something in return,
that's fine too.

30
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:58,625
Then you have to make Lawyer Boripat
win this case

31
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,383
and get him out of prison.

32
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:22,317
Attorney Charoen,

33
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:25,950
I need you a favor.

34
00:04:33,892 --> 00:04:34,892
How are you?

35
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
How are you?

36
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,450
Is there any problem at the office?

37
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:44,983
We're getting a lot of media flak right now.

38
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:47,917
But no one's give up.

39
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:50,583
Thank you for being strong.

40
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:56,583
What about the others? Are they OK?
How about Tan?

41
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:00,417
Everyone is OK. Don't worry.

42
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:10,117
I went to see Chalinee and asked her
to release you temporarily.

43
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,850
So that you can go to Uncle Prem's funeral.

44
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:19,127
But…

45
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:25,483
But I have to make you win this case
as compensation.

46
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:30,983
That's what the judge wants.

47
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:47,617
You didn't show up when I called.

48
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,083
Don't you follow my orders anymore?

49
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:55,550
Being the mayor is busy.

50
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,050
I have a lot of work to do.

51
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,417
And I have to prepare for all the partners.

52
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:07,883
Next time, whatever you do,
you need to consult me ​​first.

53
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,183
I do everything for you, Little Miss.

54
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:19,371
Prangthip and I am the most loyal.

55
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:28,386
Yes, Olarn must be the most loyal.

56
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:39,717
Because Olarn is the dog that my family raised.

57
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,317
Come on, let's eat.

58
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:54,950
Come on.

59
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,114
Come on, come on, let's eat.

60
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:58,906
- Yeah.
- They look yummy.

61
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:00,186
You'll have energy.

62
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,817
Yes, the army marches on its stomach.

63
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:04,950
Yes.

64
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:17,150
Bro.

65
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,150
She doesn't eat at all.

66
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,083
Now what?

67
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,899
<i>[Court of Tulakham, 14 November B.E.2567]</i>

68
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,250

69
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:10,217
I appreciate your cooperation.

70
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:45,817
<i>Today.</i>

71
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,017
<i>The police have already ordered the closure</i>

72
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:51,000
<i>of the suspect's lawless law firm.</i>

73
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:11,883
<i>Prangthip and I are the most loyal.</i>

74
00:09:15,283 --> 00:09:16,283
<i>Yes.</i>

75
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:20,550
<i>Olarn must be the most loyal.</i>

76
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:31,783
<i>Because Olarn is the dog my family raised.</i>

77
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,417
Call Lawyer Koson.

78
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:46,057
Yes.

79
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:52,172
Hello, Lawyer Koson.

80
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,924
The mayor would like you to come and see him.

81
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:57,548
I'm busy right now. I'll call you back.

82
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,217
No matter how busy you are,

83
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:09,150
you must complete the construction contract.

84
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,475
I will sign tomorrow.

85
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,083
Gangsters are out of jail.

86
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,217
But the lawyer ended up in the prison.

87
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:53,917
Why uncle?

88
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,150
If you don't stop,

89
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:08,517
people around you

90
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,575
will disappear one by one.

91
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,643
If you don't want anyone to get in trouble,

92
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,050
stay here for a long time.

93
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,083
It's strange.

94
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:36,717
The judge

95
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:40,817
really wants me to win this case.

96
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:26,683
Hello.

97
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:27,550
Win!

98
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,950
Do you dare to come here?

99
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,350
- Hey.
- Calm down.

100
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,117
- Calm down.
- Calm down.

101
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:34,917
He'd never do that to your boss, man.

102
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:39,917
Take off the handcuffs.

103
00:14:47,664 --> 00:14:49,050
Thank you very much.

104
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,317
Yes.

105
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:54,245
Let me ask you something.

106
00:14:54,245 --> 00:14:56,183
If Lawyer Boripat is Prem's nephew,

107
00:14:57,253 --> 00:15:01,157
what's his relationship with
human rights lawyer Chawanan?

108
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,483
He's her son.

109
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:13,717
He's the son of a lawyer who died 18 years ago.

110
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:16,283
The same day my mom disappeared.

111
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,050
These two cases must be related.

112
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:35,250
We need to celebrate. Come on.

113
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:39,550
One, two, go.

114
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,783
Come on, one, two.

115
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,059
Prao.

116
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:03,650
Here you are. I copied it already.

117
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,083
- Oh my!
- Come all at once, oh!

118
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:19,950
<i>I will make everyone pay
for what they did to my boss.</i>

119
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:24,017
<i>Please take care of Tan.</i>

120
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,928
I think we need to report this
to the judge first.

121
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:40,279
I am doing this
as the mayor of Tulakham's mayor.

122
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,862
I'm doing it for the townspeople.

123
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,704
I don't need to wait for an order from someone.

124
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:49,200
Draft the construction contract

125
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,183
and prepare it for the contractor to sign.

126
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:15,307
Shin, lay low for a while.

127
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:19,083
How's the witness identifying
Lawyer Boripat? Is he OK?

128
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:21,650
<i>Don't worry, sir. Everything will be fine.</i>

129
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,483
Who let you come in here?

130
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:47,283
Mr. Mayor.

131
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:50,617
Everyone knows I'm your big supporter.

132
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:57,417
Why are you here?

133
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,283
I heard something from Vichuthep.

134
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:04,283
You speed up on the New Tulakham.

135
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,883
And for me…

136
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:07,750
I pushed you to this point.

137
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,450
You don't think I should get…

138
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,383
a little bit?

139
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:23,250
I made New Tulakham for Tulakham'speople.

140
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,683
Not for anyone to bargain the benefits.

141
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,750
Look, there are two of us here.

142
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:31,983
No need to act.

143
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:37,850
Let me be clear.

144
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:42,083
Three percent of this project.

145
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:43,850
If you're not OK with it,

146
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:49,550
you know how much insight I have about you.

147
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:56,583
If I reveal who hired…

148
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:58,517
the complainant,

149
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,183
what will the people…

150
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,383
of New Tulakham say?

151
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,783
Olarn is quite good.

152
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:17,083
He gets all the lawyers in jail.

153
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:20,183
The office is also closed.

154
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:22,150
Prao is also in trouble.

155
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,150
Hey!

156
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:27,250
Be gentle.

157
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,117
Don't make me report to your company.

158
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:35,971
Yes, I'm sorry.

159
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:55,383
That's a lot of evidence.

160
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:59,017
I hope you don't lose the case
like Sargent Itt's case.

161
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,550
In Sargent's case,

162
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,450
there is a lot of evidence, right?

163
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:08,217
Alright,

164
00:22:08,883 --> 00:22:10,317
I won't check anymore.

165
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:14,319
I hope you guys don't lose this case.

166
00:22:21,217 --> 00:22:25,317
Do you believe that
Lawyer Boripat really killed Mr. Prem?

167
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,985
If you want to be a prosecutor,

168
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,483
don't trust your feelings.

169
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:36,550
You have to trust the evidence.

170
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:44,727
<i>[Court of Tulakham]</i>

171
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,783
The prosecutor's evidence is very solid.

172
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:55,317
There's no way he will get off the hook.

173
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:01,883
I trust my feelings.

174
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,083
Once I believe, I will win.

175
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,017
I'm warning you as a friend.

176
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:17,450
If you can't hold it, back off.

177
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:37,784
<i>[Court of Tulakham]</i>

178
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,283
The prosecutor, please.

179
00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:46,650
I'm Prosecutor Erika Pongpinij.

180
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,440
I would like to file a lawsuit
against Mr. Boripat Preechachai

181
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,050
for the murder of Mr. Prem Preechachai,
who is his uncle.

182
00:24:12,723 --> 00:24:16,117
The accused used tranquilizers on the victim

183
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:17,883
and then committed the crime with a gun.

184
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:20,250
He then concealed the body

185
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,583
by dropping the crate on top of the deceased.

186
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:32,221
The prosecutor would like to submit
the evidence to the judge.

187
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:46,550
The accused's motive

188
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:51,450
was to receive benefits from
Mr. Prem's life insurance and inheritance,

189
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:55,150
which is over 100 million baht.

190
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:02,670
The court accepted the prosecutor's complaint.

191
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:06,317
The defense lawyer, please.

192
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:18,417
I'm Lawyer Praochanok Chayanit.

193
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,683
I would like to confirm that

194
00:25:19,683 --> 00:25:22,417
the defendant is the nephew of the deceased.
He'll solely receive the inheritance.

195
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:25,217
Therefore, he has no motive to do so.

196
00:25:25,217 --> 00:25:27,483
With unreliable evidence,

197
00:25:27,483 --> 00:25:29,495
it would be impossible to cause the incident.

198
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:32,680
Therefore, the entire incident was staged.

199
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,375
I may collect additional evidence
to counter the charges.

200
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,480
Please consider and reschedule the hearing.

201
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,317
The court suspends the trial

202
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,550
and will inform you again
of the date of the hearing.

203
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:20,565
Hello, madam.

204
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:23,750
You called me. Is everything all right?

205
00:26:24,854 --> 00:26:26,750
Prao, please sit down.

206
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,350
Yes.

207
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:38,050
How are you? Are you tired?

208
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:44,350
Is there anything else I can help you?

209
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,550
I can do better than last time.

210
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,517
You are fine.

211
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,883
Next time, send me a good one.

212
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:03,517
Otherwise,

213
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:05,783
when I get out

214
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,117
I'll seek revenge.

215
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:16,317
Oh, or…

216
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:19,683
You don't have a right-hand man
working for you.

217
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,050
Didn't you notice?

218
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:33,419
Why does the judge
call Lawyer Prao in so often?

219
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,450
<i>Where is Tan?</i>

220
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:21,925
<i>Oh yeah, where did Tan go?</i>

221
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:22,925
<i>I don't know.</i>

222
00:29:23,806 --> 00:29:25,598
<i>Everyone, please check on him.</i>

223
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:28,150
<i>Don't let Tan do anything by himself.</i>

224
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,583
I need to sign the contract tomorrow.
Otherwise, I'll take it seriously.

225
00:30:07,623 --> 00:30:09,683
How is it to be a defendant?

226
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:16,563
I'm a defendant with no guilt.

227
00:30:16,563 --> 00:30:20,017
The guilty person is still being the judge.

228
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:23,183
What do you think?

229
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,183
Your case is in the hands of
the most honest judge in Tulakham.

230
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,817
And if you're truly innocent,

231
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,617
you shouldn't be afraid of anything.

232
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:59,260
<i>[Sign, Tulakham's mayor]</i>

233
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,117
The case of Win will end today as well.

234
00:31:30,215 --> 00:31:30,950
<i>[Court of Tulakham]</i>

235
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,183
Please tell us what you saw that day.

236
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:38,583
Well…

237
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,383
I was scanning the building.

238
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:42,383
And then…

239
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:44,450
I heard a gunshot.

240
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,517
And I saw someone in the warehouse.

241
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:52,283
And the person you saw was this person?

242
00:31:58,859 --> 00:31:59,859
Yes, sir.

243
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:11,483
No more questions.

244
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:22,425
I will not let anyone
who is not a Tulakham person

245
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:25,075
exploit the Tulakham people at all.

246
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:28,783
I'm also a Tulakham people.

247
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,583
And I'm also your people.

248
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,050
I stand with you to protect Tulakham forever.

249
00:33:17,855 --> 00:33:19,817
Does the defense lawyer want to cross-examine?

250
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:22,717
Yes, your honor.

251
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,925
Are you certain what you said is true?

252
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:37,417
Because giving false information
is considered a violation of the law.

253
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:38,417
Objection.

254
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,717
The lawyer is threatening the witness.

255
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:44,117
I'm not.

256
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,850
Just providing additional information.

257
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:52,025
Sustained. I agree with the prosecutor.

258
00:33:52,617 --> 00:33:56,183
Be careful with your words. Please continue.

259
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,650
Do you remember this building?

260
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,870
Yes.

261
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:11,983
Let me ask you.

262
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:14,383
Where were you in the building?

263
00:34:18,017 --> 00:34:19,017
Right there.

264
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:21,517
This area?

265
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:24,006
Yes.

266
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:29,117
From where you were, what did you see?

267
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,083
Please think carefully.

268
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,050
Because your answer will affect the case

269
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,350
and will have a great impact
on a person's life.

270
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:58,717
From this spot, you probably couldn't see much.

271
00:34:58,717 --> 00:35:00,383
Because an object blocked your view.

272
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,017
Then how can you be sure it was the defendant?

273
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:12,283
On the day, officers arrived
at the scene quickly.

274
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,383
Did you call?

275
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:17,048
No.

276
00:35:18,736 --> 00:35:19,917
That's really strange.

277
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:23,117
The officers arrived at the scene quickly.

278
00:35:24,783 --> 00:35:26,117
It's like they were scheduled.

279
00:35:30,983 --> 00:35:32,450
From your position,

280
00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:35,583
how many forklifts did you see?

281
00:35:36,493 --> 00:35:38,070
Three forklifts.

282
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,286
Are you certain?

283
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,550
I'm certain.

284
00:36:04,517 --> 00:36:05,917
There was only one car.

285
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:11,583
If it was a human,
it would be hard to identify.

286
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:20,283
Let me ask the jury.

287
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,217
Can we trust the witness like this?

288
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:48,950
That was awesome.

289
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,583
Prao cornered that witness.

290
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,083
- Yes.
- Yeah.

291
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:56,517
He even said he saw everything clearly.

292
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:58,783
Oh my gosh. He was obviously hired.

293
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,183
Totally fake.

294
00:37:00,183 --> 00:37:01,617
- He was such a big braggart, bro.
- Yes.

295
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:05,050
We don't have enough evidence to win this case.

296
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:08,590
We'll have to keep fighting.

297
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:27,617
The reason why Win did this

298
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:30,463
is because he wanted the inheritance.

299
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:36,783
He knew that if something happened
to the boss, he'd inherit everything.

300
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:40,217
And there is a security guard
who testified in court.

301
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:41,417
He saw that he killed.

302
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,027
Gosh.

303
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:57,809
You did it for your own benefit,
didn't you, Win?

304
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,317
The case hasn't been decided yet.
Calm down, bro.

305
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,750
Come on, fight me.

306
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,050
If you don't, I'll surely kill you.

307
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:33,579
Fight, fight, fight me.

308
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:35,417
Hey, let's fight!

309
00:38:50,783 --> 00:38:52,117
For my uncle's gang,

310
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,850
I'll be who I was.

311
00:38:58,817 --> 00:38:59,817
Never change.

312
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:21,375
Go, go.

313
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:29,550
- Move, move.
- Get out, get out.

314
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:40,750
You look like the queen of this city.

315
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,150
You're so great and more powerful
than Kamnan Chot.

316
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,383
Your father is incomparable.

317
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,350
Aren't you afraid of being swallowed up
by my power?

318
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,117
I came here because I wanted this city too.

319
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,783
Let's see who can swallow first.

320
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:05,383
In my father's time, he might be afraid of
your financial power.

321
00:40:06,595 --> 00:40:09,883
But in my time, it wouldn't be like that.

322
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:06,664
You…

323
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:12,550
We met at the Sargent's funeral, right?

324
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:17,783
Is there something wrong?

325
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,283
Miss?

326
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,583
I work with Prem.

327
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:28,650
He left this for you.

328
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:34,050
I thought it might be important to you.

329
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,083
So I brought it to you.

330
00:41:50,517 --> 00:41:52,050
I want to tell you that

331
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:57,783
I am also fighting with Judge Chalinee.

332
00:42:46,717 --> 00:42:47,854
Prao.

333
00:42:47,854 --> 00:42:49,317
What's up, Tan?

334
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,183
Win was stabbed.

335
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:06,623
How is Win?

336
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,623
He's fine.

337
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:13,817
You can't get in. The patient is a prisoner.

338
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:16,383
But I'm his lawyer.

339
00:43:16,383 --> 00:43:17,383
You can't come in.

340
00:43:19,455 --> 00:43:20,455
Prao.

341
00:43:23,545 --> 00:43:25,650
She's the patient's lawyer. Let her go.

342
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:32,417
Only the lawyer.

343
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:35,117
Thank you.

344
00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:37,209
Yes.

345
00:44:39,073 --> 00:44:40,983
You've protected me many times.

346
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:45,583
From now on.

347
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:49,317
I'll protect you.

348
00:45:01,056 --> 00:45:02,183
You promised.

349
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:09,929
How are you?

350
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:12,817
Is it me who should be asking?

351
00:45:16,143 --> 00:45:17,317
Far from the heart.

352
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:21,883
Are you OK?

353
00:45:22,827 --> 00:45:24,260
Did someone bother you?

354
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:28,383
Don't worry about me.

355
00:45:29,317 --> 00:45:31,017
We're survivors.

356
00:45:33,283 --> 00:45:35,217
Tell me who hurt you.

357
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:41,550
He was tricked into hurting me.

358
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:45,317
If you want to press charges against him,

359
00:45:46,283 --> 00:45:47,817
I don't think it's helpful.

360
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:53,750
Then who used him?

361
00:45:55,517 --> 00:45:56,550
Is it Olarn?

362
00:45:57,709 --> 00:45:59,150
It's not him this time.

363
00:45:59,903 --> 00:46:01,183
Then who?

364
00:46:01,183 --> 00:46:02,617
It doesn't matter who it is.

365
00:46:04,883 --> 00:46:06,350
But I want you to know this.

366
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,783
You are now in danger, just like me.

367
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:15,983
Don't do anything too risky.

368
00:46:20,183 --> 00:46:22,717
If anything happens to you
because you're protecting me,

369
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,617
I'll never forgive myself.

370
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,050
Oh, that's great.

371
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:04,125
Why did you decide to let the warden

372
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,883
bring out the prisoners to help out today?

373
00:47:06,759 --> 00:47:08,550
Because I know everyone needs a chance,

374
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:13,417
especially a chance to make them feel valuable.

375
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:15,579
See? That's it.

376
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:18,517
Take a break if you're tired. Take a break, OK?

377
00:47:18,517 --> 00:47:20,017
Congrats! You can get a fresh air.

378
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:24,817
I really have to say that turning prisoners
into good people

379
00:47:24,817 --> 00:47:26,817
is not just about severe punishment

380
00:47:26,817 --> 00:47:31,283
but rather making them feel useful to society.

381
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:34,783
It's about cleansing the city and their mind.
Make them a good person.

382
00:47:34,783 --> 00:47:38,483
That's what I intend. It's my true intention.

383
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:51,817
Awesome! The extraordinary vision…

384
00:47:51,817 --> 00:47:54,963
of our great mayor of Tulakham.

385
00:47:54,963 --> 00:47:55,963
Do you like to spit?

386
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,907
Spit again.

387
00:47:57,907 --> 00:48:03,004
Do you like to spit? Spit…Spit.

388
00:48:06,273 --> 00:48:07,883
Seeing you as a mad dog like this,

389
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:09,950
I'm even more confident.

390
00:48:11,883 --> 00:48:13,717
What the hell are you so confident about?

391
00:48:14,483 --> 00:48:15,483
I'm confident

392
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,376
that you're the one behind my boss's death.

393
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:26,717
I'm a Mangpong, a subordinate of Prem
whom you ordered to kill.

394
00:48:31,939 --> 00:48:34,483
Ordered to kill, right? Ordered to kill?

395
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,583
Here's for you, here…

396
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,250
What's up?

397
00:48:52,835 --> 00:48:53,850
Shin.

398
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:54,850
Yes, sir.

399
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:58,275
Why did you do this to me?

400
00:48:58,275 --> 00:49:00,750
Who ordered you to send someone
to stab Lawyer Win in prison?

401
00:49:02,483 --> 00:49:03,483
I know nothing about it.

402
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,108
You don't know? Then who knows?

403
00:49:08,108 --> 00:49:09,108
You don't know?

404
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:12,483
I didn't do it.

405
00:49:14,983 --> 00:49:16,883
Then you find out who stabbed him.

406
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:18,717
Find out who ordered it.

407
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:21,150
Go.

408
00:49:21,883 --> 00:49:22,883
I stabbed him.

409
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:32,950
You? Huh? Good.

410
00:49:33,735 --> 00:49:36,083
You? Who ordered you?

411
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:38,684
Who ordered you?

412
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:40,250
Who ordered you?

413
00:49:41,317 --> 00:49:42,450
Who ordered you?

414
00:49:44,975 --> 00:49:47,283
Sir, that's enough, sir. He'll die soon.

415
00:49:47,283 --> 00:49:48,550
It'll be a problem if he dies.

416
00:49:51,217 --> 00:49:52,217
Let me go.

417
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:55,850
Be careful. You'll be next.

418
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,750
You don't stop, huh?

419
00:49:59,283 --> 00:50:00,283
Don't do it, sir.

420
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:02,950
It'll be a problem.

421
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:03,950
Let's go.

422
00:50:35,984 --> 00:50:38,317
Who do you think ordered
to kill Lawyer Win in prison?

423
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,550
Apart from us,
I can't think of anyone who wants to kill him.

424
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,750
There are only two people.

425
00:50:48,883 --> 00:50:49,883
Me

426
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:52,717
and…

427
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,550
Chalinee.

428
00:51:21,562 --> 00:51:23,293
<i>[Next Episode]</i>
Hey! Don't!

429
00:51:24,383 --> 00:51:25,184
Why?

430
00:51:25,184 --> 00:51:26,550
I want to know who sent him.

431
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:42,175
The one who truly protects Tulakham
must not be a traitor.

432
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:45,168
Don't do anything behind my back.
