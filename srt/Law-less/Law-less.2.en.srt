Lawyer Prao got the highest score.
<i>[Previously on LAW-LESS]</i>

6
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,800
A lawyer who helps the mafia.

7
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,260
The mafia is a human.

8
00:02:15,746 --> 00:02:17,957
I've been running from the truth
of that city for a long time.

9
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:21,401
It's time to go back and sort everything out.

10
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:22,803
Why are you here?

11
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:26,905
I'm here to chase the moneylenders
out of this office.

12
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:30,703
We build this place for
your law firm, boss, okay?

13
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:31,969
Dad, what happened?

14
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:34,919
Those loan sharks took stuff for the debt.

15
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,855
Did you come all the way here to harass me?

16
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:39,960
Is being a mafia lawyer not enough
to live on? That's why you became a loan shark.

17
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,209
That's the past.

18
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:43,539
Tomorrow, this place will be a law firm.

19
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,054
Oh, then all of my dad's debt is over.

20
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:47,491
Hey, no way.

21
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:50,057
I just changed business. The debt remains.

22
00:02:50,057 --> 00:02:54,652
Being my assistant is the only way
to pay off your father's debt.

23
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:56,263
I want to handle your case.

24
00:02:56,263 --> 00:03:00,972
I have the best lawyer.
Why should I trust you two?

25
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,225
I don't want you to die in prison, Sargent.

26
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Hello.

27
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:28,080
I'm lawyer Boripat.

28
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,160
I just opened a law firm in this city.

29
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,520
I've heard a lot about Attorney Koson.

30
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,600
I want to introduce myself to you.

31
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:42,240
A young and energetic lawyer who wants to
initiate a work. I'm happy to support you.

32
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,683
Thank you very much.

33
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:44,800
If you don't mind,

34
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,280
can I buy the former mayor's murder case?

35
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,520
I'm happy to pay the full amount

36
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,200
to get this case in our hands.

37
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,617
Look, our law firm is setting up.

38
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,960
If we get this case, we'll be famous.

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,280
The young generation wants to
build a career by all means, huh?

40
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,280
Have some dignity, Mr. Lawyer.

41
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,717
Listen, If you want to settle in this city,

42
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:18,800
you better start from…

43
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,317
being an assistant in the law firm.

44
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:24,279
Are you thinking of eating a big fish?

45
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:27,250
Please consider it.

46
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,283
I'm happy to pay the full amount.

47
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:51,930
Hey, Itt.

48
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,083
Lawyer Koson is hastily arranging
evidence for you.

49
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,517
I'm also lobbying the prosecutor.

50
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:03,510
But these guys are so demanding.

51
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:06,417
I want to leave now.

52
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:07,850
Do whatever you need!

53
00:05:08,383 --> 00:05:09,850
Don't worry.

54
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,717
Everything will be fine.

55
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,560
How's my mom?

56
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,383
I sent someone to watch over her.

57
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,160
I'll send her whatever she needs.

58
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,750
I told her that you sent it.

59
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,320
And right now, you're busy

60
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,283
chasing the thief who killed the former mayor.

61
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,617
Your mom believes you.

62
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,400
Thanks a lot, man.

63
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,583
Yeah.

64
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:34,783
The new lawyer came from nowhere and told me

65
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,883
to choose him as my new lawyer.

66
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:41,850
He said that
you guys would let me die in prison.

67
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,250
Just a new guy who wants fame.

68
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,917
New-graduated lawyers have no dignity.

69
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,850
They want to do big cases
so they can be famous.

70
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,320
They also came to ask me for a job.

71
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,450
Hey, we've helped each other many times.

72
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,717
You have to be as confident as I am.

73
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:12,850
Everything will be fine.

74
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:37,880
I didn't expect you to order durian from me.

75
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,280
Durian from my farm
is not as beautiful as others.

76
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,640
But I guarantee you it's sweet in every seed.

77
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,050
You did it all by myself.

78
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:50,281
You must be exhausted, auntie.

79
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:52,383
I have to do it anyway.

80
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:53,917
My son is busy.

81
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,117
He is a policeman.

82
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:57,528
He barely comes home.

83
00:06:57,528 --> 00:06:59,576
He's chasing thieves.

84
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,889
You're so proud of him, huh?

85
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:07,400
Not exactly. He hasn't come home…

86
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,280
for a long time. Just sending stuff.

87
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:23,083
<i>I miss you, Mom.</i>

88
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,117
<i>I'm waiting for your
birthday present this year.</i>

89
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,150
<i>No matter where you are,</i>

90
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:33,850
<i>or how long I have to wait for you.</i>

91
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,617
I assign the case of the former mayor to you.

92
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:02,483
I'm glad to see you grow up as I expected.

93
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,550
You gave me opportunities.

94
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,550
No, it's because you're capable.

95
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,317
Our city's justice

96
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:14,850
lies in a new generation like you.

97
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,750
Thank you to her, Aeri.

98
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:19,817
I apologize, ma'am.

99
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:22,483
The young generation
does not really pay respect.

100
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:27,583
No need, no.

101
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,650
I raised her from the beginning.
Don't be fussy.

102
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:39,083
Sorry.

103
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,120
Come on, Prao.

104
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,883
Oh my gosh.

105
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,650
Is this my scholar reunion party?

106
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,650
Have a seat.

107
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,717
I'm glad to give you both the law scholarship.

108
00:09:57,772 --> 00:10:01,560
As a fund secretary,
I can't help but feel sorry.

109
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,383
The scholarship student's license was revoked.

110
00:10:04,383 --> 00:10:06,950
And she hasn't won a single case.

111
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,600
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,250
How's it going, Prao?

113
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,983
The lawyer you work with.

114
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,917
I heard you had an issue with him.

115
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,440
So, a fellowship lawyer works with illegals?

116
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:29,317
Did you get a job already?

117
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,117
Well, I was just happy for nothing.

118
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:35,183
I thought you would help me out.

119
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,160
But if you want to work
with the city prosecutor's office,

120
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,083
you should have a clear record.

121
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,583
Also, you don't have a license.

122
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,183
You'll get a license soon.

123
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,217
You can work with me once you get it.

124
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:55,920
I want both of you to help me.

125
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,783
You can help Aeri at the office.

126
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,783
You two grew up together.

127
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:03,583
You are a prosecutor now.

128
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,817
You can teach her.

129
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:08,617
I mean…

130
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:13,017
I want to take the job that I promised
and finish it.

131
00:11:13,727 --> 00:11:16,083
I'll think of another later.

132
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,717
If you promised someone,

133
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:20,683
you have to do your best.

134
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,717
This is…

135
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:24,750
the first step of a law enforcement officer.

136
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,943
Oh, then…

137
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,350
I'll go home.

138
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:41,917
If you can't take it or are uncomfortable,

139
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:44,150
you can come back anytime.

140
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Yes, ma'am.

141
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,550
Thank you very much.

142
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Goodbye.

143
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:57,831
Bye.

144
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:02,250
Take care of yourself.

145
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,083
Right now.

146
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:22,250
Our law firm's employee position is fulfilled.

147
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,344
I want to announce the opening
of a law firm called…

148
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,320
Uh, what's a name do you think, boss?

149
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,983
A law firm full of lawless people.

150
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:33,950
Yes, sir.

151
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,017
A lawless law firm.

152
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,283
Someday, this town will be real.

153
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,800
Everyone,
from what I've investigated with Hook,

154
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,640
lawyer Koson and Olarn are very close.

155
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,883
And lawyer Koson
handled legal matters for the Olarn Group.

156
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,650
There are documents that the former mayor

157
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,350
suspended several important projects
of the Olarn Group,

158
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,280
especially the latest project
before he was killed.

159
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,650
And the New Tulakham project

160
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,040
has already been supported
by a banker, Mr. Vasu.

161
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,083
And this is…

162
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,450
Mr. Pradit,

163
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:51,817
the auditor.

164
00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:56,160
He's now in jail.

165
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,283
However,

166
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:03,250
all this news quickly disappeared
because of someone…

167
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,640
had manipulated this town.

168
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,317
That's this guy, Editor Harn.

169
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:19,367
<i>[Court of Tulakham]</i>

170
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,817
Hello, ma'am.

171
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,050
How's your new job?

172
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,400
Well… It's strange, but it's going smoothly.

173
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:38,181
That's good.

174
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:40,583
If you need my help, tell me.

175
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:44,343
I still owe your mother a lot.

176
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,464
But I don't give up on my mother.

177
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:52,800
Oh… ma'am.

178
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,283
We are suspicious in Olarn.

179
00:14:57,283 --> 00:15:00,083
But I'm not so sure.

180
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:07,850
If the evidence is unclear,
anything is possible.

181
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,150
But you look tired.

182
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,080
Let's go for a ride.

183
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:25,583
Don't kick it out of the field.

184
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,383
Dribble ball. Dribble ball.

185
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:31,283
Roll it here.

186
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,117
Don't kick it out of the field.

187
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:42,783
Be careful.

188
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
Be careful.

189
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,317
I used to study here.

190
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:55,517
Your mother must have studied here, too.

191
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:57,217
When I'm discouraged

192
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,120
or hesitating about what I'm doing.

193
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,083
When I see the kids, I can't give up.

194
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:19,200
I want them to grow up in a good environment
and no fear.

195
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,317
And for you,

196
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,717
I don't want you to be discouraged,

197
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:29,617
no matter what.

198
00:16:32,017 --> 00:16:33,017
Yes.

199
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,550
What's up, kids?

200
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,983
We believe that you're not the killer.

201
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,917
But we don't believe that your lawyer

202
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:15,017
will get you out of here.

203
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:22,650
You must not leave here,
and they will benefit.

204
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,817
Excuse me, can I talk to him alone?

205
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:55,983
If you mess with my mom,

206
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,483
I'll kill you!

207
00:17:58,483 --> 00:17:59,483
Remember!

208
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:04,325
You can't kill me.

209
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:14,883
You can't kill me 18 years ago, until now.

210
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:25,564
Let me go. Let me go.

211
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,119
Shut up!

212
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,800
You stay still!

213
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,400
Ouch!

214
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:46,584
Hey!

215
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,017
I will drag you out of here

216
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:57,550
for what you did 18 years ago by myself.

217
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,817
Guard! Come get me!

218
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:09,383
Guard, help me, come get me.

219
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,817
You can't use force in here.

220
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,583
Take me away, take me away.

221
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,583
Go.

222
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:26,234
What have you done?

223
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:29,017
Are you crazy?

224
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:39,650
I'm sorry.

225
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:29,383
Why is it so slow?

226
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,840
I'm going crazy in here.

227
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,017
You don't know what I've been through.

228
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,183
You better tell me.

229
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,056
Will you help me or let me rot in here?

230
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:43,850
Tell me clearly.

231
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,517
What the hell are you talking about?

232
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,750
Think of your mom.

233
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:56,983
Your mom is sick now.

234
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,950
I take good care of her.

235
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,568
Even if you leave now, what can you do?

236
00:21:22,752 --> 00:21:25,083
I'm now doing it for everyone,

237
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,783
for this city,

238
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:29,883
and for you.

239
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:38,325
You have no choice but to help me.

240
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,425
Whatever I say, you must do it.

241
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,283
Sir, Itt requested to change lawyer.

242
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:34,559
Contact Shin.

243
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Yes, sir.

244
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:47,725
Itt agree to change lawyer.

245
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,800
Call lawyer Prao, and let's meet at the court.

246
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,755
Now.

247
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:53,825
- Let's go!
- Yay!

248
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,279
We've been through a lot.

249
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,410
I have this day because of you.

250
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,560
Why did you believe
that powerless lawyer over me?

251
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,360
You don't understand what I'm doing.

252
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,640
My mother is old.

253
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,446
The more you care for your mother,
the more you have to listen to me.

254
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,117
Are you threatening me?

255
00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:33,525
I'm not.

256
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,848
But I'm doing it for this city.

257
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,450
No one can change me.

258
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,080
And the best way is…

259
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,520
I have to die in this prison.

260
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,800
Right!

261
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:06,696
Oh!

262
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:24,319
Assistant Prao has yet to arrive.

263
00:24:25,317 --> 00:24:26,383
That's really strange.

264
00:24:44,612 --> 00:24:45,400
Hello.

265
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,920
<i>Hello, Lawyer.</i>

266
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,283
Do you remember this client?

267
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,777
I'm busy, can't talk.

268
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:55,183
<i>Hey, wait.</i>

269
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:57,050
<i>Aren't you going to care, Win?</i>

270
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,517
That Lawyer Prao is here.

271
00:25:03,455 --> 00:25:04,817
Do whatever you want.

272
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,417
That woman is just a debtor.

273
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,817
Oh, Win.

274
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:12,550
Hello, Win.

275
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,543
Gosh!

276
00:25:15,543 --> 00:25:17,317
He doesn't care about me.

277
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:18,750
I'm just a debtor.

278
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,617
I hate him just as much as you do.

279
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:29,350
But since we're here, anyway.

280
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:32,104
Even though Win doesn't care about you,

281
00:25:32,104 --> 00:25:34,152
I do care.

282
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:39,783
Do you know that?

283
00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:45,750
Kidnapping and confinement is a crimes
under the Criminal Code, Section ADL123.

284
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,117
You'll get a big jail term.

285
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:50,683
Oh, that's scary.

286
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:52,683
I'm so scared.

287
00:25:59,152 --> 00:26:00,583
Lawyer Prao is with Shin.

288
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,617
We'll handle this ourselves. Don't worry, bro.

289
00:26:07,873 --> 00:26:11,683
They're playing with fire.

290
00:26:12,517 --> 00:26:15,717
So, what's the progress on
the New Tulakham project?

291
00:26:15,717 --> 00:26:16,683
It's all fine.

292
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:19,624
All the surrounding land belongs to you.

293
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:22,680
The project will go on soon.

294
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,440
It must be fun in the court today.

295
00:26:29,024 --> 00:26:32,850
Attorney Erika Phongpinij

296
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,150
filed a lawsuit against Police Sergeant,
Itt Kaew Udon.

297
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,783
The defendant was charged
with the murder of the Tulakham mayor.

298
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:43,517
The court has suspended the trial
for both parties

299
00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:46,320
to find more witnesses and evidence,

300
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,625
so that the court can conduct the trial fairly.

301
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,750
Where is Lawyer Boripat?

302
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:54,317
Why he's not here?

303
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,117
Relax.

304
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,550
My boss never makes mistakes.

305
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,050
Then who will be my lawyer?

306
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,083
The trial begins.

307
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,483
Prosecutor, please.

308
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:21,217
I am Prosecutor Erika Phongpinij.

309
00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:23,083
I want to inform you of the charges.

310
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:26,883
Police Sergeant Itt Kaew Udon is a defendant.

311
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:30,606
He committed the murder of the Tulakham mayor.

312
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,904
Please invite the defense lawyer
for cross-examination.

313
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,683
I'm Tankhun Sopharak, the defense lawyer,

314
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,850
May I conduct an investigation?

315
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:13,040
I dispute the prosecutor's accusation.

316
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,183
From examining the evidence,

317
00:28:15,183 --> 00:28:19,017
it was found that the traces of his walking,
which had a crippled leg,

318
00:28:19,017 --> 00:28:23,083
were different from the traces at the scene,
your honor.

319
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:47,150
Excuse me.

320
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:50,250
That's my subordinate and debtor.

321
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,852
If you want to do something,
You have to ask for my permission.

322
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,017
You owe me once again.

323
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,383
Aren't you rushing to the court?

324
00:29:23,983 --> 00:29:25,517
Untie me, come on.

325
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,417
The defendant is a police officer.

326
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:29,850
Why would he commit the crime

327
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,040
and leave evidence?

328
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,800
That's right.

329
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,250
The defendant is a police officer.

330
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,240
He should know the law.

331
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,352
Yeah. This is correct.

332
00:29:41,352 --> 00:29:42,483
It's just like my house.

333
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:45,610
I have a durian plantation,
but I don't plant durian.

334
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,799
I plant durian
but I don't plant Monthong durian

335
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,817
despite its fragrant, crispy,
and delicious taste.

336
00:29:52,383 --> 00:29:54,083
It's worldwide famous.

337
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,017
Objection, your honor.

338
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:57,617
Your honor,

339
00:29:57,617 --> 00:30:00,450
he talked about issues unrelated to the case.

340
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,917
But I still need to finish…

341
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,240
the durian topic.

342
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,583
I agree with the prosecutor.

343
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:10,283
Your point is not related to the case.

344
00:30:10,283 --> 00:30:12,350
I want the prosecutor

345
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,783
to question the defendant.

346
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,920
I'd like to submit additional evidence
to consider.

347
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,817
Objection!

348
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,878
I'd like to protest the submission of evidence.

349
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:26,550
Overruled.

350
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,850
I accept additional documents
to consider the case.

351
00:30:47,017 --> 00:30:49,483
Defense lawyer, please continue.

352
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:52,050
Do you have any additional issues?

353
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,720
If not…

354
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,181
Yes, ma'am.

355
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:00,320
Please.

356
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,617
Your honor,

357
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:03,483
you are the idol of justice.

358
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,583
You have judged the case,

359
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:08,917
and dealt with many influential in Tulakham.

360
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,383
Is it possible

361
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:12,180
there will be a wrong decision in the case?

362
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,117
Objection!

363
00:31:14,117 --> 00:31:16,017
It's not relevant to the case.

364
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:18,383
I request to examine the defense lawyer.

365
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:20,380
Please show your license.

366
00:31:21,328 --> 00:31:23,376
You can't do this.

367
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,350
Objection, your honor.

368
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,370
I request that the prosecutor be examined, too.

369
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,950
Yes, I protest.

370
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:33,750
Yes, I want to protest.

371
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,850
I'm Boripat Preechachai, the defense lawyer.

372
00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:03,829
Let's go, see you later.

373
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:13,680
<i>I create chaos in the court
by postponing the trial.</i>

374
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,550
<i>Then, we find more evidence in the prison.</i>

375
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:27,656
End of trial.

376
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:31,475
The court will set the date for the trial.

377
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,017
Wait!

378
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,717
What do I do now?

379
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:47,550
Remember,

380
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,083
you're a lawyer,

381
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,250
even though your license is suspended.

382
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,050
I have to be like this because I helped you.

383
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,643
You have to take responsibility.

384
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:16,593
Are you working at a law firm or a gangster?

385
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:32,217
He's alone, but you can't fight him.

386
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:34,483
What else can you do, Shin?

387
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,817
Sir, sir.

388
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,683
Don't give up on me, sir.

389
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:43,517
Get out.

390
00:33:44,117 --> 00:33:45,683
I don't want to see you.

391
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:03,404
There you go, sir.

392
00:34:11,787 --> 00:34:12,850
Hello.

393
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:16,040
I want to speak to the judge.

394
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,683
She's not available right now.

395
00:34:19,465 --> 00:34:20,817
Please make an appointment for me.

396
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:22,350
It's important.

397
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,417
Hello.

398
00:34:48,037 --> 00:34:49,850
I was born in Tulakham.

399
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:54,383
I know every corner of it.

400
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,728
I'm the only one who knows
how to make it better.

401
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,183
I haven't been to jail in years.

402
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,817
I feel like…

403
00:35:17,817 --> 00:35:20,983
coming to a memorable place.

404
00:35:22,017 --> 00:35:24,717
Bro, I can walk with my eyes closed.

405
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:49,200
Mr. Pradit, the auditor.

406
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:54,448
He's now in jail.

407
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,450
How are you? Mr. Pradit.

408
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:15,517
You!

409
00:36:16,683 --> 00:36:17,963
What the hell are you doing?

410
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,583
Will you put me in jail?

411
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,400
They're trying to stop me.

412
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,052
I'm going to change the lawyer.

413
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:29,650
I'm trying to help you.

414
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,150
What do you know about Olarn?

415
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,517
Do you know what he's thinking?

416
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:37,683
Obviously, he doesn't want you to get out.

417
00:36:38,717 --> 00:36:42,917
I'm the only one
who wants you to get out as soon as possible.

418
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,117
Don't forget.

419
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:52,183
I was born here.

420
00:36:52,183 --> 00:36:54,720
I grew up in this city's market.

421
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,417
I ate leftover food from a rice soup shop.

422
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,040
I slept in this shrine.

423
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,483
I built myself from sweat and countless scars.

424
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:07,783
I can call myself a son of Tulakham.

425
00:37:08,383 --> 00:37:12,480
Therefore, I have established
the Jaibun Than Khun Pandin Foundation

426
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,883
to protect our people of Tulakham.

427
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:18,895
I now announce that our foundation

428
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,250
aims to protect our Tulakham people

429
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,750
from all the influential people.

430
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:03,600
I set up a foundation to provide refuge
for the people.

431
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,517
I'm from this city.

432
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,450
Therefore, contributing to my hometown

433
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,720
is the best thing I can do.

434
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,217
Besides what you're doing now,

435
00:38:12,217 --> 00:38:13,650
is there anything else you want to do?

436
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,783
That's a very good question.

437
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,483
It's education.

438
00:38:18,483 --> 00:38:21,150
I'm happy to support education.

439
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,960
For example, the judge's foundation.

440
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,639
She has a perfect idea of education.
It's worth supporting.

441
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,217
She gives scholarships to young people
to study law.

442
00:38:31,217 --> 00:38:32,850
This is very good.

443
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,050
Our young generation

444
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,017
will have the opportunity to study.

445
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:38,950
They will become good lawyers,

446
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,417
a good attorney.

447
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:42,050
They're not just a good lawyer,

448
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,088
but a great one.

449
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,883
Who the hell are you?

450
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:06,150
What do you want?

451
00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:08,150
Stay out.

452
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:12,350
Leave me alone.

453
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,083
You're going to have a hard time
living in peace.

454
00:39:27,005 --> 00:39:30,320
Fresh air.

455
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:33,762
How's my law firm?

456
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,383
The worst thing about the law

457
00:39:38,383 --> 00:39:40,783
is when someone like you
gets a few days in jail.

458
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,583
What do you say, Tan?

459
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:49,417
You have to thank the judge.
You came out so fast.

460
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:50,650
He just went to work.

461
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,050
When he finished, he came out.

462
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:05,750
Grilled squid here is the best.

463
00:40:07,183 --> 00:40:09,650
If you feed me,

464
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,983
I'll reduce your debt by two thousand.

465
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:20,045
There you go.

466
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,017
Bro,

467
00:40:25,017 --> 00:40:26,350
look at Olarn.

468
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,350
He's bragging big time.

469
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,983
We need to hurry up.

470
00:40:31,317 --> 00:40:33,350
Otherwise, Sargent Itt will never come out.

471
00:40:34,783 --> 00:40:36,317
If Itt is not the murderer,

472
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:38,950
we must find the real murderer.

473
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,517
You must answer me.

474
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,550
Where were you exactly
on the day of the incident?

475
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,920
Your answer is the key to get you out of here.

476
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,317
Now, Olarn, who you trust,

477
00:40:56,683 --> 00:40:59,250
will definitely run for the mayor.

478
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,817
You should think carefully

479
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:09,360
about whether he let you get out.

480
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,950
If you want to survive,

481
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,117
you must speak out.

482
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:15,183
Sargent,

483
00:41:16,117 --> 00:41:17,583
your mother is waiting.

484
00:41:35,483 --> 00:41:36,817
Sir.

485
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:38,320
That lawyer Win and his gang

486
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,750
are investigating about Itt all over town.

487
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:44,080
What do you want me to do with them?

488
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,150
He's interesting.

489
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:50,783
I have a gut feeling

490
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:54,550
I must deal with him for a long time.

491
00:42:04,985 --> 00:42:08,920
This area is a construction zone
of the New Tulakham project.

492
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,450
Olarn bought up the land here.

493
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,150
Anyone who used to live here must move out.

494
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,817
If anyone refuses to move out,

495
00:42:15,817 --> 00:42:17,117
they will be evicted.

496
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,360
All locals moved to other places.

497
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,817
Some people…

498
00:42:22,817 --> 00:42:24,283
are living on a boat.

499
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,017
Why do you want to be a lawyer?

500
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,117
I want to know
whether I can use the law and justice.

501
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,150
The one I love tried to prove it.

502
00:43:09,817 --> 00:43:11,183
And did they prove it?

503
00:43:16,912 --> 00:43:18,983
I won't prove it.

504
00:43:20,783 --> 00:43:22,983
But I'll make it happen.

505
00:43:24,587 --> 00:43:27,883
The law must provide justice
to everyone equally.

506
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:38,765
Hello, how are you?

507
00:43:38,765 --> 00:43:41,000
Oh, Mr. Olarn, Hello.

508
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,320
Oh, hello.

509
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,640
This is so fresh.

510
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,717
- Oh.
- Hello, Mr. Olarn.

511
00:43:46,717 --> 00:43:48,400
Hello, how are you? Come on.

512
00:43:49,425 --> 00:43:51,897
Hello. Hey, Come on.

513
00:43:53,045 --> 00:43:54,133
Great, great.

514
00:44:04,457 --> 00:44:07,950
Olarn is very hot right now,

515
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,817
especially the merchants,

516
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:11,850
and the people in the degraded area.

517
00:44:12,573 --> 00:44:14,917
Ignore others.

518
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:16,383
How about a job I assigned you?

519
00:44:16,383 --> 00:44:17,417
Are you finished?

520
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,320
The foundation donation account is fine.

521
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,617
Whatever's in my hands, there's no mistake.

522
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,450
Red groupers.

523
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,717
Yes, fresh, Mr. Olarn.

524
00:44:33,717 --> 00:44:34,617
- Oh, right?
- Yes.

525
00:44:34,617 --> 00:44:36,150
- This is a barracuda.
- Just arrived.

526
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,825
It's a barracuda.

527
00:44:36,825 --> 00:44:38,583
This looks good.

528
00:44:39,883 --> 00:44:40,817
Oh yeah.

529
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:42,283
Thank you.

530
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:43,050
Yes, hello.

531
00:44:44,817 --> 00:44:47,240
This is a good shrimp. See?

532
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,181
Yes, that's right.

533
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:49,960
- Thank you. See you.
- Thank you.

534
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,117
Alright, everyone, see you soon.

535
00:44:59,684 --> 00:45:02,475
We're hunting down a suspect

536
00:45:02,475 --> 00:45:06,250
who will be the key to solving
the assassination case of the former mayor.

537
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,117
Is it related to influential people?

538
00:45:10,117 --> 00:45:11,583
Maybe…

539
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,850
This case may shake the justice system.

540
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,024
Lawyer, Are you concerned about your safety?

541
00:45:19,024 --> 00:45:20,483
What I'm doing

542
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:24,336
might offend the influencer.

543
00:45:24,336 --> 00:45:29,520
But I believe and hope that
the press will prioritize,

544
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,464
and keep an eye on this case.

545
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:42,983
Do you know? I never hated the fish smell, man.

546
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,917
Because it gave me life.

547
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:54,117
When I succeeded I built up this fish market
to repay this city.

548
00:45:55,648 --> 00:45:58,917
When we have power and money

549
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,717
they won't see us as just fishermen

550
00:46:04,683 --> 00:46:05,683
who are low-class.

551
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:21,960
What's up?

552
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,583
Sir,

553
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:27,560
that lawyer Boripat is lawyer
Chawanan's son and he's Prem's grandson.

554
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,117
<i>- Get in, get in.
- Let me go.</i>

555
00:46:31,217 --> 00:46:32,217
<i>Let me go.</i>

556
00:46:33,328 --> 00:46:36,617
<i>Hey! Let me go.</i>

557
00:46:36,617 --> 00:46:39,650
<i>Let me out, let me go.</i>

558
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,683
That kid is alive.

559
00:46:44,483 --> 00:46:46,450
Itt didn't kill him.

560
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:53,483
And now he's a lawyer like his mother.

561
00:46:53,483 --> 00:46:58,926
He's trying to get Itt's case to take me down.

562
00:47:03,992 --> 00:47:08,483
Tell Kom to find the killer.

563
00:47:08,483 --> 00:47:09,960
And take this bastard.

564
00:47:10,472 --> 00:47:11,472
Yes, sir.

565
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,850
How are you going to handle this, Kom?

566
00:47:55,283 --> 00:47:58,550
It won't bother me, will it?

567
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:01,617
Of course, sir.

568
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:16,017
Sir, can I help you?

569
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:31,444
Thank you very much, man. I'll come back later.

570
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:33,904
How was it?

571
00:48:33,904 --> 00:48:35,520
I investigated.

572
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,240
What's up?

573
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,960
Someone asked my friend to make fake documents

574
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,383
to escape the country.

575
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:41,483
And?

576
00:48:42,183 --> 00:48:44,240
He was appointed to receive the documents.

577
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,217
Around…

578
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:48,575
the old factory.

579
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:49,679
Old factory?

580
00:49:03,681 --> 00:49:05,183
You wait in the car.

581
00:49:05,183 --> 00:49:06,983
Tan, watch out for me.

582
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,417
No, I'll go with you.

583
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,075
Don't be a liability.

584
00:49:13,889 --> 00:49:14,913
Watch out for me.

585
00:49:15,448 --> 00:49:16,664
Yes, bro.

586
00:49:58,183 --> 00:49:59,550
If you don't want me to go,

587
00:50:00,283 --> 00:50:01,917
You need to help Win.

588
00:51:08,883 --> 00:51:09,883
Tan!

589
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,420
I got this.

590
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:31,989
If she dies, you die.

591
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:35,076
I caught the agent who got the mayor killed.
<i>[Next Episode]</i>

592
00:52:35,076 --> 00:52:39,243
You can't hold up, huh?
When my boss says he has new evidence.

593
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:42,309
The best evidence is now
in the prosecutor's hands.

594
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:44,642
How can you survive?

595
00:52:44,642 --> 00:52:47,297
I'll be a mayor of Tulakham.

596
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,123
After this, I will have to bother you.

597
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:55,453
Our Tulakham needs a leader.
