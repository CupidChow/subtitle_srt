To be developing this city together with the Chalinee Foundation.

7
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:12,176
So, how should we deal with Haruetai?

8
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:15,770
You brought her here.
I have nothing to do with it.

9
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,996
Aeri is the one who will
take my place in the future.

10
00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:22,456
Think carefully about what you're going to do.

11
00:02:23,274 --> 00:02:25,015
They can't take this project from us.

12
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:28,977
As long as I'm with her,
the money will still go to me anyway.

13
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:31,677
As for you, just focus on saving your own skin.

14
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:38,436
My mother worked at the judge's house,
and now she's missing.

15
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:41,951
I will take this case for you
if you agree to help me.

16
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:44,429
The judge is using you.

17
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,956
You might as well join me.

18
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:49,094
Let me go!

19
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:51,840
Let go of me!

20
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:01,148
This is the warrant for the contract killing
of the employee from Korea.

21
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,550
Let me ask you again.

22
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:07,383
Do you know this employee from Korea?

23
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,955
I don't know.

24
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:12,183
You better tell the truth.

25
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:16,550
<i>Make her disappear.</i>

26
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:18,235
You can't escape.

27
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,050
I want to use the phone.

28
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:47,183
Madam, you have to help me.

29
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:51,218
Listen to Lawyer Koson.
He can definitely help you.

30
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:55,850
<i>I'm having Attorney Charoen
look for a way to help you.</i>

31
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:09,850
Based on the evidence,
Prangthip won't get away with it.

32
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,183
I want to get out of here.

33
00:04:17,783 --> 00:04:20,250
Crying out won't improve anything.

34
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:26,950
I don't like this prosecutor.

35
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,250
Get Aeri to handle this for me right now.

36
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,550
How could I do that?

37
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:34,617
Hey, you need to calm down.
I'll handle this myself.

38
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:38,650
You should hurry up and take care of this.

39
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,417
Don't forget, I'm the one
who handles all the accounts.

40
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:46,350
Ms. Prangthip,

41
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,250
I want to confirm one more time.

42
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:56,483
This clip can be used as evidence.

43
00:04:58,183 --> 00:04:59,522
You won't be able to escape.

44
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,823
In that case, I think…

45
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,117
You should provide useful testimony.

46
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:12,683
At least you could use it
to reduce your sentence.

47
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,983
Are you threatening me?

48
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,850
This is Tulakham.

49
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,283
Go get Prosecutor Charoen.

50
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:34,283
I don't care about outsiders like you.

51
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,450
I didn't expect Kamnan Chot
to have such an excellent daughter.

52
00:05:57,031 --> 00:06:00,383
You and my father don't realize
what women are capable of.

53
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:06,117
Kamnan Chot,

54
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:08,717
having tried his whole life,

55
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:12,783
sacrificing everything,
to stand at the peak of this city.

56
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,650
But the one who succeeded
is the daughter who…

57
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,517
has always been rejected.

58
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:24,850
I've lost so much more than you know.

59
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:29,550
It's time for me to take revenge.

60
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,117
Even you, I will take revenge on completely.

61
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:38,917
Then I'll wait and see.

62
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,817
It's time for you to answer my questions.

63
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,283
Every question I ask, everything you know.

64
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:40,183
Prao.

65
00:07:58,917 --> 00:07:59,917
No.

66
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,250
No, that's not it.

67
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,517
It's impossible.

68
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,272
You and I used to love
taking pictures together here.

69
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,117
What camera did you buy for me?

70
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:29,583
D90, bought on your birthday.

71
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:32,585
I bought it even though
you didn't like digital cameras.

72
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,683
So, where did we first meet?

73
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:46,283
At your photoshop,
you secretly took my picture.

74
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,672
Because I wanted you to come
to my shop every day.

75
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:06,483
Ruetai.

76
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,050
You're Ruetai.

77
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:43,050
Right now, the remaining network is

78
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,317
the legal side and the media.

79
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,083
Judge Chalinee is probably
creating a new network.

80
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,705
And I believe she must have
everything in her hands by now.

81
00:09:58,275 --> 00:10:00,817
So what should we do next, bro?

82
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,817
If they have the media,
we need to have the media.

83
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,320
And if they have the law, we do too.

84
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,483
A lawless law firm, fight!

85
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,895
<i>[Court of Tulakham]</i>

86
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:36,650
Judge Chatree, please have a seat.

87
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:45,650
I'm honored to serve you, Madam.

88
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,183
I want you to rule on this case.

89
00:10:57,883 --> 00:11:01,450
But this case has a suspect
close to you, Madam.

90
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,560
I'm afraid…

91
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,517
Just rule according to the law
fairly enough.

92
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,983
I'm really troubled.

93
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,850
I'm looking for a precise judge.

94
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,483
It's necessary to have a good judge
to share my workload.

95
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:31,977
I will rule as fairly as possible.

96
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:35,979
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

97
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,003
Good.

00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,817

101

00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,317
<i>I won't let you do anything to my friends.</i>

103
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,117
<i>Ruetai took the photo, right?</i>

104
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:43,065
<i>We're trying to find a way to help you.</i>

105
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,483
<i>I'm the one trying to help you.</i>

<i>The one who has to die is you.</i>

00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,850
<i>We are looking for a way to help you.</i>

109
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:04,598
<i>But it must be done according to the law.</i>

110
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,817
<i>You shouldn't treat me like this.</i>

111
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,117
<i>This one belongs to Ruetai.</i>

112
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,250
<i>Let's make this room for Ruetai, okay?</i>

113
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,950
<i>See? I miss you two all the time.</i>

114
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:43,150
<i>Why did you come back here?</i>

115
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,783
<i>You deserve to die.</i>

116
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,590
Boss.

117
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,983
Boss, what should a good lawyer do?

118
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,350
Brother.

119
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,517
You asked because you want to be a lawyer?

120
00:15:14,717 --> 00:15:16,017
Why?

121
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:18,120
Well, it's because I want to be one.

122
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,850
Look at my appearance. Is there any part of me
that can't be a lawyer?

123
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,350
- Every part.
- Every part.

124
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:27,387
Hey, bro, sorry.

125
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:29,307
Did you finish high school yet?

126
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:31,517
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow, that hits home.

127
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:33,850
It'll be over soon. Gosh.

128
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,850
Calm down.

129
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:40,217
A good lawyer is someone who can
always be a refuge for their client.

130
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,817
And serves as a good example
for those who respect the law.

131
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:47,783
Exactly, Yorch.

132
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,517
You're determined. Study a lot,
and you'll be a lawyer too.

133
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,850
We're here to support you.
You could have Lawyer Prao tutor you.

134
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,350
Read a lot. Here, here…

135
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,650
Here's the appeal case.

136
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,917
Oh, this is very useful. Right here.

137
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:01,958
This section is here.

Bro.

139
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:07,617
Don't tell anyone.
The book he's reading is mine.

140
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,650
Really?

141
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:14,383
When are you going to take the exam?

142
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:16,863
Coming up soon.

143
00:16:16,863 --> 00:16:18,983
I told you to finish high school first.

144
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:21,017
He hasn't graduated yet.

145
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:29,617
<i>Based on the information you provided,
it hasn't even reached the end.</i>

146
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,050
<i>So how do you want it to end?</i>

147
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:37,283
<i>Well, Judge Chalinee</i>

148
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,917
<i>was publicly unmasked.</i>

149
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,817
<i>And was cursed and scorned
by everyone in the city.</i>

150
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:47,717
<i>Oh, perfect.</i>

151
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:50,606
<i>No way.</i>

152
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:02,885
Are you waiting to gloat over me?

153
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,483
I'm only here to extend an offer.

154
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:10,145
You want me to be your side?

155
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:15,312
You don't have to go that far.

156
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:17,885
Just allow me to help, and that's enough.

157
00:17:26,017 --> 00:17:28,298
You are the one working for Chalinee all along.

158
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,318
You know everything she did.

159
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,838
It's just like Olarn.

160
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,505
No matter how loyal you are,

161
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,417
in the end, there will be nothing left.

162
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:49,219
<i>Don't do anything I didn't order.</i>

163
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:51,483
<i>So how do we handle Haruetai?</i>

164
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,417
<i>You brought her here,
I have nothing to do with it.</i>

165
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,050
<i>Make her disappear.</i>

166
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,483
<i>You won't escape.</i>

167
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,583
<i>And do you know that judge</i>

168
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,117
<i>has assigned the New Tulakham project
to Chairman Lee?</i>

169
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:10,200
<i>He will benefit immensely from this project.</i>

170
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:14,017
<i>And the reason we don't know about this is that</i>

171
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:21,983
<i>we're definitely going to be sidelined.</i>

172
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,605
So what will I get out of this?

173
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,683
What do you have left now?

174
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:45,539
There has been an order to remove Olarn

175
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,483
from the position of mayor of Tulakham.

176
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:51,750
The authorities are gathering evidence
and additional witnesses.

177
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,517
And they are pursuing him according to
the Tulakham court's warrant.

178
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,678
May I have an interview?

179
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,563
How far have you progressed right now, sir?

180
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:04,383
I can't say much at this moment.

181
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:10,350
But I assure you that we must capture
Olarn for questioning as soon as possible.

182
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,750
In terms of evidence and witnesses,

183
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:15,863
this is locked down tightly, right?

184
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:17,850
I can't answer that.

185
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,950
How confident is the prosecution
in the evidence right now?

186
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,950
That's right.

187
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:25,170
I can't answer that yet
because it could jeopardize the case.

188
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:28,483
Will there be a press conference for this?

189
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:30,970
When will the public be informed?

190
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,850
When, sir?

191
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,817
When?

192
00:19:32,817 --> 00:19:33,575
Please let us know.

193
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:34,535
Please answer.

194
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:36,135
Is there a rough schedule, sir?

195
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:39,950
How clear is it?

196
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,017
I wonder if we should run, huh?

197
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,383
I can probably find a way.

198
00:19:48,483 --> 00:19:51,638
The money we have is plenty enough
to settle comfortably.

199
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:54,958
I'm going nowhere.

200
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,983
This is my home.

201
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:04,998
I'm going to take back the Olarn Group.

202
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:21,350
I propose the report from the prosecution

203
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,750
gathered on the progress of the case.

204
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,525
It's all in this document.

205
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:31,458
Summarize it. I'll read it later.

206
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,484
Following what the judge said,
the case is clear.

207
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:46,350
The evidence is obvious,
so just cut to the chase.

208
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,450
Aside from the sea and justice in Tulakham,

209
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,785
I secretly know that there are
other valuable things here.

210
00:20:55,917 --> 00:21:00,650
Judge, you've prepared well.

211
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,717
Today I'm completely exhausted.

212
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,854
I want to rest.

213
00:21:08,854 --> 00:21:11,787
I've fully prepared everything.

214
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:13,383
If you're ready, please go ahead.

215
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:18,417
Please.

216
00:21:29,683 --> 00:21:31,783
You have a keen nose.

217
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:37,883
The evidence you've got,
is that Secretary Prangthip won't escape, right?

218
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,350
How do you know?

219
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,450
You, the ironclad prosecutor,

220
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:50,517
don't you wonder how Prosecutor Charoen
got the evidence?

221
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:53,350
And how was it checked?

222
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,317
Are you using me as a tool for revenge?

223
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,550
I'm only doing my duty for justice.

224
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,018
Following the available evidence.

225
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:06,983
Not acting on personal feelings.

226
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:12,692
We trust in your sense of justice.

227
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:16,550
And we're glad to have you
as the prosecutor in this case.

228
00:22:22,184 --> 00:22:24,077
Thank you for coming to Tulakham.

229
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,483
I already knew you would come to see me.

230
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,083
Law and justice won't side
with someone like you.

231
00:23:01,317 --> 00:23:04,283
I can't believe I'm hearing this from you.

232
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,750
It's quite sad.

233
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,017
No matter how often I have to say it,
I'll still stand by my words.

234
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,150
Oh, Lawyer Praochanok.

235
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,350
Hello.

236
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,050
We came to show our support for the judge.

237
00:23:31,717 --> 00:23:33,283
I didn't think I would see you here.

238
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,517
It's about the secretary's case
that's making news.

239
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,805
We're waiting to hear the verdict.

240
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,850
Aeri, Aeri, my dear.

241
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,150
Aeri, sit down.

242
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:17,850
Aeri, you must help me.

243
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,217
You're a prosecutor. You must help me.

244
00:24:20,217 --> 00:24:22,217
Please, Aeri, please.

245
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,743
Mom, is there something I don't know yet?
You have to tell me everything.

246
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:29,983
Aeri, you must tell the judge to help me too.

247
00:24:29,983 --> 00:24:33,517
And tell her that I have
all the foundation documents.

248
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:37,083
And including those that
haven't been disclosed.

249
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,550
Go tell her just like that, okay, Aeri?

250
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,883
What if she doesn't care, mom?

251
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:46,217
Aeri, you have to find a way to help me!
Anything, dear.

252
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:48,417
Tell her that you're willing to do anything.

253
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,983
No!

254
00:24:50,983 --> 00:24:54,517
You must not say you will do anything.
No, no. You cannot say that.

255
00:24:55,617 --> 00:24:58,623
Aeri, you must not do everything for her.

256
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:01,183
Don't do anything for her.

257
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:03,359
You can't do it. No, no.

258
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,625
You must help me. I'm so scared, dear.

259
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,717
I will help! Just stay calm, Mom.

260
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,050
Aeri, help me.

261
00:25:13,817 --> 00:25:16,350
Please, Aeri, help me! I'm scared.

262
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,058
Please, Aeri, I'm scared.

263
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:26,438
It's not that I don't want to help.

264
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,872
But your mom's situation is really serious.

265
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:35,617
With all the witnesses and the evidence,
it's hard for her to escape.

266
00:25:38,783 --> 00:25:42,083
You, as a prosecutor, should understand well.

267
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:49,017
But my mother has always served you.

268
00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:06,183
My mom said all the foundation documents
are still with her.

269
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:11,850
So what's your point?

270
00:26:12,617 --> 00:26:17,417
It would be better if you looked for a way
to persuade your mother to confess.

271
00:26:18,217 --> 00:26:20,012
The heavy penalty may become lighter.

272
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:32,117
Your future is still far away,
don't forget that.

273
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,150
Hello.

274
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,883
You think I will run away?

275
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,583
This is my home, you know. This city is mine.

276
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,650
I will reclaim everything that belongs to me.

277
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,950
You destroyed my beloved things,

278
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:22,983
and I will destroy yours too.

279
00:27:56,617 --> 00:27:58,283
Hello, Tan. Where's Prao?

280
00:27:59,783 --> 00:28:03,296
She's at the office, bro.
You had to call and check?

281
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,317
Keep a close watch on her.
Don't let her go anywhere alone.

282
00:28:10,717 --> 00:28:11,717
Yes.

283
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:34,583
Are you thinking of using
the foundation documents against me?

284
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,083
You have no power anymore.

285
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,050
In the past, I helped you with everything.

286
00:28:43,317 --> 00:28:44,317
Yes.

287
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,583
You're right, you did everything for me.

288
00:28:50,717 --> 00:28:52,150
So I didn't do anything.

289
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:01,283
You did everything completely by yourself.

290
00:29:10,223 --> 00:29:12,217
Follow what Lawyer Koson says.

291
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:19,017
Otherwise, just take care of yourself.

292
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:19,850
Bro, Mangpong is getting caught.

293
00:30:33,717 --> 00:30:34,717
Boss.

294
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,905
Do you really think you can take me down?

295
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,383
You betrayed my uncle.

296
00:30:58,217 --> 00:30:59,217
Hey!

297
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,250
Brother.

298
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,783
Tan.

299
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,750
Brother, walk slowly.

300
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:39,217
Look at that! Oh, you deserve this!

301
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:01,350
This is for my boss!

302
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:30,483
Are you a tough guy? Here you are.

303
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,817
Oh, when did you get here?

304
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,617
Sorry!

305
00:33:48,383 --> 00:33:51,550
Is this a mattress? Are you crazy?

306
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:03,617
Here it comes! I'm back!

307
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:04,630
Share it out, would you?

308
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:06,250
Eat up!

309
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,483
- Thanks!
- Yeah, let's drink.

310
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,150
With straws too!

311
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,150
Straws! Give them out!

312
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:11,983
Here you go!

313
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,454
Tan, here's the drink!

314
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:18,583
Why is it so exhausting to fight
against those with money and power?

315
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:23,483
It's fine to risk your life, but reading books
like this will be the death of me!

316
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,083
I read every day.

317
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:27,683
Really?

318
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:31,683
Come on, that's just part of being a lawyer.

319
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,883
Oh, Prao.

320
00:34:33,883 --> 00:34:35,100
- Hey, Yam.
- Huh?

321
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,760
If you had studied like this back in school…

322
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,150
You'd be a doctor by now.

323
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,750
- Not sitting here!
- Oh!

324
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,817
Bro, just look at Yorch.

325
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:46,017
You're reading law books, huh?

326
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,490
Planning to take the exam tomorrow?

327
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:51,950
If I get my high school diploma,
I'll go on to study!

328
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,750
Okay, I'll just hand over
the office to you then.

329
00:34:58,007 --> 00:35:01,335
Alright, it's a deal!

330
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:05,750
Take me with you!

331
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,950
We need to check your behavior first!

332
00:35:29,145 --> 00:35:30,145
Hey, you!

333
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,016
Please sit down.

334
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,750
All of this is evidence from the foundation
that my mother gathered.

335
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:21,472
Your mother made the right decision.

336
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:28,917
I am not in a position to do anything
about this case.

337
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:36,045
I can only ask that you help my mother.

338
00:36:40,183 --> 00:36:42,412
Even though your mother
made the right decision,

339
00:36:44,017 --> 00:36:46,518
it doesn't mean she will get out
of the charges.

340
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,234
Because what your mother did…

341
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,361
The evidence is solid.

342
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,612
But I will do my best.

343
00:37:09,983 --> 00:37:10,983
Thank you.

344
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,450
You're welcome.

345
00:37:32,602 --> 00:37:34,550
<i>Is Lawyer Boripat really going to help me?</i>

346
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:40,083
<i>I don't know how much he can help.</i>

347
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,956
<i>I'm just going with my instincts.</i>

348
00:37:43,885 --> 00:37:44,885
<i>Aeri!</i>

349
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,083
<i>You should be on the judge's side.</i>

350
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,650
<i>Mom!</i>

351
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,550
<i>Stop forcing me to do whatever you want.</i>

352
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:57,417
<i>I'm old enough to make my own choices now.</i>

<i>If Lawyer Win can help us, we should use him.</i>

354
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,450
<i>You never wanted to choose for yourself.</i>

355
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,672
<i>And how do you know Lawyer Win can help me?</i>

356
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:19,083
<i>You like him, don't you?</i>

357
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:29,895
<i>Aeri!</i>

358
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:33,150
<i>And you think you can fight with Praochanok?</i>

359
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,998
<i>What do you want me to fight?</i>

360
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,283
<i>You don't even know what to fight.</i>

361
00:38:42,283 --> 00:38:44,083
<i>You never know anything!</i>

362
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:53,778
<i>Mom, I learned everything from you.</i>

363
00:39:49,517 --> 00:39:51,683
Guard! Guard!

364
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,283
Guard, may I have a phone call?

365
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,017
Guard!

366
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:05,150
You need to sign these agreement documents.

367
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:22,483
Can you really do this?

368
00:40:27,183 --> 00:40:28,817
I know you don't trust us.

369
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,217
But who else can you trust right now?

370
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:43,450
For us to help you,

371
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,892
you need to say
you didn't decide this on your own.

372
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,583
Someone else ordered you.

373
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,850
Will she agree to testify like that?

374
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:49,850
Oh, wait a minute.

375
00:41:51,283 --> 00:41:52,750
I want to know

376
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:57,650
how did you get those documents.

377
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,825
I got them from someone
who wants to help her mother…

378
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,283
Help Prangthip.

379
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,756
Prangthip has agreed to let us handle the case.

380
00:42:24,717 --> 00:42:27,250
She has also sent the
foundation's account evidence to us.

381
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:32,400
Exactly as planned.
What should we do next, boss?

382
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,478
That's right.

383
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,417
Expose Chalinee.

384
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:40,483
We need to deal with Judge Chatree immediately.

385
00:42:41,614 --> 00:42:42,682
- Go!
- Go!

386
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,917
How is Prangthip's case going?

387
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:50,050
It's getting close to the trial date.

388
00:42:53,683 --> 00:42:57,883
Your Honor, is there anything concerning you?

389
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,183
I can't help but worry.

390
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,717
In that case,

391
00:43:10,747 --> 00:43:13,983
may I arrange for someone
to protect you at home?

392
00:43:15,383 --> 00:43:16,383
It's for your safety.

393
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,283
Now, I'm representing Prangthip as her lawyer.

394
00:43:43,717 --> 00:43:45,050
But I'm not taking sides.

395
00:43:45,717 --> 00:43:46,783
Legally, of course.

396
00:43:48,783 --> 00:43:51,017
I want everything to go
according to the law too.

397
00:43:52,146 --> 00:43:53,517
Please trust us.

398
00:43:57,586 --> 00:43:59,283
You both are really stubborn.

399
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:02,917
See you in court.

400
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,550
Hello.

401
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,783
That Lawyer Boripat
likes to do things strangely.

402

<i>[Subject, Missing person]</i>

403
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,683
The case of Lawyer Boripat's mother
and Lawyer Praochanok's mother.

404
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,983
These two cases happened on the same day.

<i>[Report missing person on 18 June B.E.2549]</i>

406
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,817
These two have some common goals.

407
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:28,183
The weather is really nice
this morning, Lawyer.

408
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,883
How're you, Lawyer Koson?

409
00:45:38,592 --> 00:45:39,592
Olarn.

410
00:45:40,717 --> 00:45:42,121
I didn't do anything. I did not do it!

411
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:43,470
I was just following orders!

412
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:47,032
Following orders?

413
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:56,599
Following orders? Orders, orders, orders!

414
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:08,175
Following orders? Orders, orders!

415
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:15,343
Orders, orders, orders!

416
00:46:29,983 --> 00:46:30,983
Go!

417
00:46:38,517 --> 00:46:39,517
Excuse me.

418
00:46:40,517 --> 00:46:41,517
You!

419
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,350
Please sign that and return it to me.

420
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:46,161
That's enough.

421
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,517
From what I've seen, I don't think
an agreement can be reached.

422
00:46:57,278 --> 00:46:58,983
But it may work in our favor.

423
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:13,617
Hello. I'm Lawyer Praochanok.

424
00:47:15,383 --> 00:47:16,592
I think…

425
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,883
I can help you claim compensation from someone.

426
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,450
Really?

427
00:47:39,464 --> 00:47:42,717
Prangthip wants to change
her lawyer to Lawyer Boripat.

428
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:47,750
I expected that.

429
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:52,650
Well, I want to see what he will do next.

430
00:48:09,383 --> 00:48:11,617
<i>Following orders? Orders!</i>

431
00:48:11,617 --> 00:48:14,550
<i>Help!</i>

432
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,817
I didn't expect to see you here.

433
00:48:57,808 --> 00:48:59,517
Are you here to apologize to the dead?

434
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,217
My mother died on that cliff.

435
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:11,683
So I swear I will use the law
to protect this city.

436
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:17,183
I'm also using the law
to fight against you right now.

437
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,750
It's quite strange.

438
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,783
The person who stands by your side
is someone you've discarded.

439
00:49:25,017 --> 00:49:26,050
But that's fine.

440
00:49:27,183 --> 00:49:29,717
I will be the one to bring those people
back to deal with you.

441
00:49:35,327 --> 00:49:39,783
I still have enough power
to make all of you disappear.

442
00:49:40,983 --> 00:49:42,017
At any time.

443
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:46,957
Are you not using the law anymore?

444
00:49:48,117 --> 00:49:50,983
It depends on how stubborn you are.

445
00:49:54,217 --> 00:49:56,317
Until you face legal consequences.

446
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:09,417
And I will win just like every time before.

447
00:50:44,435 --> 00:50:47,094
I propose to dismiss the judge.

<i>[Next Episode]</i>

449
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,339
The evidence clearly shows that you did it.

450

You must take responsibility.

451
00:50:54,758 --> 00:50:55,795
Think carefully.

452
00:50:56,935 --> 00:50:59,278
I will take good care of Erika.

Let's meet up.

454
00:51:04,223 --> 00:51:05,684
So we can have a proper discussion.

455

Don't play tricks.
