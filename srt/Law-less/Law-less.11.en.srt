<i>It seems like some people

If you don't clear up these things,

10
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,683
it might make our work more difficult.

Hand over the New Tulakham project

14
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:37,824
He will benefit greatly from this project.

15
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,183
You know I invested almost
all my money in New Tulakham.

16
00:02:41,183 --> 00:02:43,323
This is so bad, a real mess.

17
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:44,946
And the reason we don't know about this is that

18
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:50,148
we're definitely going to be sidelined.

19
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:52,743
Because you're Chalinee's people.

20
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:54,571
I don't want you to see Prao again.

21
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:56,727
I can't do what you ask.

22
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:57,961
Why? I don't understand.

23
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:01,576

He did it because he loved his son.

80

Then, can I talk to Lawyer Boripat?

111
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:50,850
Please.

112
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,017
To be honest,

113
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,983
I feel uncomfortable about
my daughter working here.

114
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:10,583
I don't want the townspeople

115
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:13,450

Please let me finish this work.

121
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,283
It's fine. All debts are over.

122

123

Hey, you, but…

124
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,717

<i>Why? I don't understand.</i>

140
00:12:26,783 --> 00:12:27,983
It's not really who you are.

141
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:36,617
Lawyer Prao has really changed you.

142
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,600
I don't want Prao to take risks with me again.

143
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,450
Oh, then you end up feeling sad like this?

144
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:49,683
It's probably for the best.

145
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,083
I got it. I understand.

146
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,383
But if you love me and want to chase me away.

147
00:12:58,383 --> 00:13:01,717
Just so you know, I won't go.

148
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,617
I'm with you. It's a lot more fun.

149
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,483

00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:54,783
Really, bro?

178
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:59,458
Don't tell anyone. Even Prao can't know.

179
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,116
When the time comes, I'll tell her.

180
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,930
This is why you don't want
Lawyer Prao to be here.

181
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,552
But there's something
even more shocking.

182
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:20,736
The one who sent us information,
urging us to come back here,

183
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:22,101
is Judge Chalinee.

184
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,750
Why did she intentionally give information
to accuse her people?

185
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:35,592
She wanted to use my hand
to eliminate those people.

186
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:51,717
What's wrong?

187
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,539
<i>[Revoke the New Tulakham project]</i>

188
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,425
What does this mean?

189
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:17,017
How do you take responsibility, Lawyer Koson?

190
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:21,283
The problem is with you, Mayor Olarn.

191
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:25,250
Oh, you want it like this? Fine.

192
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,583
What are you doing?
What are you going to do to me?

193
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,050
- What do you want? Huh?
- Let go of me.

194
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,083
Call it off!

195
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,250
I do everything for you.

196
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:53,150
This project is my life.

197
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,317
I'm willing to give up my entire
Olarn Group for it.

198
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,083
I'll give you everything.

199
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:05,750
Do you think I deserve this kind
of compensation? Your honor.

200
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:18,750
But isn't this your job?

201
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:25,483
And it will be your duty
for the rest of your life.

202
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:33,117
I can accept anything…

203
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:38,817
except for this project.

204
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:43,283
Have you forgotten your origin, Olarn?

205
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,183
Who do you think you're negotiating with? Huh?

206
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:51,350
Did you think you got
the position of mayor by yourself?

207
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:53,983
Is your power enough?

208
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:58,583
The truth is, Olarn Group wasn't yours
in the first place.

209
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:04,683
We just… return it to its rightful owner,
that's all.

210
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:12,717
The judge was right. Your real job

211
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,850
is just a hunting dog.

212
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:23,750
If that's the case,
this fabricated position of the mayor

213
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:27,476
would probably be almost the end of its term.

214
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:44,083
Fine.

215
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,550
Then I'll do it on my way.

216
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,317
I've returned all the items.

217
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,432
I owe you nothing.

218
00:22:28,017 --> 00:22:32,783
Olarn is like a mad dog.
If you let him go, he'll just bite people.

219
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,103
This video clip shows evidence of media hiring

220
00:22:40,103 --> 00:22:42,128
and the distortion of information.

221
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:45,350
And evidence of election fraud.

222
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:48,798
I hope that Attorney General Charoen
will help take care of this.

223
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:52,783
With pleasure.

224
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,183
Only his evidence

225
00:22:58,517 --> 00:23:01,583
can make a dog bite its own tail to death.

226
00:23:07,783 --> 00:23:10,317
Oh, You just tell him that I ordered it.

227
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:12,672
So he'll be considerate of me.

228
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:15,478
And if he's still fussy, just tell him.

229
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,017
That you're the mayor's man.

230
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,178
I'll clear it up for you. That's all.

231
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,250
Sir.

232
00:23:27,717 --> 00:23:30,052
The boys at the karaoke bar
got into trouble with the police.

233
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,909
Can you please send someone to clear this up?

234
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,417
Did you order me?

235
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:52,750
Did you order me?

236
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:59,583
Did you order me?

237
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:06,550
Did you order me? Ordered me… Ordered me.

238
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,187
Order me? Huh?

239
00:24:17,187 --> 00:24:18,187
Sir, I'm sorry.

240
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:19,939
Sir, I'm sorry.

241
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:22,150
It's my fault. I won't do it again, sir.

242
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,717
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

243
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:24,717
I'm sorry.

244
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,250
I was wrong, sir.

245
00:24:28,283 --> 00:24:30,672
I'm sorry. I won't do it again, sir.

246
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:06,217
You probably don't think
I'm Praochanok, do you?

247
00:25:09,483 --> 00:25:10,350
Would you like some coffee?

248
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,350
I'm good.

249
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,583
That was yesterday.

250
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,050
My prosecutor's office

251
00:25:18,478 --> 00:25:20,517
received evidence of corruption

252
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:24,317
of Mayor Olarn.

253
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:28,783
We are now compiling the case file
to file a lawsuit.

254
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:30,517
Whose evidence is this?

255
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,417
I can't tell you.

256
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:37,850
But I'm telling you this
because I think you'll be interested.

257
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,692
Don't be careless with this case.
For your own sake.

258
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:48,917
I'm the prosecutor of this city.

259
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:51,883
I want to see this city clean too.

260
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,298
Don't trust anyone.

261
00:25:58,961 --> 00:26:00,550
Including you?

262
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:11,850
Only this evidence alone
won't be enough to convict Olarn.

263
00:26:12,717 --> 00:26:15,950
Let's just say I'll try to find something
and send them to you.

264
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,883
And I hope the person
who ordered the prosecution

265
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:21,350
is the Prosecutor Arnat.

266
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:24,550
It should be like that.

267
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:33,450
Take it easy.

268
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,650
I loved him and had faith in him.
Look at me, look.

269
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,932
- I saw it. I saw it.
- Look.

270
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:42,350
How could he do this to me?

271
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:46,417
- Are you okay?
- Get up slowly.

272
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:49,017
Ouch, I'm fine.

273
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:53,650
Would you like me to massage you?

274
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,650
No need.

275
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,583
Hey, the liquor's all gone.
Go get some more.

276
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:03,551
Yes.

277
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:05,117
Go get some more liquor.

278
00:27:05,117 --> 00:27:06,683
Okay, yes.

279
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:08,117
Sure, sweetheart.

280
00:27:10,217 --> 00:27:11,583
Sure, sure.

281
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:20,350
Just a minute, my dear.

282
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:26,250
Here it is.

283
00:27:27,183 --> 00:27:28,483
Here it is.

284
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,402
Hey!

285
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:37,117
- Why are you so surprised?
- How did you get in?

286
00:27:37,117 --> 00:27:38,583
- Surprised?
- How did you get in?

287
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:39,246
Hey! Let me go.

288
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:40,950
Open your mouth wide.
Open your mouth wide.

289
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,718
Let me go.

290
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:45,817
Oh, so you can relieve stress.
You can relax, huh?

291
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:49,917
Aren't you sad? So sad, huh?

292
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:52,217
Take them all.

293
00:27:55,117 --> 00:27:56,983
Where are you going?

294
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,713
Stay still, stay still.

295
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:02,087
I can walk by myself.

296
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:04,550
Your legs have no strength.
You can walk by yourself? Huh?

297
00:28:05,534 --> 00:28:06,950
Let's go!

298
00:28:09,717 --> 00:28:10,717
Ouch, heavy.

299
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,517
You're heavy.

300
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:22,174
Hello.

301
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:37,183
Hello, can you hear me?

302
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:43,223
Oh, yes. Are you busy?

303
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:46,750
Oh, not too much.
But I have to pack my things now.

304
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,917
I have to move and work somewhere else.

305
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,850
Oh, but we can talk now.

306
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,150
You're going to work somewhere else.
Then I probably won't see you very often.

307
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:59,417
Would you like to have dinner together?

308
00:30:00,817 --> 00:30:01,883
Sure.

309
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,150
Yes, yes.

310
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:08,383
Yes, Goodbye.

311
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,383
- Go, go, go.
- Hey, hey.

312
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:34,479
Win, don't do anything to me, man.

313
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:36,143
Let's talk about this, man.

314
00:30:36,143 --> 00:30:39,317
Hey, hey, don't wriggle too much.
If you fall down, it's not so fun.

315
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,140
If anyone falls from the Phee Phluk cliff,
it will be considered suicide.

316
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,317
What will you write a suicide note?

317
00:30:46,317 --> 00:30:48,883
Disappointed by your boss, have gambling debts

318
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,250
or you feel guilty, so you commit suicide?

319
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,383
Hey, hey.

320
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,283
Win, you're a lawyer, man.
You have to use the law.

321
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:59,917
Don't hurt me, man.
I would go on trial for you.

322
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:03,989
You killed my uncle.
Do you want me to use the law against you?

323
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:06,805
A man like you must face
a kangaroo court like me.

324
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:10,197
- Oh.
- Hey, hey.

325
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:11,717
Okay, I'll do it.

326
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:15,616
These events happened
because Mayor Olarn ordered me to do so.

327
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,250
Say that again.

328
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:28,354
I said that Mayor Olarn ordered me to do this.

329
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:29,650
I don't believe it.

330
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,440
I have the clip on my phone.
You can open it if you don't believe me.

331
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,783
It's in my pocket. Open it.

332
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:38,617
Did you find it?

333
00:31:40,343 --> 00:31:42,640
Don't hurt me. Don't kill me, man.

334
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,283
I won't kill you to waste my time.

335
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:47,017
The one who's going to kill you is Olarn.

336
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:52,083
<i>Say that again.</i>

337
00:31:53,234 --> 00:31:55,650
<i>I said that Mayor Olarn ordered me to do this.</i>

338
00:31:56,692 --> 00:32:00,750
Hey, Win, what are you doing, Win?

339
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,750
Goodbye.

340
00:32:13,045 --> 00:32:14,217
Run away safely, Okay?

341
00:32:17,296 --> 00:32:18,576
- Come back here!
- A loud thud.

342
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:20,383
Let me go, Win.

343
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:24,917
Win, come back and help me.
Win, come back here.

344
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:28,144
Win… Win.

345
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:31,483
Brother, should I send this information
to the prosecutor, Arnat, now?

346
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:32,483
Hold on.

347
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,850
I want to see Olarn struggling more.

348
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:43,658
Check all data, and then you can post it
on social media.

349
00:32:43,658 --> 00:32:44,658
Yes, bro.

350
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:56,117
Do something.

351
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,692
Otherwise, my funds
will definitely be depleted.

352
00:32:59,692 --> 00:33:02,117
We have to convince Prosecutor Erika
to be on my side.

353
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:05,783
Because I must keep my position as mayor.

354
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:09,150
I told you. I don't want Aeri
to get involved in this matter.

355
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:11,183
Then do as you wish.

356
00:33:11,183 --> 00:33:14,317
After all, the judge wouldn't let us
be free.

357
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:17,823
We know the judge too much.

358
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:21,217
What am I supposed to do?

359
00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:43,240
<i>[Olarn]</i>

360
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:53,400
Hello, Mr. Mayor. I just found out that

361
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,225
<i>you are close to the judge's secretary.</i>

362
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:58,050
<i>Can you ask the secretary for me?</i>

363
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,597
If the judge knew that you two met up,

364
00:34:01,597 --> 00:34:02,805
what would happen?

365
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:08,683
You're really annoying.

366
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:14,750
Okay. I just want to say
get ready for some good news.

367
00:34:15,383 --> 00:34:17,283
And have fun, Mr. Mayor.

368

I've warned you before.

385
00:35:21,817 --> 00:35:23,543
These gangsters.

386
00:35:23,543 --> 00:35:25,800

Where have you been?

388
00:35:39,162 --> 00:35:43,550
Oh, I went to Aerie's prosecutor's office,

389
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:46,450
and I followed up on the accounts, Madam.

390
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:52,850
Really?

391
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:59,783
I have to thank you anyway.

392
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,383
You are always doing this and that for me.

393
00:36:04,017 --> 00:36:07,217
I'd be in serious trouble if I didn't have you.

394
00:36:08,283 --> 00:36:13,079
Yes, Madam. Aeri and I are happy to serve you.

395
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,417
Hello, you came before me.
Have you been waiting long?

396
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:42,283
No, I live around here.

397
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,283
Oh, Okay.

398
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:48,383
Are you going to move and work somewhere else?

399
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:54,383
Yes, but I don't want to move.
I want to finish this case first.

400
00:36:55,117 --> 00:36:56,917
So, have you given any orders yet?

401
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,670
Not yet.

402
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:03,183
Will the whole family move?

403
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,583
No, it's just that my father is worried
about the house.

404
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,483
My father and I believe that
my mother will come back.

405
00:37:16,223 --> 00:37:17,656
Can I have a menu, please?

406
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:29,751
Can you eat spicy food? I'll order it for you.

407
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:31,150
Oh, sure.

408
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,415
- Menu.
- Thank you.

409
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:43,140
I'll have this one.

410
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,140
Okay.

411
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:47,494

Okay.

413
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:50,478

414
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:53,883
That's all for now.

415
00:37:53,883 --> 00:37:54,392
Okay.

416
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:55,921
And two plates of plain rice.

417
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:56,561
Okay.

418
00:37:56,561 --> 00:37:57,561
Thank you.

419
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:04,383
So you're going to work there for a long time?

420
00:38:05,898 --> 00:38:12,239
I don't know. I'm just worried
about this job over here.

421
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,117
And I'm worried about my father too.

422
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,250
What about you?

423
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:23,388
I was planning to wait until things
are settled here, then I'll think about it.

424
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:27,695
Yes, thank you very much.

425
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:29,950
Your information has helped us a lot.

426
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:32,317
Excuse me.

427
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,270
Thank you.

428
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:45,583
Lawyer Win seems a serious person.

429
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:51,850
Sometimes, he's too serious.
He's unpredictable.

430
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:56,783
Please.

431
00:38:58,817 --> 00:38:59,817
Thank you.

432
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:05,374
Here it is.

433
00:39:05,374 --> 00:39:06,374
Thank you.

434
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:11,783
Excuse me, miss.

435
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:12,295
Yes.

436
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:14,712
Can I change this to seafood sauce?

437
00:39:14,712 --> 00:39:16,143
She's allergic to nuts.

438
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:17,662
Oh, okay. Just a moment.

439
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:18,662
Thank you.

440
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,285
How did you know I was allergic to nuts?

441
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,383
I've never told anyone.

442
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,250
How did you know?

443
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,717
I have something to take care of, okay?
Bye now.

444
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:09,127
Mom.

445
00:40:48,414 --> 00:40:52,150
Mom, is that you?

446
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,917
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

447
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,650
I'm sorry.

448
00:42:14,915 --> 00:42:19,850
Oh, okay. I'll go right now.

449
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:29,117
You know about my mom, right?

450
00:42:35,145 --> 00:42:39,885
You've known all along,
but you didn't tell me. Why are you doing this?

451
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:44,683
You're using everyone for revenge.
Even my mom.

452
00:42:45,553 --> 00:42:46,641
How could you do that?

453
00:42:50,854 --> 00:42:57,150
If something happens to my mom,
I will not forgive you.

454
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:00,676
Prao.

455
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:14,617
Hey, hurry up, hurry up.

456
00:43:14,617 --> 00:43:16,586
What are you doing dawdling?

457
00:43:16,586 --> 00:43:19,283
She'll be here soon. Come on, hurry up.

458
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:22,217
Come on, hurry up, do your stuff. Get ready.

459
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:27,883
There she is. Hurry up.

460
00:44:22,169 --> 00:44:25,095
Excuse me, did you see this woman
walking by here?

461
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,311
I didn't.

462
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:27,399
Thank you.

463
00:44:54,273 --> 00:44:57,850
When I was young, I had two best friends.

464
00:44:59,494 --> 00:45:01,550
We like to play with dollhouses.

465
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,317
We built our kingdom together.

466
00:45:07,317 --> 00:45:09,483
<i>This one is Ruetai's.</i>

467
00:45:10,283 --> 00:45:13,083
<i>This one is Nan's.</i>

468
00:45:14,987 --> 00:45:17,291
<i>And this is mine.</i>

469
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:29,883
<i>Why throw it away? He can protect us.</i>

470
00:45:30,806 --> 00:45:34,117
<i>You don't need it. Just the three of us
are enough.</i>

471
00:45:35,683 --> 00:45:38,250
We dream of building a good city.

472
00:45:39,818 --> 00:45:44,783
So, one of us is a lawyer

473
00:45:45,665 --> 00:45:47,617
to maintain justice.

474
00:45:47,617 --> 00:45:51,811
<i>Then, leave it outside the house
to take care of the city.</i>

475
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:55,587
<i>We will rule this city ourselves.
No need to bother anyone.</i>

476
00:45:55,587 --> 00:46:00,250
<i>Then, this city must have law and justice.</i>

477
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,650
<i>Alright, let's continue decorating the house.</i>

478
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,050
<i>Okay, here.</i>

479
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,050
Another one…

480
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,983
wanted to be a reporter.

481
00:46:16,317 --> 00:46:18,050
As for me, I've never told anyone.

482
00:46:20,883 --> 00:46:23,517
I want to rule the whole city.

483
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:38,350
Can you please get me the documents
in that envelope?

484
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:24,425
Excuse me, I wonder if you've seen
this woman walk past here.

485
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,199
No, I didn't see her.

486
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:26,554
Can you take a closer look?

487
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:27,898
No, there isn't.

488
00:47:28,806 --> 00:47:30,199
Excuse me.

489
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:31,031
Yes.

490
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:34,743
Have you ever seen this woman
walking around here?

491
00:47:34,743 --> 00:47:36,279
Uh… I've never seen her.

492
00:47:36,279 --> 00:47:38,199
Does she walked around here?

493
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:39,348
- I haven't seen her.
- I haven't seen her.

494
00:47:39,348 --> 00:47:40,500
Can you take a closer look?

495
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,460
Never.

496
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,479
Never seen her.

497
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:46,883
Excuse me.

498
00:47:47,517 --> 00:47:49,638
Have you ever seen this woman

499
00:47:49,638 --> 00:47:51,430
walking around here?

500
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,222
I've never seen her.

501
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,650
Thank you.

502
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,020
See?

503
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,550
I've always missed two of you.

504
00:49:18,024 --> 00:49:20,050
Why didn't you tell me when you came back here?

505
00:49:21,283 --> 00:49:22,283
Haruetai.

506
00:49:33,717 --> 00:49:35,217
Why did you come back here?

507
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,917
You're supposed to die.

508
00:49:40,717 --> 00:49:44,483
You came back, and you made
the people you loved suffer.

509
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:51,683
Do you realize that?

510
00:50:04,762 --> 00:50:08,250
I have to come back to protect my child.

511
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:11,898
I've suffered enough with this.

512
00:50:11,898 --> 00:50:15,450
No, you came back to hurt me.

513
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,050
Why?

514
00:50:17,783 --> 00:50:20,050
Even though I paid you for everything.

515
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,650
Take good care of your daughter.

516
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,450
And I'm about to make the city
we dreamed of as kids come true.

517
00:50:27,756 --> 00:50:30,083
I will never let anyone destroy it.

518
00:50:34,517 --> 00:50:37,917
You're so brave coming here and tricking her.

519
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:40,817
Do you want to die?

520
00:50:42,483 --> 00:50:45,150
I'm asking you, do you want to die?

521
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,750
Let me go, let me go.

522
00:51:14,786 --> 00:51:16,122
My mother is not dead.

523
00:51:16,764 --> 00:51:18,162
I will take this case for you

524
00:51:18,162 --> 00:51:19,624
<i>[Next Episode]</i>

525
00:51:19,624 --> 00:51:21,468
if you agree to help me.

526
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:27,999
When I'm about to do something,
I would think about the child a lot.

527
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,640
Are you like that, Prangthip?

528
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,218
Alright, continue with it.

529
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:34,546
