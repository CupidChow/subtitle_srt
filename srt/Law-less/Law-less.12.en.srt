<i>[Revoke the New Tulakham project]</i>

8
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,914
This project is my life.

9
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:23,481
I'm willing to give up my entire
Olarn Group for it.

10
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:26,657
Do you think I deserve this kind
of compensation? Your honor.

11
00:02:26,657 --> 00:02:29,414
The truth is, Olarn Group wasn't yours
in the first place.

12
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:35,653
We just return it to
its rightful owner, that's all.

13
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,204
These events happened

14
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:40,586
because Mayor Olarn ordered me to do so.

15
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:43,465
<i>I said that Mayor Olarn ordered me to do this.</i>

16
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:47,282
How did you know I was allergic to nuts?

17
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,430
I've never told anyone.

18
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,430
Bye now.

19
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:56,222
Why did you come back here?

20
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:57,795
You're supposed to die.

21
00:02:58,354 --> 00:02:59,939
Let me go! Let me go!

22
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,204
Let go of me!

23
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:09,850
Hey, hurry up! Hurry up!

24
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,747
What are you still dawdling around for?

25
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:14,864
She'll be here any minute. Come on, hurry up!

26
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:17,417
Come on, quickly arrange everything,
get it ready!

27
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:22,983
Oh, she's here! Hurry up!

28
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:20,335
Excuse me, did you see this woman
walking by here?

29
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:21,450
I didn't.

30
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,450
Thank you.

31
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,017
When I was young, I had two best friends.

32
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:56,750
We like to play with dollhouses.

33
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,415
We built our kingdom together.

34
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:04,817
<i>This one is Ruetai's.</i>

35
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:08,117
<i>This one is Nan's.</i>

36
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:12,488
<i>And this is mine.</i>

37
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,150
<i>Why throw it away? He can protect us.</i>

38
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:29,350
<i>You don't need it.
Just the three of us are enough.</i>

39
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,350
We dream of building a good city.

40
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:42,775
So, one of us is a lawyer to maintain justice.

41
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,999
<i>Then, leave it outside the house
to take care of the city.</i>

42
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:50,759
<i>We will rule this city ourselves.
No need to bother anyone.</i>

43
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,175
<i>Then, this city must have law and justice.</i>

44
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:58,801
<i>Alright, let's continue decorating the house.</i>

45
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:00,145
<i>OK, here.</i>

46
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,150
Another one…

47
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,083
wants to be a reporter.

48
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:13,217
As for me, I've never told anyone.

49
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:18,750
I want to rule the whole city.

50
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:33,517
Can you please get me
the documents in that envelope?

51
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:22,983
See? I've always missed two of you.

52
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:30,683
Why didn't you tell me
when you came back here, Haruetai?

53
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,683
Why did you come back here?

54
00:08:46,617 --> 00:08:48,317
You're supposed to die.

55
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:52,917
You came back, and you made
the people you loved suffer.

56
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:00,252
Do you realize that?

57
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,617
I have to come back to protect my child.

58
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,350
I've suffered enough with this.

59
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,178
No, you came back to hurt me. Why?

60
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:30,083
Even though I paid you for everything.

61
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:34,883
And I'm about to make the city
we dreamed of as kids come true.

62
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,705
I will never let anyone destroy it.

63
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,492
You're so brave coming here and tricking her.

64
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,372
Do you want to die?

65
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,725
I'm asking you, do you want to die?

66
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:00,383
Let me go! Let me go!

67
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:01,417
Let me go!

68
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,817
Don't do anything I haven't instructed.

69
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,450
I'm sorry, Madam.

70
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,283
Then how can I trust you?

71
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,985
When you were the one who brought her here.

72
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,734
Madam, I really don't know anything.

73
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:31,392
I swear, Madam.

74
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:35,017
Madam, I'm sorry, Madam.

75
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,083
Please, Madam.

76
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:42,127
You don't need to worry.
I'll handle this myself.

77
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:46,671
You know that when it's in my
hands, nothing will go wrong.

78
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:47,817
Please trust me, Madam.

79
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:50,983
You don't have to worry, Madam.

80
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,617
Please, Madam, please.

81
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:05,350
Let go! Let go!

82
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:15,350
You're very brave to deceive me,
to deceive the judge.

83
00:11:16,553 --> 00:11:19,050
Do you think no one knows your evil deeds?

84
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:21,683
Do you think you can escape the law?

85
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,683
And Chalinee won't trust you anymore.

86
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:33,750
Just wait and see who will go first, me or you.

87
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:39,390
Keep watch.

88
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,583
Don't lose sight of her and wait for my orders.

89
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,150
Yes.

90
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:10,517
Don't, open it. Open the door.

91
00:12:12,061 --> 00:12:13,383
Open it!

92
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,850
Open it!

93
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:38,050
Where is my mother? What have you done to her?

94
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,617
What's wrong with your mother?
I have no idea at all.

95
00:12:43,683 --> 00:12:44,983
Hey, Prao.

96
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:48,665
Your mother hasn't been around
for over ten years.

97
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,883
Prao, is something wrong?

98
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:58,583
Prao.

99
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:03,205
You need to accept the truth now.

100
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,750
That I am your family.

101
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:12,083
Family?

102
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:16,250
You can't possibly understand
what having a family means.

103
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,050
Because the people close to you
are just those under your power.

104
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:26,050
You will never understand what family is.

105
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,017
Tell me,

106
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:33,983
where did you keep my mother?
Why are you doing this?

107
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:38,425
Tell me, how could you do this
to my mother and me?

108
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:39,025
Prao, calm down.

109
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:40,475
Why are you doing this?

110
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:41,075
Prao, calm down.

111
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:43,106
Why are you doing this to me?

112
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:45,083
Prao, please calm down.

113
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,882
Tell me where my mother is!

114
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:48,117
Why are you doing this?

115
00:13:49,017 --> 00:13:51,750
Prao, Prao.

116
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:01,283
Prao, can you calm down?

117
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,850
Prao.

118
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,050
You don't have to worry.

119
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,017
I will help you find your mother.

120
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,031
You don't need to help me.

121
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:11,117
To you,

122
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:13,883
Everyone is just a tool.

123
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,483
You are no different from Judge Chalinee.

124
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,050
For now, I will try to find a way to help you.

125
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:40,717
But the one involved in this is Mangpong.

126
00:14:40,717 --> 00:14:42,383
He just got out of prison not long ago.

127
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,783
And he's the one who stabbed
Lawyer Boripat in jail too.

128
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,417
With evidence this solid,
Mr. Olarn will definitely not get away.

129
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,683
But don't underestimate it.

130
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,717
Also, contact Editor Harn
about the press release.

131
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,617
OK.

132
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,745
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

133
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,317
Judge, you really don't know
about Prao Chanok's mother?

134
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,378
Are you trying to force me to know about this?

135
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:42,817
I'm sorry, but I don't know.

136
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:48,350
In that case, I think you should be careful.

137
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,850
Mr. Olarn may be struggling to do something.

138
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:55,150
Don't forget who he used to be.

139
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:56,917
And what he knows.

140
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:05,983
Why should a judge be afraid of a criminal?

141
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:10,617
It's good not to be afraid.

142
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:13,550
But I want to assure you

143
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,450
that I will find Prao's mother no matter what.

144
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:27,550
Hurry up, please.

145
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:19,612
You're here alone, huh?

146
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,383
I want to talk to you about my mother.

147
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:35,283
How would I know about your mother?

148
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:37,350
You definitely know.

149
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,183
My mother worked at the judge's house,
and now she's missing.

150
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,217
My mother is not dead.

151
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:56,450
I will take this case for you
if you agree to help me.

152
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,750
Prao.

153
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:37,050
Don't go anywhere alone. I'm worried.

154
00:18:37,823 --> 00:18:39,817
About your mother, I promise I will help you.

155
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:43,783
Don't bother me. You can go back now.

156
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:45,843
Prao, Prao.

157
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:47,183
I told you to go back now.

158
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:52,317
Prao.

159
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:54,883
Prao.

160
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,850
Prao.

161
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,050
Prao.

162
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,083
If you can fix it, I'll buy you coffee.

163
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,108
Hey.

164
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:03,783
No way.

165
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:04,583
Yeah.

166
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,897
How could it be opened?

167
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:06,897
- Hey.
- Hey.

168
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:12,450
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

169
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,261
Tan.

170
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:14,417
Take me to see Mangpong.

171
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:18,503
Tan.

172
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:24,950
I'll take you myself.

173
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,750
I want to see Mek.

174
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,683
You caused my boss to die,
and you still dare to come back?

175
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:00,450
Are you the one who took my mother away?

176
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,078
Where did you take her? Tell me.

177
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:03,650
Hey, what's going on?

178
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,698
You guys just stand there? Get them out.

179
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:10,097
Go, go, go!

180
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,606
Go!

181
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,417
Go!

182
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,745
This isn't over between us.

183
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:25,104
We will definitely meet again.

184
00:21:25,104 --> 00:21:26,843
Yeah, I'll be waiting.

185
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:48,394
Take care of the foundation accounts properly;

186
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,917
the rest goes into Aeri's account.

187
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:52,752
Thank you, Madam.

188
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:55,617
So, how should we deal with Haruetai?

189
00:21:57,222 --> 00:22:00,705
You brought her here.
I have nothing to do with it.

190
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:10,485
Aeri is the one who will take my place
in the future.

191
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:15,432
Think carefully about what you're going to do.

192
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:44,883
<i>I happened to have the chance
to go to the port.</i>

193
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,450
<i>I thought I would meet the Mayor.</i>

194
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,550
Instead,

195
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,083
I met some thugs sitting there as gang leaders.

196
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:56,850
There's someone else taking over.
You have no money and power.

197
00:22:57,817 --> 00:23:00,873
How long can you hold on
to the Mayor's position like this?

198
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:25,783
I'm very pleased.

199
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:28,883
To be developing this city together
with the Chalinee Foundation.

200
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,123
Take a photo. Take lots of photos.

201
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:36,250
Ah, this picture must be kept for the news.

202
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,012
Take lots of photos. Go ahead, let's do it.

203
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:12,883
They can't take this project from us.

204
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,517
As long as I'm with her,
the money will still go to me anyway.

205
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,417
As for you, just focus on saving your own skin.

206
00:24:51,183 --> 00:24:52,517
I still can't find Shin.

207
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,550
And what that Lawyer Win said, is it true?

208
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,950
Yes, it is.

209
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,583
Mek is gathering his crew at the fish market.

210
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:49,950
Turn slowly, just slowly.

211
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,450
Shin.

212
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,683
I'm sorry. Please don't do anything to me, sir.

213
00:26:03,683 --> 00:26:06,261
I'm sorry, sir. Please don't do anything to me.

214
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:08,817
Again? Are you serious?

215
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,425
Huh, Shin?

216
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:13,325
I don't know what to do anymore, sir.
I'm sorry.

217
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:14,731
Please don't do anything to me.

218
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,338
Sorry?

219
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:26,583
Yes, Madam.

220
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:29,583
What are you planning?

221
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,083
Nothing, Madam.

222
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,383
Where is Olarn right now?

223
00:26:44,076 --> 00:26:45,250
If I had a child…

224
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:50,550
When I'm about to do something,
I would think about the child a lot.

225
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,883
Are you like that, Prangthip?

226
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,017
Yes, Madam.

227
00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:03,117
Madam.

228
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:05,783
I will never turn my back on you
like Olarn did.

229
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,517
And whatever you ask me to do,

230
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:10,350
I will handle everything for you.

231
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,552
I will make sure Haruetai disappears forever.

232
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:33,917
You are the one Prem brought along, right?

233
00:27:41,183 --> 00:27:43,175
<i>Thank you for coming to see me, brother.</i>

234
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:44,519
<i>If you have something to say, just say it.</i>

235
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,050
<i>Mek is the one who betrayed Uncle.</i>

236
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,012
<i>Mek is working for Chalinee.</i>

237
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,415
<i>How can you be so sure?</i>

238
00:27:53,415 --> 00:27:55,859
<i>The one who brought Uncle here
is Mek's subordinate.</i>

239
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:58,050
<i>And he tried to kill me at the hospital.</i>

240
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,205
Please don't do anything to me.

241
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:29,096
<i>[Court of Tulakham]</i>

242
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:50,350
<i>It's been a hot topic
for former mayor Olarn Khamphithak.</i>

243
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,550
<i>The prosecutor has submitted
the indictment already.</i>

244
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,817
<i>But the former Mayor Olarn
has not reported himself.</i>

245
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:00,750
<i>Recently, a warrant for his arrest
has been issued.</i>

246
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,117
<i>But what the details will be,
let's hear it from the prosecutor.</i>

247
00:29:26,617 --> 00:29:30,561
So, have you found Praochanok's mother?

248
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,383
Do you still think I hid her?

249
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:34,417
Don't worry.

250
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:39,283
I'm confident that I will definitely
find Praochanok's mother.

251
00:29:39,283 --> 00:29:41,683
You will never take
Praochanok's mother away again.

252
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,583
Don't be too confident.

253
00:30:29,783 --> 00:30:30,964
<i>Excuse me, miss.</i>

254
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:33,012
<i>Can I change this to seafood sauce, please?</i>

255
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:34,420
<i>Because she's allergic to nuts.</i>

256
00:30:34,923 --> 00:30:36,852
<i>How did you know that I'm allergic to nuts?</i>

257
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:41,550
<i>I have something to take care of, okay?
Bye now.</i>

258
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:52,017
<i>Mom, do you know how long
I've been waiting for you?</i>

259
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:54,450
<i>I'm sorry, dear.</i>

260
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,859
<i>Excuse me, have you seen…</i>

261
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:03,725
<i>I haven't seen her.</i>

262
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:04,819
<i>- Excuse me.
- Yes.</i>

263
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,117
<i>Have you ever seen this woman?</i>

264
00:31:06,117 --> 00:31:07,450
<i>I've never seen her.</i>

265
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,436
<i>- No, I haven't.
- I've never seen her, no.</i>

266
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:09,683
<i>I've never seen her at all.</i>

267
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,683
<i>Where did you take my mom?
Why are you doing this?</i>

268
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:19,089
<i>Tell me, how could you do this
to my mom and me? Just tell me!</i>

269
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,066
Get up, get up!

270
00:31:56,553 --> 00:32:01,050
I wanted you dead 18 years ago.
Why won't you just die?

271
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:06,225
This time, you will definitely die as you wish.

272
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,517
Make her disappear.

273
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:19,652
But the judge hasn't ordered it yet.

274
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:22,550
I'm the judge's representative.

275
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:25,917
Whatever I order you to do, you must do it.

276
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,583
Yes.

277
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:39,050
- Oops.
- Oops, me too.

278
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,117
Let's go, Tan.

279
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:47,443
Tan.

280
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:48,485
Yes.

281
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:50,517
Where are you going? Where?

282
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:09,517
I will take this case for you
if you agree to help me.

283
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:15,195
Go, Kom.

284
00:33:15,998 --> 00:33:16,998
Yes, sir.

285
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,717
I hope you're satisfied with this agreement.

286
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,309
Yes.

287
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:04,109
- Get up.
- Let go of me, let go!

288
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:04,983
Go!

289
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:05,783
Let me go!

290
00:34:05,783 --> 00:34:06,783
Go!

291
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:09,184
Let go!

292
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:15,017
Hey! Stop! Wait for Mek first.

293
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,483
What should we do next, bro?

294
00:34:37,151 --> 00:34:38,517
Stick to the plan.

295
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:39,583
Go!

296
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:02,050
Alright, continue with it.

297
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:03,593
Yes.

298
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,750
Get up.

299
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,150
Let go! Let go!

300
00:35:08,717 --> 00:35:10,550
Boss, Olarn is coming!

301
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,550
Let go!

302
00:35:12,983 --> 00:35:13,983
Finish the job properly.

303
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:18,183
Come help!

304
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:21,583
Let me go!

305
00:35:23,017 --> 00:35:24,017
Let go!

306
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,917
Let me go!

307
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:28,250
Let me go! Let me go!

308
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:53,883
Release the woman.

309
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,463
Who's trying to show off around here?

310
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:24,417
I built Tulakham with my own hands.

311
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,292
You think you're just
going to take it that easily?

312
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:33,898
Where's the woman?

313
00:36:38,383 --> 00:36:39,795
Send the woman out!

314
00:36:39,795 --> 00:36:42,550
What woman? What are you talking about?

315
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:45,483
Send her out!

316
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:06,217
I'll tell you the truth.

317
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,517
The judge is using you.

318
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:12,650
Soon enough, you'll end up
in no better condition than I am.

319
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,217
You might as well join me.

320
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:30,150
Kom.

321
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,681
Yes?

322
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:31,685
Hey!

323
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:13,717
Don't!

324
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:17,250
Hey! Don't!

325
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:23,934
Oh, man!

326
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:36,817
You're too old to manage this city, Olarn.

327
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,183
I'm sorry if I startled you.

328
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:07,817
I will take you to see Prao myself.

329
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:10,850
<i>Get out right here.</i>

330
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,950
Have you dealt with Olarn yet?

331
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:49,283
Olarn didn't come to the summons.

332
00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:52,283
So I issued a warrant for the police
to go after him.

333
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:10,917
<i>Make her disappear.</i>

334
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:20,517
<i>Whatever I order you to do, you must do.</i>

335
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:34,783
I will urgently issue a warrant for Prangthip.

336
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,083
She's looking for someone
to carry on her ideals.

337
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,783
So I want your future to be the brightest.

338
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:14,181
This is the warrant for the contract killing
of the employee from Korea.

339
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:16,012
Please come to the police station with us.

340
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:19,340
What the hell are you guys? Are you crazy?

341
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,650
You know who I am.

342
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:24,850
And this is my daughter.
She's a prosecutor named Erika.

343
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,083
And I'm the secretary to the judge.

344
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:30,983
Yes, please.

345
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:32,229
Take her to the police station.

346
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:35,109
You don't have to arrest me.
I can walk there myself.

347
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:38,083
Aeri, please help me.

348
00:42:03,945 --> 00:42:06,333
<i>[six hours ago]</i>

349
00:42:08,437 --> 00:42:09,650
<i>Are you done, Shin?</i>

350
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:12,450
<i>I'm done.</i>

351
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:08,650
Olarn has escaped.

352
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,317
Escaped?

353
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,417
Don't worry, Madam.
I'll pressure him through the news.

354
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:36,683
Is that true?

355
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:14,383
Am I dreaming or something?

356
00:44:17,062 --> 00:44:18,650
I have come back to see you.

357
00:45:00,768 --> 00:45:02,834
I've always believed that you'd come back.

358
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:12,117
Mom asked Uncle of Lawyer Win
to help me get into Chalinee's house.

359
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,416
And begged him to keep this a secret.

360
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,309
I'm sorry, dear.

361
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,878
He did everything you asked.

362
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:33,696
Lawyer Win is just like his mother.

363
00:45:34,517 --> 00:45:36,183
He carries everything by himself.

364
00:45:38,517 --> 00:45:40,972
Lawyer Win does everything to protect you.

365
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,009
But can I hug you tightly for a long time?

366
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:50,617
Of course.

367
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,717
I'm not going anywhere anymore, OK?

368
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:54,789
Promise?

369
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:55,883
I promise.

370
00:46:03,557 --> 00:46:05,983
So, are you a good girl for Dad?

371
00:46:06,949 --> 00:46:09,383
I have never been naughty.
It's just Dad who is naughty.

372
00:46:09,383 --> 00:46:11,883
You boast a lot.

373
00:46:29,683 --> 00:46:31,252
Thank you very much, everyone.

374
00:46:33,197 --> 00:46:34,645
I appreciate you too, brother.

375
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:37,665
I can do anything for my boss.

376
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,450
Thank you.

377
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:05,217
Do you know who sent me the flash drive?
It was Chalinee.

378
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,217
She wants to borrow my hand
to wipe out her partners.

379
00:47:13,845 --> 00:47:18,050
You should take a break from
other matters, especially when you're with me.

380
00:48:05,451 --> 00:48:09,227
Bro, next time it's going to be fun like this.

381
00:48:09,227 --> 00:48:12,868
If there's no Yorch, Yorch will be sulking.
Do you understand, bro?

382
00:48:12,868 --> 00:48:13,820
We should be part of it too.

383
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,917
- Yes.
- With jam too.

384
00:48:18,832 --> 00:48:21,050
Hey, do you think Olarn will run away?

385
00:48:23,883 --> 00:48:26,283
Someone like Olarn won't escape
from this city for sure.

386
00:48:47,517 --> 00:48:50,883
But if you drag my mother into this
or do anything without telling me again,

387
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:53,820
I'll make sure you're dead.

388
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:57,117
End up dead, just like that, bro.

389
00:48:59,956 --> 00:49:03,917
Everyone remembers that
Lawyer Prao's mother is dead.

390
00:49:05,524 --> 00:49:09,483
Chalinee is borrowing our hands
to eliminate those around her.

391
00:49:10,783 --> 00:49:15,283
So we will use these people
to get rid of Chalinee as well.

392
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,465
I want to ask you again.

393
00:49:24,386 --> 00:49:26,083
Do you know this employee from Korea?

394
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:29,583
I don't know.

395
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:30,850
You better tell the truth.

396
00:49:34,017 --> 00:49:35,317
<i>Make her disappear.</i>

397
00:49:35,983 --> 00:49:37,017
You can't get away with it.

398
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:43,683
I want to use the phone.

399
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,883
Madam, you have to help me.

400
00:50:06,783 --> 00:50:09,783
Listen to Lawyer Koson. He can help her.

401
00:50:11,006 --> 00:50:14,654
<i>I'm having Prosecutor Charoen
find a way to assist you.</i>

402
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:28,617
Based on the evidence we have,
Prangthip won't escape for sure.

403
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:39,850
Thank you very much for the flash drive.

404
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,150
I'm going to follow your game.

405
00:50:45,016 --> 00:50:48,217
And the last one
I'm going to drag into jail is you.

406
00:50:51,818 --> 00:50:54,983
I still can't think of a way
for you to defeat me.

407
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:03,231
Do you mean the desire to protect others?

408
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,783
You've already proven that you can never do it.

409
00:51:10,383 --> 00:51:11,758
I have something you don't have.

410
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:15,432
And it's something you've never
received from anyone.

411
00:51:19,258 --> 00:51:24,183
If you mean love, you're really naive.

412
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:29,750
And I admit that there's one thing
that has exceeded expectations.

413
00:51:30,648 --> 00:51:34,983
The fact that Praochanok
chose to stand by you, not me.

414
00:51:40,817 --> 00:51:44,317
But that love will become your weakness.

415
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:53,983
You're really pathetic.

416
00:52:03,483 --> 00:52:07,183
<i>We will govern this city ourselves,
we don't need anyone to interfere.</i>

417
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,883
<i>I want to govern the entire city.</i>

418
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:58,315
My mom said all the foundation documents are still with her.
<i>[Next Episode]</i>

419
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,146
So what's your point?

420
00:53:01,172 --> 00:53:06,123
It would be better if you looked for a way
to persuade your mother to confess.

421
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:08,489
The heavy penalty may become lighter.

422
00:53:10,018 --> 00:53:11,771
I know you don't trust us.

423
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,896
For us to help you,

424
00:53:14,896 --> 00:53:16,782
you need to say you didn't
decide this on your own.

425
00:53:16,782 --> 00:53:18,210
Someone else ordered you.
