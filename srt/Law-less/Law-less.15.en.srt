5
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:06,117
I propose to dismiss the judge.

6
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,179
I would like to present evidence to everyone.
<i>[Previous Episode]</i>

7
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,195
This is a thirty-million-baht house,
invaded in the National Park area.

8
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:17,086
I propose we suspend the trial.

9
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:19,445
We should investigate the judge first.

10
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:23,351
Here's the list.

11
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:26,961
The information is connecting all your crimes.

12
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:28,712
Someone sent this information to me.

13
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:31,770
And there is only one person
who knows this deeply.

14
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:35,195
Do you think we will lose?

15
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:37,101
I haven't said we would lose yet.

16
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:39,180
But the implication is that we'll lose.

17
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,695
So, you're going to put
the entire burden on me?

18
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:44,945
But if you two don't resolve anything,

19
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:48,742
I'll have to reconsider your roles completely.

20
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:54,648
Let's meet up so we can have
a proper discussion.

21
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:58,492
Well then, let's meet at home. We should talk.

22
00:02:58,492 --> 00:02:59,570
Don't play tricks.

23
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:10,550
Yesterday's court hearing must have
kept Chalinee on the edge of her seat.

24
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:14,350
Look at her facial muscles, all tensed up.

25
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:21,117
But next time, it might not
turn out as we expect.

26
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:24,983
Why's that?

27
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:28,650
Prangthip might not testify as we instructed.

28
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:43,617
<i>What?</i>

29
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:45,417
Did you hear about yesterday?

30
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,517
Yes, I did.

31
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:50,617
<i>Prangthip is still hesitating right now.</i>

32
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:52,750
<i>I don't know if she will dare
mention Chalinee's name.</i>

33
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,853
As for me, I'm requesting a cancellation
of the arrest warrant from the prosecutor.

34
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:58,005
Get ready.

35
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,583
<i>Well then, let's meet at home. We should talk.</i>

36
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:48,950
I can't believe I'm back in this house.

37
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:50,679
Let's get down to business.

38
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:54,383
Why the rush?

39
00:04:56,783 --> 00:05:00,450
You weren't like this when using others.

40
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,950
I'm not in a hurry.

41
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,217
The New Tulakham Project.

42
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:11,917
I conceived it. I designed it.

43
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,617
I struggled to get people
to sell their land to create this new city.

44
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,217
Why did you give it to someone else?

45
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:36,450
How can I be sure?

46
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:42,417
That you'll continue to act
in the best interests of my father and me?

47
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:58,217
You know how serious I am about this.

48
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:06,483
I would die for it.

49
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:13,850
You hear me? I'd die for it.

50
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:22,350
Your duty is to protect me.

51
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:49,817
No need, let him go.

52
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,350
Understood.

53
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:19,815
<i>[Lawyer Boripat]</i>

54
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:26,042
Hello?

55
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:27,042
Hello.

56
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:30,583
I have a crucial witness
I'd like to bring to court next time.

57
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:35,350
Good, bring them along.

58
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:38,236
But you need to lift the arrest warrant first.

59
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:42,850
Oh, bring him along.

60
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:46,917
So he can testify and we can wrap it all up.
We don't want to waste any more time.

61
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:52,925
No. Without the warrant lifted, he won't come.

62
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,150
I'm being honest here.

63
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,783
I'm not anyone's tool for revenge.

64
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:05,017
That's why, Lawyer,
you need to find another way.

65
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,350
We'd like to congratulate you.

66
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,375
On our new page.

67
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,450
"Chalinee Fairy: Goddess of Justice."

68
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,785
Wow, the likes are soaring!

69
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:16,683
Didn't I tell you?

70
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,637
That all the confidence
in this city's investments…

71
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,350
Doesn't rely on resources.

72
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,650
But on you.

73
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:34,517
Because everything I've done is for Tulakham.

74
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:38,558
It's what allowed the people here
to accept me so readily.

75
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:42,759
I'm sorry. I think this whole thing.

76
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:46,759
The judge's decision on
the New Tulakham project.

77
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,825
The townspeople must wholeheartedly agree.

78
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:58,250
Cheers!

79
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:19,250
Hello, prosecutor Arnat.

80
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:25,050
If you're going to have me
lift the arrest warrant for Olarn, then…

81
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,850
No.

82
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,050
Because Lawyer Boripat already called me once.

83
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,650
That's part of it.

84
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,117
But I want you to meet someone.

85
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,483
This is my mother.

86
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:00,350
Hello.

87
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,535
<i>Lawyer Boripat's mother's case…
[Subject, Missing person]</i>

88
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:23,650
<i>And Lawyer Praochanok's mother's case.</i>

89
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,417
<i>These two cases happened on the same day.</i>

90
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:32,176
<i>[Report missing person on 18 June B.E.2549
Name, Chawanan Preechachai]</i>

91
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,117
<i>These two are up to something together.</i>

92
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,873
This means…

93
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:44,550
Please keep this a secret.

94
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:48,965
Because we need to take down
the main culprit first.

95
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:51,617
By using Olarn as a witness.

96
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:26,717
What?

97
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:29,050
<i>Your warrant has been lifted.</i>

98
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,117
That's good.

99
00:12:34,783 --> 00:12:36,483
I'm so tired of the sea.

100
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:10,381
Are you crazy?

101
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,030
How did you manage to get
Olarn's warrant dropped?

102
00:13:15,203 --> 00:13:17,123
The evidence wasn't sufficient.

103
00:13:17,635 --> 00:13:19,683
Then how could we issue
an arrest warrant in the first place?

104
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:20,917
But I'm in charge here.

105
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,383
At least the files on the election funding.

106
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:26,283
We've got him dead to rights.

107
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,950
And where did you get this from?

108
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,450
I can't disclose my source.

109
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,983
You can't disclose?

110
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:37,250
Listen, Charoen.

111
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,383
No one should use the law for their benefit.

112
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,183
As long as I am on duty.

113
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:45,983
But this is Tulakham.

114
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:50,250
You know too little about this place.

115
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,117
<i>From Tulakham's growth until
it became a special administrative province.</i>

116
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:12,583
<i>We're delighted to have individuals
who have greatly contributed to our Tulakham.</i>

117
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:16,850
<i>Let's announce the names of the individuals
who have contributed to Tulakham this time.</i>

118
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,983
<i>Namely, our judge, Judge Chalinee Sritulwong.</i>

119
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,750
Where should we go, sir?

120
00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:56,250
Anywhere but here.

121
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,417
Let's change the scenery.

122
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,217
It's good to think that we can go anywhere now.

123
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:30,983
Hey.

124
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,450
<i>It's time to be a witness now.</i>

125
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:38,617
I don't want to do anything anymore.

126
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:41,150
Let me go my own way.

127
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:43,683
Hey, no!

128
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:45,850
This is important to the people of Tulakham.

129
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:52,945
I guess I don't belong in this town anymore.

130
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:02,983
Brother.

131
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:09,250
Mek has disappeared.

132
00:16:48,183 --> 00:16:49,983
Let's start the trial.

133
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,583
Please allow Ms. Prangthip Phongpinij
to testify.

134
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:09,250
<i>I called you here…</i>

135
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,250
<i>Because I have several things to discuss.</i>

136
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,217
<i>I have many questions about you
swirling in my head.</i>

137
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:22,083
<i>Anything else you need to talk to me about?</i>

138
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:29,317
<i>About you becoming an adopted child
of the judge.</i>

139
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:39,150
<i>I think you know her better than I do.</i>

140
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:44,350
<i>But I don't want you to become
that kind of person.</i>

141
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:52,217
<i>Reconsider carefully.</i>

142
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:42,583
Let the defendant give her testimony.

143
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:12,883
On that day, I-I really went there.

144
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,250
But someone instructed me.

145
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:34,250
I-I…

146
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,069
Let the defendant testify.

147
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:43,717
I…

148
00:19:57,684 --> 00:20:01,204
Mom, Mom, Mom.

149
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,383
Let's adjourn the hearing.

150
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:06,217
Mom.

151
00:20:06,883 --> 00:20:07,883
Please don't come in.

152
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,750
Mom.

153
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,150
You follow Prangthip.

154
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,592
Let's go, Tan.

155
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:23,592
Yes.

156
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:49,750
<i>You don't know who I am, do you?</i>

157
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,717
<i>I know, but I can't close the shrine
if you don't go.</i>

158
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:57,317
<i>I'll be late for work
at the rice soup shop and the fish pier.</i>

159
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:05,911
<i>Is that enough?</i>

160
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:09,883
<i>It's more than just washing dishes
at the rice soup shop.</i>

161
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:11,517
<i>Or sitting sorting fish all night.</i>

162
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,924
<i>Thank you.</i>

163
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:21,683
<i>Tulakham needs young people to help develop.</i>

164
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:23,850
<i>Come work with me today.</i>

165
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:33,250
I choose myself.

166
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:39,450
It's time I accepted the consequences.

167
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:20,883
Time to replace the old dog, huh?

168
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:32,786
Shin!

169
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:40,733
Shin!

170
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:51,383
Shin, Shin, hey, it's alright.

171
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:53,983
It's alright. Don't worry, okay?

172
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:57,866
I'm glad to serve you.

173
00:23:57,866 --> 00:24:00,317
Hey, don't talk so much, go.

174
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,383
Protect Tulakham, alright?

175
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,140
Shin.

176
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:25,250
Shin!

177
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,057
Is this how you all gang up on someone?
That's pathetic.

178
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,050
That's enough.

179
00:24:57,117 --> 00:24:58,117
Enough, sir.

180
00:25:15,784 --> 00:25:17,150
Thank you for coming to help.

181
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:19,083
You're welcome.

182
00:25:20,307 --> 00:25:21,850
I can't allow them to kill you.

183
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,083
Go, go.

184
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,850
Stay put.

185
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,400
Stay still, stay still.

186
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,850
- Get up, get up!
- Get up, get up!

187
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:33,183
Get in the car.

188
00:26:58,814 --> 00:26:59,950
Why are you helping me?

189
00:27:01,683 --> 00:27:03,483
You want me dead, don't you?

190
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:06,278
Yes.

191
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,150
But you have to die by my hand.

192
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:17,250
The opportunity is here, take it.

193
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:25,583
I will make you a living dead
for what you've done.

194
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:37,217
You think I'll feel remorse? Huh?

195
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:39,950
And live with the guilt until I die.

196
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,617
What a hero.

197
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:51,383
Let's hope I'll be alive until that day.

198
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,992
At least now you know.

199
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:58,250
That what you've been doing is wrong.

200
00:28:07,475 --> 00:28:08,883
Thank you for your help.

201
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,583
Hello, Madam.

202
00:28:17,998 --> 00:28:19,050
<i>Everything alright?</i>

203
00:28:19,822 --> 00:28:22,483
Yes, Madam. I've taken care of Shin.

204
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:23,983
But…

205
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:25,017
<i>But what?</i>

206
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:29,450
Lawyer Win saved Olarn.

207
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,517
And the police arrested everyone,
including Mek.

208
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:33,917
I'm the only one who escaped.

209
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:39,183
Madam, Madam.

210
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:40,986
<i>Madam.</i>

211
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,017
<i>Your honor.</i>

212
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:44,883
Turn yourself in.

213
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:46,683
But… Madam.

214
00:28:47,353 --> 00:28:49,483
<i>Let the police arrest you.</i>

215
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:51,425
Trust me.

216
00:28:54,747 --> 00:28:55,747
Yes, Madam.

217
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:11,720
You, you believe me.

218
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
The truth is the truth.

219
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,283
No matter how you try to avoid it,
the truth will come out.

220
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:20,450
You know too little about Chalinee.

221
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,183
Don't forget that I've been with her
for half my life.

222
00:29:25,183 --> 00:29:27,050
This woman can do anything.

223
00:29:27,758 --> 00:29:31,517
And you'll let the whole city
face this forever?

224
00:29:33,783 --> 00:29:34,917
You can help them.

225
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,743
What? Did you find him?

226
00:29:50,743 --> 00:29:53,483
Yes, just as they were ganging up.

227
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,517
<i>Olarn survived, but Shin didn't.</i>

228
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:01,850
<i>They took care of Shin before we got there.</i>

229
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,976
I think if this is how things are going.

230
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,317
They probably won't leave it for long.

231
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:15,417
<i>Be careful.</i>

232
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:18,217
You too.

233
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,526
Yes.

234
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,183
Olarn's been taken care of.

235
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,983
A wicked man like him, it's best he's dead.

236
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:37,439
Not yet.

237
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:40,279
But if we don't hurry and handle this.

238
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:44,183
Olarn, me, and you might not survive.

239
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:50,850
As everyone knows.

240
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,783
The media is a powerful tool Chalinee
uses to guide the people of Tulakham.

241
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:58,417
We need to find a way to use this tool…

242
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,783
to deal with Chalinee.

243
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:08,624
Brother.

244
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,683
It seems we're a step behind them.

245
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,383
They've already spread everything.

246
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,183
That Prangthip falsely used Chalinee's name
to commit a crime.

247
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:23,817
It's all meant to suggest that what Prangthip…

248
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:27,117
said to expose Judge Chalinee, isn't credible.

249
00:31:34,264 --> 00:31:35,917
There's another page.

250
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:38,488
It's posting exposes on
Lawyer Win and Prao as well.

251
00:31:38,488 --> 00:31:42,725
It exposes that Lawyer Win is a lawyer
who works for the mafia in town.

252
00:31:42,725 --> 00:31:45,517
Win was sent to destroy Judge Chalinee.

253
00:31:45,517 --> 00:31:48,450
Because Chalinee interfered
with the mafia's interests.

254
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,417
But this is the strongest one.

255
00:31:53,117 --> 00:31:54,717
It accuses Lawyer Prao.

256
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:01,450
It accuses Lawyer Prao
of betraying Chalinee, who supported her.

257
00:32:13,923 --> 00:32:17,235
<i>[Lawyer Prao has betrayed
Judge Chalinee for the sake of a man]</i>

258
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:23,517
Enough. Everyone, no need to read any further.

259
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,650
They're going hard.

260
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:30,821
Hey, Hook.

261
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:31,517
Yes?

262
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:34,083
Can you check? I wonder if these guys
are fake accounts.

263
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:34,808
Check.

264
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:37,417
I'll take care of it, bro,
but give me a moment.

265
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:38,013
Yeah.

266
00:32:38,013 --> 00:32:39,101
Let's check it out.

267
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:39,717
Hey.

268
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:42,217
Wok, Muek.

269
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:43,150
Yes?

270
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,183
Let's prepare to raid their lair.

271
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:53,817
They're using the media to attack us.

272
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:57,583
Then we must use the media to get our revenge.

273
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,850
And it must be more popular than Editor Harn.

274
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:08,383
This is our last chance.

275
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:12,717
Our stake is Tulakham.

276
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:23,650
She guarantees that
if we testify as instructed, we'll all survive.

277
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:30,317
Are you sure we won't get played?

278
00:33:30,317 --> 00:33:31,617
I'm still confused.

279
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:35,017
How did the police know?
It's like someone tipped them off.

280
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:38,283
No, you're overthinking.

281
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,850
Hey, what are you guys doing?

282
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:45,417
Nothing, sir.

283
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,550
I happened to meet an old friend,
so we're catching up.

284
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:54,317
An old friend? You want to meet
some new ones too?

285
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:01,926
We're screwed.

286

You talk so nicely. You just want revenge.

That you aren't inherently bad.

destroy this city for herself.

00:41:45,982 --> 00:41:49,717

00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,650
Why?

357
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:20,535
Love?

358
00:42:24,048 --> 00:42:27,696
If you still love her, you must stop her.

359
00:42:27,696 --> 00:42:30,317
Stop her from doing anything worse.

360
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:35,683
It's time you helped her fix her mistakes.

361
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:41,683
It's gone too far, nothing can be fixed.

362
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:48,250
I'd rather die here.

363
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,350
That's the best.

364
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,882
Why did you bring me here?

365
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,690
Are you going to lure me to kill me?

366
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,250
How did you know? If you know, just be quiet.

367
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,917
Okay, good. You ran here just in time.

368
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:28,217
<i>Mr. Vichuthep, are you sure?</i>

369
00:43:28,217 --> 00:43:31,583
<i>Can you make my online lottery
platform popular?</i>

370
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:37,634
<i>Yes.</i>

371
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:42,394
<i>If I mention any product or service
on the "Tam Tueng Tee" show,</i>

372
00:43:42,394 --> 00:43:44,550
<i>it will sell like hotcakes.</i>

373
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:46,859
<i>Great.</i>

374
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,117
<i>If you say it like that, I feel at ease.</i>

375
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:52,689
<i>Hey, take good care of him.</i>

376
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:54,632
<i>Oh, he's going to make me rich.</i>

377
00:44:03,645 --> 00:44:05,350
<i>I'll go to the bathroom for a bit.</i>

378
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,211
<i>Be right back.</i>

379
00:44:16,211 --> 00:44:20,017
<i>Take your time. No need to rush.</i>

380
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:54,183
<i>Hey, hey, what are you doing?</i>

381
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:55,985
<i>What?</i>

382
00:44:57,265 --> 00:45:01,383
<i>I never thought a celebrity would be like this.</i>

383
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:03,817
<i>We need to expose this.</i>

384
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:06,083
<i>People on social media need to see this clip.</i>

385
00:45:18,493 --> 00:45:22,650
<i>Easy, let's talk this through.</i>

386
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,250
Tell me what you want me to do.

387
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,217
But don't do anything to me.

388
00:45:36,242 --> 00:45:39,050
You've been using the media power
in your hands to serve the wicked.

389
00:45:40,945 --> 00:45:44,883
It's time you use it to save this city.

390
00:45:46,608 --> 00:45:47,683
How?

391
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:00,185
Hello viewers.

392
00:46:01,183 --> 00:46:05,217
Today, I bring you to
the breathtaking scenery of Phi Phluk Cliff.

393
00:46:06,545 --> 00:46:08,450
The name sounds scary.

394
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,983
But it has the most beautiful view in town.

395
00:46:13,585 --> 00:46:15,717
<i>Today, I'm introducing someone.</i>

396
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:19,417
<i>You'll be saying "wow" when you see him.</i>

397
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:24,183
<i>Many are wondering where he's been.</i>

398
00:46:28,029 --> 00:46:30,183
<i>Hello, dear people of Tulakham.</i>

399
00:46:31,565 --> 00:46:34,483
Today I won't shoot any questions.

400
00:46:35,341 --> 00:46:38,683
I'll let you speak your mind.

401
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:41,250
Please.

402
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:50,050
I apologize for disappearing or running away.

403
00:46:56,455 --> 00:46:58,283
But from now on, I won't run anymore.

404
00:46:59,362 --> 00:47:03,283
<i>I really wanted to disappear.</i>

405
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,283
Because of everything that's been happening.

406
00:47:08,021 --> 00:47:12,517
But I just realized I can't go anywhere yet.

407
00:47:15,683 --> 00:47:23,083
Because the one I love is in danger.

408
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:30,783
I love her, I never said it.

409
00:47:33,528 --> 00:47:36,817
I've loved her since the first time I met her.

410
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:39,750
<i>This woman…</i>

411
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,317
has experienced so much pain in her life.

412
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:48,617
And that makes me pity her even more.

413
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,917
I've done everything for her.

414
00:47:56,848 --> 00:48:03,850
<i>I just want to see her smile,
and I'll be happy.</i>

415
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:09,183
And today, as I said.

416
00:48:10,352 --> 00:48:12,683
This woman is in danger.

417
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:19,183
And I, Olarn, will be the one to save her.

418
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:35,440
Chalinee, Chalinee, Chalinee!

419
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,217
Hey, Olarn is here.

420
00:48:43,347 --> 00:48:47,931
Olarn,

421
00:48:47,931 --> 00:48:52,760
Olarn, Olarn!

422
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,683
Welcome everyone.

423
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:57,617
Back to following the important events
of Tulakham today.

424
00:48:57,617 --> 00:48:59,450
Now, former Mayor Olarn…

425
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,483
has arrived at the Tulakham Court.

426
00:49:02,483 --> 00:49:05,250
And is about to meet Judge Chalinee.

427
00:49:09,417 --> 00:49:10,513
Why did you come?

428
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:13,417
I told you.

429
00:49:15,783 --> 00:49:17,450
That I'm here to help you, young lady.

430
00:49:24,412 --> 00:49:27,150
J-Judge Chalinee.

431
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:31,124
Today's verdict is attracting
a lot of attention.

432
00:49:31,124 --> 00:49:32,050
As you can see.

433
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,650
It's huge.

434
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,083
What do you say?

435
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:38,717
If I request a live broadcast of this trial
on the "Tam Tueng Tee" show,

436
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,950
I'm happy to. There's nothing to hide.

437
00:49:45,917 --> 00:50:01,838
Chalinee!

438
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:37,750
<i>[Everything will be fine if you confess.]</i>

439
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:41,217
<i>You must confess, so it ends like this.</i>

440
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:45,150
<i>Then the justice system
will remain untarnished.</i>

441
00:50:53,236 --> 00:50:58,484
<i>Think carefully.
I will take good care of Erika.</i>

442
00:51:32,488 --> 00:51:33,851
Aeri, don't get involved with her.

443
00:51:34,689 --> 00:51:36,799
She's never truly loved anyone.
<i>[Next Episode]</i>

444
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:39,872
Do you think I don't know what's what?

445
00:51:39,872 --> 00:51:42,827
I followed your orders my whole life.

446
00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:47,216
Now, it's your turn to repay me.

447
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:49,872
I'd like to testify.

448
00:51:49,872 --> 00:51:50,978
You're not allowed.

449
00:51:50,978 --> 00:51:53,778
Olarn's name was listed
as a witness in this case.

450
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,666
Let the former mayor help you.
