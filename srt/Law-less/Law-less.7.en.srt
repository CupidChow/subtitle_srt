00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:05,282
I don't know what's wrong with me.

6
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:07,834
When I see you in a judge's uniform,
<i>[Previous Episode]</i>

7
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:10,266
I feel like ripping it off you.

8
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:12,693
I'll rip this dress off you,

9
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:14,519
and put you in a prison uniform instead.

10
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:17,202
Your eyes are exactly like your mother's.

11
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:19,896
Will your fate be the same?

12
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:21,603
I'll wait and see.

13
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:23,123
You said we are friends.

14
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:26,495
I'm also trying to help you.

15
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:28,953
But it has to follow the law.

16
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:31,249
But you shouldn't have done this to me.

17
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:33,160
Why don't you understand
I'm doing this for you?

18
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,502
Why, Itt? Why?

19
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:35,822
Come back to me.

20
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:40,032
We'll take care of this city together.

21
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:42,683
That kid is a nightmare for all of you.

22
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:48,993
He's the one who will change
this dirty city, not you.

23
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:49,993
Sargent!

24
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:52,930
You should tell Sargent Itt

25
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,450
that you'll meet him soon.

26
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:56,936
I won't run away anymore.

27
00:02:58,466 --> 00:02:59,653
Let me do it.

28
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:09,950
About Mr. Vasu, Aeri is…

29
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,484
I'm more interested in that prosecutor Arnat.

30
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:15,236
Who brought him here?

31
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:18,650
Prosecutor Charoen is handling it.

32
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:21,150
Never mind.

33
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,483
What about the foundation's donation account?

34
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:25,183
Is everything OK?

35
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:26,517
I've told you.

36
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,617
Whatever is in Prangthip's hand,

37
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:30,617
there's no mistake.

38
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,583
Madam.

39
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,917
About you lobbying for
a lawyer's license for Prao.

40
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:40,671
Do you want her to work with Aeri?

41
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:47,217
Do I have to tell you what I'm thinking?

42
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,850
You have to be very careful.

43
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:10,117
Tulakham.

44
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,191
It's not the city we used to know anymore.

45
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:15,730
Although you had plastic surgery,
someone might recognize you.

46
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,355
Be careful, Haruetai.

47
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,117
Thank you very much, Prem.

48
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,250
Don't do anything behind my back.

49
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,264
Don't accidentally tell Prao that I lobbied

50
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:47,917
to help her get back the license.

51
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:50,083
Yes.

52
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,246
Prao has a party at her office today.

53
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:57,486
If not, I'll probably bring her along.

54
00:04:58,894 --> 00:05:01,134
It's OK. She's grown up.

55
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:07,406
Plus, her case on the former mayor
is popular in the city.

56
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:11,758
The prosecutor's office wants Prao to work.

57
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:14,950
If she doesn't want to work with me.

58
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,983
I've already looked into
the possibilities for her.

59
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,083
But I'm sure Prao wants to work with you.

60
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,471
But…

61
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:24,671
Mafia lawyers must have something attractive.

62
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:28,117
So they don't look like a boss and an employee.

63
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,517
That's what I'm worried about.

64
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:34,661
But never mind.

65
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:36,550
Let's talk while eating.

66
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,283
Oh, OK.

67
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:37,983
Please.

68
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:41,983
As for Prao.

69
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:43,650
I'll try talking to her.

70
00:05:44,632 --> 00:05:45,983
If she doesn't work with you,

71
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,636
I'll tell her to go back and work in the city.

72
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:52,850
If that's so, I'm relieved.

73
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,183
Thank you very much.

74
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:56,750
Yes.

75
00:05:57,384 --> 00:05:58,480
Please enjoy.

76
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,117
Dad.

77
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:13,950
Dad, open the door for me.

78
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,450
Hey, why are you so drunk?

79
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:24,883
Come inside.

80
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:31,417
Why are you drinking so much?

81
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:34,750
I'm dizzy, Dad.

82
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:56,983
Come on, have some hot tea to sober up.

83
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,552
I don't want you to work with that guy anymore.

84
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:08,263
But I have to finish something.

85
00:08:09,403 --> 00:08:10,450
For that matter.

86
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:12,583
Judge Chalinee promised to help.

87
00:08:21,883 --> 00:08:25,850
Judge Chalinee
may not be as good as you think.

88
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,750
But she's been helping
our family all these years.

89
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:32,683
All the bad things that happened
in this city might be related to her.

90
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,783
I'll consider you drunk.

91
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,517
That's why you said that.

92
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,253
She may be involved with Mom's disappearance.

93
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:42,285
Prao.

94
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:00,783
Pack up.

95
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:03,083
Go back to work in the city.

96
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,050
Don't stay here anymore.

97
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:31,983
Can I stay here?

98
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,383
Dad wants me to work with Judge Chalinee

99
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,917
or go back to work in the city.

100
00:11:05,757 --> 00:11:07,350
So you had a fight with your father.

101
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:10,650
He is so worried about you.

102
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:16,617
What about you? Do you want me to go?

103
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,050
I've never had a fight with my father before.

104
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:35,417
So I don't know what to do.

105
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:43,317
Oh,

106
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:45,983
have you ever had a fight with your mother?

107
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:53,230
No, I don't even have a chance
to fight with her.

108
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:01,350
Hey.

109
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,050
Then I'm more cooler than you, huh?

110
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,650
At least I got to fight with my dad.

111
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:27,102
Come on, sis, let's work.

112
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:34,650
Brother.

113
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,957
Why are you sleeping here?

114
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:37,045
That's right.

115
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:38,117
Yeah.

116
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:41,809
Oh, you look tired too.

117
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,699
Is the sofa hard?

118
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:48,639
Why did you come so early? Huh?

119
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:56,617
Nothing.

120
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:05,639
Do you guys come early every day?

121
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,075
- Yes.
- Yes.

122
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:37,225
<i>Mayor Olarn and his team came to visit
and encourage the police officers.</i>

123
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:39,517
<i>He provides the necessary supplies</i>

124
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:43,350
and promises that
he will support the officers in every way

125
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,517
<i>to suppress corruption</i>

126
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:46,375
<i>- in Tulakham.</i>
- Please, sir.

127
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:58,050
Uncuff him, please.

128
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,417
When are you going to get me out?

129
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,583
If you plan to do something, then do it.

130
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,183
The prosecutor who ordered the prosecution
is from the Central Prosecutor's Office.

131
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:20,803
This guy is tough. It's going to be difficult.

132
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,917
So you guys can't help me get out?

133
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,683
You'll have to make a sacrifice.

134
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:32,217
But it won't be long.

135
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,999
Are you planning to cut me off?

136
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:38,250
I won't sacrifice myself alone anyway.

137
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,183
Oh, come on.

138
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:43,350
You give me a hard time.

139
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:52,517
OK, fine.

140
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,550
I'll drag you all to jail.

141
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:03,043
<i>[Vasu's daughter]</i>

142
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:06,517
<i>Hello.</i>

143
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:09,250
What are you going to do?

144
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,883
It depends on what you choose.

145
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,283
You'll rest here for 3-4 years.

146
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:19,250
As for all your family expenses,

147
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,250
we'll take care of it.

148
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:22,450
I guarantee it.

149
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,950
When you come out, your daughter will graduate.

150
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:27,850
But if not.

151
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,150
We have to take care of you in a different way.

152
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,683
Your wife is beautiful

153
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,717
and your daughter is still young.

154
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:36,717
That's perfect.

155
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,983
You bastard!

156
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,050
Let me go, let me go.

157
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,883
Hey.

158
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:52,025
<i>After being arrested,</i>

159
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:54,250
<i>Mr. Vasu initially confessed to all charges.</i>

160
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,817
<i>There will be another
official press conference.</i>

161
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:59,383
It's unbelievable, bro.

162
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:01,919
Vasu would decide to confess alone.

163
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,850
Olarn definitely cut him off.

164
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,383
Hey, brother.

165
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:23,150
I think there's something wrong
with Vasu's case.

166
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:27,483
We'll probably have to collect
more evidence to close the case.

167
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:30,083
Wait a minute.

168
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:34,350
Should you call me the
chief prosecutor of Tulakham? Huh?

169
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:40,302
You can't use the same brotherhood relationship
from the time we were students.

170
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,650
But from what I've investigated,

171
00:16:46,683 --> 00:16:50,550
I don't think Vasu would confess like this.

172
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:54,450
The suspect has already confessed.

173
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:57,117
That means we can close the case.

174
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,383
Is there anything wrong? Huh?

175
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:06,783
Is the case closed
or cut off to disconnect to the main culprit?

176
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:10,283
Who do you think you are? Huh?

177
00:17:10,283 --> 00:17:12,497
That's why you came here to file a lawsuit

178
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:13,783
and disrespect me like this.

179
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,550
No matter how great you are,

180
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:23,650
this is Tulakham. City of Justice.

181
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,283
And I'm here.

182
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,483
Go back to your place.

183
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:38,159
There's no place for you in Tulakham.

184
00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:47,817
Even the Prosecutor Arnat couldn't do anything.

185
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:53,183
They probably know what we're going to do.

186
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:54,917
They won't just sit around and do nothing.

187
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:57,083
So, what do we do now, bro?

188
00:17:58,237 --> 00:18:00,917
We should all be careful during this time.

189
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:04,317
They'll probably find a way to get us.

190
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,617
You.

191
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,050
You should stay with Yam for now.

192
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:15,650
I mean…

193
00:18:16,548 --> 00:18:17,817
I'm sorry to bother you.

194
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:36,117
I feel much better now.

195
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,183
We finally cut off Vasu.

196
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:43,695
Hope everything will go on.

197
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,317
The mayor's favorite gangster style…

198
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:49,983
is really working.

199
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:52,634
I should give you a round of applause.

200
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:55,983
The legal staff, like Attorney Erika,

201
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,083
couldn't help at all.

202
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:08,750
Since she became a prosecutor,
she only lost the cases.

203
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:15,183
Plus, our rival has got
the lawyer's license back.

204
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,783
What should you do when working here?

205
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:51,617
Don't know. Don't see or hear anything.
And don't say anything.

206
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,563
Must be blind, deaf, mute.

207
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,017
And don't expose what happened
in this room, right?

208
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:01,850
Yes.

209
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:18,783
Unlock.

210
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,717
Unlock.

211
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,983
Give it to me.

212
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:37,159
<i>[Mr. Olarn, Ms. Chalinee is managing
to return Praochanok's lawyer license.]</i>

213
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,450
You're fired.

214
00:20:44,717 --> 00:20:47,183
If you expose this to anyone.

215
00:20:48,187 --> 00:20:50,183
Your son will be blind.

216
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,717
Your daughter will be mute.

217
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:55,550
Your mother will be disabled for life.

218
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,417
I'm not threatening you.

219
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:03,817
Please.

220
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,750
Please don't do anything to us.

221
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:12,583
I promise. I won't say anything.

222
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:27,350
So, Lawyer Win brought Prosecutor Arnat here.

223
00:21:28,505 --> 00:21:31,417
Is it a good thing that other prosecutors

224
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:33,283
are interfering?

225
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:37,817
Don't worry, I can handle it.

226
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,035
Because no matter what he does,
it has to go through me anyway.

227
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:48,155
As for the money, it has already been
transferred to the foundation.

228
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,283
We don't have to rely on Vasu anymore.

229
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,417
Other issues should be fine.

230
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:59,717
I only care that New Tulakham can resume.

231
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:03,517
This project isn't just yours.

232
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,317
Aren't we all contributing equally?

233
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,317
Come on.

234
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,683
You just do what you're good at.

235
00:22:15,383 --> 00:22:18,317
We'll handle the legal stuff.

236
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,850
Are you trying to make friends with me
over a cup of coffee?

237
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:41,983
Well, not that much.

238
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:46,517
I just want to make friends
with the fake justice of Tulakham.

239
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:48,650
As you see,

240
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,583
the case was closed.

241
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:51,950
And I can't do anything.

242
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:56,275
Vasu is the key to unlocking
the wickedness of many.

243
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,983
And of course.

244
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:00,317
If you break the key,

245
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:03,117
all doors will be locked.

246
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:06,883
Do you have another way?

247
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:08,450
No.

248
00:23:10,283 --> 00:23:12,183
But I'm sure I can make it happen.

249
00:23:15,717 --> 00:23:16,950
It sounds a bit surreal.

250
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,950
Let's say.

251
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,683
If you find a way, then we'll talk about it.

252
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:28,703
Oh, be careful. Don't make a mistake yourself.

253
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:40,697
It seems like you still have
something on your mind.

254
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:44,583
The case is closed. But it seems so abrupt.

255
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,717
I'm used to it, sir.

256
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,450
I've experienced this for ten years.

257
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:53,350
Ten years?

258
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,787
It's during the period when
prosecutor Charoen is stationed here.

259
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:14,708
I remember you like it.

260
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:20,950
This looks like the wildest law firm
since I've been a prosecutor.

261
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:23,450
Detective.

262
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,617
If there's anything suspicious,
you can arrest them.

263
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:31,350
They all look familiar.

264
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:33,717
All rock stars are here.

265
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,317
I can't believe it.

266
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:42,850
A cup of coffee can win
an honest prosecutor's heart.

267
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:49,283
I didn't come here so that you can use me.

268
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:55,017
But I'm just a bit obsessed with
the justice system of this city.

269
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:28,317
Hey, bro.

270
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,683
- Is there more?
- Are you OK?

271
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,117
How are you, Muay? Are you OK?

272
00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:02,350
- OK.
- Can you hear?

273
00:26:03,003 --> 00:26:04,183
- I can.
- OK.

274
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,243
- Um.
- Are you OK?

275
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,383
Is everyone okay?

276
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:13,450
Yep.

277
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:16,650
They want to scare us.

278
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:22,455
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, watch out.

279
00:26:24,493 --> 00:26:25,493
Firecrackers.

280
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,217
My printing house got hit too.

281
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:31,017
I'll check them.

282
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:32,050
Hey, be careful.

283
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,243
We must be careful from now on.

284
00:26:52,031 --> 00:26:53,117
Thank you.

285
00:27:03,517 --> 00:27:05,483
Can you stop acting like you're all alone?

286
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:08,250
You still have us.

287
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:12,883
I'm worried about all of you.

288
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:17,950
But we can take care of ourselves.

289
00:27:18,783 --> 00:27:23,017
By the way, you've always protected me.

290
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:28,917
But I can't protect you all the time.

291
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:32,183
Then…

292
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:36,420
Would you like me to move
into your office with you?

293
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,983
So you'll protect me all the time.

294
00:27:46,468 --> 00:27:48,017
I believe my mother is still alive.

295
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,817
And I have to meet her.

296
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:35,617
Your request is the one

297
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:38,725
I've wanted to hear from you

298
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:39,750
since I've been here.

299
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:45,056
Thank you for honoring me, son.

300
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,183
I will handle this with the law
that my mother believes in.

301
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:51,450
I just want you to protect Prao.

302
00:28:52,586 --> 00:28:56,490
Lawyer Prao has made you a lot more mature.

303
00:28:57,578 --> 00:29:00,864
Anyway, I am just preparing.

304
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,464
I won't do anything extensively.

305
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,920
Do you feel better now?

306
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:08,423
Yes.

307
00:29:29,395 --> 00:29:30,550
Tell Mek.

308
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:45,327
You brave enough to ambush me like this, huh?

309
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:46,917
If it's not here, I don't dare either.

310
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:51,417
But since we're here, the mayor would
like to invite you to discuss something.

311
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:37,150
This is my favorite shop.

312
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:12,017
Go.

313
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:13,036
Hey!

314
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:18,950
Don't be rude to him, man.

315
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,454
Do you know that he is number one in this city?

316
00:31:25,158 --> 00:31:27,983
If it were before, a hundred of you guys

317
00:31:29,983 --> 00:31:31,476
wouldn't be able to handle him, man.

318
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:35,217
But he doesn't like to follow anyone,

319
00:31:35,217 --> 00:31:36,250
so he can't stay.

320
00:31:38,183 --> 00:31:39,250
Right, Brother Prem?

321
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:41,162
Tell me what you want.

322
00:31:48,952 --> 00:31:50,617
Take your nephew home.

323
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:53,112
Don't come back here again.

324
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:58,104
Everything will end, and no one will lose.
Plus, we can still be friends.

325
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,112
Do you get it wrong? Huh?

326
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:08,383
Do you want me
to befriend a lowly fish delivery boy like you?

327
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:10,917
You are like a shabby dog

328
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,117
running and following someone's order.

329
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:18,417
Are you the Tulakham gangster?

330
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,850
You're just a bad person.

331
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:31,517
If not friends, then enemies.

332
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:34,883
My people are coming here.

333
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:37,197
If there's a problem,

334
00:32:37,197 --> 00:32:40,909
think about the mayor position
you're sitting on.

335
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:52,217
It's a pity that no one is coming.

336
00:33:01,487 --> 00:33:02,850
<i>Tee.</i>

337
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,717
<i>Take good care of your boss.
If you need anything, call me.</i>

338
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,736
<i>OK.</i>

339
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,163
Stay here for a while.

340
00:33:58,717 --> 00:34:00,283
Lawyer Win will come to help you guys.

341
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,503
I'll drag you all to jail.

342
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:11,917
I'm waiting to see what you can do.

343
00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:15,323
Actually…

344
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,250
I want to be friends with you guys.

345
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:22,193
But you are trying to destroy me,

346
00:34:23,153 --> 00:34:26,865
both Vasu and Sargent Itt.

347
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,599
What did you pay?

348
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:41,150
I guess I'll have to cut off
your arms and legs.

349
00:34:47,783 --> 00:34:49,117
Don't hurt Prao.

350
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:47,083
There he is!

351
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,550
You're trespassing, hurting my people,
what should I do?

352
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:57,806
What do you want?

353
00:35:59,017 --> 00:36:02,250
Why don't you work with me and build Tulakham?

354
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,353
How long are you going to do this?

355
00:36:06,117 --> 00:36:07,817
Until I drag you to jail.

356
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,750
Can you win alone?

357
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,371
You're protecting the wrong person.

358
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:28,192
Olarn!

359
00:36:28,192 --> 00:36:30,050
Do you think you can protect anyone?

360
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,248
Get them back.

361

I think it's the same medicine
