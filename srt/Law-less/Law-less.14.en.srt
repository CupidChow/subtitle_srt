Based on the evidence,
Prangthip won't get away with it.

<i>[Previous Episode]</i>

7
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,464
This clip can be used as evidence.

8
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:15,093
You should provide useful testimony.

9
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:19,699
At least you could use it
to reduce your sentence.

10
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:23,156
Aeri, you must help me.

11
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:25,773
You're a prosecutor. You must help me.

12
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:29,591
My mom said all the foundation documents
are still with her.

13
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:31,412
So what's your point?

14
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:36,188
It would be better if you looked for a way
to persuade your mother to confess.

15
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,825
The heavy penalty may become lighter.

16
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:43,005
Prangthip has agreed to let us handle the case.

17
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:46,660
She has also sent the
foundation's account evidence to us.

18
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,183
I know you don't trust us.

19
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:50,342
But who else can you trust right now?

20
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,902
For us to help you,

21
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:58,337
you need to say
you didn't decide this on your own.

22
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:00,986
Someone else ordered you.

23
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:08,350
Are you ready?

24
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:15,847
I'm ready, but it's a pity…

25
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:18,087
that today I won't see you as the prosecutor.

26
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:24,550
Today I prefer to observe,
that's enough for me.

27
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:30,025
In that case, I hope next time

28
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,750
I'll see you sitting on the bench.

29
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,650
Today, just focus on the case you have, OK?

30
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,163
We can start the trial.

31
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:26,496
I invite the prosecutor to state
the charges against the defendant.

32
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:37,150
I propose to dismiss the judge.

33
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:44,475
Right after the court opens,
you're asking for dismissal?

34
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:46,275
That's quite disrespectful to me.

35
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,883
If I counter-sue, what would you say?

36
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,763
I would like to present evidence to everyone.

37
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:35,650
No need for that. I will
counter-sue the defense lawyer.

38
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:40,283
I propose we pause this trial first.

39
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,283
And listen to this evidence.

40
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,483
May I present the evidence?

41
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,283
This is a thirty-million-baht
house, invaded in the National Park area.

42
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,117
And more importantly,

43
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,517
this house belongs to Judge Chatree.

44
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:31,950
May I have additional evidence?

45
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:38,283
<i>[Signed by Chatree Boonwong, Buyer]</i>

46
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:39,683
A thirty-million-baht house.

47
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,883
I'm following along.

48
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:46,250
With just the judge's salary,
how could he afford this?

49
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:51,217
But Judge Chatree managed to buy it.

50
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:54,883
At the price of only five million baht.

51
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:05,550
Hey! Invading parkland is already a crime.

52
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,283
Hey, is this called corruption or what?

53
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:12,128
He has to resign. Resign.

54
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:14,987
Hey, you know what?
My friend's dad is also a prosecutor,

55
00:07:14,987 --> 00:07:16,717
but he doesn't have this kind of wealth.

56
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:25,517
I propose to dismiss Judge Chatree
from the trial.

57
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:28,417
He's seriously violating ethics.

58
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:33,083
He lacks sufficient qualifications
to investigate this case fairly.

59
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:50,150
I propose we suspend the trial.

60
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:52,583
We should check for evidence,

61
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,183
and investigate the judge first.

62
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:17,883
Hello?

63
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,850
<i>I have important evidence to share.</i>

64
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:25,250
<i>If you're interested,</i>

65
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:27,783
come meet me.

66
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,183
Here we go! Hey! There he is!

67
00:08:53,922 --> 00:08:55,249
Lawyer, may I interview you?

68
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:56,275
- May I have an interview?
- Yes.

69
00:08:57,383 --> 00:09:00,600
How is the trial of Secretary Prangthip going?

70
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,883
There are still issues with the judge
who will adjudicate this case.

71
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:05,850
We may need to find another one.

72
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,650
Who will be the replacement judge?

73
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,550
It must be the most impartial person
in Tulakham.

74
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,650
- Judge Chalinee, right?
- Definitely.

75
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,617
Absolutely! Right?

76
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:17,209
Right?

77
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:20,409
<i>There are still issues with the judge

78
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,950

81
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:32,783
<i>Judge Chalinee, right? Is that who you mean?</i>

82
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:34,483
<i>Absolutely! Right?</i>

83
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,109
<i>Right?</i>

84
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:38,183
<i>It's definitely Judge Chalinee, isn't it?</i>

85
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:38,850
<i>Isn't it?</i>

86
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,450
<i>It must be her! Right?</i>

87
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,583
<i>Please answer my question.</i>

88
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:39,217
Let's go eat something. The weather is…

89
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:43,283
- A bit gloomy.
- I want to eat a lot right now.

90
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:45,550
- It's hard to breathe.
- I have a headache.

91
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,583
Where's Prao? Has anyone seen her?

92
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,683
Huh, haven't seen her.

93
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,250
Oh, really?

94
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,817
I didn't notice either.

95
00:10:57,617 --> 00:11:00,217
But I'll check for you.
She might be in the bathroom.

96
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:02,484
Oh! Hurry up, OK?

97
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:06,973
Hey, when did she go missing?

98
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:07,973
Not sure.

99
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:20,617
<i>You think I will run away?</i>

100
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:24,750
<i>This is my home, you know. This city is mine.</i>

101
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,450
<i>I'll reclaim everything that belongs to me.</i>

102
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,783
<i>You destroyed my beloved things,</i>

103
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:35,883
<i>and I will destroy yours too.</i>

104
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,150
- You don't see her?
- I don't see her.

105
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,583
What the hell?

106
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,583
There she is!

107
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,350
Hey, what's with that face?

108
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,795
What's wrong? Did you find her?

109
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,850
I didn't find her.

110
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:57,808
Split up and look for her quickly.

111
00:11:57,808 --> 00:11:58,475
Hey, go, go!

112
00:11:58,475 --> 00:11:59,383
Alright, brother.

113
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:01,383
Go, Muek, go with Wok.

114
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:02,283
- Okay.
- Hey, Muek!

115
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:02,983
Go with Hook!

116
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,545
- Hey! Come on.
- Wait!

117
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:08,717
Lawyer Prao!

118
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Where's the evidence?

119
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:35,050
The evidence you mentioned.

120
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:41,683
It's me.

121
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,783
I know everything about the judge.

122
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,250
But how will you get this piece of evidence?

123
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:17,617
Olarn.

124
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,850
Where's Lawyer Prao? I don't know.

125
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,650
Haven't found her.

126
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,579
Not found at all!

127
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:52,283
I've walked around already.

128
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,417
I looked again and didn't find her.

129
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,550
Hey, did you find her?

130
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,550
I didn't find her.

131
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:01,920
Didn't find her?

132
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,725
Have you looked everywhere?

133
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:03,917
I've looked everywhere.

134
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:04,581
Is something wrong?

135
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:05,650
Where did she go?

136
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,450
Hello?

137
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,783
Hey, brother.

138
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,883
Don't even think about it!

139
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:37,950
Let Prao go.

140
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:40,917
Do you know how to cherish something?

141
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:45,650
You don't look too good, do you, Mr. Mayor?

142
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:49,083
In this state, I could easily handle you.

143
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,317
You want to kill me, don't you?

144
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,217
There's no need to involve others.

145
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,550
I've come to see you, after all.

146
00:15:57,404 --> 00:15:59,283
Prao's the one you need to protect, isn't she?

147
00:16:03,883 --> 00:16:05,083
Let's end it here.

148
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,483
It's better not to interfere.

149
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:22,050
Let the men talk.

150
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,583
- Win…
- Quiet!

151
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:02,283
Wait a minute. Let me tell you something first.

152
00:17:02,283 --> 00:17:03,550
I don't want to hurt women.

153
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,350
I've told you I don't want to hurt women.

154
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,250
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

155
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,166
You might really lose everything otherwise.

156
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:34,950
If you want to stop Chalinee,
you have to help me.

157
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,750
Sir.

158
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,517
Are you asking me to surrender?

159
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,583
No way.

160
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:09,817
Here's the list.

161
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,250
The information is connecting all your crimes.

162
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:16,517
Someone sent this information to me.

163
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:19,817
And there is only one person
who knows this deeply.

164
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,150
Do you feel hurt?

165
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,583
If you can defeat me,

166
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,583
I will testify for you.

167
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,983
I will take care of the arrest warrant,
see you in court.

168
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,950
Sir.

169
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:49,783
Let's go. Hurry up! Let's go, Sir!

170
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,242

171
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,080

181
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,183
- Go away!
- Go away!

182
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:07,917
Chatree!

183
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:08,850
- Go away!
- Go away!

184
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,750
Chatree!

185
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,617
- Go away!
- Go away!

186
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:11,450
Chatree!

187
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,350
- Go away!
- Go away!

188
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:31,050
Chalinee!

189
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,250
Chalinee! Chalinee! Chalinee!

190
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:55,419
Chalinee!

191
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:57,157
<i>[Chatree, Get out]</i>

192
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,815
<i>[Chalinee, keep fighting]
[Chalinee loves Tulakham]</i>

193
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:19,550
Can you trust Olarn?

194
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:23,950
Will he agree to be our witness?

195
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,350
Chalinee has done a number on him.

196
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,417
He has to come.

197
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,350
But he loves Kamnan Chot very much.

198
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,817
He loves Tulakham more.

199
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:55,283
Now.

200
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:57,917
This might hurt a bit.

201
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,517
Sir… Boss.

202
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:17,117
You can call me whatever you want, Shin.

203
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:20,095
Sir.

204
00:25:21,517 --> 00:25:24,017
Tulakham City has progressed to this day.

205
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:27,883
It's because of you
and Judge Chalinee's collaboration.

206
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:34,450
Now Chalinee is about to…

207
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,883
<i>Can't you wait for the young lady
to fall asleep?</i>

208
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,450
<i>Take her to play somewhere else.</i>

209
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:52,050
<i>Come on, young lady, don't stay here.</i>

210
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:03,483
<i>Let go! Let me go!</i>

211
00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:04,640
<i>Don't do anything to the lady!</i>

212
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,617
<i>- Why are you holding me?
- Sir!</i>

213
00:26:05,617 --> 00:26:06,617
<i>Let go!</i>

214
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:07,383
<i>Sir!</i>

215
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:08,550
<i>I beg you!</i>

216
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,817
<i>I do everything for you, young lady.</i>

217
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,750
<i>Yes, Olarn must be the most devoted one.</i>

218
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:43,083
<i>Because Olarn is the dog my family has raised.</i>

219
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,064
Shin.

220
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:55,050
Do you know? I never abandon anyone.

221
00:26:57,153 --> 00:26:59,417
No matter if I'm full or hungry.

222
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,383
If I abandon you now,

223
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:14,717
I will look for you and serve you as before.

224
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:42,879
<i>[Money transfer successful]</i>

225
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,683
<i>Here's the list.</i>

226
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:54,117
<i>The information is connecting all your crimes.</i>

227
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,083
<i>Someone sent me the information.</i>

228
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,317
<i>And there's only one person
who knows this deeply.</i>

229
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:12,917
The judge has been planning
to eliminate everyone since the beginning.

230
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,017
Sir…

231
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:21,650
If you want to survive,
you have to struggle yourself.

232
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,717
What do you mean?

233
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:33,817
We have to stop Chalinee.

234
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:37,250
Protect Tulakham from those people.

235
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:48,283
<i>I'm very pleased to develop this city
along with the Chalinee Foundation.</i>

236
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,983
<i>This project is my life.</i>

237
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:55,150
<i>I'm willing to sacrifice
the Olarn Group for it.</i>

238
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,883
<i>I'll give you everything.</i>

239
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:02,750
<i>Do you think I deserve such a reward?</i>

240
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:15,317
<i>But this is your duty, isn't it?</i>

241
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:22,083
<i>And it will always be your duty
to fulfill it throughout your life.</i>

242
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:31,850
I will take down the judge myself.

243
00:29:46,545 --> 00:29:47,583
Madam.

244
00:29:48,617 --> 00:29:54,117
Now we can't let Judge Chatree
continue working.

245
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:59,617
Because the Tulakham court
is no longer trusted by the people.

246
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:07,283
And now journalists from all over
are focusing their attention on our city.

247
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:10,117
Do you think we will lose?

248
00:30:11,683 --> 00:30:12,717
That is…

249
00:30:13,317 --> 00:30:15,550
I haven't said we would lose yet.

250
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,117
But the implication is that we'll lose.

251
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,883
So, you're going to put
the entire burden on me?

252
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,917
Yes, of course.

253
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,817
I still have to fulfill my duties
as a judge unavoidably.

254
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,128
But if you two don't resolve anything,

255
00:30:37,917 --> 00:30:41,850
I'll have to reconsider your roles completely.

256
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,217
If you have any plans, report them.

257
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,517
Don't come here just to complain.

258
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:13,583
Brother.

259
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,317
Are you really just going
to let Olarn go like that?

260
00:31:17,117 --> 00:31:18,483
He doesn't have many choices.

261
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:24,683
But I believe that someone like Olarn
acts for Tulakham's best interests.

262
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,417
Then why did he cause trouble
for others before?

263
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,783
If there are no choices,
he must go with the flow.

264
00:31:40,517 --> 00:31:42,350
It's not fair to only be angry at Olarn.

265
00:31:43,517 --> 00:31:45,183
We should be angrier at Chalinee.

266
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:59,783
Right now, Tulakham is really hot.

267
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,483
Ever since Chairman Lee invested in this city,

268
00:32:06,783 --> 00:32:09,250
everyone wants to come here.

269
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:17,350
Whether it's journalists, tourists,
or other investors.

270
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:23,994
But the reason everyone wants to come here

271
00:32:23,994 --> 00:32:28,517
is not just because of the resources
or opportunities.

272
00:32:31,356 --> 00:32:32,356
Why is that?

273
00:32:41,998 --> 00:32:42,998
Because of you.

274
00:32:46,683 --> 00:32:48,950
Because everyone has faith in you.

275
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:54,583
Think about it.

276
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:58,883
This city may have abundant resources,

277
00:32:59,717 --> 00:33:02,017
but if no one can access them,

278
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,083
it's useless.

279
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:12,883
But because you're here,
guiding the correct way to take.

280
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:19,883
This is the reason Chairman Lee
dares to come here.

281
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:24,017
And in Prangthip's case.

282
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,383
There is only you,

283
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:31,317
who can restore full confidence
in this situation.

284
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:47,583
Sir.

285
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,450
The judge seems to know we are coming today.

286
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:52,350
There are guards as well.

287
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:56,017
She's on edge because of guilt.

288
00:34:16,517 --> 00:34:18,017
How are you, Your Honor?

289
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,750
I thought you might not pick up.

290
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:23,317
Why don't you come and talk to me?

291
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:27,017
Now that you have guards, I can't get close.

292
00:34:31,478 --> 00:34:32,850
Someone protested yesterday.

293
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,917
So they had to increase my security,
that's all.

294
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:39,817
Let's meet up so we can have
a proper discussion.

295
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,283
I can't go see you today.

296
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,050
I might get caught.

297
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,983
Well then, let's meet at home.
We should talk.

298
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:00,617
Alright.

299
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:01,617
Young lady,

300
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,750
Don't play tricks.

301
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:12,692
Aeri.

302
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:18,217
You know, the person I always thought
would take my place

303
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,417
is only Praochanok and you.

304
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:27,050
But right now, Praochanok seems like
she can't bounce back anymore.

305
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:32,517
So it's just you, Aeri.

306
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:37,967
Yes.

307
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:45,383
Are you ready to follow the path
I've paved for you?

308
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:48,776
Yes.

309
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:50,767
In this case,

310
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:54,517
your mother will be guilty
according to the procedure.

311
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:56,783
Can you accept that?

312
00:35:57,817 --> 00:36:00,883
The evidence is clear as it is.

313
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:02,050
If you say she's not guilty,

314
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:05,550
You, a prosecutor like you,
will end up in trouble.

315
00:36:09,912 --> 00:36:11,417
Prepare the information well.

316
00:36:13,183 --> 00:36:15,217
And convince your mother to understand as well.

317
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:19,483
If you want your career to prosper,

318
00:36:20,984 --> 00:36:23,083
you must do as I say.

319
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,750
Hello?

320
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:41,650
Come see me right now.

321
00:36:43,617 --> 00:36:46,117
Why? Do you have something urgent to discuss?

322
00:36:47,217 --> 00:36:50,217
Judge Chalinee is taking matters
into her own hands.

323
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:52,583
She will definitely go after me.

324
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:53,917
Yes.

325
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:55,717
You're going to feel the full force of this.

326
00:36:57,617 --> 00:36:59,683
No more playing around. Are you coming or not?

327
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:12,350
I've never seen her lose in the case
since becoming a judge.

328
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:14,583
Do you think you can beat her?

329
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,850
In this game, there is only one option:
you must win.

330
00:37:20,783 --> 00:37:23,183
Hey, what game are you guys playing?

331
00:37:23,183 --> 00:37:25,383
Or do you want me to lose?

332
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,750
Let's just say if you knew
who would be the witness on the other side,

333
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,617
you would be shocked.

334
00:37:38,283 --> 00:37:39,283
Who?

335
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:42,850
Editor Harn.

336
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:47,417
That Editor Harn? That loser?

337
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:51,717
He will make that evidence very convincing.

338
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,817
You wouldn't let him easily rock you, right?

339
00:37:56,412 --> 00:37:58,483
Am I going to give in?

340
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,050
This man grew up thanks to me,

341
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,650
I've supported him.

342
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:10,683
In this case, I will be the assistant lawyer.

343
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:30,717
It's better to let me go. Let's part ways.

344
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:35,383
I won't interfere with you,
and you don't interfere with me.

345
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:46,650
You betrayed my uncle,
and you almost killed me.

346
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,350
You expect me to just let you go?

347
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:55,917
What do you want?

348
00:39:00,017 --> 00:39:01,217
To be a witness in court.

349
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:05,350
And let's go our separate ways,
no more interference.

350
00:39:09,117 --> 00:39:10,117
Can I use a phone?

351
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,417
Do you think he will testify for us?

352
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,583
So what next?

353
00:40:08,183 --> 00:40:09,883
You look really troubled.

354
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:14,250
Troubled? You think so?

355
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,817
It must be good for you.

356
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:22,783
How can it be good?
I've been with you all along.

357
00:40:24,028 --> 00:40:26,883
And now you have to be in this situation.

358
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:34,350
This isn't the person I used to know.

359
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:40,283
Prangthip.

360
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:46,183
The way to save you
is to uphold the justice process.

361
00:40:48,186 --> 00:40:49,883
The evidence clearly shows you are guilty.

362
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:54,350
You must accept the truth for this to end.

363
00:40:55,683 --> 00:40:58,350
And the justice process will remain unsullied.

364
00:41:07,117 --> 00:41:08,117
Think carefully.

365
00:41:10,283 --> 00:41:12,450
I will take good care of Erika.

366
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:16,617
And I might…

367
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:22,350
adopt Erika as my own daughter,
just as you wish.

368
00:42:06,217 --> 00:42:09,930
Sir, Standing out in the cold
too long, you might get sick.

369
00:42:18,317 --> 00:42:21,397
Contact Kom and ask about what's
happening in court and where the case stands.

370
00:42:22,383 --> 00:42:23,383
Yes, Sir.

371
00:42:40,982 --> 00:42:44,566
From now on, we will have to face
the strongest opponents in this city.

372
00:42:44,566 --> 00:42:45,683
And we must win.

373
00:42:53,149 --> 00:42:57,817
<i>[Court of Tulakham]</i>

374
00:43:09,317 --> 00:43:12,350
Let the trial begin. Please.

375
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:22,683
We found the hair and fingerprints of the defendant
in the area where the missing person was detained.

376
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,783
This aligns with
what the defendant mentioned in the video,

377
00:43:25,783 --> 00:43:27,937
that the defendant had ordered
the victim to be harmed

378
00:43:27,937 --> 00:43:30,050
while searching for the missing person.

379
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:39,250
<i>I ordered you to do it,
and you must do it. Make her disappear.</i>

380
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:45,150
It is clear that Ms. Prangthip
is trying to implicate others.

381
00:43:46,983 --> 00:43:49,250
I want the jury to understand

382
00:43:50,216 --> 00:43:54,417
from my witness to aid in your decision-making.

383
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:00,750
I would like to call Mr. Harn Khotchan
to the stand.

384
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:03,950
Please proceed.

385
00:44:08,317 --> 00:44:12,350
I call Mr. Harn Khotchan from
the Tulakham News Agency.

386
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:25,517
Mr. Harn.

387
00:44:25,517 --> 00:44:28,217
Do you have any relationship
with the defendant?

388
00:44:31,706 --> 00:44:33,550
I've known her for a long time.

389
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,483
Since I was an intern in journalism.

390
00:44:35,483 --> 00:44:37,817
I've seen her working with the judge.

391
00:44:38,656 --> 00:44:40,550
What is your impression of the defendant?

392
00:44:41,856 --> 00:44:44,597
As far as I know her,
at first, she seemed ordinary.

393
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:46,850
She's determined and ambitious.

394
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,250
But after she started working with our judge,

395
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,817
she tended to leverage
her longstanding connections

396
00:44:54,383 --> 00:44:56,850
to claim superiority over others.

397
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,383
For instance, when I visited the judge,

398
00:45:00,383 --> 00:45:03,917
I would see her using her power
to intimidate her subordinates ruthlessly.

399
00:45:04,817 --> 00:45:05,850
Or sometimes she would…

400
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:09,317
brag about knowing the judge's name

401
00:45:09,317 --> 00:45:12,739
to gain privileges for her own dealings.

402
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:16,817
How shameless! You come to cling to me
like we're allies.

403
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,576
And then you say we're on the same team.

404
00:45:20,576 --> 00:45:22,483
How ridiculous!

405
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,817
This is what I want everyone to see.

406
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:31,650
This is the root of the problem
that led to this case.

407
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,017
When the prosecution has no further questions,

408
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:48,283
the next is the questioning
from the defense lawyer. Please go ahead.

409
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:56,817
From what I see,

410
00:45:57,517 --> 00:46:00,517
you have met with Prangthip quite often.

411
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,217
Do you have any ties with her?

412
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,383
I don't have any relations
with someone like that.

413
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,617
I just occasionally visit the judge,
that's all.

414
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:16,517
From past information and reports,

415
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,950
you often attend events with Prangthip.

416
00:46:22,131 --> 00:46:26,675
You yourself have relied on her influence
to grow in this city.

417
00:46:26,675 --> 00:46:29,017
Me? I relied on her?

418
00:46:29,017 --> 00:46:30,696
No, she relies on me.

419
00:46:30,696 --> 00:46:31,848
Speak properly, old man.

420
00:46:31,848 --> 00:46:34,350
Hey, how else can I say it?

421
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,217
I've had to write news to support
the project for you countless times.

422
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:40,750
I never charge a single baht.
You're the one in debt to me.

423
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:44,376
You idiot, biting the hand that feeds you!

424
00:46:44,376 --> 00:46:46,700
Oh, so now you want to kick me out, huh?

425
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,725
When you came to beg for help
to be the news editor here,

426
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:51,197
you didn't say this.

427
00:46:51,197 --> 00:46:52,349
It's the same thing.

428
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:53,373
How long have I been writing news?

429
00:46:53,373 --> 00:46:54,750
How much have you earned from this?

430
00:47:09,183 --> 00:47:13,550
It's clear that this person cannot be trusted.

431
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:17,050
Your Honor, I request to call the next witness.

432
00:47:19,581 --> 00:47:21,650
The court allows the summoning of the witness.

433
00:47:36,217 --> 00:47:37,217
Witness.

434
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:42,150
I've received information that
you have something to say about this case.

435
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:43,839
Yes.

436
00:47:45,317 --> 00:47:47,750
I'm the one who killed
that spa therapist employee.

437
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:51,017
Did you do it yourself,
or were you ordered by someone else?

438
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:53,350
Someone ordered me to do it.

439
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:58,450
And that person is Prangthip.

440
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:07,083
But Prangthip was also ordered by someone else.

441
00:48:11,616 --> 00:48:15,450
Do you know who ordered Prangthip?

442
00:48:24,325 --> 00:48:25,350
I don't know either.

443
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:29,283
But it must be someone important
that Prangthip respects.

444
00:48:29,283 --> 00:48:30,283
Thank you.

445
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,983
At least my client doesn't have to bear
the blame alone.

446
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:41,617
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

447
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:49,283
I request that the court's police
detain the witness for questioning.

448
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:52,283
And there will be another trial.

449
00:48:52,283 --> 00:48:54,683
That's all for today.

450
00:49:03,017 --> 00:49:07,353
You guys are also really good
at getting Editor Harn to be questioned.

451
00:49:07,353 --> 00:49:09,883
And making the judge unable to sit still.

452
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:13,417
Don't get too complacent.

453
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:18,350
Next time you must mention
the name of the person who ordered it.

454
00:49:21,945 --> 00:49:25,750
Don't pressure me, give me time to think.

455
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:27,417
Then we can talk.

456
00:49:48,517 --> 00:49:49,517
How is it going?

457
00:49:50,048 --> 00:49:52,583
On the prosecution's side,
the witness is Editor Harn.

458
00:49:53,117 --> 00:49:55,017
But he was provoked into
revealing too much himself.

459
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:57,475
As for the defense witness,

460
00:49:57,475 --> 00:49:59,517
he claims he was ordered by Prangthip.

461
00:49:59,517 --> 00:50:01,783
But Prangthip was also ordered by someone else.

462
00:50:03,883 --> 00:50:05,417
Has the witness mentioned who that is?

463
00:50:07,162 --> 00:50:10,550
Not yet, but it's definitely someone
more powerful than Prangthip.

464
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,781
The judge has ordered
a suspension of the trial for now.

465
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,983
That Lawyer Win…

466
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,717
He's good at planning.

467
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:23,950
Let's keep watching.

468
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:26,650
Yes, Sir.

469
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,217
<i>The evidence clearly shows that you did it.
You must take responsibility.</i>

470
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:55,183
<i>Think carefully.
I will take good care of Erika.</i>

471
00:50:57,448 --> 00:50:59,117
<i>And I might…</i>

472
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:05,017
<i>adopt Erika as my own daughter,
just as you wish.</i>

473
00:51:52,545 --> 00:51:55,122
I have a crucial witness
I'd like to bring to court next time.

474
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,786
But you need to lift the arrest warrant first.
<i>[Next Episode]</i>

475
00:52:00,064 --> 00:52:01,900
Olarn's been taken care of?

476
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,068
But if we don't hurry and handle this.

477
00:52:04,068 --> 00:52:06,258
You and I might not survive.

478
00:52:06,959 --> 00:52:08,639
Let the defendant testify.

479
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:10,299
I really went there.

480
00:52:10,299 --> 00:52:12,018
But someone instructed me.
