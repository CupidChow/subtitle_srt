<i>[Previous Episode]</i>

7
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:13,346
Olarn must be the most loyal.

8
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:17,982
Because Olarn is the dog that my family raised.

9
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:21,909
If you don't want anyone to get in trouble,

10
00:02:22,898 --> 00:02:25,294
stay here for a long time.

11
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:26,518
It's strange.

12
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:30,229
The judge

13
00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:32,820
really wants me to win this case.

14
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:36,649
Do you remember this building?

15
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:37,873
Where were you in the building?

16
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:40,607
How many forklifts did you see?

17
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:41,779
Three forklifts.

18
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,485
There was only one forklift.

19
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:45,255
Let me ask the jury.

20
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:48,016
Can we trust the witness like this?

21
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:56,217
Is there anything else I can help you?

22
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:01,074
I can do better than last time.

23
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,883
Who do you think ordered
to kill Lawyer Win in prison?

24
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:42,117
Apart from us, I can't think of anyone.

25
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,589
There are only two people.

26
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:48,483
Me

27
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,317
and…

28
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,083
Chalinee.

29
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:23,417
Don't.

30
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:25,150
Why?

31
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,423
I want to know who sent him.

32
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,083
Don't get up. I'll shoot you.

33
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:05,683
Do you realize what you've done?

34
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:12,183
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:14,983
It's not me you should apologize.

36
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,783
If you had killed Olarn,

37
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:20,750
everything Win has done is worthless.

38
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,383
I'm angry that he killed Mr. Prem.

39
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:30,617
He also sent someone to hurt Win in prison.

40
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:38,005
But Win told me that Olarn
had nothing to do with this.

41
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:43,483
But even if Olarn did,

42
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:46,617
Win came here!

43
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:50,396
Because he wanted to use the law
to deal with bad people.

44
00:05:51,203 --> 00:05:53,817
Doing this shows that you don't love him.

45
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,817
While Win's not here,

46
00:06:06,677 --> 00:06:08,661
you guys don't do anything rashly.

47
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,983
Otherwise, everything
we've fought for will be over.

48
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:14,783
Do you understand?

49
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:16,483
- Yes.
- Yes.

50
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:17,267
Yes, I do.

51
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:18,240
Do you understand?

52
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,283
- I do.
- I do.

53
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:38,598
How's it going? Did you get it?

54
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,317
Of course, I did.

55
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,483
I'll never make a mistake.

56
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:45,078
No mistake?

57
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,950
Like yesterday?

58
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,317
Oh, sir.

59
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,117
Check this out.

60
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:54,823
His name is Mek.

61
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,550
He's Prem's close subordinate.

62
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:01,383
He's now become
the gang leader instead of Prem.

63
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:05,717
I think it's him
who ordered to kill Win in jail.

64
00:07:10,793 --> 00:07:11,793
And where is he now?

65
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:15,154
I heard that he has been hanging around
in Tulakham a few times.

66
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,083
You have people following him.

67
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:23,183
If you see him again, tell me right away.

68
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:25,988
Sure.

69
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:35,683
What's wrong?

70
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,983
The prison sent it to you.

71
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:48,383
When you were attacked in prison.

72
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:52,774
Those guys were trying to find a blind spot
so that CCTV didn't capture the image clearly.

73
00:07:55,282 --> 00:07:56,583
Is it one of these three guys?

74
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:03,994
No, it's not.

75
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:05,697
Are you sure?

76
00:08:06,582 --> 00:08:08,255
It's definitely not one of these three.

77
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,183
This is a criminal case.

78
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:23,783
Even if you don't press charges,
I must follow up.

79
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:26,317
You're a lawyer. You should know better.

80
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:36,150
Your skills are really good.

81
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,050
It's reasonable that you
used to massage in Korea.

82
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,050
Thank you, madam.

83
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:47,317
You have been working abroad
for so long with such skills.

84
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:50,138
You must have saved a lot of money, right?

85
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:53,622
Well… quite a lot, madam.

86
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:57,183
Then why do you still offer a massage service?

87
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:02,313
Why don't you open a shop? Or teaching massage.

88
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:11,483
It's OK, you don't need to answer.

89
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:14,850
I'm just asking inquisitively.
I hope you don't mind me.

90
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:17,054
Yes, madam.

91
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,028
Madam.

92
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:27,684
Can't you see I'm massaged?

93
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:30,116
You suddenly popping. It's rude.

94
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:32,317
I'm sorry, madam.

95
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:33,817
Olarn wants to meet you.

96
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:35,596
Hello.

97
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:38,483
Your honor.

98
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,717
How dare you come when I'm resting.

99
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:50,350
Can't you see? There are others.

100
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:57,274
Well, she's just a masseuse.

101
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:08,032
If you have something, just tell me.

102
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:19,785
You know about that Lawyer Win
was stabbed in prison and almost died, right?

103
00:10:21,314 --> 00:10:23,250
I know. Why do you ask?

104
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:27,450
Do you know who's behind it?

105
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:35,617
It's not you?

106
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:43,111
No.

107
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:46,717
I have nothing to do with it.

108
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,183
Maybe it's Prem's minion…

109
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:53,317
who wants revenge.

110
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:56,281
Well…

111
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,650
It might be possible.

112
00:11:02,617 --> 00:11:07,950
My people saw Prem's top subordinate
hanging around this city.

113
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,171
Really?

114
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:15,291
And then he comes here and there.

115
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:26,679
So I want to warn you to be careful.

116
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:29,882
Thank you.

117
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:35,298
But why would he want to hurt me?

118
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:40,183
I've never done anything to his boss.

119
00:11:42,462 --> 00:11:48,417
I'll investigate
who ordered the kill of Lawyer Win.

120
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,310
Including

121
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:54,883
why Prem's gang is hanging around here.

122
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:58,619
Whatever.

123
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:04,150
Is that all, Mr. Mayor?

124
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,850
Yes.

125
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,750
Wait.

126
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:29,643
Yes.

127
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:34,417
Whatever you know and hear,
just leave it in this house.

128
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,283
If it gets out, I'll consider you doing it.

129
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:42,017
You have to take responsibility for your life.

130
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:45,081
Just one masseuse.

131
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:48,014
Do you have to threaten her like this,
Prangthip?

132
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:51,114
No matter who they are.

133
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:52,778
I don't trust anyone.

134
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,274
Fair enough.

135
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,150
Understand.

136
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:01,217
You have to understand Ms. Prangthip.

137
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,383
She has been suppressed all her life.

138
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,817
She has to relieve it by suppressing others.

139
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:09,829
Do you understand?

140
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:11,483
I don't like to oppress anyone.

141
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:13,417
I prefer the exchange.

142
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:18,317
If you want money constantly,

143
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,450
deaf and blind, when entering this house,

144
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,417
no matter what I say to the judge.

145
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:37,472
Thank you.

146
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,117
I promise I won't say anything.

147
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:44,843
Excuse me.

148
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,018
If you can't identify who hurt you,

149
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:05,117
you won't get bail.

150
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:07,583
They will think that you are
making up stories to get out.

151
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:09,783
That's right.

152
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,683
I really intended to do that.

153
00:14:17,218 --> 00:14:19,532
Mangpong is my brother, whom I respect.
He's in the gang.

154
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,150
He respects and loves Uncle Prem a lot.

155
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:25,217
Someone incited him that I killed Uncle Prem.

156
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,917
So he tried to kill me.

157
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:37,350
So Mangpong intends to kill you.

158
00:14:39,302 --> 00:14:40,822
So you're going to let him go?

159
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:43,568
I'm willing to do this.

160
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,025
Because I want to prove my innocence
that I didn't kill Uncle Prem.

161
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:20,883
Calm down, Lawyer.

162
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:23,950
I should call you inmate.

163
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:27,088
Why are you here?

164
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:32,450
Oh, a townsman was injured and hospitalized.

165
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,317
I want to visit you, can't I?

166
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:45,317
You have to pay for Uncle Prem.

167
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,883
Calm down, don't accuse me.

168
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:53,383
I just want to know.

169
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,683
Do you know who ordered to kill you?

170
00:16:11,783 --> 00:16:12,783
Tell me.

171
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:23,617
Do you start to believe it?

172
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,550
That the judge is targeting you.

173
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:31,750
You must be very nervous.

174
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,250
You think you're great, but you're not.

175
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:39,750
Just a pawn to be tossed away.

176
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
You're mouthy.

177
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,917
We'll see.

178
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,736
<i>[Court of Tulakham]</i>

179
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:08,117
Most importantly,

180
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,883
the defendant was attacked
and seriously injured by another inmate.

181
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,683
And the perpetrator has not been caught.

182
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,650
For safety reasons,

183
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:19,783
the defendant should be released on bail.

184
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:22,850
What do you think, Prosecutor?

185
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:34,717
There was an assault in prison,
but the perpetrators have not been caught.

186
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:41,183
How can we be sure that it wasn't a set-up
to get out of prison?

187
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:45,817
The defendant's record is not quite good.

188
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:49,050
I'm afraid that if he is granted bail,

189
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:53,850
he might go out and eliminate
the evidence and intimidate witnesses.

190
00:17:56,256 --> 00:17:57,750
After considering the petition

191
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:01,583
and the Prosecutor's analysis,

192
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:06,117
The court found it inappropriate
for the defendant to be granted bail.

193
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,217
The court dismissed the appeal.

194
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:27,483
I'm sorry your boss couldn't get bail, Prao.

195
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:39,583
It's a long journey.

196
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:43,250
Don't be too confident, Aeri.

197
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:47,050
From what I've seen,

198
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:51,683
your boss probably won't get away with it.

199
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:56,920
The best thing to do is use
this opportunity to distance yourself.

200
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:02,783
I think it would rather be you.

201
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,650
that should stay away from bad
people.

202
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,150
I'm sorry about the bail.

203
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:42,817
I already knew it would be like this.

204
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:45,250
But you did your best.

205
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:33,841
Where did you get it?

206
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:40,717
A woman we met at Sargent Itt's funeral.

207
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:44,883
She became a masseuse for the judge.

208
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,559
Massage therapist?

209
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:52,883
She also told me she used to work
with your uncle.

210
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:02,217
I think she must have been
in trouble because of those people.

211
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:07,083
That's why she takes the risk to do this.
To find a way to get revenge.

212
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:11,883
I don't think she's trustworthy.

213
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,283
They might set up a trap for us.

214
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,583
But I think she's reliable.

215
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:21,650
Why are you so confident?

216
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,018
I don't know.

217
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,183
You should trust me.
And even if I was deceived,

218
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,283
I won't stop until justice is served.

219
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:49,750
What if you succeed,
but something bad happens to you?

220
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:54,550
Didn't I tell you that
I'll never forgive myself?

221
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,517
So, You have to be very careful.

222
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,750
- Lawyer Prao.
- Oh.

223
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:16,696
Are you going to visit Win?

224
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:20,950
You visited him alone.

225
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,183
He must have been happy all day.

226
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,783
But How is he?

227
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:29,012
Better. No sign of sickness.

228
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:32,701
Lawyer Prao. Someone is waiting
to see you at the office.

229
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:58,216
Ms. Lawyer.

230
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,017
Sorry for being rude.

231
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:09,183
I happened to see your cute little photo,

232
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:13,583
so I couldn't help but take a look at it.

233
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,550
Yes.

234
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:21,774
Is there something wrong?

235
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:23,169
I'm worried about you.

236
00:23:30,112 --> 00:23:33,250
I heard that you admire
Judge Chalinee very much.

237
00:23:36,194 --> 00:23:38,917
But you're facing something
that destroys your feelings like this.

238
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,750
I should thank you instead. You enlighten me.

239
00:23:50,324 --> 00:23:53,517
Then why would you put yourself
at risk of exposing these people

240
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:55,750
when you know it's dangerous?

241
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:00,350
I was in this city.

242
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,050
Judge Chalinee and those people

243
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,350
made me lose my best friend.

244
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,590
I can't even stay in this city because of them.

245
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:23,317
Then I thought that

246
00:24:24,783 --> 00:24:26,050
running away was useless.

247
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,911
I'd rather come back and fight for this city.

248
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:32,917
Why do you want me to help you?

249
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:39,750
Prem said that
you and Lawyer Win can expose these people.

250
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,417
The more I meet you,

251
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:47,483
the more confident I am.

252
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:53,363
Thank you.

253
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,183
Now, Chalinee and Olarn are breaking up.

254
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,250
If you think of doing anything,
you should do it now.

255
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Yes.

256
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:16,583
I apologize.

257
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:20,517
My man made a mistake. Couldn't kill Win.

258
00:25:22,117 --> 00:25:25,350
I guarantee he won't survive next time.

259
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:38,144
Hey, wake up!

260
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:49,859
Look at that!

261
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:06,750
Can you please have some manners?

262
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,050
It's urgent, sir.

263
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,050
They saw Mek, Prem's subordinate,
secretly meet Prangthip.

264
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,850
Gosh!

265
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:19,332
Don't follow me.

266
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,650
Oh, you visit me quite often.

267
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:44,617
Stop playing around.

268
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,650
I knew that Mek ordered your murder in prison.

269
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,383
He didn't do it to get revenge for Prem.

270
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:54,483
He got the job from Chalinee.

271
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,450
Now, your uncle's gang is in Chalinee's hands.

272
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,350
Is that all you want to tell me?

273
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:11,683
What does Chalinee want to do?

274
00:27:11,683 --> 00:27:12,983
Tell me everything you know.

275
00:27:15,232 --> 00:27:16,972
Are you afraid of being trashed?

276
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,150
Does she want a second chance to kill you?

277
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:33,583
You better run. Go away.

278
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,783
I have to take care of everything.

279
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:46,517
You can't die.

280
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:49,817
You have to live and help me handle this. Go.

281
00:27:52,094 --> 00:27:53,310
Come on. Hurry.

282
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:16,517
Shin, send someone to the hospital now.

283
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:19,126
Don't ask too much. Hurry.

284
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,050
Go.

285
00:32:02,183 --> 00:32:03,183
Shin.

286
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:27,483
The omelet is tasty.

287
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:33,276
Of course. There will be
no more burnt-egg legends.

288
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,483
Hey, Dad, eat a lot.

289
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:38,517
Here.

290
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:43,296
Try this soup, Dad.

291
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:44,656
Oh, you made this yourself?

292
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:46,318
I thought you bought it from the market.

293
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:52,617
It's delicious.

294
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:54,683
Why are you good at cooking all of a sudden?

295
00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:00,417
I'm going to cook it for a patient.

296
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:03,117
A patient, who's that?

297
00:33:04,978 --> 00:33:05,983
Wait a minute, Dad.

298
00:33:12,052 --> 00:33:13,283
Hello, what's up, Tan?

299
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,412
Prao, where are you going, Prao?

300
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,383
Hey! Seriously?

301
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:45,417
Don't you even think you should thank me?

302
00:33:47,957 --> 00:33:50,032
You obviously see that
they intend to kill you too.

303
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:57,213
Tell me.

304
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,383
What will Chalinee do next?

305
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:05,685
Why do you think Chalinee is supporting you
in becoming mayor?

306
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,317
Probably…

307
00:34:15,117 --> 00:34:17,678
She wants to control everything in her hands.

308
00:34:17,678 --> 00:34:19,917
Hey, Is this what we already know?

309
00:34:26,143 --> 00:34:28,683
Drag you out of the dark to the light.

310
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:32,550
You can easily do all the bad things
but can't do them anymore.

311
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:35,117
Supporting people who repent.

312
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:38,917
Finally, she finds a way to get rid of you,

313
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:41,917
and dig a hole to bury all the
bad things she did with you forever.

314
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:46,117
She eventually becomes the judge
whose the whole town loves.

315
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:53,250
- You!
- You can't come in.

316
00:34:55,383 --> 00:34:56,150
Hey.

317
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,083
Win, do you hurt? Are you OK?

318
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:03,117
Win.

319
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:05,283
Why did you risk doing all of this by yourself?

320
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:07,901
If something happens to you, I will…

321
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,393
Who am I going to pay off my debt to?

322
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,550
It's like I'm not here.

323
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:24,040
Then why did you come here alone?

324
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:27,150
You know this place is a bandit's den.

325
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,612
It's like I do not exist.

326
00:35:34,492 --> 00:35:38,283
I'm afraid that if someone else comes,
you'll get in trouble again.

327
00:35:45,683 --> 00:35:46,683
Bro.

328
00:35:48,672 --> 00:35:49,672
Bro.

329
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:53,550
What did they do to you? Should we handle them?

330
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:55,675
Hey!

331
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,283
I helped your boss.

332
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:36,683
Since we have the same enemy.

333
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:41,317
Why don't we keep the peace
and expose Chalinee?

334
00:36:45,618 --> 00:36:46,618
OK, go on.

335
00:36:50,196 --> 00:36:53,050
You use your position
as Tulakham's mayor as a guarantee.

336
00:36:54,356 --> 00:36:57,717
You testify for Win to be acquitted.

337
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,550
So he can get out and deal with Judge Chalinee.

338
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,817
After that we'll take care of our business.

339
00:37:12,244 --> 00:37:13,983
What do you want me to say?

340
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:18,004
Confess that your subordinate killed Prem.

341
00:37:18,644 --> 00:37:21,145
What the hell are you talking about?
If I admit it, I…

342
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:22,145
I have a plan.

343
00:37:46,454 --> 00:37:47,617
Hear me out.

344
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,183
I swear that

345
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:00,583
I will testify truthfully in every respect.

346
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:05,483
And I will use my position as
Tulakham's mayor to guarantee that

347
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,550
what I will testify to the court today

348
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:10,817
will not be distorted

349
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:13,483
by fear of any power.

350
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:20,217
<i>Since now, we have the same enemy.</i>

351
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:25,279
<i>Why don't we keep the peace
and expose Chalinee?</i>

352
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,927
<i>You use your position as
Tulakham's mayor as a guarantee.</i>

353
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:30,917
<i>Go to the court.</i>

354
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:35,750
<i>You testify for Win to be acquitted.</i>

355
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:39,483
<i>So he can get out and deal with
Judge Chalinee.</i>

356
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,750
<i>And after that,</i>

357
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,783
<i>we'll take care of our business.</i>

358
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:47,598
Please invite the defense lawyer
to examine the witness.

359
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:52,650
<i>And what do you want me to say?</i>

360
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:56,983
<i>Confess that your subordinate killed Prem.</i>

361
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,117
My minion's name is Pued.

362
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:06,050
Pued is a fish market boy.

363
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:09,083
I have raised him since he was little.

364
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:11,983
He loves me a lot.

365
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,717
Then, Pued furious at the defendant

366
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:18,850
that he kept harassing me.

367
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,117
So he killed Mr. Prem.

368
00:39:23,047 --> 00:39:24,785
And then he places the blame on the defendant.

369
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:29,217
On that night.

370
00:39:30,283 --> 00:39:32,350
Why did you go to the hospital?

371
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:41,317
Pued came to confess with me.

372
00:39:43,517 --> 00:39:44,550
I felt guilty.

373
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,550
So I had to go to the hospital that night.

374
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:53,617
I apologize to Win on Pued's behalf.

375
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:56,550
But things went wrong.

376
00:39:57,417 --> 00:40:00,483
I have already sent him
to turn himself into the police.

377
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:03,650
Objection.

378
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:05,517
Sustained.

379
00:40:09,024 --> 00:40:11,591
You and the defendant have a conflict.

380
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,950
Why did you agree to testify for the defendant?

381
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:24,017
I have done many bad things in my life.

382
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:29,715
The fact that the townspeople
let me serve as Tulakham's mayor.

383
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:33,117
I have to do everything right.

384
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:40,283
I will do anything for Tulakham.

385
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:45,617
Except for one thing.

386
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:54,591
I will not be a traitor to Tulakham.

387
00:41:21,275 --> 00:41:23,083
This must be… Celebrate.

388
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:26,617
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

389
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:30,380
Mookata, Mookata, Mookata.

390
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,380
Stop.

391
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:34,778
No celebration. He just got back.

392
00:41:34,778 --> 00:41:35,900
Let him get some rest.

393
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Oh, what the hell.

394
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:38,404
Later.

395
00:41:38,404 --> 00:41:39,650
- Today, OK?
- What the hell.

396
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,650
Some other day.

397
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,650
Thank you very much, everyone.

398
00:41:43,613 --> 00:41:45,943
Oh, we barely did anything, brother.

399
00:41:45,943 --> 00:41:49,811
It's her. Prao has done all of this.

400
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:50,927
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

401
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,454
Let's celebrate.

402
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:17,383
Thank you for everything.

403
00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:20,983
And thank you for reminding Tan.

404
00:42:23,117 --> 00:42:26,517
You've protected and enlightened me.

405
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:32,117
From now on, I'll do everything
to help you overthrow Judge Chalinee.

406
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,717
I insist on my previous words.

407
00:42:36,183 --> 00:42:37,517
Revenge and all that stuff…

408
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,433
aren't as important as your safety.

409
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:46,317
If I hadn't you by my side,

410
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,317
I wouldn't have made it this far.

411
00:42:52,895 --> 00:42:54,383
Should I be happy?

412
00:42:58,303 --> 00:42:59,303
Prao.

413
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:06,917
Meeting you

414
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:12,050
is one of the best things in my life.

415
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,120
What about you?

416
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,150
How do you feel about me?

417
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:25,703
I…

418
00:43:29,217 --> 00:43:32,850
I… feel the same.

419
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:53,824
Hello.

420
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:59,117
Welcome to the "Tam Tueng Tee" show.

421
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:05,583
Today, I'm bringing you to the mayor's office.

422
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:08,723
I'm now with the mayor.

423
00:45:08,723 --> 00:45:09,875
Hello, sir.

424
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:10,950
Hello, Mr. Vichuthep.

425
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:16,483
<i>Your appearance as a witness.</i>

426
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:20,583
It's the talk of the town.

427
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,217
<i>- It's like you're taking your position</i>
- Here you are, two coffees, no sugar.

428
00:45:25,217 --> 00:45:26,331
<i>to hang on a thread.</i>

429
00:45:26,331 --> 00:45:27,657
Thank you.

430
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:28,983
<i>I'm aware that</i>

431
00:45:30,183 --> 00:45:35,068
<i>my decision might cause discomfort
to many parties.</i>

432
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:36,850
But as the mayor,

433
00:45:37,983 --> 00:45:40,883
I must help the judge uphold justice,

434
00:45:41,412 --> 00:45:44,804
even though I'm at risk.

435
00:45:44,804 --> 00:45:45,887
Can I ask you something?

436
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:46,719
Yes.

437
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:47,952
Are you worried?

438
00:45:50,192 --> 00:45:51,517
Am I worried?

439
00:45:53,404 --> 00:45:58,883
<i>Well… I would say
I am confident in my virginity.</i>

440
00:45:59,936 --> 00:46:01,088
<i>Wrong is wrong.</i>

441
00:46:01,834 --> 00:46:03,750
Even though he is my subordinate.

442
00:46:04,522 --> 00:46:07,783
Aren't you afraid that your reputation
will be tarnished?

443
00:46:08,426 --> 00:46:12,183
It's about the loyalty
my subordinates have towards me.

444
00:46:13,043 --> 00:46:14,850
So, if he wants to do something arbitrarily,

445
00:46:17,617 --> 00:46:20,298
well, if it's going to be tarnished,
that's the price I have to pay.

446
00:46:20,298 --> 00:46:25,376
You'll pay by… You'll bow down and apologize.

447
00:46:25,376 --> 00:46:30,650
I want to sincerely apologize
to him on behalf of my subordinate.

448
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:37,133
<i>It goes against the concerns
and uneasiness of many people.</i>

449
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:43,083
<i>But I have to say that your popularity
is skyrocketing right now.</i>

450
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:46,147
Have you had a chance to check
your feedback on social media?

451
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:49,283
I know nothing about social media.

452
00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:50,891
I haven't checked social media at all.
Not at all.

453
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,850
It's OK. I'll show you.

454
00:46:54,402 --> 00:46:56,706
<i>This is your total likes.</i>

455
00:46:56,706 --> 00:46:58,344
<i>And you look at each comment.</i>

456
00:46:58,344 --> 00:47:02,550
<i>Everyone gives you encouragement.
"I support you."</i>

457
00:47:03,136 --> 00:47:06,250
They sent you many hearts. "Keep fighting."

458
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:08,317
Olarn has become a hero.

459
00:47:11,442 --> 00:47:14,770
Thank you to everyone who believes in me.

460
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:21,617
And please be assured that I am doing this
for all the people of Tulakham.

461
00:47:22,521 --> 00:47:23,328
Thank you.

462
00:47:23,328 --> 00:47:26,912
Strike while the iron is hot!
Share this clip on the page.

463
00:47:27,488 --> 00:47:28,488
Yes, sir.

464
00:47:29,717 --> 00:47:33,117
What will Judge Chalinee say?

465
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,283
<i>OK, our "Tam Tueng Tee" show</i>

466
00:47:43,283 --> 00:47:47,550
<i>will follow up on the new mayor's work.</i>

467
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,217
<i>Thank you for watching.</i>

468
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:54,650
Look at this, madam.

469
00:47:55,283 --> 00:47:57,750
Olarn is really over the top.

470
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,283
He just pretends to be a sacrificer
and takes responsibility for his subordinates.

471
00:48:01,283 --> 00:48:03,783
He clearly turned a crisis into an opportunity.

472
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:05,483
Actually.

473
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:08,350
It would be better to call you
and make excuses.

474
00:48:10,371 --> 00:48:12,750
Or did you know in advance about the court?

475
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,835
Or did Mr. Olarn consult you?

476
00:48:16,835 --> 00:48:18,250
Right?

477
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,717
I knew this plan must be yours.

478
00:48:21,317 --> 00:48:22,850
That gangster from the rice soup shop.

479
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,883
He can't think of anything clever like this.

480
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,183
Whoa!

481
00:48:30,183 --> 00:48:32,383
The number of likes is higher
than the previous clip.

482
00:48:34,217 --> 00:48:36,650
Olarn must be very cheerful now.

483
00:48:37,917 --> 00:48:39,983
He's so arrogant.

484
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,012
He definitely thinks
he will be as popular as…

485
00:48:43,669 --> 00:48:45,950
As you.

486
00:49:08,472 --> 00:49:10,302
You're back to work now, aren't you?

487
00:49:10,302 --> 00:49:11,302
Yes.

488
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,750
Kom.

489
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:17,517
The judges seem busy lately.

490
00:49:18,983 --> 00:49:20,117
Try to find out.

491
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,517
Just in case we can help her in some way.

492
00:49:39,883 --> 00:49:41,017
Kom.

493
00:49:42,402 --> 00:49:43,402
Yes.

494
00:49:44,895 --> 00:49:45,917
Keep it quiet.

495
00:49:59,493 --> 00:50:00,850
Service him. Come on.

496
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:01,860
Yeah, service him.

497
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,483
- Do you want to drink something?
- What do you want? Water?

498
00:50:03,483 --> 00:50:04,419
What do you want to drink, bro?

499
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:05,583
- Plain water.
- Plain water.

500
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:08,550
- Hey, your drink is the same.
- It's the same plain water.

501
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:10,179
OK, I'll go get it for you.

502
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:12,337
No problem, I'll handle it.

503
00:50:12,337 --> 00:50:14,385
I'll go get it. I'm the fastest.

504
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,517
Hey Jam, get me some water.

505
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:22,859
What? I'm eating.

506
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:24,350
Hey, you guys service him.

507
00:50:40,678 --> 00:50:42,083
I'm still wondering.

508
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:46,502
Why does Judge Chalinee
want me to win this case?

509
00:50:47,117 --> 00:50:49,017
She might want us to get rid of Olarn.

510
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,411
But it might be too late.

511
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:54,350
So she sent someone to get Olarn
and me at the hospital at once.

512
00:50:55,744 --> 00:50:58,050
How did you know Chalinee ordered them?

513
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:01,450
They were Olarn's old minion, and…

514
00:51:06,549 --> 00:51:07,549
Mek's minion.

515
00:51:08,122 --> 00:51:10,617
So,
does that mean someone is replacing Olarn now?

516
00:51:30,448 --> 00:51:33,776
Have your man take Prangthip
to search this place.

517
00:51:33,776 --> 00:51:36,917
I need to check if there is something
I need to clean up.

518
00:51:37,936 --> 00:51:38,936
Shin.

519
00:51:39,717 --> 00:51:41,550
Yes, please follow me.

520
00:51:56,992 --> 00:52:02,983
Lawyer Boripat had someone send me
these pictures to threaten me.

521
00:52:09,024 --> 00:52:11,840
He needs me to testify.

522
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,085
Otherwise, he'll use these pictures against me.

523
00:52:16,177 --> 00:52:22,283
You probably want Lawyer Praochanok
to win the case.

524
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:28,217
Oh, of course.

525
00:52:30,655 --> 00:52:34,750
I have to drive justice
in all forms in Tulakham.

526
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:41,608
And you must support my orders.

527
00:52:41,608 --> 00:52:45,640
Which I have done all my life if you remember.

528
00:53:01,983 --> 00:53:03,812
And if you are worried about me,

529
00:53:04,483 --> 00:53:06,350
what can I do to protect myself?

530
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:37,183
The one who truly protects Tulakham
must not be a traitor.

531
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,883
Don't do anything behind my back.

532
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:13,069
Hand over the New Tulakham project to Chairman Lee.
<i>[Next Episode]</i>

533
00:54:13,069 --> 00:54:17,505
He will benefit greatly from this project.

534
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:19,744
We don't know about this.

535
00:54:20,381 --> 00:54:25,694
Because we are definitely going to be ditched.

536
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,651
I don't want you to see Prao again.

537
00:54:32,578 --> 00:54:34,349
Because you're Chalinee's people.
