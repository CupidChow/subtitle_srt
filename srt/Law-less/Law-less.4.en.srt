6
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:08,504
Don't come any closer.

7
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:13,141
I checked the phone.

8
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:16,093
The number the assassin calls most often.
It's the Agent's number.

9
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:18,823
I'll be a Tulakham's mayor.

10
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:21,345
I will revive the New Tulakham project.

11
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:24,427
I've arrested the Agent
who got the mayor killed.

12
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:27,919
And I'm handing over this witness
to Prosecutor Erika.

13
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,738
Aren't you afraid that I'll win?

14
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:33,692
His only chance to enter the trial is with you.

15
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,754
These are the missing person's files
when your mother went missing.

16
00:02:36,754 --> 00:02:39,300
How many people have died at Phi Phluk cliff?

17
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,481
And the day my mother disappeared,

18
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:43,319
did someone jump off the cliff?

19
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:47,926
You set me up in the first place.

20
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:51,116
Stay here for a while.

21
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:53,398
Then, I'll find a way to help you.

22
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:55,199
It won't be long.

23
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,694
You bastard!

24
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:03,798
Anyway, you and I are both Tulakham people.

25
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,910
Thank you.

26
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:12,977
For what?

27
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:15,617
You are a bit stubborn, though.

28
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:18,483
Once you come in, everything goes well.

29
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,648
Then, would you lower the debt?

30
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:27,850
I'm doing my job.

31
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:31,183
And you should follow the rules.

32
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:35,650
And please prove it to me quickly.

33
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,483
Unless I'll get tired of this job soon.

34
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,639
Not so soon.

35
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:44,407
A suspicious girl like you
will believe it without a doubt.

36
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:54,886
Hello.

37
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:57,014
Olarn has sent his man here.

38
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,383
They're going to different spots.

39
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:00,419
<i>Keep an eye on him.</i>

40
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:06,065
So what are you going to do next?

41
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,783
Oh, man.

42
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:16,183
Is the trial in court not enough, Mr. Chairman?

43
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:18,950
Calm down, Sergeant.

44
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,083
The case isn't over yet.

45
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:24,017
We've come this far.

46
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:26,579
It won't be long.

47
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:28,750
This guy…

48
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,617
must be dragged into this.

49
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:33,217
Itt.

50
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,846
You stay here for a while.

51
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:39,050
Let me manage New Tulakham.

52
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,283
Then I'll help you out.

53
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:41,655
Live together like before.

54
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:42,655
No more, man.

55
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:47,517
I've done a lot for you.

56
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:49,683
It's time to do for my mom.

57
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:56,750
My boys are unreliable, man.

58
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,983
They're unstable.

59
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,283
They take good care of her today, but tomorrow…

60
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,783
they might be upset.

61
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:03,883
Listen to me.

62
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,050
I will never die in prison.

63
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,483
I need to go out and take care of my mother.

64
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:15,457
I'll never let you use me again.

65
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:18,517
You have to live here.

66
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,717
I'll live outside.

67
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:28,017
If it doesn't go this way.

68
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,883
I don't guarantee your safety.

69
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:39,411
Is there a problem?

70
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,283
If we want this guy to be a witness,

71
00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:47,717
we have to accept the risk.

72
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:53,089
So we can fight them, right?

73
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:54,089
Don't worry.

74
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,150
I have a backup plan.

75
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:15,942
Sir, if the Agent tells the truth.
What should we do?

76
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:21,303
Prosecutor Erika wouldn't lose face
by losing this case.

77
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,017
If he's a witness for that side,

78
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,725
how can he be useful to us?

79
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,817
I'm sure.

80
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:36,350
Everything will be on our side.

81
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,617
Kom.

82
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:41,617
If you were me,

83
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:46,350
would you let go of your dreams?

84
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:49,516
No, sir.

85
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:58,412
Let the Agent speak as a witness.

86
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:02,789
And everything he says must benefit us.

87
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,250
Yes, sir.

88
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,883
I would like to ask the witness.

89
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,483
Did you know the deceased, Mr. Aung?

90
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:11,749
No.

91
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,631
Did you receive any jobs from the defendant?

92
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:18,783
I didn't.

93
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,727
I used the wrong question, your honor.

94
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:23,550
I should have asked.

95
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:30,079
Has someone ordered you to hire an
assassin to kill the former mayor of Tulakham?

96
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,183
Objection.

97
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:33,399
This irrelevant question

98
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,875
will unnecessarily prolong the trial.

99
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,350
Sustained.

100
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,350
Please ask the necessary questions.

101
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,450
<i>I'll go to the bathroom.</i>

102
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,331
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

103
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:11,326
<i>[Your son is in court now.
Please go and cheer him up.]</i>

104
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:15,211
<i>[Your son is in court now.]</i>

105
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:19,950
<i>[Please go and cheer him up.]</i>

106
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:26,875
Your honor.

107
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,325
From the evidence, we found that this witness

108
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,283
has made phone calls to Mr. Aung

109
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:33,742
and he has a drug-related background.

110
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:37,175
Turns out that there is no record
in the system.

111
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:38,317
What does that mean?

112
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:40,675
You don't have to answer.

113
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,125
He is a big player in the gray business,
and has been arrested.

114
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,617
But there is no record in the history at all.

115
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:51,817
What does that mean?

116
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:59,025
Maybe he has money, power,
or complete orders from a big boss.

117
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:01,742
That's why he's so clean.

118
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,025
You don't have to answer.

119
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,517
Your honor.

120
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:06,801
The defense lawyer is buying time.

121
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:09,169
Lawyer, please be cautious.

122
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:12,683
It's your choice.

123
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:16,517
You can tell the truth about
whose money you received or hide it.

124
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:18,317
If you refuse to tell the truth.

125
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:19,783
I will…

126
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:22,383
drag you out of the witness stand

127
00:09:22,383 --> 00:09:24,317
to the defendant's stand.

128
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,683
Your honor.

129
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:29,083
The defense lawyer is threatening
the witness.

130
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,330
Lawyer, please be cautious.

131
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:37,154
It's an honor to be here as a witness.

132
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:41,250
You can speak in front of your mother
that you will protect the truth.

133
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,183
<i>[It's nothing, mom.]</i>

134
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,617
<i>[Don't worry.]</i>

135
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:15,783
I'm ready to tell you.

136
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,617
You don't have to answer.

137
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:31,183
I was hired

138
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,450
to find a gunman

139
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:37,775
to kill the former mayor.

140
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,343
Who is that?

141
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,125
He is…

142
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:57,283
President Olarn's secretary.

143
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:05,350
This Agent also has a side
that wants to protect someone.

144
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,983
He probably doesn't want to show
some sides to his mother.

145
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:13,348
Everyone has someone they want to protect.

146
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:19,099
That's why you didn't rashly grab him
in front of his mother.

147
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:25,950
After this,

148
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,983
we'll have to find an employer
above the secretary, right?

149
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:34,914
Do you still need Sargent Itt?

150
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,317
I'm sorry, sir.

151
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:46,850
You go hide somewhere.

152
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,717
Don't let anyone know.

153
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,399
You can get money from Shin.

154
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,350
Yes, sir.

155
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:11,383
Oh, Prao.

156
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:12,575
Sit down.

157
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:13,625
Hello, ma'am.

158
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,688
Hello.

159
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:16,989
Look…

160
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,917
Today's case is a historical case.

161
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:24,850
Thank you very much.

162
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,150
For allowing Lawyer Boripat
to do his duty for justice.

163
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:29,835
And…

164
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,332
Thank you on behalf of Sargent Itt as well.

165
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:34,517
It's normal.

166
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:39,697
That the beneficiaries
will try to turn white into black

167
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:41,417
by forcing new evidence.

168
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:46,683
But my duty is to weigh fairly

169
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:49,950
without any feelings involved.

170
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:54,850
If Win's not sure,

171
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,817
he would give important evidence
to Attorney Erika.

172
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:02,201
That's right.

173
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,717
But helping Sargent Itt is not his end goal.

174
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:11,697
It's Mr. Olarn.

175
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,583
You can see through people now.

176
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:38,383
<i>This is the missing person case file
when your mother went missing.</i>

177
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,183
<i>Only this copy remains.</i>

178
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:42,825
<i>The original file is all gone.</i>

179
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:44,183
<i>On that day, my mother went missing.</i>

180
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:45,950
<i>Did someone else jump off a cliff?</i>

181
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:52,173
<i>I'm Boripat Preechachai, the defense lawyer.</i>

182
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:13,435
<i>[Report a missing person on 18 May B.E.2549
Mrs. Chawanan Preechachai]</i>

183
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:17,183
I want you to tell me about the judge.

184
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:21,650
Do you know that…

185
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:26,217
Olarn inherited the business from Kamnan Chot?

186
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,400
And do you know who's his child?

187
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:38,288
Judge Chalinee.

188
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:42,417
Whatever Olarn did.

189
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,083
Someone in the shadow is manipulating it.

190
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:48,217
But he never says who that is.

191
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:52,183
There's only one person in this whole town

192
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,917
who can order Olarn.

193
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,650
You don't need to know.

194
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,950
It's beyond your power.

195
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,350
I believe nothing is beyond the power of law.

196
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,150
And I believe that

197
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,650
justice really exists.

198
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:29,483
Excuse me.

199
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:33,545
I wonder if you know this place?

200
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:36,025
It used to be a law firm.

201
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:39,183
But the owner is a woman,
and she has a son.

202
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:41,450
I've never seen it before.

203
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,350
This one?

204
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,507
Never seen this before?

205
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:45,595
Yes, never.

206
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:48,883
Excuse me, have you ever seen
this place before?

207
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:49,917
Thank you.

208
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,400
Never seen?

209
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,417
Do you know?

210
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,381
- I've never seen it.
- No.

211
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:57,789
- No.
- No.

212
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:00,861
The document I gave you is the last one.

213
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:05,042
In this city, they closed
the missing person cases in two years.

214
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:08,550
I haven't been involved
in this case for a long time.

215
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:14,357
I just want to know if on the same day,

216
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:18,150
there is a case or an incident
related or connected in some way.

217
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:21,850
Let's see what I can do.

218
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,351
But don't expect too much.

219
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,983
I believe that my mother is still alive.

220
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:32,917
I won't give up easily.

221
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,117
Anyway, please inform me.

222
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:37,117
Yes, I will.

223
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:39,825
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

224
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,583
Are you going solo today?

225
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,150
I want to know the secretary's progress.

226
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:59,380
We're tracking him down.

227
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:02,717
It's strange.

228
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,783
He moves quickly.

229
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:14,049
You're not doubting me, are you?

230
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:19,117
I suspect the people in your office.

231
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,657
You guys still come even in the late night.

232
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:33,250
What else do you want to trick me?

233
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:35,250
I knew.

234
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,057
That lawyer convinced you that we fool you.

235
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:40,917
I don't need anyone to persuade me.

236
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:43,183
I know what kind of person you are.

237
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,850
Yeah.

238
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,683
That's right, dude. We're really old friends.

239
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,217
Then, let me get to the point.

240
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,150
Next trial.

241
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,950
You plead guilty, as we discussed.

242
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,083
Why would I do that?

243
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:09,483
If you say what I have written,

244
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,137
you will be sentenced to less than ten years.

245
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:14,383
Confessing will reduce the sentence,

246
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,850
seven years at maximum.

247
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:20,417
If you behave well in prison,

248
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,296
your sentence will gradually be reduced.

249
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:25,730
I think you will get out within three years.

250
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,983
Yeah.

251
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,117
Seeing your hopeful face like this, I'm glad.

252
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:51,650
Stop fooling me.

253
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,787
A guy like you,

254
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:55,683
has no sincerity for anyone.

255
00:19:58,517 --> 00:20:00,450
We're done!

256
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:04,283
Guard!

257
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:06,683
Guard!

258
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:26,650
Sorry for the urgent call.

259
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,683
I just wanted to ask about the secretary.

260
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:33,083
He escaped before we issued the warrant.

261
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,375
How did he know?

262
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,783
I don't know either.

263
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,134
Are you sure we don't have a leak?

264
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:42,817
I don't think so.

265
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,250
Um… ma'am.

266
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:48,117
I want to warn you to think carefully.

267
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:50,261
About what?

268
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:52,085
That you turn the case to help Sargent Itt.

269
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:58,672
We must protect him if he's really innocent.

270
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:02,389
I have to find out the truth.

271
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:05,383
Make it big and clear like this.

272
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:07,275
So people will get the right number, sir.

273
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:08,383
Good.

274
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:09,450
Go ahead, Shin.

275
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:11,550
Okay.

276
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,905
You do it like this.

277
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,950
As much as you can, understand?

278
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,718
Yes sir.

279
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:17,718
Very good.

280
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:19,716
Hello.

281
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:20,642
<i>Hello, Mr. Olarn.</i>

282
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:23,675
Prosecutor Erika gradually suspects us

283
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:26,253
<i>that Kom went missing.</i>

284
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:27,405
So what?

285
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:30,225
<i>I'm afraid she'll turn the case,
and help Sargent Itt walk away.</i>

286
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:31,700
And after that, she'll trace it
all the way to…

287
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,125
So what do you want?

288
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:37,079
If you want more money in exchange
for stopping that prosecutor,

289
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,283
I can handle it myself.

290
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:41,817
But if you're thinking of blackmailing me,

291
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,672
you should know who you're dealing with.

292
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:45,875
No, Mr. Olarn.

293
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,017
<i>I just want to tell you to be careful.</i>

294
00:21:48,017 --> 00:21:49,083
<i>So you don't…</i>

295
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:57,540
Please let me go!

296
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,868
<i>No, Olarn.</i>

297
00:21:58,868 --> 00:21:59,901
<i>No, no.</i>

298
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,451
<i>Where will you run to, mayor?</i>

299
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,817
<i>No, no, no.</i>

300
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,950
<i>No, no, no.</i>

301
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,417
Good.

302
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:33,850
I knew it all.

303
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,583
That one day you'll come to me.

304
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:40,083
And I also know why you come to me.

305
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:44,009
What do you plan to do to Tulakham?

306
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:45,417
I also think

307
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,583
that you wouldn't come here

308
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,517
without knowing anything about us.

309
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:54,671
Yes.

310
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:59,583
Then you must know Win is my nephew by blood.

311
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,905
His mother and I are siblings.

312
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:06,017
So Win is the only nephew I have.

313
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:09,497
His return to Tulakham

314
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:13,273
was his own free will since he first came here,

315
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:16,456
including pulling you into the team.

316
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,983
He watched over you and protected you

317
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:23,967
since he studied law.

318
00:24:26,935 --> 00:24:28,483
I want to assure you that

319
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,283
he definitely has good intentions for you.

320
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,791
Okay, what do you have?

321
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:49,185
I can help you get away with it
and return to your mother.

322
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,883
The trial is in a few days.

323
00:24:52,883 --> 00:24:56,183
If you don't make a decision quickly,
you're barely survive.

324
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:09,517
I promise.

325
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,283
You won't die in prison.

326
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:18,550
I'll die from your hands outside, right?

327
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,583
Prao got here.

328
00:26:06,283 --> 00:26:07,783
<i>And…</i>

329
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:09,553
<i>if we're talking about Tulakham,</i>

330
00:26:09,553 --> 00:26:11,490
<i>Win often talks about that cliff.</i>

331
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,642
<i>Phi Phluk Cliff.</i>

332
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:15,798
<i>Yes.</i>

333
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:22,437
<i>[Report of a missing person,
Ms. Chawanan Preechachai]</i>

334
00:26:59,673 --> 00:27:00,889
You're not going home?

335
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:07,301
Many things are going on in my head.

336
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,908
It would be suffocating to go back.

337
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:13,717
What about you?

338
00:27:17,173 --> 00:27:18,250
Me too.

339
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,117
In the past,

340
00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:27,917
I know nothing about you.

341
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,690
Today, I realize that…

342
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,383
Everything that happened
was your plan from the beginning.

343
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:40,883
You could say that.

344
00:27:43,217 --> 00:27:44,750
I survived

345
00:27:47,483 --> 00:27:49,783
because a woman helped me.

346
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,317
Who is she?

347
00:28:07,747 --> 00:28:09,600
Wait, you haven't told me yet.

348
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,217
Who is the woman who helped you?

349
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,650
She might be my mother.

350
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:18,373
Do you remember what she looked like?

351
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:31,251
<i>Hey, where are you going?</i>

352
00:28:36,517 --> 00:28:38,017
<i>Go!</i>

353
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:39,017
<i>Run away!</i>

354
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:40,850
<i>Go! Hurry up!</i>

355
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,183
<i>Go! Go!</i>

356
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:45,317
I was so young back then.

357
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:47,503
I remember nothing.

358
00:28:47,503 --> 00:28:48,625
And…

359
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:53,809
What about shape, hairstyle,
dress color, or whatever?

360
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:56,369
You can't remember anything at all?
That woman saved you.

361
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:58,683
Everything happened so fast.

362
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,417
I really can't remember.

363
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,399
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:14,182 --> 00:29:15,183
It's okay.

365
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,439
I'm sorry, too.

366
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:24,817
I'm usually like this
when thinking about my mom.

367
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:27,150
I totally understand.

368
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,750
When I was young.

369
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:32,417
My mother used to take me for a walk here.

370
00:29:34,192 --> 00:29:35,717
There was no shrine at that time.

371
00:29:37,328 --> 00:29:38,396
Really?

372
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:43,783
The shrine was established
after people jumped off the cliff.

373
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,217
I told you.

374
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,217
They didn't jump themselves.

375
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:53,617
The locals believe that this place is haunted.

376
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,150
When the shrine was established,

377
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,383
no one dares to come here at night.

378
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,217
So it's easier for them to do.

379
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,950
I'm sorry about your mother.

380
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,563
But you want me to believe that
the person behind all this is…

381
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:14,437
I haven't proved anything, it's…

382
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,717
It's okay.

383
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:16,750
You still have time.

384
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:33,683
It's a bad time for Chairman Olarn.

385
00:30:33,683 --> 00:30:37,710
Apart from this, his secretary
has been involved in a big case.

386
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:40,617
I also had to file a lawsuit.

387
00:30:40,617 --> 00:30:42,083
I sue Chairman Olarn

388
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:45,753
regarding his land overlapping
with state land.

389
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:49,337
You seem so confident.
Do you have a solid evidence?

390
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,463
Yes.

391
00:30:56,626 --> 00:30:59,175
In the case where Mr. Apai Maneejamnong

392
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:01,950
filed a complaint with
the Tulakham City Prosecutor,

393
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:07,850
accusing Olarn Group of planting
crops in the company's vacant land

394
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:12,750
to make up an agricultural area
to avoid paying land taxes,

395
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,550
which is damaging to the city.

396
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,954
The court considered the investigation results
of the prosecutor's officers

397
00:31:18,954 --> 00:31:25,717
and found that Olarn Group harvested
the products grown in the area to sell

398
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:32,417
and use the profit for charity.

399
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:36,983
This is considered a regular
social activity of the company.

400
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:41,425
Since there was no evidence
of any intention to avoid land tax,

401
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:45,150
the court ruled to dismiss the case.

402
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,950
End of trial.

403
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:59,683
What's your further plan, Mr. Olarn?

404
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:04,083
Actually, I would like to donate money

405
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:09,650
as much as this city should receive
from my land tax

406
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,131
for the public benefit of Tulakham.

407
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,183
Good.

408
00:32:14,883 --> 00:32:16,931
It's good to be a giver.

409
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:21,625
Even if you look from Mars, you'll know
it's fake.

410
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:24,313
Anyway, it's better than exploiting the town.

411
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:31,317
Thank you, Apai, for filing this lawsuit.

412
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:35,717
I realize there are honest mistakes

413
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:38,117
that I need to fix.

414
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:39,550
Honest mistakes?

415
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,450
You're ready to be a politician, huh?

416
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,983
Well, whatever you are.

417
00:32:45,983 --> 00:32:51,367
I will never stop holding it against you.

418
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:53,950
Wait, Mr. Apai.

419
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,417
I really mean to thank you.

420
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:57,850
Let's stop fighting,

421
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,550
and make this city better.

422
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,283
We have different opinions,
but we don't have to be divided.

423
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:10,603
Oh, Mr. Apai, don't you agree?

424
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:18,217
I agree with you, Prao.

425
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:21,431
What is it, ma'am?

426
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:26,091
Even though I know what he's like
and what he's done,

427
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:30,251
when the evidence shows that
he is not guilty, so be it.

428
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,540
Yes, ma'am.

429
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:42,224
I don't know whether he is truly remorseful
or just pretending.

430
00:33:42,224 --> 00:33:44,383
But at least he's willing to
donate money to the city.

431
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:45,750
It's useful somehow.

432
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:48,950
Come on.

433
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:50,891
Prao.

434
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:51,957
Let's go have lunch.

435
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:59,849
I have to head back and clear up my work.

436
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,889
<i>The court dismissed the charge against me.</i>

437
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,650
<i>But I feel sorry.</i>

438
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,561
<i>I intend to do something good.</i>

439
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:23,409
<i>It turned out to cause an adverse effect
I didn't expect for my beloved Tulakham.</i>

440
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:26,609
<i>So what's your plan, Mr. Olarn?</i>

441
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:33,521
<i>I would like to donate money as much as
this city should receive from my land tax.</i>

442
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,059
<i>For the public benefit of Tulakham.</i>

443
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:40,839
<i>Mr. Olarn is a real saint.</i>

444
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:45,125
<i>Even though he's not guilty,
he donates millions to the city.</i>

445
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,725
<i>He has a good heart.</i>

446
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:50,317
<i>Oh, I know who he is in the past.</i>

447
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:52,517
<i>I don't believe in this case.</i>

448
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:53,850
I believe in a good man.

449
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,343
From what I've seen,

450
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,000
I think Mr. Olarn is the best
of all the candidates.

451
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,583
He's respectable.

452
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,783
<i>As he runs for the election…</i>

453
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:10,421
Ma'am, look at this.

454
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,500
Olarn gains popularity in a cliche way.

455
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,484
Fortunately, the townspeople are weak-minded.

456
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:37,124
<i>[So tragic! Human rights lawyer

458
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:45,750
<i>Whatever Olarn did.</i>

459
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,283
<i>Someone in the shadow is manipulating it.</i>

460
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,583
<i>But it never said who it was.</i>

461
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,417
<i>There's only one person in this whole town</i>

462
00:35:57,383 --> 00:35:59,250
<i>who can order Olarn.</i>

463
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:23,193

464
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:25,483

00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,409

<i>Do you remember what she looked like?</i>

470
00:37:03,153 --> 00:37:05,283
What the hell!

471
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:08,934
Why didn't you guys come all at once? Huh?

472
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,550
It won't take long.

473
00:37:16,379 --> 00:37:18,883
Come on, just say it.

474
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:20,383
I'm getting sleepy now.

475
00:37:23,355 --> 00:37:26,450
The day you were ordered
to kill Lawyer Boripat.

476
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:28,283
That night.

477
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,183
A woman helped him, right?

478
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:35,983
Who is that woman?

479
00:37:35,983 --> 00:37:37,283
Why she was there?

480
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:40,617
Why?

481
00:37:40,617 --> 00:37:41,817
Why do you need to know?

482
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:45,783
Answer me, Sargent.

483
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:47,845
Who is that woman?

484
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:50,725
What did she look like? What was she wearing?

485
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:53,283
I can't remember.

486
00:37:53,283 --> 00:37:55,050
That was decades ago.

487
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,551
I don't know who she is.

488
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:58,383
Then where did you take her?

489
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:01,950
Why are you pressuring me? Huh?

490
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,167
Just one woman, why do you care?

491
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:06,215
Because she might be my mother.

492
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:10,663
Sargent.

493
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:15,050
She is my mother, right?

494
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,917
A reporter named Haruetai.

495
00:38:19,183 --> 00:38:20,483
You know her, right?

496
00:38:20,483 --> 00:38:21,983
Is it her, Sargent?

497
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:25,117
Answer me, Sargent.

498
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,017
Do you know for how long
I've had to endure this feeling?

499
00:38:30,957 --> 00:38:34,157
Where did my mom go?
Is she still alive out there?

500
00:38:34,157 --> 00:38:35,437
I don't know. Guard.

501
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:36,017
Sargent.

502
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:36,849
Hurry up, man.

503
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:37,300
Sargent, answer me.

504
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,983
Hey, hurry up, guard.

505
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:39,850
Sargent.

506
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,317
- Tell me where she is.
- I don't know.

507
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:43,287
- I don't know.
- Take it easy.

508
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,583
- Take me quickly.
- Sargent.

509
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,683
Where did you keep my mom, Sargent?

510
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:47,745
Calm down, calm down.

511
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:49,550
Take me away. Close the door.

512
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,217
You…

513
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,550
How could you live with…

514
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:26,250
this feeling for decades?

515
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:46,283
I know I have important things to do.

516
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:15,983
I just realized how bad it is.

517
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:19,050
How can you control yourself?

518
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,050
When you faced Sargent Itt or even Olarn.

519
00:41:23,087 --> 00:41:24,775
Because I have a bigger goal.

520
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:27,095
Judge Chalinee.

521
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,350
Do you start to believe me?

522
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,150
I don't know.

523
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,183
But I promise.

524
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,950
After this, I will help you as much as I can.

525
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:45,050
I'll accept the up-coming truth.

526
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:49,950
Even if it destroys your faith

527
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,317
that you have for Judge Chalinee?

528
00:41:57,545 --> 00:41:58,583
When the time comes

529
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,617
we must face the truth.

530
00:42:02,883 --> 00:42:04,983
It's impossible to lie to yourself forever.

531
00:42:07,305 --> 00:42:09,183
Especially for the lawyers like us.

532
00:42:23,283 --> 00:42:24,617
Sir.

533
00:42:24,617 --> 00:42:26,517
Prosecutor Erika has come to see you.

534
00:42:31,317 --> 00:42:32,377
Please.

535
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:38,117
I'm happy to help, Ms. Prosecutor.

536
00:42:38,117 --> 00:42:39,117
Please sit.

537
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:43,459
Since running for mayor,
you're using politician-like language.

538
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:45,317
You're very observant, Aeri.

539
00:42:45,883 --> 00:42:47,299
That's appropriate.

540
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:50,217
Your mother pushed you
to become a city prosecutor.

541
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:52,617
Oh, how is she?

542
00:42:53,128 --> 00:42:56,075
I haven't seen her since I ran the election.

543
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:57,083
She's fine.

544
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,939
I have something important to talk to you.

545
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:04,843
Prosecutor Erika is here,
so it must be important.

546
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:09,350
I want to know how much you know

547
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,350
about the disappearance of Kom.

548
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:20,435
You believe that Lawyer Win, huh?

549
00:43:20,947 --> 00:43:22,250
Please answer my question.

550
00:43:25,468 --> 00:43:28,650
This is not a court.

551
00:43:29,162 --> 00:43:31,583
Don't bother using the attorney's words.

552
00:43:35,452 --> 00:43:36,517
So what?

553
00:43:37,217 --> 00:43:39,868
How much do you know about his disappearance?

554
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,183
If you can't explain it,

555
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:45,017
you will become a suspect
in the former mayor's case.

556
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:53,850
I don't understand why you
suspect me or Kom.

557
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:59,383
You saw evidence pointing out
who was the murderer.

558
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:00,788
It's Sargent Itt.

559
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:02,517
I just think logically.

560
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:06,340
If it's baseless, why would he run away?

561
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,917
Do you have an explanation?

562
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:13,583
Are you serious?

563
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:17,350
I don't need to answer you here.

564
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,060
Let's talk in court.

565
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:41,451
Just so you know, I will find out
the truth about this whole story.

566
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:03,100
I'm very excited to interview…

567
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,283
the candidate for new mayor of Tulakham.

568
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:11,350
The candidate
who received the most votes from the audience

569
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:15,250
for me to ask questions today is…

570
00:45:17,383 --> 00:45:20,750
Mr. Olarn Khamphithak.

571
00:45:21,934 --> 00:45:24,046
Take pictures, take pictures.

572
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:27,017
Hello.

573
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,250
Thank you very much for coming today.

574
00:45:33,245 --> 00:45:34,550
You made the right decision.

575
00:45:35,383 --> 00:45:36,450
But seriously,

576
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,250
if you hadn't been one of them
at the beginning,

577
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,185
these bad things wouldn't have happened.

578
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:43,650
Hey, let's not rehash this.

579
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,562
We can't go back and fix anything.

580
00:45:46,562 --> 00:45:49,698
But you can help us fix what will happen.

581
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,750
You must help us.

582
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,683
Is there any other evidence that can clear you?

583
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,812
Evidence?

584
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:13,950
<i>Itt.</i>

585
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,317
<i>That's your shirt.</i>

586
00:46:16,317 --> 00:46:17,483
<i>Your shoes.</i>

587
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:20,083
<i>Great evidence.</i>

588
00:46:24,301 --> 00:46:25,783
If I remember correctly.

589
00:46:27,304 --> 00:46:28,304
That day.

590
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:31,693
There was a courier truck parked there, too.

591
00:46:31,693 --> 00:46:34,350
I remember from the clip Olarn showed me.

592
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,453
A TLK company courier truck is parked there.

593
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:40,450
Normally, this kind of truck

594
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,183
would have a dash cam, right?

595
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:46,617
So if we find that car, we have a hope.

596
00:46:50,509 --> 00:46:51,583
Are you sure, Sargent?

597
00:46:53,197 --> 00:46:55,178
It's the only thing I can think of right now.

598
00:46:57,613 --> 00:47:02,383
Normally, the dash cam
will record the event repeatedly.

599
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:05,283
This event happened a long time ago.

600
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:08,650
Maybe, if we hurry,

601
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,617
we might get the footage
before they're deleted.

602
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:20,450
Alright, here's the question
we've selected from the audience.

603
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:21,788
Are you ready, Mr. Olarn?

604
00:47:21,788 --> 00:47:22,575
Please.

605
00:47:22,575 --> 00:47:23,950
Here's the question.

606
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:27,617
How do you feel about being seen

607
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:32,283
as the successor of influence
to the late Kamnan Chot?

608
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,417
Yes.

609
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:43,150
I am the successor of Kamnan Chot's influence.

610
00:47:46,436 --> 00:47:47,483
But

611
00:47:48,483 --> 00:47:50,983
it is an influence of thought

612
00:47:50,983 --> 00:47:55,083
that wants to see our Tulakham
develop and flourish.

613
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,325
- Olarn, Olarn, Olarn.
- Olarn, Olarn, Olarn.

614
00:48:03,325 --> 00:48:05,789
Yes, thank you.

615
00:48:11,285 --> 00:48:12,483
I would like to ask.

616
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,650
Can I ask now?

617
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:22,475
I have to… I beg your pardon, Mr. Apai.

618
00:48:22,475 --> 00:48:24,325
We didn't inform…

619
00:48:24,325 --> 00:48:26,325
I'm happy to answer your questions, Mr. Apai.

620
00:48:29,605 --> 00:48:31,117
Mr. Apai, please ask.

621
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:32,683
Thank you.

622
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:36,550
Your business in the Olarn Group.

623
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,470
Everyone knows that

624
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,883
it was inherited from Kamnan Chot.

625
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,417
In the past,

626
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:46,617
it has caused many problems
for the townspeople of Tulakham.

627
00:48:48,609 --> 00:48:50,483
So I want to know

628
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:53,917
if you were the city's mayor,

629
00:48:55,427 --> 00:49:01,750
how would you remedy
the suffering caused by the Olarn Group?

630
00:49:05,397 --> 00:49:07,412
You don't need to wait for me
to become a mayor.

631
00:49:10,517 --> 00:49:11,577
Shin.

632
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,950
I would like to give this ten million baht to…

633
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:27,000
- Ten million!
- Ten million!

634
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,150
Judge Chalinee's Foundation.

635
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:33,683
And…

636
00:49:33,683 --> 00:49:37,408
why Judge Chalinee's foundation?

637
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:38,883
The Judge Foundation

638
00:49:38,883 --> 00:49:42,250
has continuously provided care
and assistance to the Tulakham's people.

639
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,117
I believe that.

640
00:49:45,117 --> 00:49:50,355
The foundation can use this money
to create the most benefit

641
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:52,817
to those who are truly in need.

642
00:49:52,817 --> 00:49:59,309
It's the same as we are confident
in the judge's fairness, right?

643
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:00,749
- Yes.
- Yes.

644
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,450
And for you, Apai.

645
00:50:12,817 --> 00:50:13,983
What you did

646
00:50:15,983 --> 00:50:17,183
is a mirror

647
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:23,283
reflecting and making me see the mistakes
I made in the past.

648
00:50:25,297 --> 00:50:28,583
Without you, I wouldn't be able to think.

649
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:30,917
I do appreciate it.

650
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:34,417
And…

651
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,450
Take a shot, take a shot.

652
00:50:39,843 --> 00:50:41,750
You don't have to do this.

653
00:50:49,717 --> 00:50:52,655
That's awesome. Our Olarn.

654
00:50:52,655 --> 00:51:06,287
Olarn, Olarn, Olarn.

655
00:51:09,617 --> 00:51:11,583
We have to find that delivery truck.

656
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:14,750
I think it's going to be difficult, bro.

657
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,611
That delivery truck shouldn't be
the only one, right?

658
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:18,775
- Yes.
- Yes, bro.

659
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,117
No matter how hard it is, we have to find it.

660
00:51:21,117 --> 00:51:23,017
It's the only evidence

661
00:51:23,017 --> 00:51:24,535
that can save Sargent Itt.

662
00:51:24,535 --> 00:51:25,617
You're right.

663
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:28,450
So.

664
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:30,950
This is the warehouse.

665
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:55,817
Okay, now we come to…

666
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:02,338
the vital question that made me rush to

667
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:04,450
judge Chalinee's house tonight.

668
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,350
I had to interview Judge Chalinee here.

669
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:10,117
Oh boy, they're rushing me on social media.

670
00:52:10,117 --> 00:52:12,617
Here you are.

671
00:52:12,617 --> 00:52:13,450
Well…

672
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,117
What do you think about Mr. Olarn,

673
00:52:16,117 --> 00:52:20,750
the candidate for Tulakham's mayor,
is really going all out.

674
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:21,925
He's so dramatic.

675
00:52:21,925 --> 00:52:25,669
He suddenly signed a ten million
check to your foundation.

676
00:52:26,238 --> 00:52:29,583
First, I want to answer
on behalf of the foundation's president.

677
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:33,517
Although Olarn Group and I are not related,

678
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,450
I can't deny it.

679
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:40,340
Olarn Group inherited the business
from Kamnan Chot, my father.

680
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,350
Therefore,

681
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:45,383
I and the foundation
will be responsible for managing the fund

682
00:52:45,383 --> 00:52:48,650
to reimburse those affected by the Olarn Group.

683
00:52:50,297 --> 00:52:51,717
Ma'am, you answered like this,

684
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:55,350
I think the townspeople
probably understand that

685
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,317
you support Mr. Olarn in becoming mayor.

686
00:52:57,317 --> 00:52:58,683
No, no.

687
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:03,175
Supporting what he does
and supporting him to be a mayor

688
00:53:03,175 --> 00:53:04,650
is different.

689
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,250
If Mr. Olarn devotes himself to this city.

690
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:12,650
I'm also a Tulakham resident.

691
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,983
I am ready to support you.

692
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,615
As promised.

693
00:53:36,491 --> 00:53:40,842
Thank you, ma'am. I wouldn't come this far without you.
<i>[Next Episode]</i>

694
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,568
The court has considered all evidence.

695
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:45,530
The defendant is not guilty.

696
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:49,296
Harn's fan page says Olarn
is leading every poll.

697
00:53:49,296 --> 00:53:53,266
Even if he wins, I won't stop trying
to bring him down.

698
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:56,162
By the law.

699
00:53:56,162 --> 00:54:00,012
Whoever wants to destroy me and this city,

700
00:54:00,012 --> 00:54:03,240
may they perish.
