<i>Both cities are special administrative regions.</i>

7

<i>They have a special court system

<i>I'll begin with the capital.</i>

11
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:07,555
Trust me, I can defeat lawyer Win this time.

12
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:08,583
Of course.

13
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:12,821
If you don't believe lawyer Prao,
then who do you believe?

14
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:15,575
She got the highest score
in the barrister exam.

15
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,983
Don't bother with my client.

16
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:21,317
Better take care of your mafia client.

17
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:23,250
I just want to compliment you.

18
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,967
Anyway, today is the verdict day.

19
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:32,250
I wish you good luck
in successfully beating me as you intended.

20
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,683

22

Today is the last day of the trial.

23
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:54,147
Plaintiff's lawyer, please.

24
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:04,360
Were you at the crime scene that night?

25
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:06,844
Yes.

26
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:08,400
What did you see?

27
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,539
The defendant was beating the plaintiff.

28
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:14,280
Did the plaintiff ask the defendant to stop?

29
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,283
The plaintiff kept asking.

30
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:19,750
But the defendant escalated the violence.

31
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:25,877
No more questions.

32
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:37,325
You said that you saw the defendant
attack the plaintiff.

33
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:39,279
Did you see the incident before that?

34
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,279
No.

35
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:45,660
That means you don't know
what happened before that, correct?

36
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,160
At that time, did you liquor and were tipsy?

37
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:56,863
I don't remember.

38
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,660
You don't remember whether
you liquor and were tipsy?

39
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,685
But you remember what you saw?

40
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,954
- Objection, your honor.
- No more questions.

41
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:17,350
I have additional evidence.

42
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,017
I would like you to consider.

43
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:23,399
It is not on the list of evidence.

44
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,922
If you want to introduce new evidence,
the defendant must first agree.

45
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:31,442
I agree.

46
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:48,450
<i>Are you sure?</i>

47
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,450
<i>That money will help me survive.</i>

48
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,375
<i>Money can solve everything.</i>

49
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:02,187
Why did you put it in a crap bag?

50
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,125
It doesn't draw attention.

51
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,217
Are you sure anyway?

52
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:08,750
That money can help me survive?

53
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:11,720
Money can solve everything.

54
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:24,883
This clip is not related to the case directly,

55
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:27,683
but the defendant and the defendant's lawyer

56
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:31,017
showed their intention to use the money
to solve the problem.

57
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,783
That means…

58
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:36,317
they will bribe the court
to acquit the defendant.

59
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,250
It implies that…

60
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:42,062
the defendant knows he is guilty.

61
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:43,875
It's no different from admitting it.

62
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:47,887
Do you have anything to defend?

63
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:51,279
Do you mean the money in this envelope?

64
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,483
I admit it.

65
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:01,383
The defendant and I
intended to bring it to the judge.

66
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,583
For the verdict to be in our favor.

67
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,405
What? Don't you feel ashamed?

68
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,629
Please have a look.

69
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,537
It's actually the defendant's money.

70
00:07:20,537 --> 00:07:22,671
Take a look at the attached documents.

71
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:25,050
The fingerprints indicate that

72
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,683
on the defendant's banknotes,

73
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:29,243
there are the plaintiff's fingerprints.

74
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:38,763
It shows that the plaintiff tried to
take money from the defendant's pocket.

75
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:41,783
So, the plaintiff became angry
and started a fight.

76
00:07:41,783 --> 00:07:43,683
The defendant is a man.

77
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,850
He has more strength.

78
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:51,153
One walking passing by
might think that it is a physical assault.

79
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:52,270
Objection, your honor.

80
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,442
The fact that fingerprints are on the banknote
is not necessarily a struggle.

81
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:00,617
The banknote has torn marks.

82
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:03,871
If it was given with affection,

83
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:06,017
why does it have torn marks?

84
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,325
And if the defendant is willing
to give to the plaintiff,

85
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:11,550
why does the defendant have the banknote?

86
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,483
The evidence both parties have brought in,

87
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,183
so I conclude that…

88
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:21,283
defendant physically harmed the plaintiff.

89
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:26,667
Which is punishable under
the Criminal Code Section BARB,

90
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:30,683
sentenced to two years imprisonment
and a 60,000 fine.

91
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:34,417
In the case of physical assault
caused by provocation.

92
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:38,187
The plaintiff
fought over the defendant's money.

93
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:43,519
The defendant shall be liable to a fine at the
maximum penalty rate instead of imprisonment.

94
00:08:58,144 --> 00:08:59,519
What a pity.

95
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,141
My blessing didn't work.

96
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,213
You can't defeat me.

97
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,519
How dare you be proud to help the wrong guy.

98
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:13,757
Let's go, Ms. Sic ha.

99
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:19,409
<i>Next, Tulakham City.</i>

100
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,725
<i>[Court systems are set up

101
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:36,113
In the case, Mr. Apia Agamemnon

102
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:41,340
filed a petition to reopen the case,
which was jointly sued by a Tulakham women.

103
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,524
Mr. Chot Sritulwong or Kamnan Chot
and his network

104
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:49,850
abused them in commercial sex acts.

105
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,883
The group of women lost the case.

106
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,750
Now,

107
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:01,250
I thoroughly considered the evidence and
additional witnesses, as requested

108
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,450
Therefore, the court has decided that

109
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:13,559
Mr. Chot Sritulwong and his network are guilty.

110
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:19,775
Mr. Chot Sritulwong, the leader of the network,
has passed away.

111
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,225
His current business network, the Olarn Group,

112
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:32,279
shall compensate 5 million
to each woman in the group.

113
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,639
End of trial.

114
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,279
Awesome!

115
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:42,159
Wow!

116
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:44,683
You're watching idol clips?

117
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:48,983
Judge Chalinee Sritulwong of Tulakham.

118
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:52,683
The only city in the country where judges
come from an election.

119
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,279
Very good.

120
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,050
Oh! Hey.

121
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,050
Where are you going? I'm admiring your idol.

122
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,875
I don't want to talk to the guy who…

123
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,885
What?

124
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:10,109
Choose wisely.

125
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:12,864
If you want to call me an animal,

126
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:15,783
or softly, like "bad guy."

127
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:17,650
It falls under the law.

128
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,279
- C393, affront.
- C393, affront.

129
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,063
But wait, I have a promotion.

130
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:24,917
If you condemn me right here,

131
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,744
amidst many people, and they can hear you.

132
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:28,883
You will get a bonus.

133
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:32,383
For Section C328 Defamation,

134
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:34,279
you'll be heavily punished.

135
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,158
I wouldn't lower myself to scold you.

136
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,367
A lawyer who helps the mafia.

137
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,683
A member of the mafia is still human.

138
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:41,983
I don't discriminate.

139
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,405
And I believe that if it were Judge Chalinee

140
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,817
she would do the same as me.

141
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:52,503
Don't compare yourself to her,

142
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,720
in the case of Kamnan Chot, her dead father

143
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,000
she even re-judged the case to make him guilty.

144
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:01,639
How amazing!

145
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Judge Chalinee is a good person.

146
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,960
Are you being sarcastic?

147
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,683
I'm not.

148
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:11,550
I'm admiring her.

149
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,159
Well, the "good," you say.

150
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:16,159
It's like you're mocking her
for being a bad person.

151
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:22,514
Judge Chalinee is a good person.
Good, good…

152
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:26,450
good… good… good… good… good…

153
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:38,807
Well, you have to pay a fine.

154
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:40,040
Do you agree?

155
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,883
Yes.

156
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:45,250
Even though it goes against my legal ideology,

157
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,250
I agree.

158
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,083
What about you?

159
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,195
Yes.

160
00:12:58,609 --> 00:12:59,750
Done?

161
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,853
Hello.

162
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:14,883
Yes, I did it.

163
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:16,717
I'm sorry. Huh?

164
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:22,321
What?

165
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,750
No deadline?

166
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,250
I mean…

167
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,217
Yes, yes, bye.

168
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:37,152
That kind of soft voice.

169
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:39,583
You're surely suspended.

170
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,783
How about this?

171
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:47,283
If you sincerely apologize to me.

172
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:52,817
I'll talk to your boss

173
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:55,017
not to suspend you.

174
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,450
No way!

175
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:08,959
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

176
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,317
<i>That's too bad, Prao.</i>

177
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,283
<i>Because you protected me.</i>

178
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:13,950
<i>That's why you got suspended.</i>

179
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,483
It's not just that, ma'am.

180
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:20,483
I was angry he protected his mafia client.

181
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:22,217
And after I heard the verdict,

182
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:23,817
I was disappointed.

183
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,398
But…

184
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,650
When I watched your live broadcast,

185
00:14:29,183 --> 00:14:32,083
my heart swells, ma'am.

186
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,840
Even though…

187
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,950
<i>Even though…</i>

188
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,350
the defendant is my dead father?

189
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:40,950
No, no… it's not like that.

190
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,917
I apologize.

191
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:42,917
It's okay.

192
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,679
Thanks to you, instead.

193
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,159
<i>You reassured me I was doing the right thing.</i>

194
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,517
<i>Oh, by the way…</i>

195
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:54,317
<i>while on leave,</i>

196
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:57,183
<i>why don't you come back and help me?</i>

197
00:14:57,183 --> 00:15:01,480
Do you remember the case in which
the former mayor was murdered?

198
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,112
It would be great if you could help me.

199
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,450
With pleasure, ma'am.

200
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:10,450
When we get there,

201
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,150
I will see you.

202
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:14,085
Okay.

203
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,810
See you later.

204
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:19,275
Take care of your health. Goodbye.

205
00:15:33,655 --> 00:15:34,711
How was it?

206
00:15:43,755 --> 00:15:44,783
Win! Dude!

207
00:15:44,783 --> 00:15:45,983
Hey, I want to know.

208
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:47,499
Why did you do this to me?

209
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:48,850
So you'll know.

210
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,850
What it's like to hurt a helpless woman.

211
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:56,480
Then why would you be my lawyer?

212
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
First,

213
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,983
my uncle asked me to help you

214
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:01,850
in return for helping him.

215
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:05,650
Second,

216
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,983
a bad guy like you deserves me.

217
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:16,713
Bro!

218
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:29,871
He's fine, please continue.

219
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:31,112
Hey, I can't take it anymore.

220
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:38,220
<i>[Scan the QR code to transfer money
Name: Ms. Sicha Boontham]</i>

221
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,092
<i>[Account: xxx-x-x1703-x]</i>

222
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:42,283
You transfer a 100,000 Baht compensation
to the woman you hurt.

223
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:43,825
Then I'll let you go.

224
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:45,250
Whoa! Win.

225
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,350
But I've already paid a fine of 30,000 Baht.

226
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:52,480
Okay, continue then.

227
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Hey! Fine, I'll transfer.

228
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:09,549
Can I go now?

229
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:31,050
I last saw your box a long time ago.

230
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,873
Your boxing is still as sharp as ever.

231
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:35,409
You taught me.

232
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:42,817
You told Shin that you helped him because
I asked you to do it.

233
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:44,810
Is it not just that?

234
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,850
That's it.

235
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,183
What else do you think?

236
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:55,283
You know Prao will handle this case,

237
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,372
right?

238
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:16,680
What do you think?

239
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,560
<i>We can get rid of all these bad guys.</i>

240
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,800
Tulakham will be a better city.

241
00:19:22,355 --> 00:19:24,839
<i>I want to know who sent it.</i>

242
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,030
It must be someone who means well
but doesn't want to reveal himself.

243
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,480
What are you going to do?

244
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,720
I've been running from the truth
of that city for a long time.

245
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:36,279
It's time to go back and sort everything out.

246
00:19:39,565 --> 00:19:41,017
Then take our man with you.

247
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:42,650
Let's finish it.

248
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:47,240
It's okay. I'll handle it my way.

249
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,560
I can never stop you from doing anything.

250
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,650
<i>But…</i>

251
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,022
<i>you have to promise me you'll be careful.</i>

252
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:58,022
Yes.

253
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:00,983
Can I ask you something?

254
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:04,983
You go back because of this or…

255
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:07,150
do you want to follow someone?

256
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:16,583
<i>Hello everyone,</i>

257
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,904
<i>this is the "Tam Tueng Tee."</i>

258
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:21,350
<i>Today, I'm with a person,</i>

259
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,717
<i>who is called a lover of justice,</i>

260
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:28,017
<i>Judge Chalinee Sritulwong.</i>

261
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:28,850
<i>Hello, ma'am.</i>

262
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,850
<i>Hi.</i>

263
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:34,368
<i>Let me get straight to the point, ma'am.</i>

264
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:40,359
<i>It's a hot topic right now.
You reopen the case of your…</i>

265
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,719
<i>Oh,</i>

266
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:44,359
<i>My father forced women to become mistresses?</i>

267
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:47,719
<i>That's right. How straight you are.</i>

268
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:51,717
<i>Yes, for this case, I want to thank Mr. Apai</i>

269
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,525
<i>who filed a request to reopen this case.</i>

270
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:56,859
You are not angry at Mr.Apai?

271
00:20:56,859 --> 00:21:01,579
Mr. Apai is a precious person to our city.

272
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:05,017
He always encourages us
not to overlook small things,

273
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:09,339
and the closed case
that leaves scars in people's hearts.

274
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:13,579
Are you afraid it will tarnish your father,

275
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,980
and most importantly, yourself?

276
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,917
From what my father's network did,

277
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:22,740
he can't deny responsibility.

278
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,850
<i>The values ​​he held back then</i>

279
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,883
<i>might have made him unaware of
the negative consequences.</i>

280
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:32,617
<i>The results of that day go on to this day.</i>

281
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:35,083
As a blood heir,

282
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:39,550
I want to compensate for my responsibilities

283
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,860
to restore justice to them.

284
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,319
I…

285
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:48,779
apologize on behalf of my father.

286
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:54,815
Bro,

287
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,083
tell me about this city.

288
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:03,883
In the past, this city was not much,

289
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:07,117
farming, rice planting.

290
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:09,650
Then, foreigners came to set up a base.

291
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:13,817
Some people profited
from foreigners like Kamnan Chot.

292
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:15,683
They had conflicting interests.

293
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:18,317
They kill each other.

294
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:22,050
New generations
think of the time when foreigners ruled.

295
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:25,650
So they demanded Tulakham a special zone.

296
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:28,779
It has a self-governing system
unlike anywhere else.

297
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:35,005
It's the only city in which judges
must come from elections.

298
00:22:36,477 --> 00:22:37,550
Wow!

299
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,683
That's great, bro.

300
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:43,217
That's why many people love her.

301
00:23:02,976 --> 00:23:03,976
It's up there.

302
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,283
Your mother's law firm.

303
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:12,217
Oh, hey…

304
00:23:12,217 --> 00:23:13,779
Oh, wait for me, bro.

305
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:14,803
Wait me, bro.

306
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:32,779
What's that noise?

307
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:37,120
Do you want a loan?

308
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:40,983
20% interest.

309
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,483
From your look, do you still need money?

310
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,743
Let me introduce myself, dear.

311
00:23:59,553 --> 00:24:02,383
My name is Yam.

312
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:04,483
What's yours?

313
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:08,231
How much do you want?
I'll lower the interest for you.

314
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:11,779
Cute, my heart is melting.

315
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,152
Oh!

316
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,217
What are you doing over there?

317
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:22,317
Hey! Why are you pulling?

318
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:40,629
Here's another one, pin here, button here.

319
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,788
When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer like you.

320
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,779
Really? Why?

321
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:54,304
I'll help you fight against those bad people.
This city will be full of goodness.

322
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:56,544
And you'll always smile.

323
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:01,615
You have to remember.

324
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:02,283
Yes.

325
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:04,017
Being a lawyer…

326
00:25:04,017 --> 00:25:06,250
you have to fight against bad people
with the law.

327
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:12,683
Being a lawyer…

328
00:25:13,783 --> 00:25:15,650
means fighting against bad people
using the law.

329
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:19,117
Hey!

330
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,883
Why are you guys so loud? What's going on?

331
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:22,050
I don't know who he is.

332
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:27,527
Oh, hey.

333
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:28,927
What are you doing standing there?

334
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:37,683
Why are you here?

335
00:25:41,084 --> 00:25:42,084
Well,

336
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,740
I'm here to chase the moneylenders
out of this office.

337
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,417
Huh? What did you say?

338
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:51,083
Huh?

339
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,317
Do you know who I am?

340
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:54,039
Tell me.

341
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,400
He's Yorth, my brother.

342
00:25:57,168 --> 00:25:58,168
Hey, kids.

343
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,316
You should get ready for some exercise.

344
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,039
Beat him up, bro.

345
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,717
Sure!

346
00:26:05,617 --> 00:26:06,959
He's here alone.

347
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:09,283
You seem a tough guy.

348
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,450
We'll see.

349
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:16,217
Dad.

350
00:26:16,217 --> 00:26:18,903
Do people still print pictures these days?

351
00:26:18,903 --> 00:26:22,799
It's gotten less. If they come
within two months, it is perfect.

352
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,799
They are mostly ID photos.

353
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,799
Why don't you stop, Dad?
I can take care of you.

354
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,583
This is all my life.

355
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,617
I'm happy seeing these pictures.

356
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:37,317
Also…

357
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,683
if your mother comes back,

358
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,417
she'll find us.

359
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:51,418
Do you still believe that Mom will come back?

360
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:59,194
You don't blame me I was suspended, huh?

361
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:02,650
It's good, though.

362
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:06,483
You can work with Judge Chalinee.

363
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,450
Dad wants you to come back to work with Miss Chalinee,

364
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,817
rather than be in the city.

365
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:20,017
Oh.

366
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:24,917
Dad.

367
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:28,083
She invited me to hear the verdict.

368
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:29,175
Huh?

369
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:32,799
That's good. Go ahead, dear.

370
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:40,773
Ouch! Let me go! Ouch!

371
00:27:40,773 --> 00:27:43,653
Bro! Bro! Bro!

372
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:53,783
Hey!

373
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:58,850
Whoa, bro.

374
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,483
There's nothing fun for me here.

375
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:11,150
Brother, please don't harm us.

376
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,483
Look,
what do you want? You can take them all.

377
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:18,580
You guys are also scammers, right?

378
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,389
Scammers, are you kidding?

379
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:21,172
Ouch!

380
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:24,350
Here, handsome lawyer Win!

381
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,175
And I'm…

382
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:27,231
Tankhun, the lawyer's right hand.

383
00:28:27,231 --> 00:28:31,025
Uh, while we're talking,

384
00:28:31,025 --> 00:28:34,375
can you please take this box
off my head, brother?

385
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,799
I can't breathe.

386
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,431
Ouch! Watch out.

387
00:28:37,431 --> 00:28:40,983
Ouch! Go easy, please.

388
00:28:40,983 --> 00:28:42,575
Thank you.

389
00:28:46,584 --> 00:28:51,000
According to the Criminal Code, Section S551.

390
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:58,891
Anyone who trespasses
and uses another person's real estate

391
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:02,865
or disturb the possession of the real estate

392
00:29:02,865 --> 00:29:06,617
shall be punished with a one-year imprisonment
and a 20,000 Baht fine

393
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:07,350
or

394
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,483
both imprisonment and a fine.

395
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,186
Oh.

396
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:17,917
Ah…

397
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:25,383
How about we'll be your errand boys?

398
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:27,075
Or…

399
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:31,125
we build this place for
your law firm, boss. Okay?

400
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:32,883
Okay.

401
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,917
But you have to take a test first.

402
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:39,112
Question one,

403
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,183
clean the room neatly.

404
00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:43,450
But…

405
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,550
Never remove the drawing at that fish tank.

406
00:29:49,992 --> 00:29:53,064
Oh, that messy drawing of a boy.

407
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,117
Are you going to find a team easily like this?

408
00:30:05,117 --> 00:30:09,079
What about the second question?

409
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:13,717
After you finish cleaning,

410
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,050
open this paper and read it.

411
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,450
The second question is here.

412
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,350
Wow.

413
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,583
Sure, boss.

414
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:23,283
That's awesome, and I'll take care of it.

415
00:30:24,596 --> 00:30:25,596
Let's go, Tan.

416
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:28,383
Let's have some fun.

417
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:30,970
What fun?

418
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:35,417
Mr. Apai Maneejamnong

419
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,834
filed a petition to the
Tulakham Prosecutor's Office

420
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:44,560
to reopen the case at Olarn Group
interrupts small business partners

421
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,850
- unable to pay debts to Olarn Group
- Your rival is now rising.

422
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,483
- to facilitate Olarn Group to take over
- But she can't beat you.

423
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,683
- The investigation found that
- She is close to Judge Chalinee.

424
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:56,917
- The Olarn Group is guilty.
- so she became a city's prosecutor

425
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:00,183
What rival, Dad?

426
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,363
I never thought of competing with Aeri.

427
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:06,627
Please make your final statement, defendant.

428
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:16,640
Olarn Group was established to continue
with Kamnan Chot's intention,

429
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,440
to drive the city's economy to prosper.

430
00:31:21,016 --> 00:31:28,117
In business, it's normal
to have some conflicts with our competitors.

431
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:33,440
But we want to confirm we do not have
any bad intentions towards anyone.

432
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,383
I must say that we sincerely apologize,

433
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,150
and promise to provide proper compensation.

434
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,339
We ask the court to have mercy on us as well.

435
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:54,631
Here is the verdict.

436
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:07,819
Olarn Group is guilty of the charges
without intention.

437
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:10,017
The civil penalty shall remain.

438
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:16,819
The defendant shall pay ten million
compensation to each business partner,

439
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:19,883
and return all the business
to the original owner.

440
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:21,850
End of the trial.

441
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:43,511
Judge Chalinee is determined to help
the helpless people, sweetie.

442
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:45,471
Yes, Dad.

443
00:32:47,963 --> 00:32:49,050
Hi Prao.

444
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,917
Long time no see.

445
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:53,183
Hello Aeri.

446
00:32:54,217 --> 00:32:55,435
How are you?

447
00:32:55,435 --> 00:32:57,183
I'm fine.

448
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,083
But I'm tired of being a prosecutor.

449
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:03,339
I want to get a break like you.

450
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:08,917
You're good and competent.

451
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:10,783
I don't know why you got suspended.

452
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,850
I have to go.

453
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,083
Judge Chalinee invited me
to have dinner at her house.

454
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,817
Oh, what are you talking about?

455
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:26,650
Huh?

456
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,339
We're talking about her suspension, ma'am.

457
00:33:31,238 --> 00:33:32,250
Oh.

458
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,250
But if I met…

459
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:39,983
a lawyer who helped bad guys hurt women,

460
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:43,365
I would do the same as her.

461
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,295
Are you free today?

462
00:33:51,503 --> 00:33:52,819
Yes, ma'am.

463
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:54,339
Have dinner at my place.

464
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,355
Come on.

465
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,011
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:01,339
See you later.

467
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,299
Yes, ma'am.

468
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:03,355
See you then.

469
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,750
See you.

470
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,650
Let's go, Dad.

471
00:34:16,817 --> 00:34:19,039
- Mr. Olarn.
- Mr. Olarn is here.

472
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,476
Can I interview you, Mr. Olarn?

473
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:21,315
Yes.

474
00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:23,067
What do you think of the verdict?

475
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:24,699
Do you think it's fair?

476
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:30,450
We're just defending the company's rights
without ill intent toward anyone.

477
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,950
When the court determines that
we are wrong, we accept it.

478
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,217
Anyway, the Olarn Group…

479
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:39,340
insist on making Tulakham develop further.

480
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,850
Don't be offended.

481
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:46,317
I do my job as a good citizen.

482
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:48,617
When I see…

483
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,050
something wrong,

484
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,050
I usually can't stand it.

485
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,599
Let's say…

486
00:34:57,117 --> 00:34:58,417
we'll meet again

487
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,917
in the next case, Mr. Olarn.

488
00:35:01,492 --> 00:35:04,468
Someday, a professional complainer like you
will learn the lesson.

489
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:06,524
Hey!

490
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,850
Did you hear clearly?

491
00:35:10,117 --> 00:35:12,783
He threatened me in front of you.

492
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:17,583
But it's alright.

493
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,150
I understand you have a temper
because you lost the case.

494
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,383
But if you threaten me again,

495
00:35:26,383 --> 00:35:29,817
I will complain and sue you.

496
00:35:35,362 --> 00:35:36,496
<i>[Judge Chalinee Sritulwong
the Tulakham's dignity.]</i>

497
00:35:36,496 --> 00:35:38,570
<i>[Chalinee ordered Olarn Group
to return the business to the partner]</i>

498
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,090
<i>[The Olarn Group fury, Chalinee ordered them
to return business with 10M compensation!]</i>

499
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:42,324
<i>[Chalinee has no fear and ordered
the Olarn Group to pay.]</i>

500
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,517
Today we have French food.

501
00:35:49,517 --> 00:35:51,283
Enjoy your meal, Prao.

502
00:35:51,798 --> 00:35:55,350
Prangthip, if you have something to do,
please do it.

503
00:35:58,134 --> 00:35:59,134
Yes, ma'am.

504
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:05,340
Enjoy, okay?

505
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,283
Yes.

506
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:09,450
Ma'am.

507
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,717
Can I ask you something?

508
00:36:11,422 --> 00:36:13,080
Why did you judge the case

509
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,340
without fear of Mr. Olarn's influence at all?

510
00:36:16,683 --> 00:36:21,317
Who can the townspeople rely on
if the judges are afraid of influence?

511
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:26,340
But Mr. Olarn used to be your close friend
since childhood.

512
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:30,017
How do you deal with this feeling?

513
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,283
For me,

514
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,617
the most important is

515
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:45,017
I want to be someone
the townspeople rely entirely on.

516
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,150
When I'm thinking like this,

517
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,917
all fear disappears.

518
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:55,512
If I were half of you,

519
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:57,383
I would be very proud.

520
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:02,424
But I will be like you.

521
00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:07,917
Let's eat.

522
00:37:13,652 --> 00:37:16,340
Dad, what happened?

523
00:37:18,623 --> 00:37:22,102
Those loan sharks took stuff for the debt.

524
00:37:22,102 --> 00:37:24,406
Are you okay, Dad?

525
00:37:24,406 --> 00:37:26,505
I'm okay, and they only took the stuff.

526
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:28,350
Why did you borrow from them?

527
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:32,883
I have less income, so I had to borrow it.

528
00:37:36,864 --> 00:37:38,005
Where are they?

529
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,683
I'll go after them.

530
00:37:39,683 --> 00:37:40,783
Prao… Prao.

531
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,117
It's dangerous, dear. Don't go.

532
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:47,450
If you don't tell me.

533
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,750
I'll leave and never come back.

534
00:38:03,021 --> 00:38:04,641
Hey, you, it's closed.

535
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:07,101
Hey, wait, wait.

536
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:09,865
What the hell happened? Huh?

537
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:13,150
Did you guys tear down my father's house?

538
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:13,683
Oh.

539
00:38:13,683 --> 00:38:14,683
- Yes.
- Yes.

540
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:19,722
Ouch!

541
00:38:23,463 --> 00:38:24,217
Oh boy.

542
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:25,479
That's harsh.

543
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,780
I'll call the police.

544
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,317
Oh, wait, wait.

545
00:38:31,317 --> 00:38:33,340
We don't do that business anymore.

546
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,936
This place will become a law firm tomorrow.

547
00:38:35,936 --> 00:38:37,280
Huh?

548
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,494
Don't you believe it?

549
00:38:39,494 --> 00:38:41,156
You can ask my boss.

550
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:41,772
Yeah.

551
00:38:41,772 --> 00:38:43,604
Boss, come over here.

552
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:52,525
Oh boy.

553
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,340
You came earlier than I expected.

554
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,543
Ouch!

555
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,016
That was a strong punch.

556
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:00,017
Did you come all the way here
to harass me?

557
00:39:00,017 --> 00:39:01,776
Is being a mafia lawyer not enough to live on?

558
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:03,340
That's why you became a loan shark.

559
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,417
That's the past.

560
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,340
Tomorrow, this place will be a law firm.

561
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,067
Oh, then all of my dad's debt is over.

562
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:12,083
Hey, no way.

563
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,183
I just changed business. The debt remains.

564
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:20,340
I'll report the police for trespassing
and property damage.

565
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,763
Do you have any evidence?

566
00:39:23,763 --> 00:39:26,672
There are no fingerprints or any hair.

567
00:39:26,672 --> 00:39:32,521
The CCTV didn't capture the image either.
I turn it in another direction.

568
00:39:34,143 --> 00:39:38,340
That means it must be you who trespass.

569
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:44,878
The fingerprints on the door.
Plus, you physically harmed two people.

570
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:47,566
Who said two?

571
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,550
Officer, you can't just arrest and lock me up.

572
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,648
We can meditate. Why do you have to do this?

573
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,340
Officer, when can she leave?

574
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,820
We have to follow procedures.

575
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,660
You can't do this. We can mediate, officer.
Let me go.

576
00:40:32,192 --> 00:40:37,099
If anything happens, you can find
your uncle at this place.

577
00:40:37,963 --> 00:40:42,624
Do you understand? You have to run away
and never come back here again.

578
00:40:42,624 --> 00:40:46,656
Promise me. Do you understand, son?

579
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:51,162
Stay in here. Be quiet, and don't come out.

580
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,448
Where is the card?

581
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:05,099
Where is the card?

582
00:41:13,192 --> 00:41:14,217
What are you doing?

583
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:15,607
Stop it!

584
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:16,268
Stay out!

585
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:18,957
I told you to stop.

586
00:41:41,014 --> 00:41:42,014
Hello.

587
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:53,713
Win… Win…

588
00:41:58,216 --> 00:41:58,815
Spit it out.

589
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:00,099
Let me go! Let me go!

590
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:01,474
Spit it out!

591
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:02,474
Let me go!

592
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:04,796
Run! Win, Run!

593
00:42:04,796 --> 00:42:06,908
Mom, Mom.

594
00:42:06,908 --> 00:42:08,648
I'm going to kill your mom.

595
00:42:08,648 --> 00:42:09,608
Win, run away.

596
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:10,438
Mom.

597
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:11,491
Run away.

598
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:16,437
Mom, Mom.

599
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:21,075
Win, Win.

600
00:42:22,028 --> 00:42:24,236
Mom, Mom.

601
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:26,156
Run away!

602
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:34,345
Mom.

603
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:45,467
Please help me, officer.

604
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:48,195
Help me, officer. Help me.

605
00:42:48,195 --> 00:42:51,401
Help me, please.

606
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:52,457
What's wrong?

607
00:42:52,457 --> 00:42:54,857
Help me, officer. Help me, please.

608
00:42:54,857 --> 00:42:58,562
That guy killed my mom. Please help me.

609
00:42:58,562 --> 00:43:01,407
That guy killed my mom, officer.

610
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:02,648
Hey, what are you going to do with the kid?

611
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:05,535
Help me, officer.

612
00:43:05,535 --> 00:43:06,933
Bury them together.

613
00:43:06,933 --> 00:43:07,943
Come over here.

614
00:43:07,943 --> 00:43:11,320
Let me go, let me go.

615
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,442
- Get in.
- Let me go.

616
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:15,374
Let me go.

617
00:43:16,283 --> 00:43:17,601
Let me go.

618
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:26,852
Let me go, let me go out.

619
00:43:44,648 --> 00:43:45,648
Shut up!

620
00:43:46,469 --> 00:43:47,525
You stay still!

621
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:12,129
Hey, where are you going?

622
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:14,530
Let me go, let me go.

623
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,099
Let me… let me go.

624
00:44:17,627 --> 00:44:18,627
Let me go.

625
00:44:19,854 --> 00:44:26,099
Let him go! I said let him go!

626
00:44:30,988 --> 00:44:33,388
Hey, where are you going?

627
00:44:38,781 --> 00:44:41,085
Go, run away.

628
00:44:47,488 --> 00:44:53,865
Uncle! Uncle!

629
00:44:54,467 --> 00:44:56,099
Uncle.

630
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:33,314
Dad.

631
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,369
Hey, Prao.

632
00:45:37,095 --> 00:45:41,662
Did you ask Judge Chalinee to help me?

633
00:45:41,662 --> 00:45:42,910
I have no one to ask for.

634
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:44,237
Dad.

635
00:45:44,237 --> 00:45:48,219
Your dad asked for help from Judge Chalinee,
and she sent me here.

636
00:45:48,219 --> 00:45:51,383
But we just arrived when we saw you.

637
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:53,683
How did you get out?

638
00:46:04,774 --> 00:46:06,099
Hello.

639
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,099
It's me.

640
00:46:11,127 --> 00:46:12,202
Why did you call?

641
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:16,332
Wow, I finally agreed to compromise.
I send someone to pay the fine.

642
00:46:16,332 --> 00:46:18,593
You should thank me after all.

643
00:46:18,593 --> 00:46:22,625
Okay, meet me at my office at noon.

644
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:24,049
Why should I go?

645
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:26,257
You need to talk about your father's remission.

646
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:35,958
Hey!

647
00:46:40,351 --> 00:46:48,939
Huh? I got first place in my class,
and you want me to be your assistant?

648
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:54,315
In exchange for all your father's debts,
loan principal, and interest.

649
00:46:58,592 --> 00:47:02,195
I would never work with someone
who benefits from law.

650
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:08,367
Oops!

651
00:47:09,728 --> 00:47:13,739
I'd rather work as a dirty maid,
keeping the office clean

652
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:18,340
rather than a good-looking job
but making society dirty like you.

653
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:24,292
Being my assistant is the only way
to pay off your father's debt.

654
00:47:29,508 --> 00:47:31,236
Let's go upstairs.

655
00:47:36,032 --> 00:47:40,099
What's up, Tan? All clear? Awesome.

656
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:51,360
We just got the first job.

657
00:47:56,645 --> 00:48:02,099
I promise I won't use the law
to help the wrong guy.

658
00:48:02,867 --> 00:48:08,367
If I break a promise, you can quit.
I'll forgive your father's debt, okay?

659
00:48:08,367 --> 00:48:09,774
Why would you do that?

660
00:48:09,774 --> 00:48:12,654
Because you're my idol.

661
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,692
Sign or not?

662
00:48:30,906 --> 00:48:35,260
Everything in your hand is dirty.

663
00:48:37,468 --> 00:48:38,620
Oh, it hurts.

664
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,644
Oh, you're well prepared.

665
00:48:57,932 --> 00:49:00,838
Welcome to the team, debtor.

666
00:49:06,136 --> 00:49:08,120
The first job just came. Are you ready?

667
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:34,960
I've just arrived at Tulakham.
I have something to clear with the lawyer here.

668
00:49:35,728 --> 00:49:36,785
Who the hell are you?

669
00:50:08,664 --> 00:50:09,960
Who are you guys?

670
00:50:17,407 --> 00:50:21,151
I'm lawyer Boripat.
I just opened a firm in this city.

671
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,439
And this is my assistant, lawyer Prao.

672
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:30,099
I want to handle your case.

673
00:50:31,321 --> 00:50:33,597
I already have a lawyer. And he's excellent.

674
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:41,853
Lawyer Koson, the hottest lawyer in Tulakham.
He owns the most wealthy law firms.

675
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:51,960
He won every case, especially the cases
judged by Judge Chalinee.

676
00:50:53,983 --> 00:51:02,214
But for this case, he'll let you
die in prison for sure.

677
00:51:02,214 --> 00:51:05,408
What the hell are you talking about?
Why should I believe you?

678
00:51:05,408 --> 00:51:07,960
Because I want you out of here the most.

679
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:28,332
Hey, I have the best lawyer,
And the most powerful man has my back.

680
00:51:28,332 --> 00:51:33,217
Why should I trust you two?
If you only have this, go home.

681
00:51:37,347 --> 00:51:39,459
I don't want you to die in prison, Sargent.

682
00:51:44,205 --> 00:51:46,317
Someone with more power than Lawyer Koson

683
00:51:47,817 --> 00:51:50,617
won't let you out of here.

684
00:52:18,872 --> 00:52:19,897
If you don't mind

685
00:52:19,897 --> 00:52:22,377
I want to buy a former mayor case from you.
<i>[Next Episode]</i>

686
00:52:22,377 --> 00:52:23,777
The new lawyer came out of nowhere,

687
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,709
and told me to choose him
as my new lawyer.

688
00:52:26,709 --> 00:52:28,653
You can't kill me 18 years ago,

689
00:52:28,653 --> 00:52:29,873
until now.

690
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,646
I'll kill you!

691
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:35,418
The law must provide equal justice to all.

692
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,090
Hello Mr. Lawyer, do you remember me?

693
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:41,077
Can we use the law and justice?

694
00:52:43,058 --> 00:52:45,291
Someday, this town will be real.
