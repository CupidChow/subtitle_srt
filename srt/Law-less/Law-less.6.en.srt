Mom… Mom… Mom…

8
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:17,602
Mom…Who did this to you?

9
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:19,291
I would like to thank you.

10
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:23,025
I wouldn't have come this far without you.

11
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:24,936
Please join with us.

12
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,549
Olarn won't let you go.

13
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:28,191
I won't run away.

14
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:31,463
If you want revenge, do it now.

15
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:35,691
I gave them all to you
for taking care of my mother.

16
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,686
I hope you find your mother soon.

17
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:40,886
I can't believe that lawyer Boripat
has many connections.

18
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:43,551
You even know someone here.

19
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:45,329
For the record.

20
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:48,256
No matter what you ask me to do, I won't do it.

21
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:50,089
This is my lawyer's license.

22
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:52,578
She has done our family a great favor.

23
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:58,856
He'll come to me.

24
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:02,418
I know him well.

25
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:08,283
<i>This is the New Tulakham Project,

28
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:25,263
Hey, you. Wait.

29
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:28,096
You stay still. I'll handle it myself.

30
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:28,800
Hey, you.

31
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:33,550
Hey, just a second.

32
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,717
I'm not telling you to get revenge on anyone.

33
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:44,125
But I'm just telling you that
this case may be related

34
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,919
to the Tulakham's justice system
over the past ten years.

35
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:54,919
You mean Judge Chalinee
involved in these cases?

36
00:03:56,967 --> 00:04:00,700
Lawyer Prao, what are you going to say?
Just think carefully.

37
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:04,540
You're a Chalinee Foundation fellowship.

38
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:07,383
If you make a mistake on this,

39
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:10,450
you might regret it until you retire.

40
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,387
What's wrong with these young generations.

41
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:21,817
I'll try to read the documents.

42
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:25,317
Just so you know,

43
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:28,217
if this guy tricks me again.

44
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:30,417
I'll definitely get him.

45
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,620
Very good.

46
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,283
Is it okay?

47
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:53,420
I've cleared out old financial documents
from the system.

48
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:55,717
And I put this set of documents instead.

49
00:04:56,683 --> 00:04:58,483
You can adjust the numbers right away.

50
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,683
They should be fine.

51
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,917
I can definitely clear up legal issues.

52
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:56,983
This project is my dream.

53
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:02,583
Don't let any single one get in your way.

54
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:19,250
Are you going solo today, lawyer Boripat?

55
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:22,783
I don't know what's wrong with me.

56
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,550
When I see you in a judge's uniform,

57
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:30,217
I feel like ripping it off you.

58
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:34,583
Is that so?

59
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:38,210
It won't be long.

60
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:41,617
I'll rip this dress off you,

61
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,770
and put you in a prison uniform instead.

62
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,226
Your eyes are exactly like your mother's.

63
00:06:49,183 --> 00:06:51,683
Will your fate be the same?

64
00:06:52,883 --> 00:06:54,083
I'll wait and see.

65
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,617
Lawyer Win.

66
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:08,217
Are you here to meet the judge?

67
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:11,417
Yes.

68
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,683
I just stopped by to give her
some encouragement.

69
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,717
Excuse me.

70
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:35,883
Sir.

71
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:39,317
Hm?

72
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,038
<i>This one is Ruetai's.</i>

73
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:55,555
<i>This one is Nan's.</i>

74
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,527
<i>And this is mine.</i>

75
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:13,587
<i>Kiss kiss kiss.</i>

76
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:26,420
<i>What?</i>

77
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,919
<i>Stop, don't.</i>

78
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,783
<i>Little Miss.</i>

79
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:29,793
<i>Don't stay.</i>

80
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:31,919
<i>Let's go, Little Miss.</i>

81
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,991
<i>Let me go, let me go, let me go.</i>

82
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:37,050
<i>Your life is mine.</i>

83
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:53,224
<i>Why did you throw it away? It can protect us.</i>

84
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:57,259
<i>You don't need it. Three of us are enough.</i>

85
00:09:58,245 --> 00:10:01,984
<i>I'd rather have this room for Ruetai.</i>

86
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:07,919
<i>This room is for Nan.</i>

87
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:11,517
<i>There are so many.</i>

88
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:13,850
<i>- Do you want these two?
- Do you want this one?</i>

89
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,789
<i>I'd rather have this one.</i>

90
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:19,823
<i>How about this be Nan's notebook?</i>

91
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:26,525
<i>Then keep it outside the house,
to look after the city.</i>

92
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,749
<i>We will rule this city ourselves.
I won't let anyone disturb us.</i>

93
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:35,103
<i>Then this city must have law and justice.</i>

94
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:39,583
<i>- Okay, let's arrange the house.
- Okay.</i>

95
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:56,583
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

96
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,683
<i>I just want to know if you can help…</i>

97
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,483
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

98
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:04,683
<i>Of course, it has to abide by the law.</i>

99
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,317
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

100
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:11,317
<i>Yes, okay.</i>

101
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:13,417
<i>Okay.</i>

102
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:15,883
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

103
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:17,817
<i>Bye.</i>

104
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:26,850
<i>Do you think…</i>

105
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:29,517
<i>I'm really involved, Nan?</i>

106
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:33,983
<i>Can you just not take this case?</i>

107
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:48,547
<i>Let go of my hand!</i>

108
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:51,171
<i>I will never let you do anything to my friend.</i>

109
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:54,947
<i>Your friend exposed me.
Why are you defending her?</i>

110
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:59,111
<i>Why do you do this? How many times
have you done this?</i>

111
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:02,183
<i>Why did you do this? You only do bad things.</i>

112
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,506
<i>No, sir.</i>

113
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,517
<i>Did Haruetai take the photo?</i>

114
00:12:59,322 --> 00:13:01,050
<i>We're trying to find a way to help you.</i>

115
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:14,183
<i>It's me</i>

116
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:17,983
<i>who try to help you.</i>

117
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:19,783
<i>If this hadn't happened,</i>

118
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:23,950
<i>you would have died.</i>

119
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:26,950
<i>And your whole family.</i>

120
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:29,403
<i>You said we are friends.</i>

121
00:13:32,283 --> 00:13:34,850
<i>We're going to make this city better together.</i>

122
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:38,483
<i>I'm also trying to help you.</i>

123
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:40,917
<i>But it has to follow the law.</i>

124
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,983
<i>Actually, if you…</i>

125
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:45,262
<i>You were forced by Olarn,
so you made a mistake.</i>

126
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:47,182
<i>You just tell the truth.</i>

127
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:48,910
<i>Eventually, if you…</i>

128
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,783
<i>If you finally go to jail.</i>

129
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:55,995
<i>When you're released from prison,</i>

130
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:57,875
<i>we can pursue our ideology.</i>

131
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:04,557
<i>But you shouldn't have done this to me.</i>

132
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,550
<i>She said what she did…</i>

133
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:37,483
<i>She did for us.</i>

134
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:40,617
<i>If I had a choice,</i>

135
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,383
<i>I wouldn't even handle her case.</i>

136
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:49,783
<i>Whether she is right or wrong,</i>

137
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:52,050
<i>we can solve it together.</i>

138
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,919
<i>But it doesn't mean I won't do anything.</i>

139
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,550
<i>It doesn't mean I won't help at all.</i>

140
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,583
<i>And it doesn't mean…</i>

141
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,017
<i>I understand.</i>

142
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,517
<i>If you were me, what would you do?</i>

143
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:47,117
<i>Why are you crying, Mom?</i>

144
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:55,683
<i>I want…</i>

145
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,417
<i>this city is a good</i>

146
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,483
<i>and proper place, son.</i>

147
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:05,850
<i>But I want you to smile.</i>

148
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:11,450
<i>If I'm your rightness,</i>

149
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,783
<i>will you smile?</i>

150
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:18,183
<i>I do.</i>

151
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:47,483
<i>Win.</i>

152
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,983
<i>If anything happens.</i>

153
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:51,717
<i>You go find Uncle Prem here, son.</i>

154
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:54,010
<i>Do you understand?</i>

155
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,617
<i>You have to run away,</i>

156
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,417
<i>and don't come back here again.</i>

157
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:58,835
<i>Promise me.</i>

158
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:01,083
<i>Do you understand, son? Promise me.</i>

159
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:05,475
<i>Stay here. Be quiet. Don't come out.</i>

160
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:12,683
<i>Where's the card?</i>

161
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,050
<i>I said where's the card.</i>

162
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:28,783
<i>What are you doing?</i>

163
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,650
<i>Stop it!</i>

164
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,183
<i>I said stop!</i>

165
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:56,483

<i>Spit it out!</i>

169
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:14,750
<i>Let go of me.</i>

170
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,920
<i>Let me go.</i>

171
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,383
<i>- Let me go!
- Run away!</i>

172
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:18,617
<i>Win, run away!</i>

173
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:19,159
<i>Go!</i>

174
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,383
<i>Mom, Mom.</i>

175
00:19:22,624 --> 00:19:24,032
<i>Win, run away.</i>

176
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,283
<i>Mom.</i>

177

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,450
<i>Win.</i>

182
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,283
<i>Mom…Mom…Mom.</i>

183
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:40,317
<i>Run away!</i>

184
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,717
I've worked more than you today.

185
00:20:36,717 --> 00:20:38,983
I'm the boss. You drive.

186
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,250
You're welcome, boss.

187
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,623
Watch your step, okay?

188
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,571
You answer me now.

189
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:58,417
That you're ready to change Tulakham
to a better place with me.

190
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:02,083
I'm ready.

191
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,650
I've been waiting to be by your side
for a long time.

192
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,750
I'm ready to give you my whole life.

193
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:10,444
Good.

194
00:21:21,474 --> 00:21:22,517
Keep a lookout.

195
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:29,277
Where is it?

196
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:35,766
Hurry up!

197
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:53,317
Just a second!

198
00:21:57,023 --> 00:22:00,250
Your boxing style is comparable
to your style in the court.

199
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,983
I like people who have a passion

200
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:07,717
regardless of work or something else.

201
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:13,280
Passion is the desire to do something.
You can't help it.

202
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,083
You might be more surprised.

203
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,900
If you knew what my true passion was.

204
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,150
Is that so?

205
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,683
Then that means…

206
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:29,750
I have to get closer to you? Then I can see.

207
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:36,083
I don't expect that

208
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,850
the prosecutor is interested in boxing.

209
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:41,561
My minion is here.

210
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:44,250
Who's your minion?

211
00:22:46,284 --> 00:22:49,017
Then we'll talk later, Win.

212
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:54,284
Thanks for the water.

213
00:22:59,683 --> 00:23:01,217
Thanks for the water, too.

214
00:23:25,648 --> 00:23:28,717
I knew you'd call me.

215
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,404
<i>Do you remember the jetty gangster?</i>

216
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:16,664
<i>They don't know who owns the place.</i>

217
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,983
<i>They asked for money, man.</i>

218
00:24:20,785 --> 00:24:23,575
<i>Tulakham locals must protect Tulakham.</i>

219
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,350
<i>So you beat them up and run away?</i>

220
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,883
<i>Hey.</i>

221
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:30,810
<i>I'm also from Tulakham, man.</i>

222
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,950
<i>Look.</i>

223
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,343
<i>Though I make a living
in different ways from you.</i>

224
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:36,317
<i>But for the sake of our homeland,</i>

225
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,383
<i>I must contribute, you know.</i>

226
00:24:59,977 --> 00:25:04,250
<i>Olarn, are you planning to bribe the officers?</i>

227
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,300
<i>Should I just throw you in jail?</i>

228
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:09,317
<i>Hey.</i>

229
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,150
<i>This is your mom's medical expenses.</i>

230
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:17,700
<i>Your mom has to live
and watch you become a good cop.</i>

231
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:22,983
Come on.

232
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,150
If you're going to shoot, then do it.

233
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:33,383
If you don't, sit down and eat.

234
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:48,517
You suck.

235
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:52,150
Your mother died because of a son like you.

236
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:56,617
Come on!

237
00:26:00,983 --> 00:26:01,983
Come on!

238
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:10,475
You want to shoot me
with the gun I gave you? Go ahead.

239
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,117
I'll do it for Tulakham.

240
00:26:16,217 --> 00:26:17,483
I'll kill a bad guy like you.

241
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,950
I'm the mayor.

242
00:26:21,383 --> 00:26:24,317
I'm not a street thug.

243
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,117
Remember,

244
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,683
I'm the mayor.

245
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,617
I'm the mayor.

246
00:26:35,817 --> 00:26:38,183
You can't kill me.

247
00:26:38,183 --> 00:26:40,850
I can't die now. No.

248
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,900
Why don't you understand
I'm doing this for you?

249
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,204
Why, Itt? Why?

250
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,483
Give me a 0.3.

251
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,650
Boss.

252
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:12,350
We saw Olarn's man
driving Itt's car out of town.

253
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:19,378
Find the signal for Shin's car.

254
00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:20,410
Yes.

255
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:22,664
Find Sargent Itt's car.

256
00:27:22,664 --> 00:27:24,250
Yes.

257
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,317
Come on, load it now.

258
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,717
Found the signal of Shin's car, bro.

259
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,183
Who ordered you to beat him?

260
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,083
Who told you?

261
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:17,917
He is my friend.

262
00:28:18,694 --> 00:28:20,160
If I didn't order you,

263
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:22,783
you guys don't do anything.

264
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:26,783
Untie him.

265
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:27,783
Yes.

266
00:28:58,143 --> 00:28:59,183
Tell me, Itt.

267
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:04,017
What evidence did you give them?

268
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:23,383
Come back to me, Itt.

269
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,150
Then we…

270
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:27,283
We'll take care of this city together.

271
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,083
That kid…

272
00:29:35,217 --> 00:29:37,917
is a nightmare for all of you.

273
00:29:39,637 --> 00:29:43,925
He's the one who will change
this dirty city, not you.

274
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,450
If you had killed him back then,

275
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,983
we wouldn't have met in this situation.

276
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:04,750
I don't want to see you
killing people on orders.

277
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,450
Then you have to be on my side.

278
00:30:24,317 --> 00:30:26,550
I'll give you a chance to make up your mind.

279
00:30:35,325 --> 00:30:36,325
Found his car.

280
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,650
Bro.

281
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:13,383
Let's go.

282
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:36,099
Follow him, man. Hurry up.

283
00:32:22,302 --> 00:32:23,569
Watch out!

284
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,083
Sargeant!

285
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,617
Hold on, Sargeant.

286
00:33:54,025 --> 00:33:55,050
Sargeant.

287
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,217
Sargeant, don't die.

288
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,483
You have a debt to pay.

289
00:34:01,203 --> 00:34:02,203
I want…

290
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,383
to kill Olarn with my own hands.

291
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,217
Gosh.

292
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:12,573
I feel ashamed of myself.

293
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:14,550
Sargent.

294
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,250
You must be alive
and pay for what you did.

295
00:34:24,285 --> 00:34:26,017
I want to be a good cop.

296
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:31,850
I apologize to you.

297
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:38,217
It shouldn't have happened.

298
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:43,117
I didn't kill anyone.

299
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,183
I'm serious.

300
00:34:55,183 --> 00:35:00,096
I've never killed anyone… never.

301
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,117
You owe me nothing, Sargent.

302
00:36:50,883 --> 00:36:52,350
If you were my friend,

303
00:36:54,883 --> 00:36:57,517
we wouldn't have to meet in this situation.

304
00:37:03,483 --> 00:37:04,783
You should tell Sargent Itt

305
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:07,917
that you'll meet him soon.

306
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,217
I think Itt can wait for you.

307
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:18,395
I want to be friends with
a new generation like you.

308
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:22,350

309
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,583
I am ready to face you in every way.

310
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:33,383
Your boss has a bad luck.

311
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:36,483
Whoever is involved with him

312
00:37:37,683 --> 00:37:39,250
will die in agony.

313
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:40,950
I warned you.

314
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,150
You'll never know
what evidence Itt left for me.

315
00:37:50,873 --> 00:37:53,883
If Itt had killed you 18 years ago,

316
00:37:53,883 --> 00:37:55,717
he wouldn't have died like this today.

317
00:37:59,183 --> 00:38:02,817
You better protect people around you.

318
00:38:18,183 --> 00:38:20,883
Find out what evidence he got from Itt.

319
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:22,683

00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,883

Well…

00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,417
Because…

365
00:44:33,231 --> 00:44:35,599
Because I got my lawyer's license back!!

366
00:44:39,992 --> 00:44:41,950
You have to treat us to Mookata.

367
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,683
Congratulations to a new lawyer.
Let's congrats her.

368
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:53,679
So, the trainee lawyer position must be vacant.

369
00:44:56,353 --> 00:44:58,783
How much have I paid you guys?

370
00:44:58,783 --> 00:45:00,317
Why is it like this?

371
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:03,650
So you guys are also in trouble, right?

372
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:04,650
You too!

373
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,550
Never catch up on anything.

374
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:09,348
Have you ever succeeded in anything?

375
00:45:09,348 --> 00:45:11,650
If Vasu doesn't say anything,

376
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,783
nothing happens.

377
00:45:13,783 --> 00:45:15,017
It should be manageable.

378
00:45:29,817 --> 00:45:31,717
<i>She's very concerned about this.</i>

379
00:45:31,717 --> 00:45:33,283
<i>She asked me to tell you that</i>

380
00:45:33,283 --> 00:45:36,183
<i>don't let it affect the New Tulakham project.</i>

381
00:45:36,183 --> 00:45:37,583
Let's finish it.

382
00:45:38,617 --> 00:45:40,017
Mayor Olarn.

383
00:46:04,517 --> 00:46:07,783
Are you sure you want to end this with you?

384
00:46:09,312 --> 00:46:12,717
I can assure you I have a way
to drag everyone out.

385
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:16,183
But you have to choose
whose side you want to be.

386
00:46:23,217 --> 00:46:24,650
This is Tulakham.

387
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:27,650
This is not a place for you to show off.

388
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,417
The one who should choose which side to be on

389
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,517
should be you.

390
00:46:37,537 --> 00:46:41,617
All this evidence can tie you up.

391
00:46:42,785 --> 00:46:44,083
Once you're done,

392
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:49,983
others will abandon you.

393
00:46:57,362 --> 00:47:00,150
You didn't even ask me about
the lawyer's license I got back.

394
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:04,117
Judge Chalinee help you to get it back, right?

395
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,117
Aren't you surprised at all?

396
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:11,083
Well, you did a good job
with the Sargent's case.

397
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:13,683
And you're her outstanding scholarship student.

398
00:47:13,683 --> 00:47:15,983
It wouldn't be hard for her
to return the license to you.

399
00:47:17,217 --> 00:47:19,050
But what I'm interested in is

400
00:47:20,117 --> 00:47:21,150
what she did it for.

401
00:47:21,864 --> 00:47:25,256
For favors or for other purposes?

402
00:47:27,496 --> 00:47:30,283
What if the other purpose is to make me
stop working with you?

403
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,683
Then I'll increase your interest.

404
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:37,517
You'll work with me for a long time.

405
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,304
Do you know?

406
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:45,817
Why did my dad want to keep the shop
so that he had a debt?

407
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:51,617
He wants to keep everything in the shop
as much as possible.

408
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,950
So my mom can find it one day.

409
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,350
I believe she is still alive.

410
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:01,150
And she will come back.

411
00:48:03,017 --> 00:48:06,983
Oh, what are these two chit-chat?
What are you discussing?

412
00:48:06,983 --> 00:48:10,050
We're here to celebrate. Come on.

413
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,050
Come on, there's so many food here.

414
00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:18,483
Don't sit down, bro.

415
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,875
Our lawless law firm

416
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:26,217
will win every case, cheer!

417
00:48:26,217 --> 00:48:29,617
- Cheer!
- Cheer!

418
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:32,150
Can I eat now?

419
00:49:12,922 --> 00:49:13,983
Hello.

420
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:16,650
I'm sorry.

421
00:49:17,217 --> 00:49:18,850
I have to bother you again, Prem.

422
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,317
You're like my sister.

423
00:49:22,317 --> 00:49:23,417
It's okay.

424
00:49:26,507 --> 00:49:27,550
I'm not here

425
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:29,817
to help you.

426
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:33,035
But I want to stop you instead.

427
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:38,550
I never forget

428
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:42,283
that you helped me all these 18 years.

429
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,250
But that day.

430
00:49:50,617 --> 00:49:52,517
If I hadn't taken those pictures,

431
00:49:59,212 --> 00:50:01,183
Nan wouldn't have died.

432
00:50:06,117 --> 00:50:07,517
I don't want to run away anymore.

433
00:50:09,777 --> 00:50:11,917
Everything here has changed.

434
00:50:14,031 --> 00:50:16,950
It's too dangerous for
someone like you to fight.

435
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:29,647
I always lose to this kind of determined look.

436
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,650
I can't stop you anymore.

437
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,717
Let me do it.

438
00:51:12,465 --> 00:51:15,023
I don't want you to work with that guy anymore.

439
00:51:15,023 --> 00:51:17,532
But I have to finish something.
<i>[Next Episode]</i>

440
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:20,265
Judge Chalinee promised to help.

441
00:51:20,265 --> 00:51:22,711
I just want you to protect Prao.

442
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:25,266
I'll handle it with the law
that my mother committed.

443
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:27,178
Thank you for honoring me, son.

444
00:51:27,178 --> 00:51:29,578
I'll drag you all to jail.

445
00:51:29,578 --> 00:51:32,447
I'm waiting to see what you can do.

446
00:51:32,447 --> 00:51:34,536
I want to be friends with you guys.

447
00:51:34,536 --> 00:51:37,625
I guess I'll have to
cut off your arms and legs.
