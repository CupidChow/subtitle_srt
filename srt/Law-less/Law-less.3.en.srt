If you don't mind,

6
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:07,407
can I buy the former mayor's murder case?
<i>[Previous Episode]</i>

7
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:12,034
I want to announce the opening of
the lawless law firm.

8
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,333
Why did you believe
that powerless lawyer over me?

9
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,004
I'm doing it for this city.
No one can change me.

10
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:22,788
And the best way is…

11
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:24,804
I have to die in this prison, right?

12
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:30,287
If Itt is not the murderer,
we must find the real murderer.

13
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:32,418
We're hunting down a suspect

14
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,100
who will be the key to solving
the assassination case of the former mayor.

15
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,034
That kid is alive.

16
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:40,650
And now he's a lawyer like his mother.

17
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,124
Find the killer.

18
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:44,624
And take this bastard!

19
00:02:49,357 --> 00:02:50,616
I investigated.

20
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:52,164
Someone asked my friend to make fake documents.

21
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:55,049
He'll get the documents at the old factory.

22
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,360
I'll handle him.

23
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,750
Easy.

24
00:05:14,717 --> 00:05:16,850
We just want you to be a witness.

25
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,560
No, no.

26
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:27,325
If something happens to this woman, you die.

27
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:39,320
I said let her go!

28
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,605
Don't come any closer.

29
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Prao.

30
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,717
I got you. You have to trust me.

31
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,400
Prao, look at me.

32
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,520
You have to trust me.

33
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,983
Trust me, Prao.

34
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,117
Hold my hand.

35
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:35,317
Don't let go.

36
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,350
Breaking news.

37
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,550
A tragic incident occurred

38
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,033
when an unidentified male body
fell into a machine.

39
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:46,641
Police are now reporting that
the unnamed male body

40
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:49,650
is illegal immigrant labor.

41
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,283
The officers are providing first aid
to witnesses at the scene.

42
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:55,360
<i>If there are any further…</i>

43
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,088
We followed him to find out some information.

44
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:26,544
You guys are lawyers but act like police.

45
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,320
What law did I break?

46
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,640
I think you guys should find
the criminal record.

47
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,280
Maybe you will find a connection.

48
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,817
Listen,

49
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,850
the police have CCTV footage from one corner.

50
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,050
But unfortunately, it's too far away.

51
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,350
At least,

52
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,117
you two won't be accused of attempted murder.

53
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,917
It's weird.

54
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:04,683
His mobile phone disappeared without a trace.

55
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,417
The investigation team
questioned witnesses and said

56
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,283
he was using his phone that day.

57
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,417
Don't just pick up charges
on us like this, Aeri.

58
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:21,817
Well, matter never disappears from this world.

59
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Isn't that right?

60
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:26,083
Mr. Lawyer.

61
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Of course.

62
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,850
But it depends on who finds it first.

63
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:45,840
We have undertaken the Jaibun Than Khun Pandin
Foundation for a while now.

64
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,760
We realize that there are many people
suffering in our city.

65
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,760
So, I do my best to solve
various problems for everyone.

66
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,583
I will drive citizen welfare.

67
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,217
Slums…

68
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:04,720
will become only photos.

69
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,000
We will all move to a more convenient,

70
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,880
modern, and safe condo.

71
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,283
The fish market we loved.

72
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:22,880
It will become a modern fish trading center.

73
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,950
There will be a dock for cargo ships.

74
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,450
Everyone wants to invest here.

75
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,983
Pha Phi Phluk will become a tourist attraction.

76
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:36,350
It will be a check-in spot for taking photos.

77
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,283
All of you…

78
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:42,383
will see what I intend to do this time.

79
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:44,783
I've only asked for one thing.

80
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:50,717
I request you to stand by me for our city.

81
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,383
Wow!

82
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:07,183
I admire your determination, Chairman Olarn.

83
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,160
This is a young-talented lawyer in this city.

84
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,120
There are so many people here.

85
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,880
Are you trying to steal my visibility?

86
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,750
Your analysis is great.

87
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,000
Now that the media is spotting me,

88
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,450
I would like to take this opportunity
to share important news

89
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,783
with the chairman and our media.

90
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:31,617
In the murder case of the former mayor,

91
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,983
the mastermind and the murderer
are still at large.

92
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,150
As for me, Lawyer Boripat,

93
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,750
I have more clues.

94
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:43,960
The deaths of the foreigners?

95
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,040
Means that the past has been a scapegoat?

96
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,320
Catch him.

97
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,240
Soon, for sure.

98
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:04,917
Citizens should be proud
to have such a good lawyer.

99
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,517
Don't ever break the law yourself.

100
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,480
He's gone. Let's beat the drum!

101
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Sir.

102
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,483
After the assassin died,

103
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:28,880
it was confirmed that
there was no evidence left, Sir.

104
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
How can you be sure?

105
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,640
Whatever you think is right, it's not.

106
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,783
You check with your eyes
to ensure no evidence is left.

107
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
- Yes, I'm going.
- Go.

108
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,517
You guys search for the phone
in every inch of this area.

109
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,817
Yorth.

110
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,817
Hello.

111
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,717
Hello.

112
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:48,250
Oh, hang up.

113
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:52,617
Check the number detail.

114
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:53,617
Yes, bro.

115
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:01,117
Why did you just show up?

116
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,160
That guy mocked me at my place.

117
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,718
They're going to get me, right?

118
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,128
No one has any evidence yet, sir.

119
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:27,917
Even the forensic team still hasn't found it.

120
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:32,750
I don't believe it.

121
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,752
Check the call history and the messages
that were exchanged.

122
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,883
I found that there was contact with Kom.

123
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:53,283
And there is a middleman
who is probably an agent.

124
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,752
The latest is on the day they caught him.

125
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:57,883
Tan is trying to decode another one.

126
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,350
So,
we have to find a way to track down this Agent.

127
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,896
There is no social media activity
on this phone.

128
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:12,264
This phone is for calling only.

129
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,650
Try to find a coordinate
in which he calls from,

130
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,117
and trace it from there.

131
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,283
- Yes, boss.
- Okay.

132
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,383
Yes, use this date, time, and place.

133
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:28,683
I've searched everywhere, sir.

134
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:29,683
But I can't find it.

135
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,983
I don't know what to say to you guys anymore.

136
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,650
Kom.

137
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:36,883
You're directly involved.

138
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,616
But you don't seem to be bothered at all.

139
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,650
Shin.

140
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,850
Spread our men everywhere you suspect,

141
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,850
and find the evidence.

142
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:49,384
Yes, sir.

143
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,783
I'm not a suspect.

144
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,600
Why are you questioning me?

145
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,350
I'm interested in the evidence that proves

146
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,050
what you and Lawyer Boripat said is true.

147
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,360
Not just making up stories
to make your client win.

148
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,450
I believe that my client is innocent.

149
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,083
And I will do everything to prove this fact.

150
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,583
If you're hesitant for some reason.

151
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,120
I think it's totally right.

152
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,800
We'll see who's right or wrong in the court.

153
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,183
But as both of you are lawyers,

154
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:52,456
you should know
that the penalty for hiding evidence.

155
00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:56,232
It could even revoke your license.

156
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,283
Can even lead to the revocation
of your license.

157
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:01,617
You admit it, right?

158
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,583
The police arrested the wrong guy.

159
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,883
Sargent Itt is innocent.

160
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:15,120
Excuse me.

161
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,117
As for the evidence,

162
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,383
it will be in your hands when the time comes.

163
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,320
Excuse me.

164
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,480
This way?

165
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,400
The signal is here.

166
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:45,173
He must work here.

167
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:46,760
Let's go.

168
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,320
Hey.

169
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:51,040
You pulled me hard.

170
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:56,450
From all the evidence we have,

171
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,650
Itt ties up the defendant
in the former mayor's case.

172
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,450
How is it possible?

173
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,917
The new defendant shows up.

174
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,950
Ms. Erika.

175
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,270
He's dead anyway.

176
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,050
I think we shouldn't worry about that.

177
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,883
I don't want to miss out.

178
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:15,783
This is an important case for me.

179
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,383
As a prosecutor,

180
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:21,983
I have to make sure we don't get the wrong guy.

181
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,336
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,120
The survey results show that our Tulakham

183
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,783
has several degraded areas,

184
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:33,217
which should be taken care of.

185
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:35,783
Such as the port area

186
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,717
of Phi Phluk Shrine.

187
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:44,483
Six educational institutions are still lacking.

188
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:49,017
Though they have received help
from the judge's foundation.

189
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,550
Why?

190
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,650
You should be good at the bad things, too.

191
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:00,840
Oh, sir.

192
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,520
What about the foundation?

193
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
It's all right.

194
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,120
Hundreds of people come to ask
for donations every day.

195
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Our boys are going out to help them.

196
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:17,292
Good.

197
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:24,383
Many people are asking for donations,
meaning the city has many problems.

198
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,417
- Olarn.
- Mr. Olarn.

199
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:33,280
Olarn.

200
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,616
Why do you run for this election?

201
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:38,550
I will be the mayor of Tulakham.

202
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:43,817
I will improve the quality of life
for Tulakham people.

203
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:46,517
I will revive the New Tulakham project.

204
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:51,650
I will make our jetty beautiful, modern,
and worth investing in.

205
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,250
I'll make every natural spot in our city

206
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,450
to be a tourist attraction.

207
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,650
I'll generate income for our people.

208
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:00,800
Yes.

209
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,120
How confident are you in this application?

210
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:07,317
Very confident.

211
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:10,950
I know that the citizens
of Tulakham know me well.

212
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,360
Thank you.

213
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,216
Olarn, Olarn, Olarn.

214
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:21,112
Ma'am.

215
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,607
<i>I will improve the quality of life
for Tulakham people.</i>

216
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:32,359
<i>I will revive the New Tulakham project.</i>

217
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,360
Do you have nothing to say?

218
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,576
What do you want me to say?

219
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,183
A guy like Olarn, huh?

220
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:48,617
Will revive the New Tulakham project.

221
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:52,040
He'll build a jetty to draw
investor's attention.

222
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,383
Also, he will make this city
a tourist attraction.

223
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,850
He has a daydream, right? Ma'am.

224
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,917
He hasn't even been elected yet.

225
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:06,483
Whether he'll elected.

226
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:09,568
It's his business.

227
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,817
I'm sorry, ma'am.

228
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:38,550
You must be overjoyed.

229
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:44,517
But after this, I may have to bother you.

230
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:48,917
If I win.

231
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,517
I'll transfer all my shares

232
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:54,983
to your foundation.

233
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,783
My foundation is too small.

234
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:04,050
It's probably not suited.

235
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,450
Without Kamnan Chot,

236
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,317
I wouldn't be here today.

237
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,560
Therefore, there is no more suitable charity
than your foundation.

238
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,250
What's your plan for this election?

239
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,583
You're wearing a hat in Olarn Group.

240
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,650
I will transfer all of Olarn Group's shares

241
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:54,950
to the Judge Chalinee Foundation.

242
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:57,017
So that the foundation

243
00:22:57,017 --> 00:22:59,374
can continue to create benefits.

244
00:22:59,374 --> 00:23:01,520
It's a very risky bet.

245
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,850
It's not risky.

246
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,750
I do it for Tulakham.

247
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,731
Besides, it's a way to show my sincerity.

248
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,123
I have no conflict of interest.

249
00:23:17,745 --> 00:23:18,745
Oh.

250
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,000
Ma'am Judge, who are you
particularly supporting?

251
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,117
No one.

252
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,440
I'm a law enforcement officer.

253
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,650
I came here to see if today's candidates

254
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,750
would support our city's election laws
to be transparent.

255
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,950
I'll…

256
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,760
hold on to the law.

257
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,217
And I hope that

258
00:23:52,217 --> 00:23:57,083
you will agree with the policy I deploy
to develop our Tulakham.

259
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:07,600
Olarn, Olarn.

260
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,496
Excellent.

261
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:09,612
Mr. Olarn, hello.

262
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:11,909
Oh, hello. Wow.

263
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,960
I am very proud of you.

264
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,983
You built this fish market.

265
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:22,717
Everyone here can live on because of you.

266
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:25,736
Oh, no.

267
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:27,383
Yes.

268
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:30,380
Yes. Oh, Thank you.

269
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,217
Sir.

270
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:34,017
You are the idol for labor here.

271
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:36,050
Do your best, go for it!

272
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:38,083
Go for it!

273
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,783
Develop yourself to the limit.

274
00:24:39,783 --> 00:24:41,720
- Yes.
- Okay, see you.

275
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,480
Great!

276
00:24:50,328 --> 00:24:53,656
To reward you for your great effort,

277
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:58,450
the chairman will provide you with jobs.

278
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,088
When the chairman becomes the mayor of
Tulakham,

279
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:10,650
we will help him develop this city,

280
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,683
the New Tulakham project,

281
00:25:12,683 --> 00:25:15,317
and public utilities.

282
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:17,550
We'll make a jetty
and Pha Phi Phluk beautifully.

283
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:21,683
It would bring many tourists and investors.

284
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:23,017
And when that day comes,

285
00:25:23,017 --> 00:25:25,783
all of us will be rich.

286
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,728
Enjoy!

287
00:25:34,728 --> 00:25:35,728
- Sir.
- Uh.

288
00:25:36,717 --> 00:25:37,917
Someone wants to see you.

289
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,550
How do you know Sargent Itt
is not the murderer?

290
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,650
How can you be sure you didn't look
at the wrong person?

291
00:25:57,486 --> 00:25:58,683
I saw him clearly.

292
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,200
Well, Sargent Itt is lame.

293
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,150
But the guy who killed him that day
didn't have a crippled leg.

294
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,617
I'm not a police.

295
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,750
Why did you tell me?

296
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,560
Well…

297
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,520
My life has been tough.

298
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,499
I want to live as comfortably as others.

299
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:17,983
I mean…

300
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:20,117
If you would kindly give me some money,

301
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:21,120
I can assure you.

302
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,040
I will keep it until the day I die, sir.

303
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:26,880
Why would he give you money?

304
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,054
Well…

305
00:26:31,217 --> 00:26:34,517
That day,
I saw that the person who drove away was…

306
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:39,325
You must keep it until you die.

307
00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:41,587
Yes, sir.

308
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:06,331
There's no way this guy would commit suicide.

309
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,883
How come?

310
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:12,283
The suicide note is in the pocket

311
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:13,883
saying that he has debt from gambling.

312
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,083
He has no way out.

313
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:17,483
Are you an idiot?

314
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:20,250
What kind of suicide would write such a letter?

315
00:27:21,713 --> 00:27:24,417
Don't be too fishy.

316
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:26,650
You're too suspicious.

317
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,383
That's why you didn't get a promotion.

318
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:31,717
He committed suicide. That's it.

319
00:27:44,472 --> 00:27:51,083
I think Olarn probably didn't invite
us to just eat delicious food. Huh?

320
00:27:52,243 --> 00:27:55,187
That means there's a hidden agenda?

321
00:27:56,736 --> 00:27:57,950
Of course.

322
00:27:59,383 --> 00:28:03,296
Someone made big news in this city today.

323
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:06,598
News about running for mayor of this city.

324
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:07,325
Right?

325
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,017
I have to thank everyone who supported me.

326
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:16,183
Supporting what?

327
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,250
No need to compete against each other.

328
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,683
So, you apply alone.

329
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:25,350
This election.

330
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:29,584
We should add two more competitors.

331
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:33,783
But no one wants to compete with you.

332
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:36,117
The title of mayor of this city

333
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:39,617
belongs solely to Chairman Olarn.

334
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,450
But should you have some political knowledge?

335
00:28:45,483 --> 00:28:47,617
Oh, if that's the case.

336
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,017
Please advise me.

337
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:58,117
I don't care who's ready to run.

338
00:28:58,117 --> 00:29:00,950
But I care whoever gets it

339
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,883
will govern this city in the right place
and at the right time.

340
00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:07,583
Right, Mr. Olarn?

341
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:10,650
Of course.

342
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,488
Our city's best fish.

343
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,517
Prao?

344
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:16,840
Are you Prao?

345
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:19,277
Detective Songob.

346
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,240
Hey, it's you!

347
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,783
Hello!

348
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,917
It's been a long time.

349
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:29,280
You've grown up, haven't you?

350
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,000
Yes.

351
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,550
I can barely recognize you.

352
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,450
Yes.

353
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,683
It's been many years.

354
00:30:34,683 --> 00:30:36,117
Anyway, I…

355
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:38,040
I'm sorry about your mother.

356
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:43,383
But I believe that my mother is still alive.

357
00:30:45,523 --> 00:30:49,328
Have you heard any news
or additional information?

358
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,240
It's been 18 years, huh?

359
00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:02,083
Actually, I have one document.

360
00:31:03,183 --> 00:31:05,350
But I don't know if it's useful or not.

361
00:31:06,008 --> 00:31:07,517
I've kept it for a long time.

362
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,517
Meet me at the station if you're free.

363
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,064
Okay, thank you.

364
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:16,230
Okay, see you later.

365
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,230
Yes.

366
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,800
<i>Police are now reporting that the unidentified
male body</i>

367
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,805
<i>is illegal immigrant labor.</i>

368
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:04,349
<i>The officers are providing first aid
to the witnesses at the scene.</i>

369
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,750
<i>In the murder case of the former mayor,</i>

370
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,217
<i>the mastermind and the murderer
are still at large.</i>

371
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:24,528
These are the missing person's files
when your mother went missing.

372
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:26,250
There's only a copy.

373
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,250
The original files are gone.

374
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:31,583
How many people have died at Pha Phi Phluk?

375
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,817
And the day my mother disappeared,

376
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:35,550
did someone jump off the cliff?

377
00:32:49,056 --> 00:32:50,464
Thank you very much.

378
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:52,891
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

379
00:33:52,891 --> 00:33:56,920
<i>♪ Happy birthday, Happy birthday ♪</i>

380
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,880
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

381
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,960
Happy birthday, sweetie.

382
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,650
Thank you, Dad.

383
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:11,280
Then… I'll make a wish.

384
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,200
Go ahead.

385
00:34:19,072 --> 00:34:21,383
I think what I want to pray

386
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,017
is the same to you.

387
00:34:27,128 --> 00:34:28,880
Then, let's pray together.

388
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:35,139
May Mom come back to live with us again.

389
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:48,395
- Let's eat! Let's eat!
- Wait.

390
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:50,160
I'll go get a knife to cut it.

391
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
Okay.

392
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,135
<i>Be quiet, sit down.</i>

393
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:46,201
<i>Ouch!</i>

394
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,040
<i>Hey, hey, where are you going?</i>

395
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,840
<i>Let me go, let me go.</i>

396
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:10,472
<i>Let me go.</i>

397
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:18,415
<i>Let him go, I said let him go.</i>

398
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,416
<i>Hey, where are you going?</i>

399
00:36:28,483 --> 00:36:29,483
<i>Go, run away.</i>

400
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,083
<i>Run away.</i>

401
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,283
<i>Go, Run away, Kiddo.</i>

402
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:42,950
Happy birthday, Prao.

403
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,150
Hello.

404
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,360
Who is this?

405
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,683
Does this number sound familiar?

406
00:37:19,824 --> 00:37:21,203
What do you want?

407
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:23,750
I heard that someone
had a bad feeling over there.

408
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,483
So, I'm calling to cheer up.

409
00:37:25,483 --> 00:37:27,883
If you have something to say, just say it.
Stop playing around.

410
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:43,139
You probably don't want to see your boy
groaning like a dog, right?

411
00:37:49,424 --> 00:37:51,317
Hello, Chairman Olarn.

412
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,083
Beautiful office.

413
00:37:55,997 --> 00:37:57,750
It could be better

414
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,217
if you let Sargent Itt
walk around here sometimes.

415
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:02,217
Sit down.

416
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,152
Hey.

417
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:21,800
I heard that
your boys are looking for this phone.

418
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,360
That's why I bring it to you.

419
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,317
This is a paperweight.

420
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:27,317
I have a lot of them.

421
00:38:27,883 --> 00:38:29,450
Keep it to yourself.

422
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,983
Information inside the phone.

423
00:38:37,517 --> 00:38:38,917
Go get it in the court.

424
00:39:01,168 --> 00:39:03,183
Wow, bro, that's so cool.

425
00:39:03,183 --> 00:39:05,483
"The information inside the phone,
go get it in the court."

426
00:39:05,483 --> 00:39:06,783
Whoa.

427
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:11,228
Entering the tiger's den
is so exciting, isn't it, bro?

428
00:39:11,228 --> 00:39:12,520
What should we do next?

429
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,283
Why is it too much

430
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:19,817
to get me out of here?

431
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:22,283
At least you're in here,

432
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:24,783
and you'll be safe, man.

433
00:39:24,783 --> 00:39:29,450
I want you to live here
safe and sound.

434
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,480
While the chairman is campaigning.

435
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,283
You have to accept your fate here.

436
00:39:34,283 --> 00:39:36,450
Your mother will be safe.

437
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,480
What are you going to do to my mother?

438
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,350
Itt!

439
00:39:39,683 --> 00:39:42,150
I'm taking care of your mom.

440
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:45,817
And I'll keep watch over her

441
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,550
as long as you cooperate.

442
00:39:51,965 --> 00:39:54,333
You never change your ways.

443
00:39:59,176 --> 00:40:00,917
I'm good at this.

444
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,717
But I still insist that

445
00:40:05,617 --> 00:40:08,750
I don't want to use this way with your mother.

446
00:40:17,808 --> 00:40:18,920
<i>Hello.</i>

447
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,872
Hello, Mom. How are you?

448
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:23,960
<i>I'm busy and tired now.</i>

449
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,520
Next time, don't send me anything.

450
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
You come in person.

451
00:40:30,072 --> 00:40:31,783
Wait for me, Mom.

452
00:40:31,783 --> 00:40:32,950
If I can get out…

453
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:38,416
If I return this time, I'll build
the storage shed for you, Mom.

454
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,528
Will you make it next week?

455
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,283
Next week?

456
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,248
I'll try my best, Mom.

457
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:48,183
Mommy.

458
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:50,617
You're all alone.
Take good care of yourself, Mom.

459
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,600
You too, take care.

460
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,544
Yes, Mom.

461
00:40:57,544 --> 00:40:59,139
That's all.

462
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:19,183
I checked the phone.

463
00:41:19,717 --> 00:41:21,450
The number the assassin calls most often.

464
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,450
It's the Agent's number.

465
00:41:24,117 --> 00:41:25,483
Do you know the address?

466
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,483
I know.

467
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,150
I'll go with you.

468
00:41:29,326 --> 00:41:31,438
I don't have time to manage risk.

469
00:41:32,462 --> 00:41:34,283
But I'm on your team.

470
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,983
I need to know everything.

471
00:41:36,484 --> 00:41:38,617
And this time,
it's directly related to the case.

472
00:41:38,617 --> 00:41:39,683
I really need to know.

473
00:42:04,507 --> 00:42:05,617
Here we go.

474
00:42:05,617 --> 00:42:07,792
Keep an eye on him.

475
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,050
Okay, got it.

476
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,120
He's wearing a black jacket,
and walking into the market.

477
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,400
Okay, I see him.

478
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:55,800
How are you, Mom? How's business?

479
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,825
Good, son.

480
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,483
- I just got more fish to sell.
- Good, Mom.

481
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:10,440
Hey, don't.

482
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,417
I don't want his mother to be upset.

483
00:43:14,104 --> 00:43:15,704
You have a soft side, too.

484
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:25,560
I hope you win the lottery.

485
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,373
Hey, bro, he's about to leave.

486
00:43:36,312 --> 00:43:37,383
You watch his mom.

487
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,050
Keep her out of this.

488
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,840
Where are you going?

489
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,360
What?

490
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
Hey, come here.

491
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,417
Thank you very much, everyone.

492
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:13,083
I had to come here first.

493
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:18,283
This place and the locals
here are my family.

494
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,550
A little further from here

495
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,883
is the old fish porridge shop

496
00:45:23,883 --> 00:45:26,792
where I worked there when I was young.

497
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:30,650
I've succeeded because of this place.

498
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,850
Therefore, it's time for me to repay the favor.

499
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,383
My New Tulakham project

500
00:45:40,383 --> 00:45:45,944
will provide people with a decent, modern home,

501
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:47,720
and free from influence.

502
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,317
Listen up, please.

503
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:00,717
I'm Lawyer Boripat.

504
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:02,883
I handle the murder case of the former mayor.

505
00:46:02,883 --> 00:46:05,683
I'm here to inform you all
of the important things.

506
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:10,083
I've arrested the Agent
who got the mayor killed.

507
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:19,250
And I'm handing over this witness
to Prosecutor Erika.

508
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,483
She is the prosecutor of this case.

509
00:46:21,483 --> 00:46:25,550
I hope that Prosecutor Erika
will conduct her job fairly.

510
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,199
Wait.

511
00:46:45,283 --> 00:46:47,083
Aren't you afraid that I'll win?

512
00:46:48,768 --> 00:46:51,117
The Agent with you would be safe.

513
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,568
Keep him as a witness.

514
00:46:53,568 --> 00:46:57,283
His only chance to enter the trial is with you.

515
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:02,150
I hope you won't disappoint the public.

516
00:47:05,352 --> 00:47:07,560
Are lawyers like this these days?

517
00:47:08,935 --> 00:47:11,317
They just want to make up someone to witness
and do it.

518
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:16,734
I guess I'll lay my hope on Prosecutor Erika.

519
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:21,550
I'm counting on you.

520
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:45,505
My lawyer said he got a new witness.

521
00:47:45,505 --> 00:47:48,040
You couldn't stand the anxiety,
so you had to run over here?

522
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,250
I'm not that anxious.

523
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:56,250
I just don't want you to assume that
you're winning this case.

524
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:59,183
How could you think I'd lose?

525
00:48:00,217 --> 00:48:02,250
You obviously see that we've got a new witness.

526
00:48:13,314 --> 00:48:14,314
Itt,

527
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:17,783
that's your shirt, your shoes.

528
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,483
The best evidence is now
in the prosecutor's hands.

529
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,840
How can you get away with this?

530
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,717
You set me up in the first place.

531
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,200
You bastard!

532
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,250
That's also important evidence.

533
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,250
How can I give it to anyone so easily?

534
00:48:38,968 --> 00:48:39,883
But,

535
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,583
it's gone now.

536
00:48:48,764 --> 00:48:49,250
You…

537
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:51,017
Don't be aggressive, Sargent.

538
00:48:51,017 --> 00:48:52,450
Behave yourself.

539
00:48:52,983 --> 00:48:54,850
Then, nothing will happen.

540
00:48:57,872 --> 00:48:59,750
Stay here for a while.

541
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,850
Then, I'll find a way to help you.

542
00:49:02,983 --> 00:49:04,283
It won't be long.

543
00:49:06,035 --> 00:49:07,083
You bastard!

544
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:10,808
Anyway,

545
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:14,550
you and I are both Tulakham people.

546
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:20,720
Think carefully.

547
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:31,150
Sir,

548
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,583
this is your popularity poll.

549
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:36,480
You can see the surrounding area in a circle.

550
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,160
It has a popularity score of 89-90 percent.

551
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,080
89-90 percent.

552
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,050
There will be only the middle area.

553
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:45,683
If we can get into this area,
that would be great.

554
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:48,417
Hey.

555
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:49,417
Open.

556
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:51,217
Hello.

557
00:49:51,217 --> 00:49:52,217
Please.

558
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,850
It's an honor that you come to visit me here.

559
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,750
You should have told me.

560
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,517
So I can prepare for the welcome.

561
00:50:03,517 --> 00:50:04,383
Please.

562
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:06,350
I don't need to tell you in advance.

563
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,183
You just do your job.

564
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,717
Did the campaign go well?

565
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,850
I saw that your enemy suddenly attacked you.

566
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,117
Well…

567
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,617
It's normal when
you're doing something important

568
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:24,550
for the country.

569
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,976
You must have a great nuisance.

570
00:50:26,976 --> 00:50:28,640
Huh? Is that so?

571
00:50:31,346 --> 00:50:34,331
Do you know about this?

572
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,383
When it comes to the case,

573
00:50:36,383 --> 00:50:38,283
even a little bit,

574
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:41,050
Erika has to report to me anyway.

575
00:50:42,717 --> 00:50:43,883
The case…

576
00:50:43,883 --> 00:50:45,983
is a matter for the prosecutor and the court.

577
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:47,883
Election…

578
00:50:48,983 --> 00:50:50,483
is your business.

579
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:55,017
Election is important.

580
00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:00,017
Our Tulakham cannot stand with
the leader's absence for long.

581
00:51:05,915 --> 00:51:07,195
Yes ma'am.

582
00:51:39,317 --> 00:51:44,095
In the next trial, you will plead guilty, as we discussed.

583
00:51:44,095 --> 00:51:46,833
Everything in this town…

584
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:49,522
is manipulated by someone.

585
00:51:49,522 --> 00:51:51,486
He never told me who that is.

586
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:55,953
There's only one person who can
give orders to Olarn.

587
00:51:55,953 --> 00:51:59,735
I've survived because a woman helped me.

588
00:51:59,735 --> 00:52:01,757
Who is she?

589
00:52:01,757 --> 00:52:06,802
- Just a woman, why do you care so much?
- She could be my mom.
