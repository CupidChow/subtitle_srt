<i>[Previous Episode]</i>

6
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,629
You weren't like this when using others.

7
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:13,363
Let the defendant give her testimony.

8
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:15,129
I really went there.

9
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:16,738
But someone instructed me.

10
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:26,421
I want you to meet someone.

11
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:33,028
This is my mother.

12
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,819
Shin!

13
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:56,173
Tell me what you want me to do.

14
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:58,838
You've been using the media power
in your hands to serve the wicked.

15
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:03,350
It's time you use it to save this city.

16
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:09,642
Chalinee, Chalinee, Chalinee!

17
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:48,645
<i>[Everything will be fine if you confess.]</i>

18
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,017
<i>You must confess, so it ends like this.</i>

19
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,817
<i>Then the justice system
will remain untarnished.</i>

20
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:09,417
<i>Think carefully.
I will take good care of Erika.</i>

21
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,250
It's finally come to this day.

22
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:30,083
It's a waste that I loved
and supported you all along.

23
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:35,501
Wasn't it you who taught me
to love what's right?

24
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:38,650
Today, I'll do what you taught me.

25
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:49,383
Today, I'll make you suffer
for what you've done.

26
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,950
We'll just have to wait and see.

<i>[Court of Tulakham]</i>

28
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:19,583
<i>Mom, please confess.</i>

29
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,050
<i>What you said about Chalinee in that video.</i>

30
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,617
<i>You lied to save yourself.</i>

31
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:30,844
<i>Aeri, I didn't lie, dear.</i>

32
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:33,498
<i>Someone told me to do it.</i>

33
00:05:34,412 --> 00:05:36,137
<i>Aeri, don't get involved with her.</i>

34
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:38,812
<i>She's never truly loved anyone.</i>

35
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:43,217
<i>Do you think I don't know what's what?</i>

36
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:48,285
<i>I followed your orders my whole life.</i>

37
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:53,550
<i>Now, it's your turn to repay me.</i>

38
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:00,583
<i>Can you do this for me?</i>

39
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:23,283
Commencing the final court hearing.

40
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:29,221
Mrs. Prangthip Phongpinij hired someone
to kill the spa worker.

41
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:32,050
Evidence in the form of a video has surfaced.

42
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:33,917
Showing that…

43
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:39,950
Ms. Prangthip implicated
Ms. Chalinee Sritulwong,

44
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,750
judge of the Tulakham Court.

45
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,417
Please have Detective Sangob announce
the results of the video investigation.

46
00:06:59,957 --> 00:07:03,917
The forensic science division
has thoroughly investigated the video.

47
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:07,417
No editing, duplication,
or added audio was found.

48
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:08,950
The video is genuine.

49
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:17,483
Next, let's call Lawyer Koson Saisin.

50
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:20,183
Ms. Chalinee's representative, to testify.

51
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:35,417
<i>All this evidence shows that Prangthip…</i>

52
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:38,250
<i>used your name for personal gain many times.</i>

53
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,650
<i>And it proves that
you had nothing to do with it.</i>

54
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:48,417
All the profits were consistently transferred
into Prangthip's account.

55
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,364
Indicating that Prangthip

56
00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:57,417
frequently used the Judge's name.

57
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,150
Suggesting that…

58
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,917
Mrs. Prangthip may have used the Judge's name
to hire someone to kill a spa worker.

59
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,350
To cover up her crime.

60
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,950
Let the defendant give her final statement.

61
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,283
I don't have much to say.

62
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:53,817
I admit I hired someone
to kill that spa worker.

63
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,817
With the defendant's confession,

64
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:09,600
The court rules…

65
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,683
wait a minute.

66
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:15,750
I think the defendant hasn't finished speaking.

67
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:40,317
<i>And did you make me a judge like her?</i>

68
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:51,850
<i>Right now, I don't care what happens to anyone.</i>

69
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,050
<i>My future is in her hands now.</i>

70
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,483
<i>Wasn't it you who taught me?</i>

71
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:06,017
<i>To stay close, to emulate her.</i>

72
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:10,050
<i>I followed your teachings my whole life.</i>

73
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:17,050
<i>Now, consider it as…</i>

74
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:23,983
<i>your responsibility for raising me
to be this way.</i>

75
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:34,283
<i>Aeri.</i>

76
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:59,283
<i>Aeri, I'm sorry.</i>

77
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:06,383
<i>For making you this way.</i>

78
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,550
I hired them, it's true.

79
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:31,250
But someone else ordered me.

80
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:35,783
That person is…

81
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,817
Judge Chalinee.

82
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:04,350
You said you came to help her, hurry up!

83
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:06,617
The viewers are demanding it!

84
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:10,612
Please remain calm.

85
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,072
I'll consider what the defendant just said.

86
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:20,517
To be a result of poor judgment
and a desperate attempt to save herself.

87
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:26,650
As the one who was implicated, I forgive her.

88
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:31,050
And I request that part
of the testimony be expunged.

89
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:34,550
Next is the verdict.

90
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,617
Wait a minute.

91
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,917
I'd like to testify.

92
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:51,850
The court is delivering its verdict,
this is not allowed.

93
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,683
But my testimony will clear your name.

94
00:12:58,017 --> 00:12:59,017
No.

95
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,528
Actually…

96
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,850
Olarn's name was listed
as a witness from the beginning.

97
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:07,117
He should testify.

98
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,416
Public opinion is also unanimous.

99
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,450
Let the former mayor help you.

100
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:24,742
Please.

101
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:40,250
Hey everyone, let's support Olarn!

102
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:48,600
Olarn!

103
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:52,850
I need to tell a longer story.

104
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:57,017
I'll be talking about Judge Chalinee.

105
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:10,683
I swear on my life…

106
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,517
Judge Chalinee…

107
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:17,500
has always wanted to improve Tulakham

108
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,996
ever since she was a child.

109
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,908
Judge Chalinee never agreed
with what Kamnan Chot did.

110
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:31,450
But that caused Judge…

111
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:38,517
to be scolded and severely punished by
her father, Kamnan Chot, throughout her life.

112
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:45,083
I understand and pity her greatly.

113
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:49,837
And over time,

114
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:58,350
that pity turned into love.

115
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:04,750
I've tried to protect Judge Chalinee all along.

116
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:23,877
One day, the Judge tried to protect

117
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:26,783
her close friend.

118
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,883
Her close friend attempted
to expose Kamnan Chot.

119
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:39,883
Causing her to hurt
her own father accidentally.

120
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:45,783
Of course, I had to prevent her
from being tarnished.

121
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:51,550
It was me.

122
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:57,517
I was the one who killed Kamnan Chot.

123
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:00,513
Yes.

124
00:16:00,513 --> 00:16:05,098
I decided to betray him

125
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,783
to protect the one I love.

126
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,017
I thought that would be the end of it all.

127
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:15,417
Unfortunately.

128
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:24,383
Another one of the Judge's close friends,
whom she cherished…

129
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:29,317
happened to see and record the incident.

130
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:32,250
Also,

131
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:37,850
she'll report that Chalinee was involved
in killing her own father.

132
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:39,583
Following that incident.

133
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:46,683
Judge Chalinee found herself
in a precarious position, completely alone.

134
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,450
With me…

135
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:57,283
taking care of eliminating those treacherous
friends and those who stood in her way.

136
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:05,850
So Judge Chalinee could work
to make Tulakham the way she dreamed.

137
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,483
Hey everyone.

138
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,383
Olarn tricked us!

139
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:17,917
- Hey!
- Olarn! Olarn!

140
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:20,800
Olarn, Olarn, you tricked us?

141
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,850
Hey, you evil, wicked Olarn!

142
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,599
Hey, let go! Let go!

143
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,050
Hey, you wicked one! You tricked us!

144
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:34,933
Enough, Olarn, that's enough.

145
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,650
Stop talking nonsense, it's not true.

146
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:43,817
And it's irrelevant to the case. Enough!

147
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,650
Who says it's not true?

148
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:58,217
Let's see if this is evidence or not.

149
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:03,850
This picture wasn't edited.
But it's a real photo taken by Ms. Haruetai.

150
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,717
Anyone can do this.

151
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,483
Nothing is confirmed.

152
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:15,550
What if there are eyewitnesses at the scene?

153
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:26,483
I'd like to call a witness.

154
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,750
Mrs. Haruetai Chayanit.

155
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:32,850
The photographer.

156
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:57,050
Viewers, this is…

157
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,150
The deceased spa worker.

158
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,117
The face everyone sees…

159
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:16,883
and recognizes as the deceased spa worker.

160
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,350
It's not the real face.

161
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:27,683
Do you remember who the woman standing here is?

162
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:36,517
This woman…

163
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,150
is a friend who secretly filmed the event.

164
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,817
That Chalinee directed Kamnan Chot's murder.

165
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:45,983
And afterward, she fled to Korea.

166
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:54,250
Changing her face and transforming
her identity to escape capture.

167
00:19:54,942 --> 00:19:56,750
From someone known as her best friend.

168
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,683
And she is my mother.

169
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:09,017
Haruetai.

170
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:13,017
I confirm everything Olarn said is true.

171
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,383
And those pieces of evidence are all real.

172
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,217
Because I took them myself.

173
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:30,083
That's enough, stop now, before it's too late.

174
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:33,183
Don't hurt anyone anymore.

175
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,450
Everyone, listen up.

176
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:54,083
I'm here today to own up to everything.
I'm the one at fault.

177
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,183
I indulged her and helped her.

178
00:20:57,914 --> 00:21:00,319
Making the mistake even more serious.

179
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:02,783
That's why she's a completely different person

180
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:06,319
from the girl who wanted to make
this city better.

181
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,047
It's my fault.

182
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,817
And I'm here today…

183
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,283
to beg you.

184
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:23,217
Young lady.

185
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,617
Let's stop here.

186
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:35,883
You should admit your guilt.

187
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:39,450
Accept the punishment.

188
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,717
Then you'll have a chance
to become a good person again.

189
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,683
Do good things for this city.

190
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:51,550
Like you've dreamed of.

191
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,717
No.

192
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:02,950
It shouldn't be like this.

193
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,450
No.

194
00:22:11,783 --> 00:22:14,117
I propose to reopen this case,

195
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:20,717
and all cases related to Judge Chalinee.

196
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:22,568
So Judge Chalinee can fight the case.

197
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:27,483
But you need to stop being a judge
at the Tulakham court first.

198
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,750
No.

199
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:33,883
Don't think you have no one, Young Lady.

200
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:36,117
You still have me, and you always have.

201
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,617
Just admit your mistake, please.

202
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:44,104
No.

203
00:22:46,883 --> 00:22:50,050
Admit your fault, Judge.

204
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:10,756
Pause the trial.

205
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,450
Get out! Everyone out! Get out!

206
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:52,817
Everyone, our Chalinee is being bullied.

207
00:23:52,817 --> 00:23:54,319
Are we going to accept this?

208
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,795
- No way.
- Absolutely not.

209
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:57,395
- Not accepting.
- We won't accept this.

210
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,699
Let's go up and support her. Come on!

211
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:02,483
- Hey, hurry up!
- Chalinee!

212
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,017
Chalinee! You can do it!

213
00:24:06,683 --> 00:24:11,092
Chalinee, keep fighting!

214
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:13,607
<i>[Chalinee is a fraud.]</i>

215
00:24:13,607 --> 00:24:15,035
<i>[Chalinee is innocent, we don't believe.]</i>

216
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:16,357
<i>[Olarn, a fake mayor.]</i>

217
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:17,575
<i>[Get out! Get out!]</i>

218
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:38,950
Chalinee, fight on!

219
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,050
Hey, let go!

220
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,617
Chalinee, fight!

221
00:24:41,617 --> 00:24:42,319
- Hey!
- Chalinee!

222
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,471
Let me go!

223
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:44,742
Chalinee!

224
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:46,790
Chalinee, keep fighting!

225
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,094
Chalinee, fight on!

226
00:24:55,283 --> 00:24:56,796
<i>Ruetai took the photos, right?</i>

227
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,416
<i>I'm trying to find a way to help you.</i>

228
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:17,983
<i>I'm the one trying to help you.</i>

229
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,183
<i>If this hadn't happened,</i>

230
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:24,383
<i>you would die.</i>

231
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:27,417
<i>Your whole family too.</i>

232
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:29,883
<i>You said we were friends.</i>

233
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,392
<i>We were supposed to make
this city better together.</i>

234
00:25:37,215 --> 00:25:39,017
<i>I'm looking for ways to help you.</i>

235
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:41,583
<i>But it must be done according to the law.</i>

236
00:25:42,283 --> 00:25:43,517
<i>Honestly, in this matter, if you…</i>

237
00:25:43,517 --> 00:25:45,917
<i>If Olarn is forcing you
to the point you acted out,</i>

238
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:47,850
<i>you just have to speak the truth.</i>

239
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,050
<i>And if in the end you…</i>

240
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,319
<i>If, in the end, you really have to go to jail.</i>

241
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,508
<i>One day you'll serve your time and come out.</i>

242
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:58,523
<i>Then we can fulfill our ideals together.</i>

243
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:05,117
<i>But you shouldn't treat me like this.</i>

244
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:20,983
<i>She said that everything she did was for us.</i>

245
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:27,817
<i>If I had a choice, I wouldn't even
want to take this case.</i>

246
00:26:30,314 --> 00:26:35,550
<i>Whether it's right or wrong,
we can figure that out later.</i>

247
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:39,414
<i>But that doesn't mean I won't do anything.</i>

248
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:41,850
<i>It doesn't mean I won't help at all.</i>

249
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:44,163
<i>And it doesn't mean…</i>

250
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,033
<i>I understand, OK?</i>

251
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:02,088
<i>So, if you were in my shoes, what would you do?</i>

252
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,117
<i>This one belongs to Ruetai.</i>

253
00:27:29,945 --> 00:27:32,483
<i>This one is Nan's.</i>

254
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:36,637
<i>And this is mine.</i>

255
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,583
<i>Why throw it away? Keep it to protect us.</i>

256
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:55,750
<i>We don't need it,
just the three of us is enough.</i>

257
00:27:56,635 --> 00:28:00,883
<i>Let's make this room for Ruetai, OK?</i>

258
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:02,409
<i>OK.</i>

259
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:06,150
<i>And this room will be for Nan.</i>

260
00:28:07,983 --> 00:28:09,917
<i>Wow, there's so much.</i>

261
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:12,385
<i>- Should we take this?
- How about these two?</i>

262
00:28:13,183 --> 00:28:14,247
<i>Let's take this one.</i>

263
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:16,917
<i>Let's use this as a notebook.</i>

264
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:18,117
<i>How about Nan's?</i>

265
00:28:20,983 --> 00:28:22,851
<i>Then let's keep it outside the house.</i>

266
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:24,981
<i>It'll be the watch for the city.</i>

267
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:27,285
<i>We will govern this city ourselves.</i>

268
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:28,750
<i>No one else needs to interfere.</i>

269
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:34,187
<i>If that's the case, this city must have
laws and justice.</i>

270
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,275
<i>Sure.</i>

271
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:47,783
Hello, beloved people of Tulakham.

272
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:53,950
You all have seen what happened in court.

273
00:28:56,063 --> 00:28:59,983
<i>I would like to admit one truth.</i>

274
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,708
<i>I'm involved in my father's death.
[Judge Chalinee is here]</i>

275
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,057
<i>[Tell the whole truth]</i>

276
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:08,720
<i>[What happened? I didn't catch up.]</i>

277
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,583
<i>[Get out, you wicked person]</i>

278
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:16,917
<i>But I did it to protect my friend.
[Chalinee, keep fighting]</i>

279
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,383
<i>Beloved friends who share the same ideals.</i>

280
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:31,498
<i>Friends with whom we share a dream.
[Unacceptable, you do not belong here]</i>

281
00:29:31,498 --> 00:29:32,778
<i>[I always support you.]
[I don't want to hear!]</i>

282
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:35,250
To make this city better.

283
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,350
My friends and I

284
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,350
want to stop the influence

285
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:56,550
of the dark forces that are consuming Tulakham.

286
00:29:57,782 --> 00:30:00,229
<i>While I didn't think that…
[No one care bad person like this]</i>

287
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:01,882
<i>[No one cares about bad people.]
[The excuses of a wicked person.]</i>

288
00:30:01,882 --> 00:30:03,006
<i>[I truly sympathize with you.]</i>

289
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:05,150
<i>it would end in my father's death.</i>

290
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:09,283
But now that it has happened,

291
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,617
I can only…

292
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:20,687
dedicate the rest of my life
to the city of Tulakham.

293
00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:27,314
<i>[Fake crying, no one is moved anymore, okay?]</i>

294
00:30:27,314 --> 00:30:29,378
<i>[She's a good person]</i>

295
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:31,246
<i>[Tulakham must not run out of good people.
Do not give up!]</i>

296
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,387
<i>[Do you feel any remorse?]</i>

297
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:50,550
As for the other accusations,

298
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:54,328
<i>[Annoyed, you're talking nonsense.]
[Fake!!]</i>

299
00:30:54,328 --> 00:30:58,083
<i>they are the work of those,
who try to destroy me.</i>

300
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:02,550
<i>And you all know very well who they are.</i>

301
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,617
Those who fear that this city will improve.

302
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:16,187
<i>[You are a good person,
doing it for us people of Tulakham.]</i>

303
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:17,455
<i>[No one will feel sorry for you,
even if you cry your heart out.]</i>

304
00:31:17,455 --> 00:31:18,850
<i>[Take off the judge's outfit.]</i>

305
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,750
<i>At this point,</i>

306
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:22,038
<i>[Remove yourself,
do not tarnish the people of Tulakham.]</i>

307
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:23,583
<i>[People like this
don't even realize they're wrong.]</i>

308
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:27,161
<i>there will be people who believe
and don't believe what I say.</i>

309
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:28,721
<i>[Finally, someone sees your true nature.]</i>

310
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,548
<i>[We love and still respect you always.]</i>

311
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:32,628
<i>It will take time to prove it.</i>

312
00:31:32,628 --> 00:31:34,168
<i>[I don't wanna see your face anymore. Get out!]</i>

313
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,050
I hope that what I'm about to do next,

314
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:50,583
<i>will awaken the people of Tulakham
to rise up and change this city for the better.</i>

315
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:21,120
<i>[Court of Tulakham]</i>

316
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,817
No, no, let me go!
I want to see the young lady.

317
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:49,483
Let me go! I want to see the young lady!

318
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,817
Let go! Let me go!

319
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:55,583
Let me go! No!

320
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:57,650
Let me go!

321
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:05,550
Chalinee can't accept being a defendant
in a court where she was a judge.

322
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:38,139
Let me go! Let me go!
I want to see Miss! Let me go!

323
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:01,750
I will take Olarn out the back.

324
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,683
You two also need to head out that way.

325
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:05,906
OK.

326
00:34:05,906 --> 00:34:06,906
Yes.

327
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,550
<i>For me,</i>

328
00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:40,850
<i>nothing is more important than making Tulakham</i>

329
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:44,183
<i>have someone that the citizens…</i>

330
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:46,962
<i>can truly depend on.</i>

331
00:34:47,883 --> 00:34:51,017
<i>If I can think like this,
then fear simply disappears.</i>

332
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:57,817
<i>If I could be even half the person you are,</i>

333
00:34:57,817 --> 00:34:59,283
<i>I would be incredibly proud.</i>

334
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,583
<i>But I will be just like you.</i>

335
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:06,783
<i>Just give me one answer.</i>

336
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:12,017
<i>Are you ready to join me
in changing Tulakham for the better?</i>

337
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,350
<i>I'm ready.</i>

338
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:34,417
<i>You know, the one I always thought
would take my place</i>

339
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,750
<i>was only Praochanok and you.</i>

340
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:40,550
<i>But now, Praochanok doesn't seem
to be coming back.</i>

341
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,617
<i>So it's just you, Aeri.</i>

342
00:35:44,234 --> 00:35:45,234
<i>Yes.</i>

343
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:52,283
<i>In this case, your mother
will have to be guilty.</i>

344
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:54,317
<i>Can you accept that?</i>

345
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,900
<i>Yes.</i>

346
00:36:02,734 --> 00:36:04,250
<i>Aeri, don't get involved with her.</i>

347
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,050
<i>She's never truly loved anyone.</i>

348
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,683
<i>Do you think I don't know what's what?</i>

349
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,517
<i>I've followed everything you ordered.</i>

350
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:16,717
<i>Has that made me a judge like her?</i>

351
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:33,788
- Why do this?
- Why do this, Madam?

352
00:36:33,788 --> 00:36:34,583
No way!

353
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:37,450
- Judge Chalinee!
- Judge Chalinee, why do this?

354
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,283
- Judge Chalinee!
- Judge Chalinee!

355
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,700
Oh, let go!

356
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,983
Let us go, Judge Chalinee!

357
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:45,950
Everyone, stop!

358
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:02,161
Judge Chalinee has sacrificed her life

359
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:04,209
for the sake of justice.

360
00:37:05,105 --> 00:37:09,721
We, who love and believe in her,

361
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,920
must not waver.

362
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:18,862
We can't be weak.

363
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:26,717
Because there are still
many bad people out there.

364
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:35,635
We must continue the ideals.

365
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:43,612
Transform this sorrow
and frustration into strength.

366
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:49,585
Let's make Tulakham even better.

367
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:57,050
I, Prosecutor Erika,

368
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,283
I volunteer to lead you all

369
00:38:01,285 --> 00:38:04,983
to fulfill the ideals of Judge Chalinee.

370
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:12,850
I will run for election as the new Judge

371
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,517
<i>[Court of Tulakham]</i>
to protect justice for this city

372
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,959
as Judge Chalinee…

373
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:22,628
entrusted me to do.

374
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:43,620
Erika!

375
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:11,383
I'm sorry.

376
00:39:15,415 --> 00:39:17,909
<i>[Tulakham Prison]</i>

377
00:39:24,883 --> 00:39:25,883
What's up, Tan?

378
00:39:35,117 --> 00:39:36,117
Let's go, Prao.

379
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:45,861
Who did this?

380
00:39:50,964 --> 00:39:52,151
<i>[Bad Lawyer]</i>

381
00:39:52,151 --> 00:39:53,471
<i>[Get out]</i>

382
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:55,589
Bro.

383
00:39:56,983 --> 00:39:58,150
I came back and found this.

384
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:03,117
What should we do, bro?
Should I deal with those who did this?

385
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,671
<i>[Many years later]</i>

386
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,483
Here it is. It's about the case.

387
00:40:35,283 --> 00:40:36,426
- Yorch.
- Huh?

388
00:40:38,028 --> 00:40:40,482
How's that lottery case going?

389
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:43,490
Oh, it seems heavy for both parties.

390
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,032
It looks like our opposing parties
are in deep trouble.

391
00:40:46,032 --> 00:40:48,639
But our client is in even more trouble,
it's getting out of control.

392
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,372
This case seems to have a long way to go.

393
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:55,817
Make sure to look closely and do your best.

394
00:40:56,447 --> 00:40:58,150
We can't afford to mess this up.

395
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,883
Huh?

396
00:40:58,883 --> 00:41:00,676
Hey, when you say we can't mess up.

397
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:01,917
Does that mean this case
is getting a lot of attention?

398
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:06,000
Yeah, because if we win this case,

399
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,983
we'll get a huge share.

400
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,150
Awesome!

401
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,550
Oh, if Win and Prao knew that

402
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,550
we, especially Tan, were like this.

403
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,683
They'd be thrilled.

404
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,450
So don't let the boss find out!

405
00:41:23,473 --> 00:41:24,479
That's right!

406
00:41:28,783 --> 00:41:29,917
What shouldn't you tell me?

407
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:31,434
Hey, bro.

408
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:32,586
Hey!

409
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:33,239
Bro!

410
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:33,975
Lawyer Prao.

411
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:36,950
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

412
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,983
If I had told you before, how would I know?

413
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:43,026
That you're taking this case for a large share.

414
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:48,517
Hey, what I just said was all in good fun.
We were just joking around.

415
00:41:48,517 --> 00:41:49,906
Yeah, just joking around.

416
00:41:49,906 --> 00:41:50,919
But we mean it.

417
00:41:53,017 --> 00:41:55,503
So how is everyone doing? All good?

418
00:41:55,503 --> 00:41:57,183
- We're good.
- We're good, Lawyer Prao.

419
00:41:57,183 --> 00:41:59,850
Everyone's doing well except for me.

420
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:03,917
Oh, Yam, what's wrong?

421
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:06,383
Well, ever since you have been away,

422
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:11,550
I've had to be the prettiest one
in this lawless law firm.

423
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,550
It's a bit overwhelming.

424
00:42:13,273 --> 00:42:15,480
What are you saying? You dressed up
like you're going to a religious ceremony.

425
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,150
- Oh wow.
- Whoa! Your outfit is the same as hers.

426
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,583
- You two have no difference.
- Yeah.

427
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:23,083
You're always so confident, aren't you, Auntie?

428
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,117
- Oh wow.
- That's true!

429
00:42:24,117 --> 00:42:24,750
Hey! I'm your sis.

430
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,110
Your lips are even redder
than the traffic light!

431
00:42:27,317 --> 00:42:28,843
It's great to see everyone happy.

432
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:32,983
Honestly, we've made it this far because of…

433
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,450
Lawyer Prao and boss.

434
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,217
We should also thank Lawyer Boripat.

435
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,917
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you so much.

436
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,450
<i>Let's do it this way.</i>

437
00:42:50,483 --> 00:42:51,950
<i>You all will grow with this.</i>

438
00:42:57,517 --> 00:42:59,083
<i>Let's make Tulakham thrive, Tan.</i>

439
00:43:03,298 --> 00:43:05,983
<i>Everyone, just pretend nicely.</i>

440
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:09,717
<i>- Got it, boss.
- Sure.</i>

441
00:43:19,186 --> 00:43:20,974
<i>- Get out now!
- Get out!</i>

442
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,350
<i>Go, go! Out!</i>

443
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,150
<i>Get out!</i>

444
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,370
<i>Get out! Get out!</i>

445
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,138
<i>You bastards!</i>

446
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:27,700
<i>Yeah, don't come back!</i>

447
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,950
<i>- Go on, get out!
- Get out!</i>

448
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:31,583
<i>Leave!</i>

449
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:32,550
<i>- Get out!
- Go!</i>

450
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,183
<i>Go away, man.</i>

451
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,325
<i>You used us!</i>

452
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:38,245
<i>You hurt someone good like Judge Chalinee!</i>

453
00:43:38,245 --> 00:43:40,101
<i>Get out! You don't belong here!</i>

454
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:43,237
<i>- Go! Get out!
- Get out!</i>

455
00:43:44,117 --> 00:43:45,483
<i>Stay away!</i>

456
00:43:45,483 --> 00:43:49,650
<i>- Go! Get out! Get out!
- Get out!</i>

457
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:50,850
<i>Leave!</i>

458
00:43:52,217 --> 00:43:53,699
<i>Don't come back again!</i>

459
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,914
<i>- Go!
- Get out!</i>

460
00:43:57,683 --> 00:43:59,217
I'm glad to see everyone here today.

461
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,883
Thank you so much, Tan, for training everyone.

462
00:44:07,483 --> 00:44:09,150
Now Tulakham finally has someone to rely on.

463
00:44:11,117 --> 00:44:12,117
Sure, bro.

464
00:44:26,092 --> 00:44:30,183
Mom, I'm trying to be a good lawyer,

465
00:44:32,192 --> 00:44:34,888
using the law to fight against bad people,
just like you taught me.

466
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:40,411
Now Tulakham is slowly getting better, Mom.

467
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:11,487
I don't want to disturb
the touching moment of Lawyer Win.

468
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:12,959
But I want Lawyer Win to know that

469
00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:15,783
when you're free, you should take a walk
around Tulakham Court.

470
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:16,850
You might see something.

471
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,583
And now Judge Chalinee has become
a beloved figure.

472
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:53,335
She has become a pillar of support
for the people of Tulakham, just as she wanted.

473
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:58,007
Now, let's get to work,
there are cases to clear up.

474
00:45:58,007 --> 00:45:59,287
I'll stop by somewhere first.

475
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,617
Hey, you! Grilled squid!

476
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,923
It makes me think of that time
I ate it with the gang.

477
00:46:53,929 --> 00:46:54,989
Hey, Win!

478
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:04,443
Do you think it's him?

479
00:47:05,397 --> 00:47:07,061
Didn't he get a full twenty years?

480
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,198
Want to have fresh seafood?

481
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:21,217
I don't think it's Olarn, do you?

482
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,118
How much for the squid?

483
00:47:27,118 --> 00:47:28,206
A hundred baht per stick.

484
00:47:28,206 --> 00:47:28,975
Then I'll take two sticks.

485
00:47:28,975 --> 00:47:30,083
Sure, coming right up.

486
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,083
Do you want anything?

487
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:33,283
I'll have what you ordered.

488
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,317
Alright.

489
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:35,800
Then I'll add shrimp too.

490
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,783
Got it!

491
00:47:36,783 --> 00:47:37,783
Thank you!

492
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:03,483
Hello, Mr. Olarn.

493
00:48:03,483 --> 00:48:05,250
Hey, how are you?

494
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,450
Thanks a lot. Yeah.

495
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,317
Hello, Mr. Olarn.

496
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:08,243
Hello there.

497
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,283
Hi there!

498
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,350
Here.

499
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,251
Thank you very much, sir.

500
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:53,549
Share this with everyone, OK? Split it all up!

501
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:54,549
That's great.
