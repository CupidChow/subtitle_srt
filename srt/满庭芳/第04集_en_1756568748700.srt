They're gone.

00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,150
Something is bad.

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,930
Something's going to
happen at Luofeng Village.

7
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,330
Is anyone in there?

8
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,560
Check over there too.

9
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,970
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,509
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,780
Go that way.

12
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,780
Search thoroughly.

13
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,350
Yes, sir.

14
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,090
You, go over there.

15
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,650
Yes, sir.

Nothing here either.

19
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:05,920
Search thoroughly.

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,450
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,280
Check that side as well.

This village isn't registered

in the provincial records.

28
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,470
We don't know
how many people lived here.

29
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,030
So...

30
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,980
we're not sure if anyone survived.

No need to chase her.

36
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,430
Why?

37
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,830
She could be the only survivor!

38
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,050
She's not.

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,030
Mr. Wang.

41
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,870
Last night, a great fire broke out
in Luofeng Valley,

42
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,000
and strange events occurred
near Changding Bridge.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,530
Why didn't you report to me?

44
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,620
Your Majesty,

45
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,310
it's precisely because
this case is full of doubts

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,110
that I have to take it seriously.

47
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,540
That is why I am

48
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,280
reporting to you directly.

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,760
Your Majesty,

50
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
the fire was suspicious.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,190
In just one night,

52
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,020
the entire village was wiped out.

53
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,660
I...

54
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,960
have ordered my men
to surround Luofeng Valley,

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,420
hoping to find clues
to solve this case soon.

56
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,800
But unexpectedly, a woman

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,400
of unknown identity appeared at the scene.

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,860
She showed up for no reason

59
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,270
and acted suspiciously.

60
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,530
I'm afraid...

61
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,470
the crime scene
has already been compromised.

62
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,970
Your Majesty,

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,430
I've always been

64
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,910
swift and decisive

65
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,170
in my investigations.

66
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,840
If I...

67
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,280
find anyone else suspicious at the scene,

68
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,280
I ask for your permission

69
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,170
to execute them

70
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,020
right on the spot.

71
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,230
It's rare for Mr. Wang
to show such dedication.

72
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,770
How could I refuse?

73
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,960
Rise and speak.

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,110

75
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,430
to serve Your Majesty.

76
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,040
Who are you?

77
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,190
Greetings, Miss Su.

78
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,650

and has left the palace,

79
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,430
from now on,

80
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,480

-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

83
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,750
You may leave now.

84
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,160
Your Majesty, what brings you here today?

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,950
Su Leyu.

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,720
Did you sneak out of the palace

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,480
to Luofeng Valley

89
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,680
and disrupt Mr. Wang's investigation?

90
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Since Your Majesty's last warning,

91
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,630
I haven't stepped outside the palace once.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,270
Are you saying Mr. Wang
accused you falsely?

93
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,720
If someone wants to condemn another,

94
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,950
they'll always find an excuse.

95
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,270
It seems

96
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,950
I've spoiled you so much

97
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,240
that you've forgotten your place.

98
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,270
I sentence you to Xuanji Pavilion

99
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,870
to reflect on your mistakes.

If one day

106
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,530
Changyan faces danger,

107
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,470
and Dacang is in peril,

108
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,120
would you be willing

109
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,320
to shoulder this immense burden for me,

110
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,780
and protect our people?

111
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,670
Your Majesty.

112
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,090
What are you reading, Leyu?

113
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,870
In today's morning lesson,

114
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,470
my teacher spoke of history.

115
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,870
When he talked about
the empresses and consorts,

116
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,070
the books only praised their virtues.

117
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,910
Not a single historical record

118
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,640
describes their heroic deeds.

119
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,920
I was confused,

120
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,720
so I borrowed many history books,

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,120
and I'm still searching.

122
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,450
Did you find anything?

123
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,190
This vast ocean of history

124
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,850
is hard to navigate,

125
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,490
so I still haven't found anything.

126
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,800
It seems to me

127
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,190
that you

128
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,430
have the talent to assist and advise me.

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,830
In the future,

130
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,280
would you like
to make a name for yourself?

131
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,240
If it's not in the history books,

132
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,030
why not write yourself into history?

133
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,380
If that day truly comes,

134
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,320
I will do my best

135
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,840
to create a new path,

136
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,770
and protect our Dacang

137
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,530
for an era of peace and prosperity.

138
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,850
Greetings, Your Majesty.

139
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,790
Do you know why

140
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,300
I sent you to Xuanji Pavilion
as punishment?

141
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,720
Because Song

142
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,390
is Wang Zhan's spy.

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,270
After all, no one dares

144
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,980
to enter the Xuanji Pavilion.

145
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,730
Today he deliberately mentioned you.

146
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,120
His words were full of threats against me,

147
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,630
saying he would execute anyone suspicious

148
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,680
right on the spot.

149
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,810
He has already recognized you,

150
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,920
and I'm afraid he might harm you.

151
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,230
How's the investigation
of Luofeng Village going?

152
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,070
I discovered

153
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
a huge secret in Luofeng Village.

154
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,360
The villagers are all skilled
in martial arts,

155
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,620
and they're all women.

156
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,330
It seems the Ghost Soldiers Passing

157
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,800
is likely related to them.

158
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,080
I suspect the reason Luofeng Village

159
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,670
was burned down

160
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,780
has something to do with this.

161
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,930
When Wang Zhan and Xi Zimo

162
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,270
were at the scene,

163
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,570
they didn't seem to be investigating.

164
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,970
Instead, it was more like
they were searching for something.

165
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,230
Could it be...

166
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,960
this is what they were looking for?

167
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,550
Perhaps if we figure this out,

168
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,470
[Pingyang]

169
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,720
we can solve the mystery
of the Ghost Soldiers Passing,

170
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,150
and also find clues
for the Changding Bridge case.

171
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,480
This looks like a military command token.

172
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,780
But I've never seen

173
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,700
our Dacang army use

174
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,960
a military name like "Pingyang."

175
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,600
All of Dacang's military tokens

176
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,260
must be officially recorded.

177
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,510
I think the Archives

178
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
may have records.

179
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,790
Then tomorrow morning,

180
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,720
we'll go to the Archives and check.

181
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,720
Your Majesty,

182
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,720
I'll need you to cause a scene

183
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,570
so I can investigate in secret.

184
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,450
That way, we won't alert them.

185
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,750
The chief of the Archives, Yue Menglin,

186
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,320
might be useful to us tomorrow.

187
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,850
Your Majesty is truly wise.

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,960
Do you remember
this mandarin duck lantern?

189
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,020
It was you who chose the design for us.

190
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
This book, "The Tale of Zhang Shunmei
and the Phoenix Lantern",

her red silk handkerchief

who found the handkerchief,

The storage rooms for the Ministries
of War, Justice, and Revenue

233
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,030
have been in disrepair for years,

234

and they are severely leaking.

235
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,260
If this continues,

236
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,020

will inevitably be destroyed.

237

the Ministry of Revenue
hasn't allocated any funds,

240

so I can't make the repairs.

241
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,600
Your Majesty,

242
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,380
Dacang has always
budgeted based on income.

243

All of this year's funds
have already been allocated,

244

we should ignore state affairs

Could he find out anything

The Xi family has already
dealt with all the old files,

264
