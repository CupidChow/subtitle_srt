00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,270
The International Junior High School of the World, which has gained global attention, has opened.

2
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,450
This school is Ivy League Free Pass, an amateur Myeong-moon-go.

3
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,490
We welcome you to join this school.

4
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,830
You can visit the university now.

5
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,910
In this video, we will review the first story of the first episode of the first episode of the drama.

6
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,250
Please enjoy the video until the end.

7
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,490
I was so nervous.

8
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,250
I was so nervous.

9
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,630
I was so nervous.

10
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,210
Is there anyone?

11
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,870
Is there anyone?

12
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,350
It's late but I will go to practice.

13
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,190
Where is this?

14
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,430
Oh! It's close and nice.

15
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:37,490
I hope my friend comes quickly.

16
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,950
Who are you? Come quickly!

17
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,070
Who are you? Come quickly!

18
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:54,290
Oppa, don't you have a soil filter at home?

19
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:55,990
We only have soil.

20
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,890
You know I'm the number one assassin, right?

21
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,830
Sit close to me.

22
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,990
If you sit close, you will be interested in me.

23
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:07,970
Why?

24
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,190
You have to sit in a place that is not interested.

25
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,170
Wait, if I do this, will you be able to see my phone?

26
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:13,770
Why?

27
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,510
Oh, who is it?

28
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,410
Oh, who is it?

29
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,770
Oh, hello.

30
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,670
Hello.

31
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,750
Oh, hello.

32
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:34,510
Hello.

33
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,250
Hello.

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:36,690
Hello.

35
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,950
I think this is a little low.

36
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,510
I think this is a little low.

37
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,450
Is the school originally this small?

38
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,390
Oh, it's so tall.

39
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,050
After graduating from elementary school in Korea, I was sent to Finland because I couldn't speak Finnish.

40
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,210
I am a Korean wearing a wig.

41
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,070
Oh, this seat looks good.

42
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,190
Oh, I like this seat.

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,910
Honestly, if I sit in front of you, do you think you can see me from behind?

44
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,110
By the way, do you think that you can see me from behind?

45
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,050
Oh, you're

46
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,250
What do you mean?

47
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,970
By the way, what do you mean?

48
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,330
By the way, how do you think I do this?

49
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,830
I think it's okay because it's not even in front.

50
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,030
Why is your height so high?

51
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,710
Let's compare the height.

52
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,570
No, there is no reason to compare.

53
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,690
Sit down, sit down.

54
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,050
No, I liked it, the manly style.

55
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,370
Oh

56
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,690
I'm sorry, but can the student grow a beard?

57
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,150
The bone will break.

58
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,290
The bone will be cut right away.

59
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,470
I had a shave in the morning.

60
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,830
I shaved my head.

61
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,270
It was like a Santa Claus.

62
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:34,810
Wow.

63
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,170
It's a great job.

64
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,150
Great job.

65
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,570
Great job.

66
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:42,990
High five.

67
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,250
Bye guys!

68
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:58,990
Hello!

69
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,990
Jennie! Hello!

70
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,530
Chanel! Chanel!

71
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,450
Hello everybody, my name is Chanel Moon.

72
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,330
I'm from LA.

73
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,040
I'm from LA.

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Where did you come from?

75
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,460
From the US.

76
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,800
Why are you acting like you don't know? We met each other.

77
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,100
We met each other.

78
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,440
Where did Justin come from?

79
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,980
South Africa.

80
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:31,100
You're not friends?

81
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,120
I'm not African.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,740
Why are you African?

83
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,500
You look like an African, but you're not African.

84
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,100
You're really South African.

85
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,420
I'm not African.

86
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,120
You're close but I'm not.

87
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,320
Congo and South Africa is about 3000km away.

88
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,100
3000km?

89
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,360
Congo is in the middle.

90
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,340
We are in the south.

91
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,800
We are in the south.

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,340
That's why we are South Africa.

93
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,780
Jennie speaks Korean well.

94
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,460
Jennie speaks Korean well.

95
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,900
Jennie speaks Korean well.

96
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,320
I'm curious where you came from.

97
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,800
I'm a real Korean.

98
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,740
Do you want to play Korean Battle with me?

99
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,240
No. No.

100
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,500
No.

101
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,200
Jennie, you can't go to school.

102
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,080
No. No.

103
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,440
Only foreigners go to school here.

104
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,080
The international high school is good to go together.

105
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,000
That's right.

106
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,820
So, there is no international high school.

107
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,380
You just don't know.

108
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:29,860
You are right.

109
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,640
Sorry.

110
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
Anyway, I'm a real Korean.

111
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,660
Thank you.

112
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,560
Who?

113
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,580
This is really famous.

114
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,440
What did you say?

115
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,640
This is really famous.

116
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:01,420
There are only two left.

117
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,380
The shoes are special.

118
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,960
I think I know this one.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,260
I think this one is really famous.

120
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,460
This is a very famous school. The Le Seraphim Middle School.

121
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,340
You came from Le Seraphim Middle School.

122
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,100
Right.

123
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,380
You are from the Queen's Academy.

124
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,780
Wait, I'm from the King's Academy too.

125
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,040
Wait, I'm from the King's Academy too.

126
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,020
I have a mission in this company.

127
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,920
I told you not to touch each other.

128
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,300
If you need anything, feel free to say it.

129
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,800
We have to block comments.

130
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,440
You can sit here.

131
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,900
Why is there something here?

132
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,940
There aren't that many seats.

133
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,440
There are a lot of people but we are the same age.

134
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,400
Huh?

135
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,560
Why are you like that?

136
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,060
Why are you like that?

137
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,940
Why are you like that?

138
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,160
Because we are friends.

139
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:52,660
Because we are friends.

140
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,700
Sit down.

141
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
You are a little down.

142
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:04,840
Wow!

143
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:13,800
I didn't understand how you put water in the coffee.

144
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,840
That's why I thought it was like a museum.

145
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:29,420
You can sit wherever you want.

146
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,180
What is MBTO?

147
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,160
MBTO is good at eating meat.

148
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,100
They are good at eating meat.

149
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,100
What?

150
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,460
Why?

151
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,260
They are good at eating meat.

152
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,020
Why?

153
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,080
I went to elementary school in Korea.

154
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,340
I went to elementary school in Korea.

155
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,780
How do you greet students in Korea?

156
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:50,860
Students?

157
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,680
When they are in their first semester, they are a little tough.

158
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,280
Ah...

159
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,560
They don't greet you right away.

160
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,080
Oh, really?

161
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,880
With a girl?

162
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,400
Like this.

163
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,100
We are Italian.

164
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,220
You know how we greet people on Instagram?

165
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,400
We say, Mi-soo, kiss.

166
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,320
When we meet, we say,

167
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,460
Kiss?

168
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,220
No, not like that.

169
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,620
What?

170
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,140
What?

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,240
What?

172
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,440
We just make sounds.

173
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,280
They are kind?

174
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,780
All the people in high school and high school are like this.

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,720
This is the basic greeting.

176
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,600
But in elementary school, they don't do it like that.

177
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,560
In elementary and middle school, they don't do it like that.

178
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,080
But wait a minute, they do this since high school.

179
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,120
Really?

180
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,660
So, Italian students have something to write when they go to high school.

181
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,300
How about Japanese?

182
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,400
In Japan, it's all about making a distance.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,520
Making a distance?

184
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,600
They don't even know how to say it.

185
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,800
It's like this.

186
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,120
It's like this.

187
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,600
It's like touching or something like that.

188
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,020
It's a bit similar to Finland.

189
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,280
It's similar to Finland. We don't even know what it is.

190
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,340
What?

191
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,700
How do you know?

192
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,260
But you have to know beforehand. If you talk about Finland, you have to search it up.

193
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,180
Because it may not be true.

194
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,080
He doesn't know well.

195
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,000
He doesn't know what Finland is.

196
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,820
I've never heard of that.

197
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,000
I've heard all kinds of things.

198
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,760
It's interesting.

199
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,480
What is it?

200
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,960
What is it?

201
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,440
He doesn't know.

202
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,380
What?

203
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,160
A baby's playing with her.

204
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,320
What are you saying?

205
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,180
Everyone, welcome to the famous foreign language school!

206
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,640
First of all, I am your homeroom teacher.

207
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,760
Please call me Boom Teacher.

208
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,640
Boom Teacher?

209
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,700
Yes.

210
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,980
I'm not doubting you, but how did you become a teacher?

211
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,840
No, because I only know one language.

212
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,380
I only know Korean.

213
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,580
That's right, you're a foreigner.

214
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,360
I'm not a foreign teacher.

215
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,600
Overall, the subject is entertainment.

216
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,960
There are a lot of foreign stars in Korea that the teacher has released so far.

217
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,740
There are a lot of foreign stars in Korea that the teacher has released so far.

218
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,480
Who is it?

219
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,380
Who is it?

220
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,560
Nichkhun!

221
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,400
I know Nichkhun!

222
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,900
Ask Nichkhun.

223
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,540
Do you know Ayumi, who was a star in Japan?

224
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,780
I raised Momo, BamBam, and Salmosa.

225
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,460
I've never heard of BamBam and Chungha.

226
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,100
What is it?

227
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,920
It's fun.

228
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,520
If you listen to the teacher well, you can become a star in Korea.

229
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,200
Who came in first?

230
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,960
I did.

231
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,580
Minnie.

232
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,260
Did you just sit here?

233
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,600
I wanted to show the teacher well, so I sat in the front.

234
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,080
Oh, did you?

235
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,920
She was in the center.

236
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,600
She said hello so comfortably that I thought she was Mr. Lee's daughter.

237
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,200
I used to be the president of the school.

238
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,220
Really?

239
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,840
That's why I have some experience.

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,720
You should use honorifics to your teacher.

241
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,120
Oh, that's right.

242
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,880
That's because she is my friend's age.

243
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,240
She is your friend's age.

244
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,340
I know what you mean.

245
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,140
Why did Jenny and Sanha fall apart?

246
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,060
Jenny and Sanha are almost ambassadors, aren't they?

247
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,540
Aren't they ambassadors?

248
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,300
It's true.

249
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,580
It's true.

250
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,280
It's true.

251
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,060
It's true.

252
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,900
This is the first time I've seen this.

253
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,520
There was a reason why he came with us.

254
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,060
That's right.

255
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,420
I'm sorry but I took a picture of the historical drama.

256
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm actually taking a picture of the historical drama.

257
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,580
What role did you play in the historical drama?

258
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,420
I am a person who came with a ship.

259
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,700
It's like a screen.

260
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:37,980
We are going with the same feeling.

261
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,000
There were a lot of things like that in the past.

262
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,560
It suits you well.

263
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,100
Do you know what kind of school this is?

264
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,060
I don't know.

265
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,240
Can you explain our school?

266
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,640
We have a precise purpose.

267
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,540
Our high school was established with the goal of entering a prestigious university.

268
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,180
You will receive special education to enter this university.

269
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,540
We are going to use the same method that is used in the current Ivy League universities.

270
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,880
We are going to proceed with the class with the curriculum.

271
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,100
If you follow the curriculum, you can enter Ahn Young University.

272
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,680
Let's go.

273
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,100
Today is the first day of Ahn Young High School.

274
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,980
The class will start right away.

275
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,360
The class will start right away.

276
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,860
The class will start right away.

277
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,760
It is very important to have a relationship beyond the borders of the global world.

278
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,740
That's right.

279
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,060
Relationship.

280
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,900
This is important.

281
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,920
I'm sorry, but I'm not good at English.

282
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,700
What is the meaning of relationship?

283
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,460
We are in charge of English.

284
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,120
Justin.

285
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,500
What is the correct pronunciation?

286
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,280
Relationship.

287
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,460
Is there a cute version?

288
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,400
Relationship?

289
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,520
I can't understand well.

290
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,840
Relationship is important.

291
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,780
Because today is the first day of the year, there are many things that we don't know yet.

292
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,780
At that time, let's introduce ourselves at the school.

293
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,700
Introduce yourself?

294
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,640
I will introduce myself as Ice Cream.

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,780
You know English, right?

296
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,020
Introduce myself.

297
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,300
I don't understand English.

298
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,300
No, no, no.

299
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,560
Okay, now it's time to introduce ourselves.

300
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,460
Introduction.

301
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,020
Harvard University.

302
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,040
Okay?

303
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,600
What? Harvard?

304
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,940
Wait a minute.

305
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,920
We are suddenly in Harvard.

306
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,520
I am married to you.

307
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,680
Really?

308
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,960
You don't know each other, do you?

309
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,900
There are various names for Harvard.

310
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,000
There is also Harvard Piano.

311
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,640
The place where Harvard University is located is Massachusetts.

312
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,260
What?

313
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,100
Massachusetts?

314
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,380
Massachusetts?

315
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,960
Massachusetts.

316
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,240
Wait a minute.

317
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,580
Massachusetts?

318
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,880
Massachusetts.

319
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,920
Because she is American.

320
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,540
If you talk like this,

321
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,480
you can feel the distance between you.

322
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,120
Where is Jenny?

323
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,340
Massachusetts.

324
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,760
She is good.

325
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,760
Jenny has to do like this.

326
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,540
When you introduce yourself,

327
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:24,420
there is a system called

328
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,840
Two Truths and One Lie.

329
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,280
Two Truths and One Lie.

330
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,500
Do you know it?

331
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,960
I know it.

332
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,360
I read it at school and did ice-breaking.

333
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,260
You did?

334
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,100
Two Truths and One Lie

335
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,400
makes three sentences

336
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,020
to introduce yourself.

337
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,260
Two of them are

338
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,800
the truth

339
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,920
and one is a lie.

340
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,620
There are three rounds.

341
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,980
You introduce yourself one by one.

342
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:54,980
You write it down.

343
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,240
Only you and I

344
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,940
if it is true or not.

345
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,020
Only you and I will know.

346
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,820
I will reveal

347
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,000
how many lies there are.

348
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,480
You can find out

349
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,200
who is lying

350
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,600
in the meeting.

351
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,180
If you find it,

352
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,920
you can find it again.

353
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,820
You know each other

354
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,540
and you can figure out

355
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,400
what is a lie.

356
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,080
Which one is a lie?

357
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Why don't we try it together?

358
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Can we choose our

359
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,960
Why are you doing this to your teacher?

360
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,720
Nadan will be back with his parents next week.

361
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
Sujin, how far did you go?

362
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,300
Including what you did with your teeth.

363
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,880
Ah, my teeth.

364
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,420
If you put your teeth in...

365
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,000
Where do you put your teeth in?

366
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,000
Did you get a sleep anesthesia or not?

367
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,280
No, I didn't get a sleep anesthesia.

368
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,460
But let's say it's not a chiropractic.

369
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,460
Let's stop talking about the chiropractic.

370
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,680
I was so surprised.

371
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,800
Leo, are you a reporter?

372
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,700
Why do you keep saying that?

373
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,660
You have to have a good personality.

374
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:46,920
You have to be a doctor.

375
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,880
I don't think so.

376
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:51,980
It's natural.

377
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,840
It's natural.

378
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:55,060
The proportion is not that good.

379
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,800
But there's nothing wrong with it.

380
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,900
You don't think he did it?

381
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,340
It's the same.

382
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,520
If he did it, where would he go?

383
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,960
If he did it,

384
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,880
what would it have been for?

385
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,440
I think he would have had a surgery.

386
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,520
I think he would have had a surgery.

387
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,200
Let's raise your hands.

388
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,640
One, two, three.

389
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,240
One, two, three.

390
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,340
One, two, three.

391
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,880
I did it.

392
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,300
I did it.

393
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,580
You chose the truth.

394
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,160
You chose the truth.

395
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,780
Thank you, but

396
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,680
it was wrong.

397
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,580
He was a liar.

398
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,520
Did he do it?

399
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,680
Did he do it?

400
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,260
Do it.

401
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,020
Do it.

402
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,660
For the show.

403
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,260
He did it in two places.

404
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,940
Let's guess.

405
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:51,540
I want to guess.

406
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,140
It's getting good.

407
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,280
He borrowed the power of medicine.

408
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,500
He did it in the 90s.

409
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:06,980
He did it in the 90s.

410
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,480
It's so natural.

411
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,980
It's so natural.

412
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,360
It's the first time I've heard that it's done well.

413
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,080
You're wrong, right?

414
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,800
If you're wrong, you're out.

415
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,680
I'm out.

416
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,340
I can't even say it.

417
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,240
Is it over?

418
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,540
It's not over.

419
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,020
It's not over.

420
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,160
Why are you so aggressive?

421
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,920
The atmosphere was scary.

422
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,220
It's not over.

423
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,700
He opens up everything he wrote.

424
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,140
You can't participate in this game, but you can keep talking.

425
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,820
You have to participate.

426
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,440
There's something else.

427
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:38,560
There's something else.

428
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,900
Then, please write down your first introduction.

429
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,340
The first introduction.

430
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,440
It could be real or false.

431
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,100
One, two, three.

432
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,860
I wrote down the first one.

433
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,020
There's a keyword for rock-paper-scissors.

434
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,340
Leo, please.

435
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,360
I did rock-paper-scissors in Korea.

436
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,120
When I was one year old.

437
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,200
Are you a mixed-race?

438
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,440
Why?

439
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,940
Are you a mixed-race?

440
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,220
Do you have Korean blood?

441
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,580
No, I'm not.

442
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,440
I can't hear you well.

443
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,660
I'm not a mixed-race.

444
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,260
Were you born in Korea?

445
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,680
I wasn't born in Korea.

446
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,160
When did you come to Korea?

447
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,040
I came on the 100th day.

448
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:31,980
On the 100th day?

449
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,240
On the 100th day!

450
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,480
On the 100th day!

451
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,180
On the 100th day!

452
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,820
On the 100th day!

453
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,280
Your parents are from Finland.

454
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,220
You came to Korea.

455
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,020
You don't have to know about the 100th day.

456
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,820
Did you have a dog gathering?

457
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,300
You came to Finland right after you were born.

458
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,760
Did you have a dog gathering?

459
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,740
You must have been busy.

460
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,460
I had a dog.

461
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,660
I had a dog.

462
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,040
Do you remember?

463
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,900
I love dogs.

464
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,340
What did you catch?

465
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,120
I caught money.

466
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:04,880
What were you wearing?

467
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,140
I wore a hanbok.

468
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,060
She's so precise.

469
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,320
Yesung is so good at this.

470
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,220
Let's hear from Jenny.

471
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,140
I caught a tadpole in Namsan.

472
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:26,660
I caught a tadpole in Namsan.

473
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,900
There's no lake in Namsan.

474
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,040
There's no lake.

475
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,240
I went to Namsan with my kids a lot.

476
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,880
If you don't know this,

477
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,240
On the day you caught the tadpole.

478
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,000
The weather.

479
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,180
Of course, I went on a sunny day.

480
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,140
On a sunny day?

481
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,140
I always went to the beach with my grandmother on a sunny day.

482
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,560
On the day you went to catch the tadpole,

483
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,180
did it rain the day before?

484
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:49,820
No.

485
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,860
It was sunny?

486
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,180
No.

487
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,120
It wasn't.

488
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,860
How did you look like

489
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,800
when you caught the tadpole?

490
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,740
Before I put my hand on the tadpole,

491
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,740
I had to move freely.

492
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,580
I had to move freely.

493
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,640
Hey, this.

494
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,740
Hey, this.

495
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,080
Hey, this.

496
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,320
What tadpole has this pelvis?

497
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,500
I know.

498
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,320
Men's tadpoles are different.

499
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:16,820
They have a tail.

500
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,540
But when you catch it, it's faster.

501
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,080
It's faster.

502
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,380
It's faster this way.

503
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,540
But Ren, you were trying to do this,

504
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,180
but you were trying to do this.

505
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,000
I was trying to do this.

506
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,780
No, I was not trying to do this.

507
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,920
You are not.

508
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,960
Alberto, do you want to announce it?

509
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,400
In high school,

510
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,940
We drank

511
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,380
matam with our teacher.

512
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,380
Matam?

513
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,180
Matam?

514
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,140
Aren't they cigarettes?

515
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,720
Matam?

516
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,980
They're cigarettes we used to smoke together.

517
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,020
It means we smoked together.

518
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,740
I don't think it's true.

519
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,600
We smoked together.

520
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,020
We started smoking when we were 18.

521
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,580
You can start smoking from now on.

522
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,700
Students smoke outside during break time.

523
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,580
But we don't have the habit of smoking outside.

524
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,500
We smoke outside, but the teacher is still there.

525
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:11,960
It's rare in the West.

526
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:13,860
Really?

527
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,800
Yes, even in the U.S.

528
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,060
Didn't you do that a lot?

529
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:17,940
No...

530
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,000
No!

531
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,960
If it's a high school student...

532
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,180
Teacher, do you use a lighter?

533
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,320
Who is this?

534
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,940
If the teacher doesn't have a lighter,

535
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,740
he can use a lighter.

536
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,860
Really?

537
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,300
When we go to a small trip,

538
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,720
do you drink beer with the teacher?

539
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Then you call him by his name?

540
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,400
We call our teachers by their names.

541
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,400
When you smoke on the stairs with the teacher,

542
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,720
the best thing...

543
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,080
When I smoke with the teacher?

544
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,260
It's an emergency staircase.

545
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,040
You get to hear the best stories on the stairs.

546
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,240
Really?

547
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,540
This is so silly.

548
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,920
Is this really the end?

549
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,180
This could be the end.

550
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,100
Minty, should we announce our next member?

551
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,560
It's the scary unnie?

552
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,620
In middle school, she was so popular.

553
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,120
So she was once called by a scary unnie.

554
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,540
That is possible.

555
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,820
What did the senior say?

556
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,100
Who is Minty?

557
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,460
What?

558
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,520
Who is Minni?

559
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,560
Where is she?

560
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,180
I am in the middle and other seniors are here.

561
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,020
Are you that good looking?

562
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,920
Are you that good looking?

563
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,660
She is jealous so she is asking.

564
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,120
Are you that pretty?

565
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,320
Are you that good looking?

566
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,400
Why are you so pretty?

567
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,120
Minni is so luxurious.

568
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,320
She is packing herself.

569
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,680
She is saying that she was pretty.

570
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,920
I didn't say that I was pretty.

571
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,200
She is popular.

572
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,920
Why is she popular?

573
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,700
I don't know.

574
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,300
I am curious about the ending.

575
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,320
It is the most interesting thing she said.

576
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,980
Sakura, do you want to announce?

577
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,080
What is she most fond of?

578
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,660
She likes soondae the most.

579
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,220
I am an expert of soondae.

580
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,260
What do you mean?

581
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,180
Soondae expert?

582
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,400
She is so good at that.

583
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,500
Which part of the body do you like the most?

584
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:45,880
Why?

585
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,740
What part of the body do you like the most?

586
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,040
Why?

587
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,500
I like sundae.

588
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,460
Hey, wait a minute.

589
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,480
You can't say it.

590
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,780
What kind of sundae?

591
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,520
I haven't been to Korea yet.

592
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,340
Hey, this is natural.

593
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,820
This card is used by foreign friends.

594
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,720
If it's a little more disadvantageous.

595
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,600
I'm Korean style.

596
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,220
I did it last time.

597
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,320
I did it last time.

598
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,920
I did it last time.

599
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,340
You can't say it.

600
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,280
Then...

601
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,360
What should we dip it in?

602
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,520
This is important.

603
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,060
The first time I liked it.

604
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,020
I ordered tteokbokki.

605
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,680
Sundae came with it.

606
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,720
I asked how to eat it.

607
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,140
The members said it would be delicious to dip it in the soup.

608
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,460
Tteokbokki.

609
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,340
Dip it in the soup.

610
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,280
How about Sundae?

611
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,040
What do you dip it in?

612
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,980
I always dip it in salt.

613
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,340
Sundae is the best.

614
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,360
Sundae is the best.

615
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,820
In Korea, if you say Sundae,

616
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,560
Where is the city that falls?

617
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,060
I came here, but I have to eat Sundae.

618
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,600
I don't know.

619
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,580
I only order delivery food.

620
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,020
Don't you go to the restaurant often?

621
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,120
Not at all.

622
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,120
Have you ever been there?

623
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,200
Because I'm busy.

624
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,140
Jennie should tell me the best restaurant.

625
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,320
But the best restaurant in Sundae is...

626
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:15,620
You have to chase a truck.

627
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,520
You have to chase a truck.

628
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,300
Jennie, do you live in Bangui-dong?

629
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,640
No, but I think I know where you like,

630
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,760
Where do you say?

631
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:31,760
Where do you hate the most?

632
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,260
mejorar for height

633
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:36,620
Sedimensional

634
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:43,640
What do you mean you don't eat Kim to eat the bloodless?

635
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,580
Come on.

636
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,960
I'm fine. hide it.

637
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,320
They're so quiet.

638
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,500
I am very sorry if this is the truth.

639
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,560
If it is the truth,

640
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,080
we will apologize to all of you.

641
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,060
They like only the Sundae from the Korean food restaurant.

642
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,380
They only like Sundae from the Japanese restaurant.

643
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,860
We just dip it in Tteokbokki.

644
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,660
So, we just did the basics.

645
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,120
Then, Nadan.

646
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,340
I am better at English than Leo.

647
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,020
He speaks English better than I do.

648
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,140
I'll just go with the truth from the start.

649
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,400
No, it's not because you say it's the truth.

650
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,920
I'm just staying still.

651
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,420
I'm just staying still.

652
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,640
Then the two of you should have a conversation.

653
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,520
Nice to meet you.

654
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,760
Why did you come here?

655
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,800
Why did I come here?

656
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,100
They...

657
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,420
They invited me.

658
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,500
They invited me.

659
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,500
They invited me.

660
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,060
They invited me.

661
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,740
You're Sam Sam.

662
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,400
Yes, Sam Sam.

663
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,180
It's so similar.

664
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,760
Chanel's friend is coming in.

665
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,620
Tough question.

666
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,780
Recently it was Christmas.

667
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,140
When we were at the North Pole,

668
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
underneath the Christmas tree,

669
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,060
there were a whole bunch of presents.

670
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,400
Hey, calm down.

671
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,160
Hey, Chanel, chill.

672
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,740
Chill, chill.

673
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,020
Chanel, chill.

674
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,720
I think we should test Jonathan.

675
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,680
No, no, no.

676
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,860
How do you pronounce your name in English?

677
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,760
My name in English? No, I can't answer.

678
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,520
It's basic.

679
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,300
Oh, basic.

680
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,640
He's a kindergarten student, you know what I'm saying?

681
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,960
So I don't do this. J-Y-N-A-T-H.

682
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,880
J-Y-N-A-T-H.

683
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,680
Pronounce? Pronounce? Jonathan.

684
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,600
Jonathan?

685
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,120
T-H is F.

686
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,160
Just a little bit.

687
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,440
This is a fact.

688
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,220
Rainn is good at this.

689
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,120
He's good!

690
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,920
Now, let's announce your name.

691
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,380
Before I debuted,

692
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,420
I performed in a group

693
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,000
with Red Velvet.

694
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,740
So you debuted well.

695
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,060
Then you should know the song we sang then.

696
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,640
Red Flavor.

697
00:29:57,085 --> 00:29:59,220
Can you show it to them?

698
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,200
You were there in the morning?

699
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,940
How did you get together?

700
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,580
It was a dance cover program.

701
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,080
So I went out as a representative of the U.S.

702
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,240
As a representative?

703
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,180
As a representative. And I went out with the team and won first place.

704
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,800
And because I won first place, we performed together.

705
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,460
Then show us a clip.

706
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:21,700
A clip of Chanel's performance.

707
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,960
Sakura was a fan of Red Velvet and she liked it.

708
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,200
My favorite sunbaenim is Red Velvet's Ahri sunbaenim.

709
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,300
Then show us a clip.

710
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,020
A clip of Chanel.

711
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,900
She said she doesn't have one.

712
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,520
Who is your favorite?

713
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,420
I like Seulgi sunbaenim.

714
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,220
She was in the same line as me.

715
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,640
She held my hand and told me to go here and there.

716
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,220
So I held her hand.

717
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,620
I think she is the best.

718
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,420
I think she is the best.

719
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:51,900
I think she is the best.

720
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,640
It was a few years ago.

721
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,160
Left hand, right hand.

722
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,880
Right hand, left hand.

723
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,140
Because when she was in Red, she used her left hand a lot.

724
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:16,920
So she used her left hand a lot.

725
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,000
I think she is good in

726
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:32,700
That's too different.

727
00:31:33,545 --> 00:31:34,960
What? What? What?

728
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,140
If you know what it is, it's real.

729
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:37,920
This is real.

730
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,060
I'm saying it right now.

731
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,700
This is real.

732
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,780
How much is it? 2,000 won?

733
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,960
2,000 won? How much is it?

734
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,060
One won is 3,000 won.

735
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,500
You're counting one won each?

736
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,340
2,000 won for one won is 3,000 won?

737
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,540
3,000 won.

738
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,600
Then there are people who count one won.

739
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,480
3,000 won multiplied by 2,000 won.

740
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:03,840
2,000 won.

741
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,360
6,000 won?

742
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,000
6,000 won.

743
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,140
That's a lot.

744
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,300
As far as I know, it's a lot.

745
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,360
No, I don't think so.

746
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,060
Did you do it with incision or non-incision?

747
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,860
Non-incision.

748
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,540
First, pull out the back hand.

749
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,620
Pull it out for a few hours.

750
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,500
Then lie down and plant it in front of you.

751
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,620
Then lie down and plant it in front of you.

752
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,440
Can I see something?

753
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,260
Can I see something?

754
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,420
You're too close.

755
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,560
I want to see it, too.

756
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,840
Sakura is going to see her hair.

757
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,680
Can I see this?

758
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,600
Yes, you can.

759
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,300
When did you do it?

760
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,560
5 years ago.

761
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,880
5 years ago?

762
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,000
Where did you start?

763
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,560
Just in front of here.

764
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,740
I'm sorry, but if I did it, I would have done it a little more.

765
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,640
That's right.

766
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:57,880
That's right.

767
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,100
Go away.

768
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,840
I mean it.

769
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,520
You can pull it out a little further.

770
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,660
I want to see 4,000 more than 2,000.

771
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,680
It's too funny.

772
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,380
We can't force ourselves now.

773
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,760
It's really hard.

774
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,100
How many people will lie here?

775
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,720
I'll reveal it.

776
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
So many people...

777
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,840
It was so surprising.

778
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,340
Among the things you announced,

779
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,980
Among these,

780
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,420
The person who lied

781
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,040
There are two.

782
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,180
The two of them are lying.

783
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,520
Liars!

784
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,080
I think it's Soondae and Olceng.

785
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,520
Why do you keep saying Olceng?

786
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,540
It's Justin and Leon.

787
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,880
What kind of Olceng is this?

788
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,560
What kind of Olceng is this?

789
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:43,660
What is this?

790
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,780
Honestly, I like Sakura and Justin.

791
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,300
Sakura?

792
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,340
I think Sakura is right.

793
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,920
Usually, Soondae should come out like this.

794
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,020
Which part do you like the most?

795
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,480
I like Soondae.

796
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,100
I like Soondae.

797
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,380
I like Soondae because I haven't been able to come to Korea yet.

798
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,960
But this is a school where foreigners go to.

799
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,100
First of all, everyone recognizes Sakura, right?

800
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,560
No, no. First of all, it's Justin.

801
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,460
It's the same person.

802
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,860
It's really the same person.

803
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,660
It's the same person.

804
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,060
Honestly, I've seen Justin since a long time ago.

805
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,280
It's the same person.

806
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,460
It's the same person.

807
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,440
No, it's not.

808
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:25,900
He has a lot of friends around Justin.

809
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,640
Oh, really?

810
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,100
I think I've heard it before.

811
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,920
No, it could be the same person.

812
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,380
Now, if you're ready, you can point out one or two people.

813
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,140
The person who is most pointed out will be judged as a liar.

814
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,500
This person is a real liar.

815
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,480
A liar.

816
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:43,280
One, two, three.

817
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,580
Justin, Justin, Justin.

818
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,020
Justin, Justin.

819
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,620
Olceng.

820
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:48,900
Olceng.

821
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,180
Wait a minute.

822
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,200
Please change the answer.

823
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,500
Who is the Soondae expert now?

824
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,120
Soondae.

825
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,060
Oh, it's not Soondae.

826
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:55,740
Please change the answer.

827
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,000
Seems like it's him.

828
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,000
Seems like it's Jeong Eul.

829
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,360
Jeong Eul.

830
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,680
Something that will happen for bit who will be the bettor.

831
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,820
Justin's the winner.

832
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,820
Justin, I grew hair.

833
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:16,760
Did you grow a hair?

834
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,300
He did.

835
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,080
That's right.

836
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:20,820
Is he serious?

837
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,240
Really?

838
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,640
He really did it.

839
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,500
So natural.

840
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,120
Why did you go in the big way last time?

841
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,920
Stop it.

842
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,520
What did you do?

843
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,580
You have to tell us the rest of the introduction.

844
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,080
Okay, then I'll tell you the other two.

845
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,860
I came to Korea with a revenge for my ex-girlfriend.

846
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,700
Oh, this is a lie.

847
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,920
I'm close to one of the BLACKPINK members.

848
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,460
Who is BLACKPINK?

849
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,360
Jisoo.

850
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,440
Jisoo?

851
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,840
Is number 3 true or false?

852
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,320
Number 3 is...

853
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,340
False.

854
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:51,520
False.

855
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,240
You don't know Jisoo at all?

856
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,040
No, no. We know each other.

857
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,660
Oh, you know each other.

858
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,360
We worked together for 6 months.

859
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,560
When we were recording the whole song party.

860
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,600
You met her at the official event?

861
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,840
Yes, we sat next to each other and talked.

862
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,480
But we can't say that we are close.

863
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,820
Oh, I see.

864
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
What's surprising is that the second one is the truth.

865
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,840
You came to Korea with a revenge for your ex-girlfriend.

866
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,380
That's right.

867
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,040
Your life is like a movie.

868
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,620
There is pain, Justin.

869
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,340
I was dating my ex-girlfriend.

870
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,620
She was from Canada.

871
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,560
She came to South Korea and only went on a trip.

872
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,880
We met and went back to her country.

873
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,140
But she was already 24 years old at that time.

874
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,940
She already went on a trip to 50 countries.

875
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,600
So I thought I should do it too.

876
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,920
I thought I would regret it if I didn't do it.

877
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,440
So I was wondering where to go because of that reason.

878
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,000
But we decided we were going back to Korea.

879
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:57,880
Maybe we should go back to the country we're from.

880
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,460
It's more prefect.

881
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,000
We should go to the last country of Korea.

882
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,920
There is a story behind it.

883
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,560
Justin, you won't be able to participate in the official game anymore.

884
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,180
Please drop out of the auction.

885
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,040
It is sad.

886
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:10,800
It is sad, right?

887
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,820
That's right.

888
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,760
I am sorry.

889
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,040
But, Justin.

890
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,340
You can talk.

891
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Don't be too surprised when watching the program.

892
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,640
If you get eliminated,

893
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,480
The person who is eliminated will be a voice changer.

894
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,300
Don't be surprised. You will hear a baby's voice.

895
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,080
She chewed it so well.

896
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,300
Two people are the same.

897
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,620
No one revealed it.

898
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,140
Let's go to the second round without revealing it.

899
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,060
Let's write down the second introduction.

900
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,340
Please raise the panel.

901
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:45,900
Please raise the panel.

902
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,520
This time, let's start with Chanel.

903
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,980
My name is from my mom's favorite brand.

904
00:37:54,765 --> 00:37:55,780
This is right.

905
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,840
Because my mom was in the U.S. when I was born.

906
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,340
So, to have a better opportunity,

907
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,580
I really liked the Chanel brand.

908
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,220
That elegant feeling.

909
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,860
But you didn't write it the same way.

910
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,660
But you didn't write it the same way.

911
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,800
Because my mom liked the brand,

912
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,200
I wrote the spelling differently so that I could have my own feeling.

913
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,580
I don't think it's right.

914
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,000
I don't think it's right.

915
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,080
But there are some cases like this.

916
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,080
There are.

917
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,940
She likes the brand so much.

918
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,040
Among our seniors, the son's name is Bentley.

919
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,240
Yes, there is.

920
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,400
Do you have a brother?

921
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,760
Three brothers.

922
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,160
What's the name?

923
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:38,940
Gucci.

924
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,580
Marana.

925
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,700
Gucci.

926
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,160
Marana.

927
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,520
Gucci.

928
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,320
Marana.

929
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,420
It's not an outlet.

930
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,200
What's your brother's name?

931
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,420
Milo, Odin, Axel.

932
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,780
But they are all famous.

933
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,140
Odin, the god.

934
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,840
Thor's father.

935
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,180
Axel? Axel Rose?

936
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,080
Axel Rose.

937
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,540
But the spelling is a little different.

938
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,140
Because of Axel Rose?

939
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,520
Then it could be right.

940
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,140
Then it could be right.

941
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,380
Okay.

942
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,060
What is the first day of the year?

943
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,800
Everyone knows that it's the third day of the year.

944
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,340
Right.

945
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,040
You already know that it is the third.

946
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,300
But for me, it's a day.

947
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,320
A day?

948
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,600
To be precise, the date is allowed to be at 7 o'clock.

949
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,560
The next morning, I saw a notice of a break-up at 9 o'clock.

950
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:26,900
You met a day.

951
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,600
It's not a day.

952
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,780
It's a day-off.

953
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:29,960
A day-off.

954
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:30,700
What time did you meet?

955
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,020
Dinner?

956
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,320
That confession was accepted.

957
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,640
It's allowed at 7.

958
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,660
7 o'clock in the evening.

959
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,460
When you have dinner, the date becomes a date.

960
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,700
The next morning, as soon as I woke up, I saw Jang-gu.

961
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:43,780
This is Jang-gu.
This is the second one.

962
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,120
This is the real one!

963
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,920
What do you mean the real one?

964
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,720
What kind of friend was she?

965
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,420
She was a girl in elementary school.

966
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,920
So she was a real person?

967
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:56,960
She was a real person!

968
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,860
She was a cyber person!

969
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,180
She was a cyber person!

970
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,860
How happy she must have been!

971
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,080
The next day,

972
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,280
she found out something.

973
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,280
When the students asked her,

974
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,900
she thought,

975
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,880
you are a real person!

976
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,020
I woke up in the morning

977
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,200
and she was a girl in elementary school.

978
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,360
At first,

979
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:22,860
I thought,

980
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,960
have I not learned Korean?

981
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,620
She was a super girl.

982
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,460
She never went to a date with her girlfriend.

983
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,440
She didn't sleep together

984
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,200
but she broke up with someone.

985
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,060
She didn't have any memories.

986
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,260
I know it.

987
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,100
There's no love.

988
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,360
There's no life record or anything.

989
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,480
We haven't held each other's hands, right?

990
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:45,980
Not even a little.

991
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,060
My only memory is, in my dream, I'm having my first love.

992
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,680
I hope it's a lie.

993
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,420
Did you date a lot in elementary school and middle school?

994
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:54,820
Did you have a good relationship?

995
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,340
I'm not going to go into detail, but I did.

996
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,460
Are you enjoying that?

997
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,040
Are you enjoying that?

998
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,180
You are going out!

999
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,260
Out!

1000
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,480
Would you like to jump if I say yes?

1001
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:23,320
Sakura, would you like to say something?

1002
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,220
I talk to my mom for 3 hours on the phone.

1003
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,520
You talk to your mom for 3 hours on the phone.

1004
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,120
You talk to your mom for 3 hours on the phone.

1005
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,700
Every day.

1006
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,600
Every day?

1007
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,800
Almost every day.

1008
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,600
You don't have time.

1009
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,320
Wait, this is a lie.

1010
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,180
This person doesn't even have time to eat her favorite sundae.

1011
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,200
I only order delivery food.

1012
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,200
That's right.

1013
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,340
Then this is also a lie and this is also a lie?

1014
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,260
Only one is a lie.

1015
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,020
This is a lie.

1016
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,740
This is a lie.

1017
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,140
This is a lie.

1018
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,980
No, this doesn't fit.

1019
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,260
What did you say to each other?

1020
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,500
I didn't say anything.

1021
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,160
You didn't say anything?

1022
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,940
There are a lot of things we do.

1023
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,660
We just do what we want.

1024
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,520
We just do what we want to do.

1025
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:16,600
We play games.

1026
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,040
I think she's a real friend.

1027
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,280
When she's on a video call, she doesn't talk.

1028
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,220
She just plays the game.

1029
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,280
It's like this these days.

1030
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,200
We're in the same space.

1031
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,880
Since this is a daily routine, I'll just ask a simple question.

1032
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,300
What was the biggest issue you had recently?

1033
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,300
What was the issue that your mother talked about?

1034
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,100
What was the issue that you talked about for 3 hours and 10 minutes?

1035
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,400
Issue?

1036
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,160
Issue?

1037
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,580
There won't be any.

1038
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:41,740
Why?

1039
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,880
Why?

1040
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,000
Because it's a lie?

1041
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:44,380
Because it's a lie.

1042
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,640
Okay, okay, that's it.

1043
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,820
It's going too far.

1044
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,260
And it's shocking.

1045
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,680
Shall we announce it?

1046
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,120
I've never taken a shower in cold water.

1047
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,420
I've never taken a shower in cold water.

1048
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,440
I'm really good at taking a shower in cold water.

1049
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,400
Really?

1050
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,780
Yes, so if there's cold water, I just don't do it.

1051
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,840
I wait until there's warm water.

1052
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Oh, wait a minute.

1053
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,420
And I went to boarding school.

1054
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,700
Thailand's weather is hot.

1055
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,600
Even if it's hot, regardless of the weather,

1056
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,220
I always take a shower in warm water.

1057
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,420
I saw it on the news.

1058
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,600
It's really cold in Thailand.

1059
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,660
It's so nice.

1060
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,400
Even if it's 10 degrees,

1061
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,000
you look like you're wearing a padded jacket.

1062
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,980
Even if it's only 20 degrees, it's cold.

1063
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:26,380
It's ridiculous.

1064
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,320
I think it's right.

1065
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:28,620
Yeah.

1066
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,220
I think it is right.�

1067
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:31,400
The

1068
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,140
old man likes people who like to take a shower in warm water. And

1069
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,380
that guy does too. Hey,

1070
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,720
I like it! But.

1071
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,240
It's

1072
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,620
a lie. He's

1073
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,200
cheating. I am.

1074
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:47,940
It's really

1075
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:48,820
good. It's so

1076
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,660
hot. Then what should

1077
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:51,820
we do?

1078
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:52,960
I don't get hot easily.

1079
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,320
Nobody gets hot easily...

1080
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,300
Right, everybody grows.

1081
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,020
I think we've done it before.

1082
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,340
Swimming pool?

1083
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,500
What?

1084
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,320
We're done already!

1085
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:01,820
Pool!

1086
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,940
It's swimming pool.

1087
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:04,660
Water man!

1088
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,380
For me...

1089
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,540
It's just hot water coming out of the pool.

1090
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,080
Todo Island?

1091
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,180
Out of hot water?

1092
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:11,760
Out of water under the åt��?

1093
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:12,920
Out of cold water under the ot��.

1094
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,320
Excuse me.

1095
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,340
That's not allowed...

1096
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,820
Is it too hot in the summer or is there anything else?

1097
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,920
My grandparents have a resort. You can get warm water from there.

1098
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,820
You really have a resort, and you can get warm water from there?

1099
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:31,380
Yes.

1100
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:35,660
This is so real, but it's hard to get in.

1101
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,200
I have two brothers and three sisters, and all three of us are foreigners.

1102
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,680
International marriage?

1103
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,320
Yes, international marriage.

1104
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,880
All the people in the house...

1105
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,880
Where are you from?

1106
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,260
I'm Korean, and my first sister is Albanian, and my youngest is Japanese.

1107
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,840
This is the first marriage.

1108
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:58,940
This is my first marriage.

1109
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,440
After you got married, did you recommend her to your sisters?

1110
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,280
Yes, I did.

1111
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,060
It just happened naturally.

1112
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,560
Alberto seems to be honest.

1113
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,520
We should have caught Jenny in Japan.

1114
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,540
I couldn't catch her.

1115
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,760
Jenny?

1116
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,320
I ran 10km to become a model.

1117
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,680
Did you meet Olcay at that time?

1118
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,180
No, it was different time.

1119
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,600
Why did you run?

1120
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,960
I wanted to be a model, but I was very chubby.

1121
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,380
So I had to lose weight to fit well in clothes.

1122
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,480
Did you run like this when you ran?

1123
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:39,880
I ran like this.

1124
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,960
If the music was good, I ran like this.

1125
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,640
Have you ever seen someone run like that?

1126
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,620
How long did it take to run 10km?

1127
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,580
If I can run 10km, I don't have time to run.

1128
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,620
Now I understand how Justin feels.

1129
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,200
Jenny's problem is not the problem of Still, Leo is the problem.

1130
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,540
She's from a ski club.

1131
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,660
As you said, she's from a ski club.

1132
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,440
I mean, I used to ski in the Air Force.

1133
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,180
I know you went to the Air Force.

1134
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,620
Can you show us how to ski?

1135
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,900
Can you show us how to ski?

1136
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,000
Oh, wrong.

1137
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,420
Oh, wrong.

1138
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,680
Isn't that a tadpole?

1139
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,260
Oh, a tadpole.

1140
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,760
It's a tadpole.

1141
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,440
If an enemy shoots,

1142
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,460
you have to avoid it.

1143
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,380
You have to avoid it.

1144
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:51,700
Practice.

1145
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,020
Oh, you have to run that much and avoid it?

1146
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,120
You have to avoid it.

1147
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:56,920
It's acting.

1148
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,020
Then how do you shoot while skiing?

1149
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:01,400
Because you are in the Air Force.

1150
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,680
You have a gun, right?

1151
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,320
You have a gun, right?

1152
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,780
Then how do you shoot?

1153
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,840
Thinking about aчас供

1154
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:18,240
This is no reason to go.

1155
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,440
Normally, you are lying down.

1156
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,620
It's cold.

1157
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,820
Is it pretending to be wearing a cap?

1158
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:26,620
Yes.

1159
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:33,680
There are some people who lie.

1160
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,740
In the second round, there are two people

1161
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:37,860
who lie.

1162
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,800
It's just two of us.

1163
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,620
It's just two of us.

1164
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,460
It's just two of us.

1165
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,460
Just two of us is lying?

1166
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,840
Wait a minute. Finland is also a duty.

1167
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,900
We have to go to the army.

1168
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,540
Yeah, it's a duty.

1169
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,200
I know that the soldiers are skiing to relieve stress.

1170
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,620
But they are not wearing ski boots.

1171
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,060
Why are you looking at me?

1172
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,780
Why are you looking at me?

1173
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:02,960
Alberto.

1174
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,060
Thailand is hot.

1175
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,280
We should have done it with cold water at least once.

1176
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,800
It's really frustrating.

1177
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,860
Let's organize our minds.

1178
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,100
Let's do what you want.

1179
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,280
This person is a liar.

1180
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,920
If you are too confused,

1181
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,820
let's do the sundae in the first round.

1182
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,400
Suddenly?

1183
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:24,920
Suddenly?

1184
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,500
The sundae in the first round.

1185
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,440
I'm still a little stiff.

1186
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,800
I can't sleep at night.

1187
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:36,680
One, two, three.

1188
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,260
Sundae.

1189
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,380
No, no, no.

1190
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,000
Let's go. Sundae.

1191
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:42,780
Sundae.

1192
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,540
Oh, it's suddenly sundae.

1193
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,480
What are you going to vote for?

1194
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,160
You suddenly picked up the sundae that was in the first round.

1195
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,400
If this is a lie,

1196
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,940
you have one more chance to point it out.

1197
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,320
There's a lot of Korean food, but it's sundae.

1198
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,160
Is it true or a lie?

1199
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,300
Please announce it yourself.

1200
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:09,940
I hate the sundae the most among Korean food.

1201
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,840
Wow, I'm serious.

1202
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:17,780
I'm really honest.

1203
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,300
Wow, it's me.

1204
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,300
That's me.

1205
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,940
Oh, is that you?

1206
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,340
I got money from an association.

1207
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,140
I got money from the Association of Sundae.

1208
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,980
She bought for the company.

1209
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,600
I'll turn the lights. What's your favorite thing?

1210
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:34,820
Kimchi stew.

1211
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,260
I want to eat it!

1212
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,420
So you are going to eat it with the ripe kimchi?

1213
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:39,500
Yes.

1214
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,020
Oh, so you are going to eat it with the ripe kimchi.

1215
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,680
Add some pork neck and...

1216
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,560
Oh, yes. Add some tofu.

1217
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,660
Add some tofu...

1218
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,400
I am hungry.

1219
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,780
Sakura needs to announce the answer.

1220
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,580
My favorite subject is math.

1221
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,360
This is true.

1222
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:56,400
This is true.

1223
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,540
So what is the good point of math?

1224
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,280
Because there is an answer.

1225
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,440
Because there is a definite answer.

1226
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,540
What was your dream when you were young?

1227
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,520
I wanted to be a nurse.

1228
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,660
A doctor.

1229
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,080
My brother is 12 years older than me.

1230
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,100
I saw him when he was giving birth.

1231
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,380
It was so mysterious.

1232
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,080
I wanted to be a doctor.

1233
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,220
So I became a doctor.

1234
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,220
We have one more person.

1235
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,220
Does anyone have a feeling?

1236
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,220
I am a skier.

1237
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,540
But you say the answer on purpose.

1238
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,380
But it's similar to the mafia game.

1239
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,000
There is a person who runs away.

1240
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,620
Do you know who it is?

1241
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,140
1,000 won per day.

1242
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:45,780
1,000 won per day.

1243
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,120
He keeps running away.

1244
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,320
If he doesn't run away, how can we find out the lie of Soondae?

1245
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,900
Soondae is not Na Dan.

1246
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,200
Soondae is not Na Dan.

1247
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:58,500
He is a professional.

1248
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,780
He was running away and got caught.

1249
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,340
So he became a gay.

1250
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,800
Gay?

1251
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,420
Did you not do gay?

1252
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,780
Did you not do gay?

1253
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,400
Which one is more meaningful?

1254
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,360
1,000 won per day.

1255
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,660
I am a little bit...

1256
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:21,340
Wait.

1257
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,060
1, 2, 3.

1258
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,520
1,000 won per day.

1259
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,960
1,000 won per day.

1260
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,140
1,000 won per day.

1261
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,740
1,000 won per day.

1262
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,840
1,000 won per day.

1263
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,360
1,000 won per day.

1264
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,580
1,000 won per day.

1265
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,340
1,000 won per day.

1266
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,660
1,000 won per day.

1267
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,520
1,000 won per day.

1268
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:36,560
1,000 won per day.

1269
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,800
1,000 won per day.

1270
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:37,940
1,000 won per day.

1271
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,460
1,000 won per day.

1272
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:38,800
1,000 won per day.

1273
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,080
1,000 won per day.

1274
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,240
1,000 won per day.

1275
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,080
1,000 won per day.

1276
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,400
1,000 won per day.

1277
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:40,840
1,000 won per day.

1278
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,800
1,000 won per day.

1279
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,820
1,000 won per day.

1280
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,220
1,000 won per day.

1281
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,450
1,000 won per day.

1282
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,820
1,000 won per day.

1283
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:57,000
Is it good?

1284
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,920
I didn't even think I was going to fail.

1285
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,140
This is so unfair now.

1286
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,480
The first day of Your Highness!

1287
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,780
The first day of Your Highness...

1288
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,200
or actually it's the second day of Your Highness...

1289
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,680
That's correct.

1290
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,260
It's the truth!

1291
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,640
You're so angry!

1292
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,180
I'm sorry!

1293
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,060
I'm sorry.

1294
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,120
Sorry.

1295
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,960
Come here.

1296
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:30,700
I'm sorry.

1297
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,560
Wait.

1298
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,880
We are not alone.

1299
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,220
We are in the same class.

1300
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,040
We didn't pass the exam.

1301
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,740
We didn't pass the exam.

1302
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,100
We failed to pass the exam.

1303
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,760
You failed to pass the exam.

1304
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,600
Please introduce the other one.

1305
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,720
This is the first one.

1306
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,880
I am better at English than Leo.

1307
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,280
Is it true?

1308
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:54,520
Is this the truth?

1309
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,340
Then you are lying.

1310
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,420
Before I lie,

1311
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,180
I put this in my mouth.

1312
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,580
What was the lie?

1313
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,940
I put on sunscreen every day.

1314
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,940
But this is because...

1315
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,920
You filmed an ad, right?

1316
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:14,940
Yes, I did.

1317
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,460
You filmed an ad for sunscreen.

1318
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,160
What is that?

1319
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,920
How many lies are there?

1320
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:24,860
There are so many.

1321
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,940
Everyone is good at lying.

1322
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,180
There are 5 members left.

1323
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,080
3 of them are lying.

1324
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:31,820
3 out of 5.

1325
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,160
The last 3 are left.

1326
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,520
I came to Korea and...

1327
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,060
I saw snow for the first time.

1328
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,580
Really?

1329
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,440
Really?

1330
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,360
It was snow in Korea.

1331
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,980
And interestingly,

1332
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,540
I came to Korea for the first time.

1333
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,160
When I was young.

1334
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:50,920
I came here in winter.

1335
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,400
I don't remember well.

1336
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,520
It was the first time I was in the snow.

1337
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,080
It was so amazing.

1338
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,820
It was the first time I was hit by the snow.

1339
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,900
So I cried in the snow.

1340
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,900
How old were you?

1341
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,040
I was 4 years old.

1342
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,580
After I saw you for the first time,

1343
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,720
I never gave you a gift.

1344
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,320
Wait a minute.

1345
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,760
Leo is a little uncomfortable.

1346
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,520
Why?

1347
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,780
From the teacher's point of view, he is very uncomfortable.

1348
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,040
My ex-girlfriend...

1349
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:24,360
didn't like the snow.

1350
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,000
Your ex-girlfriend didn't like the snow.

1351
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,920
But can you tell me the reason?

1352
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,380
I didn't tell you the reason.

1353
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,200
It was on TV.

1354
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,760
I just told you.

1355
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,100
It's because you touched my nose.

1356
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,380
It's because you touched my nose.

1357
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,860
You did Nuclear.

1358
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:42,880
Yes.

1359
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,260
Don't you have a song that pushes you away?

1360
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,280
Don't go.

1361
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,440
What song?

1362
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,000
Don't go.

1363
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,260
Get out of my face.

1364
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:54,620
There was a song.

1365
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,080
She told me this.

1366
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,300
She worked so hard.

1367
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,760
She even wrote the lyrics of the song.

1368
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,140
What did your ex-girlfriend say?

1369
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:04,600
She said, I don't like it.

1370
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,680
That's right.

1371
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,460
Jenny, too.

1372
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,820
I can sing very well like Beyoncé.

1373
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,040
I can sing very well like Beyoncé.

1374
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,400
Now I get it.

1375
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,160
She only showed the truth.

1376
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,560
She can't sing like Beyoncé.

1377
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,720
What should we do?

1378
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:24,680
What should we do?

1379
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,820
I can feel it.

1380
00:55:26,245 --> 00:55:27,480
First of all, the vocal cords.

1381
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,160
For me, my soul.

1382
00:55:30,925 --> 00:55:32,060
Can you see it?

1383
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:32,560
My soul.

1384
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,900
I inherited it.

1385
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,100
I thought everyone had inherited it.

1386
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,680
It's already been revealed that it's not.

1387
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,120
It's not me.

1388
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,940
This is too high.

1389
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,260
What's your favorite song?

1390
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:53,540
Beyoncé's Texas.

1391
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,600
It's a recent song.

1392
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,160
It's Texas Soldom.

1393
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,580
It's Texas Soldom.

1394
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,380
I shortened it.

1395
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:01,920
What?

1396
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,640
When did you say that?

1397
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,720
It's okay.

1398
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,140
Calm down. Alberto.

1399
00:56:09,585 --> 00:56:12,480
I am the vice president of the Italian Chamber of Commerce.

1400
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,380
I am the vice president.

1401
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,320
I went to the competition before the broadcast.

1402
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:17,760
The first company I went to

1403
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,600
was mainstream company.

1404
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:24,200
And I had seen Italian brand Production.

1405
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,340
I was the sporting assistant in the school and

1406
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,280
vice president.

1407
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,560
Who is the vice president?

1408
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,220
Andra Bellacci, Italian Amber.

1409
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:37,040
Who is Andrea Bellacci?

1410
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,660
Anlacion is the vice president.

1411
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:38,740
But Dlandra is the president of Korea.

1412
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,820
The embargo ?

1413
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,580
So this is the second round.

1414
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,340
We can't talk about our opinions here.

1415
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,400
Does a vice president get paid?

1416
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:49,760
We don't earn paid.

1417
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,320
Because we are a sales company, all the brands are members.

1418
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,740
Members get Ranked Opportunity on annual basis.

1419
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,820
That's why I got picked for this show.

1420
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,060
I am also the vice president of the Namagong.

1421
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,560
Can you tell us what kind of vice president you are?

1422
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,020
You have to tell us what kind of vice president you are.

1423
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,280
The main venture company in Namagong.

1424
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,380
How many members are there?

1425
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,620
Six members.

1426
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,100
That's a lot.

1427
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,580
How do you know the president's name?

1428
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,140
Tim Dickens.

1429
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,520
I'm really Tim Dickens.

1430
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,600
Shall we announce Chanel?

1431
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,780
I am a college student.

1432
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,600
Really?

1433
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,000
I just graduated.

1434
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,960
That's so real.

1435
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,860
I'm a global engineer.

1436
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,920
What's your major?

1437
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,660
Bio-living engineering.

1438
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:44,760
Bio-living engineering?

1439
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,540
Bio-living engineering?

1440
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,500
Bio-living engineering?

1441
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,540
Before I became an idol, I wanted to be a doctor.

1442
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:53,660
It was my dream.

1443
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,520
I studied hard because it was like a dream.

1444
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,520
Then...

1445
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,120
Jenny is coming out again.

1446
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,520
Send me to America.

1447
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,800
I'm a college student from the United States.

1448
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,460
What was your major?

1449
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,540
What was your major?

1450
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,880
I was a trainee when I entered the university.

1451
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:18,520
I couldn't take a taxi, so I got on the bus and went to the practice room.

1452
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,080
How many times?

1453
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,100
I went to the university.

1454
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:24,980
Leo?

1455
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,800
There must be something on the bulletin board.

1456
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,500
There's nothing on the bulletin board.

1457
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:32,760
This is the first time I'm revealing it.

1458
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,660
Really?

1459
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,240
Have you ever seen me?

1460
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:35,320
Have you ever seen me?

1461
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,100
Why?

1462
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,240
I went to an event.

1463
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:48,510
I went in last year and planned it right away.

1464
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:49,590
Is it an animal that symbolizes?

1465
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:51,170
An animal that symbolizes.

1466
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:52,130
Eagle.

1467
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,070
That's too easy.

1468
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:54,510
There's even an eagle.

1469
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:55,890
What color is it?

1470
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:56,630
Blue.

1471
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:57,730
Blue.

1472
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,070
I think it's right.

1473
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:03,750
Now that all three have been revealed, it's important to pull out the lie as much as possible.

1474
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:04,850
Pull out the lie.

1475
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:08,110
But this time, we're not looking for people anyway.

1476
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,490
It's all lies anyway.

1477
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:09,970
That's right.

1478
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:12,050
That's right.

1479
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:12,950
What kind of lie is it?

1480
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:13,830
You just have to pull it out.

1481
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,090
Oh, that's right.

1482
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,010
Now that I'm here, it's right.

1483
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:21,150
Oh, I saw it from behind.

1484
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:22,730
Why?

1485
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:25,690
It's all real.

1486
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:27,110
It pops, right?

1487
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:27,810
Yes, all of a sudden.

1488
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:29,450
Number 2 is definitely right.

1489
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:30,390
Really?

1490
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:31,710
Are you sure?

1491
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:32,470
Are you sure?

1492
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,050
Are you sure?

1493
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:33,730
Did you two plan it?

1494
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,210
It doesn't matter if it's number 1.

1495
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,050
If it's not, I'll take responsibility.

1496
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:37,690
Okay.

1497
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:37,970
Now, let's roll with your fingers.

1498
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:41,830
Number 3, number 2, and number 1.

1499
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,270
One, two, three.

1500
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,630
Number 1, number 2, and number 3.

1501
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:46,030
Does it dry?

1502
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:47,450
Number 1, and number 3.

1503
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:50,910
Number 1 was the most episode.

1504
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,490
Number 1, is it real?

1505
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:53,710
What's the lie?

1506
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:54,450
Number two is...

1507
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:56,230
It's a lie.

1508
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,130
That was great.

1509
00:59:59,330 --> 00:59:59,390
Thank you.

1510
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:04,190
It doesn't make any sense.

1511
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:07,590
Then let's check the answer on quiz.

1512
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:07,850
He smokes a lot.

1513
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,830
But he doesn't smoke.

1514
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,070
I didn't smoke because I was a player.

1515
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,230
That's right.

1516
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:17,070
And he still takes good care of his health.

1517
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:18,090
He's famous.

1518
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,290
What I learned then helped me a lot.

1519
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,230
What I learned was that

1520
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:23,830
even if you don't smoke,

1521
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,610
you have to follow people when they smoke.

1522
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:28,370
When I was in the company,

1523
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:31,290
I was trying to get close to people.

1524
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:31,750
When I was smoking,

1525
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:34,190
they told me the most important things there.

1526
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:36,970
At school, at work,

1527
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,530
they told me the most important things there.

1528
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:39,510
So you followed them.

1529
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:40,650
You followed them.

1530
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,130
But you didn't follow your teacher.

1531
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:44,550
That's right.

1532
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,050
How long did you work as a vice president?

1533
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:48,990
I still work as a vice president.

1534
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,190
My parents have worked in Korea,

1535
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:53,250
Albania, and Japan.

1536
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:54,210
That's right.

1537
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,190
I was looking forward to it.

1538
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,530
It must have been fun.

1539
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,290
It must have been fun.

1540
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,050
So,

1541
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:01,930
there is a lie among CHANEL's.

1542
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,550
Let's pick number 2.

1543
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:05,510
What is it?

1544
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,170
Brand name.

1545
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:08,970
Jenny?

1546
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:11,710
Jenny should go with CHANEL.

1547
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:14,430
Wait a minute.

1548
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:20,010
It's almost a lie.

1549
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:23,910
CHANEL, what's your answer?

1550
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:25,110
Lie.

1551
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:27,070
This is...

1552
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:30,670
Lies.

1553
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:37,090
I told you!

1554
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:40,010
She's really good at lying.

1555
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,050
She's really good at lying.

1556
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,630
She's really good at lying.

1557
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:45,970
What does that mean?

1558
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,150
It doesn't mean anything.

1559
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,330
My dad went to my mom and said,

1560
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:49,810
How's Chanel?

1561
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:53,250
She just listened to the sound and the sound was so pretty.

1562
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,190
To be honest, my mom didn't want to do it because of the brand.

1563
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:58,350
Even because of the brand.

1564
01:01:58,350 --> 01:01:59,210
I didn't want to do it because of the brand.

1565
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:02,390
But my mom had that elegant feeling.

1566
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:03,930
She liked it so much.

1567
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,750
So I said, okay, let's do it like that.

1568
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:07,510
Isn't that the name of your younger brother?

1569
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:09,790
That's right.

1570
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:10,510
That's right.

1571
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,890
But I didn't want to do it because of the singer.

1572
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,690
That's why I didn't do it.

1573
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:17,390
That's amazing.

1574
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:18,850
That's so cool.

1575
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,570
Before I debuted,

1576
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,250
I performed with Red Velvet.

1577
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,040
But because of my mother,

1578
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:52,500
I couldn't do it.

1579
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,200
Red Velvet, you have to do it.

1580
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,400
Why can't I do it?

1581
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:58,700
Red Velvet, you have to do it.

1582
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:59,000
I can't do it.

1583
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,360
I'm going to leave you alone.

1584
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,360
I can't.

1585
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,460
Ski! Ski! Ski!

1586
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,280
One, two, three!

1587
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,160
From the ski team.

1588
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,320
Truth or lie?

1589
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,760
It's the truth.

1590
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:10,340
Oh!

1591
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:11,760
It's the truth.

1592
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,100
It's the truth.

1593
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:15,260
Really?

1594
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:18,980
Really?

1595
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:20,040
That's right.

1596
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,860
We shoot while skiing.

1597
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,080
We eat.

1598
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,960
I'm sorry.

1599
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,120
I'm sorry.

1600
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:29,340
Is the rock party a lie?

1601
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,000
The rock party is also the truth.

1602
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:32,700
It's a lie.

1603
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,680
I graduated from elementary school in Korea.

1604
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,880
I couldn't go to Finland, so I was sent to Finland.

1605
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:39,940
I'm a Korean with a wig.

1606
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,500
It's a lie.

1607
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,060
Number three is a lie.

1608
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,280
Ex-girlfriend...

1609
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,260
What is it?

1610
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,000
We'll stop here.

1611
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,220
We'll give you a lot of time.

1612
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,780
Let's begin.

1613
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,760
It's fun, Leo.

1614
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:02,200
Now it's Jennie's turn.

1615
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,660
A tadpole.

1616
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,360
A tadpole.

1617
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,260
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

1618
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,480
Everyone is lying.

1619
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,140
Everyone seems to be lying.

1620
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,120
Everyone is lying.

1621
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,800
Let's try it right after listening to the song.

1622
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,260
Let's sing.

1623
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:24,700
One, two, three!

1624
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:25,520
Succeeded!

1625
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:26,680
Oh! Oh!

1626
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,960
It's a bit like a music show.

1627
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,440
Wait, this is a bit too...

1628
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:33,900
It feels like you've seen it before.

1629
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,100
You've seen it a lot!

1630
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,660
Beyonce, Beyonce...

1631
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,720
This dance is that!

1632
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,000
There is a dance like this in the song.

1633
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,120
Guns on top, Guns on top.

1634
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,740
Okay, make some noise!

1635
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,580
I can't sing like Yoju.

1636
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:52,600
I can't sing like Hongjoong.

1637
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,740
I have been given the title of Soul by Da.

1638
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:05,700
Is it Texas?

1639
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:07,820
Is it Harlem?

1640
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:10,060
Is it Texas?

1641
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,160
Is it Harlem?

1642
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,440
Way around, round, round, round.

1643
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:15,760
I got it.

1644
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,480
You got it.

1645
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:18,740
You got it.

1646
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,080
You got it.

1647
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,640
That's right!

1648
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,300
Good job!

1649
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,080
Good job!

1650
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,380
Like this.

1651
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:30,060
Good job!

1652
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:33,700
Good job!

1653
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,480
Good job!

1654
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:38,840
Then, the first one is...

1655
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,040
the real one.

1656
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:41,640
The real one.

1657
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,420
I went and slept with him a lot.

1658
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,660
And she ran 10km.

1659
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,540
I ran for 10 seconds to become a model.

1660
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,900
I worked out too much. But I was really good at working out.

1661
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:55,360
As far as I know, you walked around the company to become a model.

1662
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,760
I didn't walk around. I was an MG, so I sent a DM.

1663
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:05,060
I sent a lot of DMs.

1664
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,000
I also sent DMs to brands like your name.

1665
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,140
Brands that are just starting out.

1666
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,000
Brands that are just starting out.

1667
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,340
I worked really hard.

1668
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,120
But now that I've seen it, there are brands that are starting to work with you.

1669
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,480
And you still have DMs.

1670
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,700
I'm really proud of you.

1671
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:39,840
Jenny, from now on, focus on being a model.

1672
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,520
First of all, Moonshine.

1673
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,200
Which one do you think is fake?

1674
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,340
Number 2.

1675
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,060
Oh, cold water.

1676
01:06:49,355 --> 01:06:50,400
Oh, right. Cold water.

1677
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,120
Cold water.

1678
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,520
I think it's number 2.

1679
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,480
Number 1. Right.

1680
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,660
Number 1 is a lie.

1681
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:02,200
But in the first round, you said there were two people who lied.

1682
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,900
Among these two, there are two people who lied.

1683
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,900
But Sakura lied too.

1684
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,100
Oh, right.

1685
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:13,500
Then it's Youngjin.

1686
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:14,920
Oh, right.

1687
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,840
Oh, she's smart.

1688
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:18,020
She's different from the previous round.

1689
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,440
It's cold water.

1690
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:22,680
Of course we knew this.

1691
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,200
It's cold water.

1692
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,300
It's cold water.

1693
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,640
Now, number 2.

1694
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:28,960
Minnie.

1695
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,040
Is number 2 the truth or a lie?

1696
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:31,640
I'm nervous.

1697
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:33,840
Number 2.

1698
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,180
Number 2.

1699
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,560
It's a lie.

1700
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:38,420
It's a lie.

1701
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,520
Now, I'll explain it to you.

1702
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,140
I'm right not to like cold water.

1703
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:49,680
The dorm I attended...

1704
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,240
I came to women's dorm for the first time in Thailand.

1705
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,340
There's no warm water.

1706
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,440
Out of nowhere, there it was cold water everyday.

1707
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,320
I was soaked.

1708
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,080
A minute later.

1709
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:01,840
Moisture..

1710
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,380
When you're in the first year of class, you have to shower before 7.

1711
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,540
And you bath in two minutes, take a shower.

1712
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:12,000
Then you shampoo in two minutes, and shower in three minutes, a shower before the turn off.

1713
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,100
That's what people say.

1714
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,500
I was crowds bottomed up.

1715
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,660
What is the hardest part of living in a dorm and living in a dorm?

1716
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:20,220
When I went to dorm school, I was taught so hard.

1717
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:24,180
When I lived in a dorm, I was a piece of gum.

1718
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:34,460
While introducing yourself, the teacher was so happy to know you.

1719
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,400
I didn't know there were so many lies in our classroom.

1720
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,120
I think I'm a little further away.

1721
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:40,480
I think I'm a little further away.

1722
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,840
Leo always has a positive mind.

1723
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,440
I'll help you, Leo.

1724
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,660
What are you writing down?

1725
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:50,800
Oh, it's gold.

1726
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:51,920
Oh, it's gold.

1727
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,740
We all have various nationalities, right?

1728
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:58,280
Yes.

1729
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,440
So we made a very dramatic choice at school.

1730
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:03,380
What is it?

1731
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,100
It's the first day of class, but we're going to take a test.

1732
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,220
It's a test of knowledge.

1733
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,020
Let's sit down.

1734
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:18,500
It's the first day on the day of the exam.

1735
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,880
It's a test of knowledge rather than a difficult test.

1736
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,760
Thank you.

1737
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,160
So we should do it.

1738
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,560
The exam is Battle of our motherland.

1739
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:32,560
What is the name?

1740
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:34,760
Boo.

1741
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,340
Boo.

1742
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:35,700
Boo.

1743
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:36,280
Boo.

1744
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:41,080
Teacher, you are so good.

1745
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,140
Teacher, did you do this to show off your talent?

1746
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,680
What are you talking about? I did it to be with you.

1747
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,220
As each of you turns, you will show off your hometown.

1748
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:58,220
The person who gets the best result will be the best student.

1749
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:07,400
The person who gets the best result will get a school badge that only the best student can receive.

1750
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,120
Is it a gold? It is.

1751
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:12,800
It's a gold color.

1752
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,880
The person who gets the best result will play a town show.

1753
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:19,780
Let's see who that person is.

1754
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,760
I am Song Ta Gu.

1755
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,640
Song Pa Gu.

1756
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:29,820
I love Song Pa Gu.

1757
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,200
Song Pa Gu.

1758
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:34,780
I love it.

1759
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,640
Hanganggonggonggonggong.

1760
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,520
Where is Alberto?

1761
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:44,740
Samcheongdong.

1762
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:45,840
Samcheongdong. That's good.

1763
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,000
I live in front of Olpark.

1764
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,240
What is Olpark?

1765
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,760
Olympic Park.

1766
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,880
Wow! You are an Olympic Park.

1767
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:09,780
It took us 2 hours to brag about Sompagu, but to tell you a little bit about the city of Seoul,

1768
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,420
if you go somewhere in Sompagu for 5 minutes, it's all parks.

1769
01:11:13,815 --> 01:11:16,840
As soon as I get out of the house, I jog in my 속춘 옷.

1770
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,460
And if I go a little further, it's Hangang Park.

1771
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:21,680
Hangang Park is a park.

1772
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:25,620
What are you going to hit me with?

1773
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,880
And if Lee Hyun-se comes to Hangang Park,

1774
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:35,360
then it's always the Olympic Park or the National Stadium.

1775
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,320
You guys are stuck in the middle of the road.

1776
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,600
They say you have to take a car or something, but we walk.

1777
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,200
We can't come because we have to study music.

1778
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,860
Let's go to the Olympic Park.

1779
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:49,640
K-pop concert, K-pop concert, Olympic Park.

1780
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:50,440
Let's go there.

1781
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,280
There are so many.

1782
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,460
You guys are going to stay still.

1783
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,380
Yongsan.

1784
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,620
Dragon Mountain.

1785
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,200
Where are you going to go?

1786
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,660
Yongsan, Yongsan.

1787
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,000
It's Dragon Mountain.

1788
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,780
So who wants to go first?

1789
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:10,660
Yongsan.

1790
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:15,800
Yongsan, I know all of them.

1791
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,100
I'm telling you this really funny thing.

1792
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,840
If I have to choose a famous restaurant,

1793
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,360
So, there are many black and white chefs that are very popular these days.

1794
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,320
There are many chefs.

1795
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:28,040
But they can't make a reservation.

1796
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,640
What? They can't make a reservation?

1797
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,000
No, no, no.

1798
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,300
The owner should know.

1799
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,120
No, on weekdays, if you come close, you can go.

1800
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,480
If you come close, you can go.

1801
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:39,580
Can you make a reservation?

1802
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,680
But I'm not betting right now.

1803
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:44,660
We're talking about each other.

1804
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,000
And in the case of video,

1805
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,420
You can say it's the center of history.

1806
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:49,800
What kind of place?

1807
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:51,220
Our Icheon Museum.

1808
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:52,860
Icheon is the national center of history.

1809
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:54,960
No one cares about the nationality.

1810
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,640
The national center of history is there.

1811
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:58,660
If you go to Icheon,

1812
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,620
From the Joseon Dynasty,

1813
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,460
It's lined up like this.

1814
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:03,440
Did you go with your brother?

1815
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:04,540
No, I'm not going.

1816
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,620
I'm not going.

1817
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:11,140
Where do you live?

1818
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,840
I live in Myeong-dong.

1819
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,000
It's real.

1820
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:19,000
It's more close than Myeong-dong.

1821
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,920
Real people go to Myeong-dong.

1822
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,080
Why would the real people go to Myeong-dong?

1823
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,540
I don't think so.

1824
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,480
Is that an apology?

1825
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,620
Is that an apology?

1826
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,580
Are you doing this on purpose?

1827
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,160
From now on,

1828
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,120
We're going to start the interview.

1829
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:42,820
Myeong-dong is good.

1830
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:45,860
Let's look at Minnie's quiz.

1831
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:46,620
Let's take a look at the quiz.

1832
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,000
Where is Minnie's hometown?

1833
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,800
It's Bangkok, Thailand.

1834
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,940
Minnie's quiz. Thailand has the best square.

1835
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:56,540
Now you can answer.

1836
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,440
Thailand is not the best.

1837
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:00,840
There are a lot of bests.

1838
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,100
People are the best.

1839
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,720
Food is the best.

1840
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:04,260
Fruits.

1841
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,080
The sea is the most beautiful.

1842
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,220
There are a lot of famous beaches in Thailand.

1843
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,860
There are a lot of good things in Thailand.

1844
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,700
I'll say the most famous one.

1845
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,220
I'm going to say Miso.

1846
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:19,720
Miso.

1847
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:20,000
Oh wow.

1848
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:22,460
It's similar to the name of one of the most famous cities.

1849
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:25,740
It's not the best in Japan.

1850
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:27,840
Miso is famous in Japan.

1851
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:28,160
Miso.

1852
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:28,660
Miso is famous in Japan.

1853
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,440
Everyone smiles when they go to Miso.

1854
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:36,460
Even the police.

1855
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,260
There's a nickname for me.

1856
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,840
Why do people all smile like that?

1857
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:51,440
The Thai people's personality is very positive and they smile no matter what happens.

1858
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,040
Is it a culture?

1859
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,140
It's a culture.

1860
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,100
When they say hello, they all smile.

1861
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,140
When they say hello at the airport, they all smile.

1862
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:01,160
They smile a lot.

1863
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,260
Smiling is the best. Is that the answer?

1864
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,080
No.

1865
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:06,060
There is something better.

1866
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,080
Something better?

1867
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,920
Public transportation.

1868
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:12,400
Public transportation?

1869
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,000
Public transportation?

1870
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:14,460
It's a disaster.

1871
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,320
It's a disaster.

1872
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,100
It's a disaster.

1873
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,560
This is Minhee's story.

1874
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,900
You have to get on the ferry a lot.

1875
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:27,920
I don't think Minhee has a story like this.

1876
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:35,100
There's an app. If you want to go somewhere, you can just call a motorcycle man and ride a good motorcycle.

1877
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:36,920
Let me explain.

1878
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,240
The traffic is so bad.

1879
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:40,920
It's faster to ride a motorcycle.

1880
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,100
That's right.

1881
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,660
I think it's wrong to say that they reduce the number of motorcycles.

1882
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,200
Pass?

1883
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,500
Fail.

1884
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,140
Answer!

1885
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,220
A horror movie.

1886
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,560
Thailand's horror movie is the best.

1887
01:15:58,660 --> 01:15:59,700
Isn't the horror movie from Japan?

1888
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,660
I've seen a lot of horror movies from Japan.

1889
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,180
When I saw the horror movie from Japan, I thought it was a little moist.

1890
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:08,000
I was like that when I saw the horror movie from Japan.

1891
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,140
It was another level.

1892
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,560
What was it?

1893
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:16,280
But in horror movies, that comes out a lot?

1894
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:16,980
It comes out a lot.

1895
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,000
In a horror movie.

1896
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:19,740
In a drama.

1897
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,100
It is said to give something.

1898
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,340
It is said to give something.

1899
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:26,640
Anything.

1900
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:27,400
Anything.

1901
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:29,820
Answer!

1902
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:31,560
Give meaning.

1903
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:32,740
What?

1904
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:33,800
Give meaning.

1905
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,300
That's right.

1906
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,640
Thailand's horror movie is the best.

1907
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,280
Really?

1908
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:44,160
What?

1909
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:45,780
What do you mean?

1910
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,100
We are a Buddhist country.

1911
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,260
We believe in folk religions.

1912
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,620
That's right.

1913
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:57,720
For example, we have different colors on each day.

1914
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:58,380
It's meaningful.

1915
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,880
Monday is yellow.

1916
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,940
It means authority and trust.

1917
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,580
And Tuesday is pink.

1918
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,280
Love and friendship.

1919
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,120
That's right.

1920
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:10,840
It's good to have on a date.

1921
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:11,600
You have to write it down.

1922
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,400
What day is the date in Thailand?

1923
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:16,760
Tuesday.

1924
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,900
So as soon as I was born,

1925
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,480
Since I was born on Thursday,

1926
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:24,460
Orange is my personal color.

1927
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,940
Do you know what day I was born on?

1928
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,000
Do you know what day I was born on?

1929
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,100
But can't you know?

1930
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,860
I remember.

1931
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,440
Thursday!

1932
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:35,920
Really?

1933
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,480
Thursday?

1934
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:41,320
I know it's Thursday, but I remember.

1935
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:43,360
Do you remember?

1936
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,180
Yes, I do.

1937
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,000
But I want to say one more thing.

1938
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,020
I came from Bangkok.

1939
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,160
Bangkok.

1940
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,860
So the name of Bangkok is

1941
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:56,200
the longest name in the world.

1942
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:56,880
It's a city.

1943
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:57,800
Isn't it two letters?

1944
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,520
It's very cute in Thai.

1945
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:02,460
Really?

1946
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,080
I don't know.

1947
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,200
We only know Bangkok.

1948
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:07,320
We only know Bangkok.

1949
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,420
Actually, other than English...

1950
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:11,560
The name is very long, so wait a minute.

1951
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:12,760
Are you ready?

1952
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,660
Wait a minute.

1953
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,500
This is too much.

1954
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:17,920
It's too much.

1955
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:21,520
Here we go.

1956
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:23,480
Don't all Koreans memorize it?

1957
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,320
Can you do it in one breath?

1958
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,500
Count it.

1959
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:28,300
Start!

1960
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:37,820
Start!

1961
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:51,760
You're so cute.

1962
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,040
You're a good singer.

1963
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,080
Can you say something to the taxi driver?

1964
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:56,860
I go out of the car anyway.

1965
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,420
Minnie's Thai name was a little long.

1966
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,360
Because the meaning is a lot of good meaning.

1967
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:05,920
My name is a little short.

1968
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,200
Ni chayon tararak.

1969
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,300
Yeontararak?

1970
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:10,660
Yeontararak!

1971
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,040
Yeontararak?

1972
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,580
Clean and pure.

1973
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,860
What a cool name.

1974
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,960
It's a long name, so when you're born,

1975
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,600
your parents will give you a nickname.

1976
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,800
It must be very difficult to register in Korea.

1977
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,140
It's really difficult for foreigners.

1978
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,320
It's really difficult for foreigners.

1979
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:36,280
What's Leo's full name?

1980
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:39,620
Lanta Leo Laino.

1981
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:40,540
Laino?

1982
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,460
Lanta is

1983
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:45,820
beach.

1984
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,800
Leo is lion.

1985
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,660
Lion on the beach.

1986
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,140
Laino is a couple's name.

1987
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:57,280
All names have meanings.

1988
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,320
Shakura also said

1989
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,320
cherry blossoms in spring.

1990
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:04,660
I am called Yonatan.

1991
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,580
In the Bible,

1992
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:07,980
David's friend is named Yonatan.

1993
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:09,660
David is from the Bible.

1994
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,220
I helped David a lot.

1995
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,140
I wanted to help others.

1996
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,640
I did Jonathan.

1997
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,800
I became a high school student.

1998
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,040
So I named myself

1999
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:21,540
in Chinese characters.

2000
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,420
How?

2001
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,300
I named myself Doljo.

2002
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,120
Really?

2003
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:28,820
It's Chinese characters.

2004
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:30,240
It's cool.

2005
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:33,480
You are short-sighted.

2006
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,720
I didn't ask for help.

2007
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,280
I am sorry.

2008
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,040
How many times do you have to do this?

2009
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:44,100
It's a big deal.

2010
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,180
Should we move to our next character?

2011
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:46,320
Let's go with Alda.

2012
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,360
Venetian is

2013
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,460
the best.

2014
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,360
We have to call most of them.

2015
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:55,840
This is our hometown.

2016
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,660
I've been there.

2017
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,380
I love it.

2018
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:04,980
Benetia is the best.

2019
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:07,600
There are too many bests.

2020
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:10,540
Benetia is the best.

2021
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:11,760
The best is the best.

2022
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:11,900
Oh...

2023
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:15,140
Oh...

2024
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:16,460
The best is the best.

2025
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:19,140
Please change the answer.

2026
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:21,500
LOL

2027
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,360
Leo!

2028
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,700
Leo, you throw it.

2029
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:29,140
The best is the best.

2030
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:31,180
If you think it's weird, you should finish it.

2031
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:35,920
Benetia, what's weird?

2032
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:36,780
I'm thinking.

2033
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,320
Is it a city on top of the water?

2034
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:42,540
I think there is only one in the world.

2035
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:44,180
Right.

2036
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:48,540
They connected 400 islands and built a building on top of the water.

2037
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,220
Justin!

2038
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,780
Public transportation.

2039
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,460
What is that?

2040
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:55,760
Public transportation.

2041
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:57,520
It's the sun.

2042
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,560
Public transportation.

2043
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:01,880
Public transportation.

2044
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,060
Why is it so weird?

2045
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:04,920
Why is it so weird?

2046
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,380
Why is it so weird?

2047
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:09,700
Because...

2048
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,120
Can you stop the lens?

2049
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,500
There is no car, but you can ride a gondola.

2050
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,340
Right, you can ride a boat.

2051
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,440
There are two public transports.

2052
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,820
Water bus and water taxi.

2053
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:24,340
Wow.

2054
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,200
That's amazing.

2055
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,500
There is only one on top of the water.

2056
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,000
If there is a subway, water can come in.

2057
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:29,540
That's right.

2058
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,580
It's not even public transportation.

2059
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,120
It's like going to school.

2060
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,860
There is a private boat.

2061
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,100
It's like a car.

2062
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:39,340
It's like a car.

2063
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,820
Those who are a little late can do snorkeling.

2064
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:42,920
LOL

2065
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,620
LOL

2066
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:48,960
The answer hasn't come out yet.

2067
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,180
It hasn't come out yet.

2068
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,140
Something you can eat?

2069
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,140
Something you can eat.

2070
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:53,500
Really?

2071
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,960
Gelato.

2072
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:56,440
Gelato is delicious.

2073
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,180
Is it pasta?

2074
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:07,760
You can eat it, but no matter how much you eat, you won't be full.

2075
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,000
Chocolate.

2076
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:09,740
Konjac.

2077
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,160
Wait a minute.

2078
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:11,940
Konjac.

2079
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:12,800
Wait a minute.

2080
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,760
Don't talk about diet food.

2081
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,640
Konjac.

2082
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:21,540
Leo.

2083
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,260
I'm not interested in losing weight.

2084
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,040
If that's the case, it's konjac.

2085
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:26,400
Konjac.

2086
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,020
I don't think it's eating.

2087
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:29,960
It's not eating like this.

2088
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:31,420
I think it's getting something.

2089
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:32,520
It's like aging.

2090
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,440
Isn't aging the best?

2091
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,100
Wow, correct.

2092
01:23:39,955 --> 01:23:41,340
Jonathan, this is the second correct answer.

2093
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,280
In Venice, cussing is the best.

2094
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,040
Cussing is the best.

2095
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:46,540
Correct.

2096
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,120
Wow.

2097
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:52,940
Really?

2098
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:56,240
Wait a minute. Venice is the best here.

2099
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:56,760
Why?

2100
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,560
It's a characteristic of Italy.

2101
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,040
It hasn't been long since Italy was unified.

2102
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:03,940
It was unified in 1861.

2103
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,480
In the past, it was all urban states.

2104
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,360
So there are a lot of languages.

2105
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:10,740
In Venice, there are also different words.

2106
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:14,040
There is a characteristic of Venice.

2107
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:14,800
It's so funny.

2108
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:17,820
When you go to Venice by boat or by walking,

2109
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:20,060
you have to move quickly.

2110
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,300
So you have to speak fast.

2111
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:23,800
For example,

2112
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:24,660
Hello.

2113
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:26,260
Is everything okay?

2114
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,100
We say,

2115
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:29,560
The end.

2116
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,380
Wow.

2117
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,220
It's so fast.

2118
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:35,660
But what's funny is that it's so fast,

2119
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,220
but you want the other person to hear it.

2120
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:40,220
Right.

2121
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:41,600
You have to hear it.

2122
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:44,760
Because when you ride a boat,

2123
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,040
you can't hear it because your stomach is too short.

2124
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:47,700
If the boat is too short,

2125
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,840
you can't hear it.

2126
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:51,420
You can't hear it.

2127
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,020
So people in Venice...

2128
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:56,460
I think swear words are the most common in the world.

2129
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:58,100
I'm curious.

2130
01:24:58,615 --> 01:25:00,420
If you get angry while riding a boat,

2131
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:01,340
You can't hear it.

2132
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,800
I think it's longer than the name of Bangkok.

2133
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:10,980
It's similar to the name of Bangkok.

2134
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,900
So if you go to Venice,

2135
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:15,520
you can't hear it,

2136
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,860
but someone is talking for a long time.

2137
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:17,840
That's swearing.

2138
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:22,020
Why do you talk to us so long?

2139
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:22,900
Do we like it?

2140
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:24,100
It's swearing.

2141
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,800
You just have to listen to the tone.

2142
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:29,700
If you just listen to the tone, you'll know.

2143
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,680
If you get angry.

2144
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:35,180
There are a lot of terms for swearing in each country.

2145
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,020
There's something else.

2146
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:37,680
There's something else.

2147
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,220
In Korea,

2148
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,140
swearing is weaker than in Korea.

2149
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,660
Oh, it's simple.

2150
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:45,120
It's the worst.

2151
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:45,960
If you say,

2152
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,000
It's a pig.

2153
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,020
Is it the worst?

2154
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,180
If we say,

2155
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,260
I'm a pig.

2156
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,000
I'm a pig.

2157
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:58,680
It's cute.

2158
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:00,580
But when we came to Korea,

2159
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,200
the couple at the cafe said,

2160
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:03,840
I'm a pig.

2161
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,260
I was shocked.

2162
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:10,200
It's the worst.

2163
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,620
It's the worst.

2164
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:12,920
The worst thing.

2165
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:14,960
There's something called Ebembe.

2166
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,720
That's your grave.

2167
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:19,540
You're going to die.

2168
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:20,460
Die.

2169
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,020
But in Korea,

2170
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:23,760
We're going to kill each other.

2171
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,280
I'm going to kill you.

2172
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,440
I'm going to kill you.

2173
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:32,000
I'm going to kill you.

2174
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,480
There was something like this.

2175
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:34,520
I was surprised.

2176
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,380
I thought we should raise the level of this country.

2177
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,720
Leo, do you have anything to say about Finland?

2178
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:41,100
Finland?

2179
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:42,800
In Finland,

2180
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:45,220
You have to swear for a long time.

2181
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,060
It's not a long word.

2182
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,920
The pronunciation of the word is long.

2183
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,240
The longer it gets,

2184
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:51,960
The stronger it gets.

2185
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,600
Can you show us?

2186
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:56,480
If you say,

2187
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,140
If you say,

2188
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:00,500
If you say,

2189
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:01,680
If you say,

2190
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:07,620
If it gets a little stronger,

2191
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:09,220
It goes up to the bottom.

2192
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:09,600
How?

2193
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:13,600
Is this a swear word?

2194
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,320
Then what?

2195
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,420
You have to give me the answer.

2196
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:19,860
If you look at the answer in this program,

2197
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:20,540
What are you going to do?

2198
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:21,860
This is a swear word.

2199
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,540
There are a lot of Koreans.

2200
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:27,300
When people in Finland go to a high-speed railroad,

2201
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,160
It goes up to the bottom.

2202
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,500
Are they being cursed?

2203
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:34,340
It's a dragon.

2204
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,280
How long does it sound?

2205
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,520
Oh, that's a lot of people.

2206
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:38,740
That's a lot of people.

2207
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,120
Then when you go to a place like Finland,

2208
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:43,260
When you say Sakura,

2209
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,300
The pronunciation is like this.

2210
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,080
Sakura?

2211
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:50,600
I can't even pronounce my name.

2212
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,660
I'm Yontararak.

2213
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,160
This is just one-to-one.

2214
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:57,660
Sakura?

2215
01:27:58,840 --> 01:27:59,560
Yontararak?

2216
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,060
Leo was surprised earlier.

2217
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:02,820
Yontararak.

2218
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:05,980
It's a little strong in Thai.

2219
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:06,540
Really?

2220
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,300
Just say B.

2221
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,180
S***

2222
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,080
S***

2223
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:12,660
S***

2224
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,400
S***

2225
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:20,680
But the pronunciation is strong.

2226
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,220
I feel bad.

2227
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,960
The tone changes again.

2228
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,360
It's the same all over the world.

2229
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,800
The tone changes when you swear.

2230
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,520
So when a foreigner learns a foreign language,

2231
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:31,920
I don't think you should swear.

2232
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:33,140
I don't know.

2233
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:36,100
There's a nuance that only native people know.

2234
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:37,460
That's right.

2235
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,160
It's really hard.

2236
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,280
You have to learn the tone and culture first.

2237
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,080
If you go there and learn how to swear because you feel good,

2238
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,180
you can have a big fight.

2239
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:47,700
Next,

2240
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:49,340
Chanyeol is ready.

2241
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:53,800
America is the best.

2242
01:28:58,470 --> 01:28:59,540
America is...

2243
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:00,360
Freedom.

2244
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:03,500
Hip hop.

2245
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:05,520
Hip hop is the best.

2246
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:06,480
Sports.

2247
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:09,240
Sports?

2248
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,060
The heavenly music

2249
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:11,100
Law?

2250
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,240
Freestyling?

2251
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,680
That's right.

2252
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:16,640
Say it.

2253
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,360
We don't even have time for it.

2254
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:32,480
Visit

2255
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:33,800
You're talking more comfortably.

2256
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:34,140
Let's start talking.

2257
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,300
I'm super started.

2258
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:38,220
Is this what we heard?

2259
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,520
Special law.

2260
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:42,500
Special Law!

2261
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:45,260
Special Law!

2262
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:48,100
Special Law is the best.

2263
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:54,260
Do you know how many states we live in?

2264
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,240
Each state has a different law.

2265
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,380
So there are many special laws.

2266
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,780
Let me give you an example.

2267
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,900
For example, when you walk in Hawaii, you will lose your cell phone.

2268
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:05,380
I didn't know that.

2269
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:35,500
I'm going to eat it.

2270
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,120
It's red.

2271
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:39,440
It's red.

2272
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:42,820
If someone farted, I'll sue you.

2273
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,580
I can't do that.

2274
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:46,160
I can't do that.

2275
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:48,320
And there's a time to relax.

2276
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:49,460
What?

2277
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,820
It's like an alarm.

2278
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:56,140
I think you're in danger.

2279
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,140
Be careful and don't be uncomfortable with each other.

2280
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,440
Be careful.

2281
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:02,520
There's another unique way to cook.

2282
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,640
In the summer,

2283
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,120
we all go to the beach.

2284
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,940
We wear bikinis and swimsuits

2285
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:08,660
and go to the beach.

2286
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,900
We can't swim in the beach,

2287
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:12,940
but we can go to the city.

2288
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:16,120
I went to the city wearing a swimsuit.

2289
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:18,600
But the problem was

2290
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,400
that there was a car accident.

2291
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:21,120
Why?

2292
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,960
I think you're looking at me too much.

2293
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,560
Min is wearing a bikini.

2294
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:30,580
So,

2295
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:33,500
in the city by the sea,

2296
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,580
it is forbidden to go to the city

2297
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:36,000
wearing a swimsuit.

2298
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:38,020
Because it's not a continuous car accident.

2299
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,640
Excuse me,

2300
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:46,540
if I can make a law,

2301
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,400
is there a law

2302
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,600
that you want to make?

2303
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:51,940
What law?

2304
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:52,780
Wait a minute.

2305
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,720
Show us the law of parting in a day.

2306
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:00,060
At least 5 days.

2307
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,140
I like it.

2308
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:03,660
The law of parting in a day.

2309
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:05,020
The law of parting in a day.

2310
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:07,780
How about 100 days?

2311
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,640
100 days is too much.

2312
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:13,420
It's too much.

2313
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:14,620
So,

2314
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:17,500
it's the minimum term of dating.

2315
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,840
Then, how many days?

2316
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,200
The minimum term of dating.

2317
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:24,460
I think it's one week.

2318
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:25,540
One week.

2319
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:26,700
That's a long time.

2320
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,940
3 days! 3 days!

2321
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:31,640
Because that person also said that they were going to date by mistake.

2322
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,880
And then the next day they were like...

2323
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:36,680
But on the day of the 6th, they were like...

2324
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:37,380
It's okay.

2325
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:38,940
That's how it is.

2326
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,480
So they look at the weekdays and the weekends.

2327
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,180
7 days.

2328
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:44,640
7 days, okay.

2329
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:50,540
So exactly on Sunday, at 11.59, we will announce the date.

2330
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:51,420
Okay, we will announce it.

2331
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,620
We will use the minimum date guarantee method.

2332
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,140
We will meet each other for about 7 days.

2333
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:01,120
I think Jonathan didn't get a single kiss in a day.

2334
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:03,740
No, it's not like that.

2335
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:12,040
I want to make a really small law.

2336
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:14,180
Make it now.

2337
01:33:14,405 --> 01:33:17,360
I want to make a law that allows me to read the script more.

2338
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:31,880
This is the first time I've seen this kind of text book.

2339
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:33,760
This is a traditional Korean text book.

2340
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,840
It's so cool, but this time it's for foreigners.

2341
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,140
When I first learned, I didn't learn this.

2342
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:42,920
It was so difficult.

2343
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:43,680
That's right.

2344
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:53,140
If you didn't understand this, change it to a law.

2345
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:57,340
All writers, don't write a text book.

2346
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:59,580
Change it to a law.

2347
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:01,700
There are a lot of good laws.

2348
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:04,380
There are also a lot of personal laws.

2349
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:12,000
We will show you a special law for foreign languages.

2350
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,460
We will announce the best student today.

2351
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,000
The best student today is...

2352
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,240
Wow, you got a lot of questions right.

2353
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:23,700
Jo Lala!

2354
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:30,740
It's a gold badge.

2355
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:44,460
It's a good thing.

2356
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:45,680
It's our first time in the new semester.

2357
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:47,800
It's a good thing that we got to know each other in different countries.

2358
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:49,320
We did a great job in the international exam.

2359
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:52,940
I'm so happy to receive this precious badge.

2360
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:54,280
I'm hungry.

2361
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:55,400
I'll get the next one.

2362
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:56,580
You're shining so much.

2363
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:03,320
And we will arrange a scholarship of 250,000 won.

2364
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,560
Until the day we go to the university we know.

2365
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,020
Go go! Let's go!

2366
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:13,840
Good job!

2367
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:14,240
It's a gold badge!

2368
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,120
It's a gold badge!

2369
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:17,500
Let's go.

2370
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,320
They will hold a lecture to choose the best student.

2371
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,280
I can do anything.

2372
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:27,500
Of course.

2373
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,800
Everybody, look back.

2374
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:32,060
Look back?

2375
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:33,920
This is my leadership.

2376
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:38,180
I will let you off the hook.

2377
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:38,860
What if I win a lottery?

2378
