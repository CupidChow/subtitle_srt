1
00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:02,599
I miss you.

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,399
I miss you.

3
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:15,359
How have you been?

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:16,459
I've been good.

5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:17,509
This week...

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:19,639
She said she had her hair done.

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,139
You did?

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,259
No, I didn't.

9
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:23,319
I've been doing this for a week.

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:24,669
Looking at the winter...

11
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:25,819
Do I have to do it too?

12
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:26,079
You have to do it.

13
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,559
It's okay, right?

14
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,199
It's a balloon.

15
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:30,699
Is it okay?

16
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:31,339
It's a balloon.

17
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,499
No, it's not.

18
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:34,579
I think I have a problem because of you.

19
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:40,899
You're late today, Minnie.

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,319
Why did you come so early?

21
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:45,599
Minnie, I'm sorry, but can you close the door? It's cold.

22
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,499
Do you know what people like this say about us?

23
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,859
Hey, were you born on a boat?

24
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:51,619
Why?

25
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:52,619
We're from Venice.

26
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:54,679
There's no door on the boat.

27
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:56,779
There's no door on the boat.

28
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,959
So the person who came in with the door closed said,

29
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,119
Hey, were you born on a boat?

30
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:01,059
Were you born on a boat?

31
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:04,779
Wait a minute, but didn't Sakura come?

32
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:07,219
Where did she go?

33
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:09,699
After the last time, Justin kept asking me to eat soondae soup.

34
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:12,279
Soondae soup?

35
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,999
I hate soondae the most.

36
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,199
It wasn't me.

37
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,899
From today, everyone will know.

38
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,019
Hey, but you hate soondae that much?

39
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,979
Who is it?

40
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:29,519
Who is it?

41
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,659
Oh, it's Justin!

42
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,939
Please, man!

43
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,839
It's Justin!

44
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,019
It's him!

45
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:53,239
It's him!

46
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:57,219
What is this?

47
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,959
What do you mean, what is this?

48
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:00,879
It was cool.

49
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:01,919
Welcome.

50
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:06,099
By the way, teacher, were you born on a boat?

51
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:07,539
On a boat?

52
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,999
No, no.

53
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:09,679
He closed the door.

54
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,539
He was too focused on dancing.

55
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,979
I always have your logo song, everyone.

56
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,719
But teacher, does the song change every time?

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:20,739
It changes every time.

58
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,119
Because the songs that have a boom in the music industry are all amazing.

59
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,559
Really.

60
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:27,539
But how many songs have a boom?

61
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,979
There are a lot of them.

62
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:30,739
But they are all old songs.

63
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,919
Only the old teacher can't make a hit.

64
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,519
Teacher, but this week, Sakura...

65
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:38,999
Sakura?

66
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,879
There is a rumor that she already quit school.

67
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:42,999
Isn't it too late?

68
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:44,519
She told me in advance.

69
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,479
She said she has field training.

70
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,519
I want to go too.

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,159
There was a line.

72
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,839
Can I go if I apply?

73
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,899
You can go if you apply.

74
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,899
If there is an overseas performance or overseas activity, our school will actively send you.

75
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:02,219
You can apply, but I don't think you have any overseas activities.

76
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:07,119
I think I can apply forever if I apply once.

77
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,819
I think I can apply forever if I apply once.

78
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,299
We do our best in domestic activities.

79
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,339
Will you be back next week?

80
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:12,879
I'll be back next week.

81
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:15,939
Don't worry.

82
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,419
If you come next week, don't talk about Sundae.

83
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:17,879
Don't talk about Sundae.

84
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,139
Is there an empty seat today?

85
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,919
We don't have an empty seat.

86
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:28,599
Because there are so many friends who are waiting for T.O. to be born.

87
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:29,939
Don't you wait for your younger brother?

88
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:31,979
He said there is no hope.

89
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:34,119
It's a mess now.

90
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,819
Leo, do you know what T.O. means?

91
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:38,839
T.O.

92
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,039
Timetable?

93
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,639
Isn't it D.T.?

94
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,279
D.T.

95
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:44,999
I don't know either.

96
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:45,619
Do you have T.O.?

97
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:47,259
T.O.

98
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,219
T.O.?

99
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,199
Our teacher doesn't know.

100
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,579
She doesn't know 100%.

101
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,499
What is T.O.?

102
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,879
I know!

103
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,079
T.O.

104
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,299
I know!

105
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:09,279
What is T.O.?

106
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,459
T.O. is

107
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,559
Table of Organization.

108
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:15,499
T.O. is Table of Organization.

109
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:16,699
I did well, didn't I?

110
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:19,319
We heard that T.O. was born.

111
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:21,799
And we have another friend.

112
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:23,919
Really?

113
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:25,239
Yes, we had an audition.

114
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,899
It was the 3rd audition.

115
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:28,259
3rd?

116
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:29,059
4th?

117
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,679
Since Park Hoon is Japanese, only Japanese people had an audition.

118
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:35,099
Yes, T.O. was born in a Japanese seat.

119
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:35,699
Ah, okay.

120
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:37,919
Really?

121
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:38,579
Are you nervous?

122
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,879
Who else is there in other countries?

123
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:47,759
Is there anyone else in Korea?

124
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,979
Can we replace him?

125
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:53,799
Since Nagyung is Korean, I think she can replace him.

126
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:54,659
For now,

127
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:55,299
she's his sister.

128
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,739
No, I read the comments.

129
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,119
There are 3 Korean people.

130
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,279
One, two, three.

131
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,159
Don't look at the comments.

132
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:11,859
A friend who just arrived from abroad.

133
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,159
Please come in!

134
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,519
Why is the door locked?

135
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:38,139
Hello!

136
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:49,719
Hello, I'm Tsuki from Osaka.

137
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:53,739
I heard T.O. is here today.

138
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,279
So I'm here to say hi.

139
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,499
Please take a seat.

140
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:11,419
Tsuki!

141
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,279
Tsuki, we have to do this.

142
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,979
Do you know Tsuki?

143
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,319
Tsuki and I are close.

144
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,319
We did Zootyverse together.

145
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,199
We did a lot of music activities together.

146
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,139
Don't look at me.

147
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,979
I think I'm one of the reasons why you came to Korea.

148
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:36,579
What?

149
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,179
I don't know what to say.

150
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:45,279
I'm here because you're here.

151
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:47,459
I heard it's a good school.

152
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,179
I'm a teacher.

153
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,719
So I feel reassured.

154
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,779
I'm a teacher.

155
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,739
Tsuki, if you're here, I'm a teacher.

156
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,619
I think you're close with Jennie.

157
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,779
We went to a snack bar after school.

158
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:07,399
That's right.

159
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,999
We ate Tteokbokki.

160
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,619
Who's here for the first time?

161
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:14,559
Me!

162
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:17,779
Hello!

163
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,059
We're all friends.

164
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:26,579
I'm so happy.

165
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:31,719
They're all students.

166
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:35,419
This is a prestigious school.

167
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,159
We took the exam on the first day.

168
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:39,899
Tsuki, are you good at studying?

169
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,299
I'm pretty good.

170
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:47,619
I'm not good at everything.

171
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,059
I'm good at art and language.

172
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,959
I'm good at math and art.

173
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:58,119
How are you so good at studying?

174
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,379
I came to Korea when I was 13 years old.

175
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:07,099
I cut off contact with my mom.

176
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,079
If Sakura's mom hears this, she'll be in trouble.

177
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,659
I really wanted to be good at Korean.

178
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,159
So I told my mom not to contact me until I contacted her.

179
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,439
So I didn't contact her for a few months.

180
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:29,839
That's amazing.

181
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,819
Tsuki, let's have a class.

182
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:33,459
Okay!

183
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,899
Let's start the class!

184
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,339
Let's do a test.

185
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,119
Do you remember what you learned last time?

186
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,699
What did we do last time?

187
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:55,219
Since it's the first day, there are so many things you don't know about each other.

188
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,519
Relationship.

189
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,699
Self-introduction at school.

190
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,819
What did we do last time?

191
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:06,719
Already?

192
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:08,879
No, no, no!

193
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,239
Leadership!

194
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:17,279
No, not today!

195
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:22,219
Teacher, you're bothering me!

196
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,739
Don't do that.

197
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,279
Do you remember?

198
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,179
What we learned last time was relationship.

199
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,439
Relationship.

200
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,879
I was going to say that!

201
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:43,779
But I got confused because you kept talking about leadership.

202
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:46,679
You can call your teacher after this.

203
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:49,839
I thought you were going to say that.

204
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:58,799
Let's look at the board.

205
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:01,619
Leadership!

206
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:07,599
We're going to learn about leadership today.

207
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:10,739
Jennie, what do you think leadership is?

208
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:12,679
I think it's me.

209
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,939
I think it's me.

210
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,699
Jennie, what are you talking about?

211
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,859
I think leadership is no joke.

212
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,899
What does it have to do with leadership?

213
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:30,899
Dance leadership!

214
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,779
This leadership is not dance leadership.

215
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:33,899
You have to know exactly.

216
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:39,779
In Harvard, MIT, and Ivy League,

217
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,239
grades are important,

218
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,839
but it's also important to have a good relationship with your students,

219
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:48,199
and to show leadership towards your goals.

220
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:55,079
In our school, in our class,

221
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:56,859
and in your group meetings,

222
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:59,139
leadership is very important.

223
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,919
Today, we are going to learn about leadership.

224
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:15,859
First, let's talk about what we think leadership is.

225
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:22,439
There was a famous Jamaican scholar.

226
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:27,859
The boss is the person in front of you.

227
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:30,519
But leadership is the person at the back.

228
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,019
I saw this picture.

229
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:38,619
There's a meme about this, right?

230
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,119
There's a meme about this, right?

231
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:41,739
It's on Instagram.

232
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:45,459
Once again, the boss is the person in front of you.

233
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:47,739
The boss is the person in front of you.

234
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,799
But the real leader is the person at the back.

235
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:51,619
Then what about the people in the middle?

236
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:55,139
Just...

237
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:55,879
The people who are stuck.

238
00:11:56,739 --> 00:11:57,439
The people who are stuck.

239
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,379
Just the people in the middle?

240
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:02,499
Don't bring anything weird from social media.

241
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,079
You are learning it roughly.

242
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,419
The people in the middle are the most important.

243
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:09,959
The people who are at the back are the most important.

244
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,959
What do you think, Minnie?

245
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:12,919
Leadership is...

246
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,779
What I think leadership is...

247
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,659
First, you have your own thoughts.

248
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,759
And you can lead other people.

249
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,139
And you can lead other people.

250
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:24,719
I think a person who is good at something is a person with leadership.

251
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:26,959
Please give her a round of applause.

252
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,299
Don't just bring anything from social media.

253
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,479
Don't just bring anything from social media.

254
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:37,519
You have to come out from your heart.

255
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,299
That's a good thing.

256
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,219
What about Jennie?

257
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:44,359
I think it's the teacher.

258
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,479
The teacher is our leadership.

259
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:49,439
Please give her a round of applause.

260
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,179
Because she dances for us.

261
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,459
Jennie likes it when people dance for her.

262
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:02,899
She likes it the most when I enter the classroom.

263
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:04,959
She is good at dancing.

264
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,839
A person who leads others.

265
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:08,599
A person who leads others.

266
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:09,759
A person who leads others.

267
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:10,779
Leo.

268
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:12,679
Oh, she is getting ready to react.

269
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:15,459
Get ready to clap.

270
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:16,279
She is getting ready to clap.

271
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:16,859
She is getting ready to clap.

272
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,419
What do you think leadership is?

273
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,139
I think it's abstract.

274
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:25,159
If the members are one color,

275
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:29,919
the leader is a person who creates a rainbow with the colors.

276
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,439
A person who creates a rainbow.

277
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,799
Rainbow! Rainbow! Rainbow!

278
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,779
Rainbow! Rainbow! Rainbow!

279
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,019
Rainbow! Rainbow! Rainbow!

280
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,079
Rainbow! Rainbow! Rainbow!

281
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,159
Rainbow! Rainbow! Rainbow!

282
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,079
It's so cool. It's emotional.

283
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,599
A person who creates a rainbow with the colors.

284
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:07,019
It could be just a color,

285
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,579
but if you make it into one, it can become a rainbow.

286
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:12,199
A person who creates a rainbow with the colors.

287
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:14,339
Leo is so cool.

288
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,339
Rainbow.

289
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,799
Everyone, who became the president of the United States recently?

290
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:28,779
Trump.

291
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:31,499
As Trump became the president of the United States,

292
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:33,519
the whole world is paying attention to him.

293
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,519
Albert, do you know why the president of the United States is so sensitive?

294
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,339
In my opinion, the U.S. economy is the biggest.

295
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:45,299
According to the GDP, the U.S. is overwhelmingly number one.

296
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,439
And the U.S. stock market is the biggest.

297
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,339
So there's a saying.

298
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,759
If the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold.

299
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:57,379
If the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold.

300
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:00,979
That's a really cool saying.

301
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:03,839
That's a really cool saying.

302
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,839
If the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold.

303
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:17,599
That's how powerful the U.S. economy is.

304
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:20,179
So we have no choice but to pay attention to the U.S. economy.

305
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:22,019
I think he'll be number one in the mid-term.

306
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,659
Is this a test?

307
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:28,659
No, no. I'm just sharing what Albert knows.

308
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:35,599
That's why it's so important to choose a leader.

309
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:41,899
Who do you think is a real leader?

310
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:43,919
Is there anyone who you think is a good leader?

311
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:50,459
I think Bob Marley is a good leader.

312
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,059
I used to like him as a singer.

313
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,339
One day, I went to Italy and saw a documentary about Bob Marley on the plane.

314
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:07,599
What was impressive was that in 1976, Bob Marley was in London for a concert.

315
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:10,479
He was in the middle of a war in Jamaica.

316
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:15,119
The people were fighting and killing each other.

317
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,599
As soon as Bob Marley arrived, he was shot and almost died.

318
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:25,319
Bob Marley almost died, but he had a concert.

319
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:28,119
Anyone can die.

320
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:30,279
A rich and famous person can die.

321
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:34,679
But Bob Marley was in the middle of a war in Korea, and he had to do something.

322
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:38,579
So in 1978, he decided to have a concert in Jamaica.

323
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:43,059
But he broke his promise.

324
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:47,799
He said he was going to have a concert, but he had to see the concert of the national team and the labor team.

325
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,939
He said he had to see the concert of the national team and the labor team.

326
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:56,279
So I was singing, and I suddenly called the leader of the labor team.

327
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:58,179
Come up to the stage.

328
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:00,459
So I shook his hand in front of everyone.

329
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,959
I risked my life for the people.

330
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,639
I saw him on the plane and he cried a lot.

331
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,819
Leo, get up.

332
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,279
Justin, get up.

333
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,279
Let's shake hands.

334
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,859
Let's shake hands.

335
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:27,659
Let's shake hands.

336
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,579
The best leader.

337
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,359
The best leader.

338
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,639
Bob Marley.

339
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:42,379
Bob Marley.

340
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:44,579
Bob Marley.

341
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:45,919
Bob Marley.

342
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:50,079
Bob Marley.

343
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,259
Don't fight.

344
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:54,219
Don't fight.

345
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:02,819
I'm curious about Minnie's leader.

346
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,799
Do you have an impressive leader?

347
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,179
I have members.

348
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,199
I have a team called I-DLE.

349
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:12,999
But the leader of our team is Hoyeon.

350
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,439
She's the best leader.

351
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:16,919
I have a team.

352
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,799
And the best thing we've done recently is that we all re-contracted.

353
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,899
Thanks to Soyeon, we were able to re-contract.

354
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,759
I think she's a good leader.

355
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:42,019
I heard you're charismatic and scary.

356
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:44,979
That's obvious.

357
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,739
I think it's obvious.

358
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,779
Because all the members in our team are F.

359
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,459
But Soyeon is the only T.

360
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:04,699
At first, I didn't know what it was, but I explained it like this.

361
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:08,679
I think it's right to do this.

362
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:09,619
Trust me.

363
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:14,079
We really need a leader.

364
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:18,379
There are people who point out the key points when they talk.

365
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,439
There are people who go to the mountains.

366
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,019
It's a prayer.

367
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,779
But there are places where I can be a leader.

368
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:28,719
Where is that?

369
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:30,839
Me! School.

370
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:34,059
There is a class president.

371
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:37,819
What is the class president in English?

372
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:39,419
Class president.

373
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:42,659
Class president.

374
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:49,139
This is really important in the United States.

375
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:53,719
If you become a class president, it's really hard to enter a university.

376
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:55,699
I have leadership.

377
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,199
I have a title.

378
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,879
No, I think it's the same in Japan.

379
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,319
Does anyone have experience?

380
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:06,339
I have.

381
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:06,959
Be honest.

382
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,839
What do you mean by being honest?

383
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:12,819
Do you really have experience?

384
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:14,279
I have experience, but it was limited.

385
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:16,819
It's the class president on a Sunday.

386
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:20,859
Wait a minute. What happens to the class president on a Sunday?

387
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,599
There are classes from Monday to Friday.

388
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:26,239
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

389
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:26,979
It's all different?

390
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:27,719
It's all different.

391
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,039
This is just a number.

392
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:30,559
This is not official.

393
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:30,839
This is just a number.

394
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:33,639
This is not an official class president.

395
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:34,739
This is not official.

396
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,599
Monday is my day.

397
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:39,999
It's a good day.

398
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,559
And then I was in charge of walking my cell phone.

399
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,099
Are you in charge of walking your cell phone?

400
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,539
Everyone doesn't want to walk their cell phone.

401
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:54,179
Sometimes there are friends like that team in our school.

402
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,199
These friends hate to give their cell phones.

403
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:58,359
Because?

404
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,559
I think they're good at fighting.

405
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:00,279
It's sensitive.

406
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:02,439
But I was popular with those friends.

407
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,739
I was popular with those friends.

408
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,699
And I was popular with those who worked really hard.

409
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,079
The teacher said,

410
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,239
I think you'll be good at the middle role.

411
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:10,779
Try it.

412
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:11,599
Try it?

413
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,179
Yes.

414
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:13,279
Did you do well?

415
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:14,959
I did very well.

416
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,519
But I was fired later.

417
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:17,179
Why?

418
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:19,619
Among them, there are friends who bring two cell phones.

419
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:27,059
There's a really strong friend.

420
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:27,319
There's a really strong friend.

421
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,199
He's a little hard to deal with.

422
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:32,539
He's good at fighting.

423
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:34,379
At first, he said yes.

424
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:35,679
And his eyes were like,

425
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,839
I'm really going to hit you.

426
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,699
I'm really going to hit you.

427
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,219
What should I do if you hit me?

428
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:41,599
I have to move on.

429
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:44,199
So I just said,

430
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:44,959
Okay.

431
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,519
It's okay.

432
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,159
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

433
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,159
But you have to say,

434
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,339
Okay, very brightly.

435
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,159
You have to say it brightly.

436
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:55,779
Okay.

437
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:56,259
Okay.

438
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:57,359
You're not going to do it?

439
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:57,999
Okay.

440
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:00,559
I passed by right away.

441
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:02,039
I got caught by the teacher.

442
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,079
The teacher said I was responsible.

443
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,419
That's right, that's right.

444
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:05,719
I want you to stop here.

445
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,139
Does Justin have a class president experience?

446
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,059
I had it.

447
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:11,259
Really?

448
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:13,579
First of all, we don't have a middle school.

449
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:14,819
There's no middle school?

450
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:15,659
There's no middle school.

451
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:19,779
We have elementary school 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

452
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:21,819
And high school 1 to 5.

453
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:22,739
It's high school right away.

454
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:24,679
High school 1 to 5.

455
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,319
High school 1 to 5.

456
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,039
High school 1 to 5.

457
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:29,299
So we don't have another school.

458
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,459
So have you ever been a class president?

459
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:38,219
So, first of all, since high school 1, it's just a popular vote.

460
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:40,399
It's just a popular vote.

461
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,179
So I just challenged myself and voted.

462
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:46,419
That's when I became a class president.

463
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,179
It's kind of like a penalty vote.

464
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,259
What is it?

465
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:53,839
Leo just said it.

466
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:54,939
What is it?

467
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,639
Me too.

468
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:57,519
What is it?

469
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:57,959
What is it?

470
00:22:58,299 --> 00:22:59,579
You don't know?

471
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,479
I don't know.

472
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,239
Whenever Leo says it, I think he'll say, what is it?

473
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:04,719
Please do it.

474
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,899
Please do it.

475
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:06,999
It's so nice to hear the MC's audio.

476
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:09,159
What is it?

477
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:16,939
Is it Justin?

478
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:17,839
Is it Justin?

479
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:18,499
It's Justin.

480
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,419
He's handsome.

481
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:24,099
He's so cute.

482
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:26,339
He's so cute.

483
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:28,879
At that time, he had a very soft expression.

484
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,199
When I was in middle school, I didn't have a middle school disease.

485
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,239
He was really popular at that time.

486
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:38,939
But the reason why he was popular is because you can't get hit in our country.

487
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:39,839
Why?

488
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,659
The hair is like this.

489
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:43,219
So how much do you want to make a shape?

490
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:44,039
With hair that doesn't exist.

491
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:45,759
Forcibly.

492
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:47,959
Put wax on it and put it up.

493
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:49,599
30 minutes every morning.

494
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,659
At least 30 minutes.

495
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,339
Do you have any privileges as a class president?

496
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:55,279
Just high school students.

497
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,939
I'm just wearing a yellow T-shirt.

498
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,299
But the class president only wears a white T-shirt.

499
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:00,499
Really?

500
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:02,839
When I was the class president, I was a little cool.

501
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:07,759
There are various roles of the class president.

502
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:10,259
Did you have a role at school?

503
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:11,939
In Italy, it's a little different from high school.

504
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,319
We don't have a class president.

505
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:14,839
There is a religious president.

506
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:19,199
Once a year, he goes to school faster than the teachers.

507
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:21,299
So that the teachers can't come in.

508
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:26,419
It's called autogestion.

509
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,239
It means that you have to run the school on your own.

510
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,659
It's like a group meeting.

511
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,379
So I sleep at school for two days.

512
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,779
Because I can't let the teacher come in.

513
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:37,979
Why can't you come in?

514
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:39,739
Because I hate school.

515
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,679
I'm taking over the school.

516
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,459
You're taking over the school.

517
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:43,779
Really.

518
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:48,259
So for a week, the students take classes on their own.

519
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,159
Then you don't have a class.

520
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,679
You can go to the class you want to take.

521
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:52,859
You can play the piano.

522
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,499
You can play the drums.

523
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,019
You can take a massage class.

524
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:57,739
Massage class?

525
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,579
I love it.

526
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:00,379
Whatever the students want.

527
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:02,719
Are you thinking about that at Ahn Eun-hye High School?

528
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:05,859
Jonathan, please leave.

529
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,159
Our school has no power.

530
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:12,259
No power?

531
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:14,059
Yes.

532
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:14,759
The teacher can't come in.

533
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:15,919
It's so much fun.

534
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,079
It's so much fun.

535
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,419
It's so much fun.

536
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:18,999
It's so much fun.

537
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:19,259
It's so much fun.

538
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:21,919
There are so many bad students at school.

539
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,359
From the 1st grade to the 5th grade.

540
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:24,919
They have a lot of good experiences.

541
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,399
I'm telling you to be nervous.

542
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,239
I'm nervous.

543
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:30,739
I'm nervous.

544
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,059
It's a little heavy for you to say that.

545
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,639
But now that we've talked about it,

546
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,579
the class president is really important.

547
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:37,939
Yes, it's important.

548
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:39,099
It's really important.

549
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:39,939
It's important.

550
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,539
Everyone, we're going to start the class now.

551
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,139
What do you think is the flower of democracy?

552
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,179
The flower of democracy?

553
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:48,379
I'll tell you.

554
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:49,579
Isn't it election?

555
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:50,739
Voting.

556
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:51,839
What is election in English?

557
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:52,639
Success?

558
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,399
That's amazing.

559
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:00,919
Tell me what it is.

560
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:02,039
What is it?

561
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,059
Let's say it at the same time.

562
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,099
One, two, three.

563
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:05,699
Election.

564
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:09,019
I've done it before.

565
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:09,979
Election.

566
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:15,519
From now on, the leader of Ahwae High School,

567
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:17,739
in other words, the class president,

568
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,799
will be chosen by the class president.

569
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:30,099
When you become the class president,

570
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:34,779
you will get a big bonus when you go to a university you know.

571
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:35,439
That's amazing.

572
00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:37,539
And you will also get a scholarship.

573
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,459
With a total of 150,000 won,

574
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:42,439
you will also get a gold badge.

575
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,099
We will give it all to the class president.

576
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:47,739
Wait a minute.

577
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,899
Can anyone apply for the class president?

578
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:51,819
We also receive recommendations.

579
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:54,339
You can also recommend it yourself.

580
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,319
You can also recommend it yourself,

581
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:57,419
so I hope you recommend it.

582
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:00,739
I'll start with the impossible one.

583
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:02,999
This person can't do it.

584
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:03,959
This is also important.

585
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:04,979
This person can't do it.

586
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:05,879
This is very important.

587
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:07,999
First of all, Leo can't do it.

588
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:08,739
Why?

589
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,999
Because the class president should know English.

590
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:13,879
Because he's a foreigner.

591
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,239
He can't do it because he's not good at English.

592
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:18,279
So, Leo, pass.

593
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,819
First of all, he can only dance.

594
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:26,379
Wait a minute.

595
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:28,859
Look behind you.

596
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:30,619
Look behind you.

597
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:33,079
No, that's not it.

598
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,379
He just dances a lot,

599
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:38,339
so I don't think he has time to be a leader.

600
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,819
He only dances when he comes.

601
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:43,939
This is fun.

602
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:45,659
In the case of Alfredo,

603
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:48,399
he came from a city that swears a lot.

604
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,439
I think swearing is the best.

605
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:52,919
Why?

606
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:55,219
When he gets angry...

607
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:01,239
Hey!

608
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:04,039
I think he's good at swearing.

609
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,739
In the case of Nado,

610
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:11,239
he hasn't been able to maintain a relationship for more than a day.

611
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,619
It's not even a day.

612
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:18,819
It's half a day.

613
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:20,839
He can't even go on a date with his girlfriend.

614
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:23,919
It's a breakup when he wakes up.

615
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:28,039
It's impossible to maintain a relationship for more than a day.

616
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,879
Now, Minnie.

617
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:31,999
In the case of Minnie...

618
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,379
He's the chairman of the board of directors.

619
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,659
He's the chairman of the board of directors,

620
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:38,679
so he has a lot of talent,

621
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:40,899
and I think he's good at it.

622
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,619
I think he's good at it.

623
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,559
Minnie should recommend him.

624
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:53,719
Sir, this is...

625
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,019
This is...

626
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:58,859
Take the ramen.

627
00:28:58,859 --> 00:28:58,899
Take the ramen.

628
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:01,019
Calm down, calm down.

629
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,139
I'm even sending hearts.

630
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,799
It's uncomfortable to see from the teacher's point of view.

631
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,219
All right.

632
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:11,839
First of all, the member who came out is...

633
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,039
Minnie.

634
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:13,139
Another person's recommendation.

635
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:14,879
You can talk about yourself freely.

636
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:16,739
Just me.

637
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,159
Me.

638
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:21,099
I'm...

639
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:22,439
I'm...

640
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:22,999
Jennie's side.

641
00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:24,299
Jennie's side.

642
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:25,679
Jennie's side.

643
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,059
Because it's a little...

644
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:28,959
A little...

645
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:29,919
Visual?

646
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:30,879
And you need a celeb.

647
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:34,799
I need a foreign leader.

648
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:44,439
If you're tired and tired during the exam period,

649
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:45,679
I'll sing you a song.

650
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:47,399
During the break...

651
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,259
During the break,

652
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:52,139
Jennie will probably lock the door so she can't go out.

653
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:54,279
And Jennie time.

654
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:54,559
Okay.

655
00:29:57,139 --> 00:29:58,459
Jennie's recommendation is going up.

656
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:00,199
Minnie and Jennie.

657
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:00,639
Is there anyone else?

658
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:01,519
No recommendation.

659
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:03,039
I have one, teacher.

660
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:04,019
Especially...

661
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:04,539
Jun Ha Dan.

662
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:06,599
Jun Ha Dan, Jun Ha Dan.

663
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:07,319
Wait a minute.

664
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:08,159
Can I recommend a transfer student?

665
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:10,619
Did you talk about it during the break?

666
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,699
No, of course.

667
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:13,779
Can I recommend a transfer student?

668
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:15,479
You can.

669
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:22,579
You don't have to have a lot of talent.

670
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:23,039
You don't have to have a lot of talent.

671
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:24,719
Raise your hand.

672
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,579
If Jun Ha Dan is a candidate, go up.

673
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:28,579
If not, go down.

674
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,099
Jun Ha Dan, close your eyes.

675
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,059
One, two, three.

676
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:34,839
I did it twice.

677
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:36,039
Put your hands down.

678
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:40,559
The recommendation for a transfer student has gone up.

679
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:42,539
I have something to confess.

680
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,579
I have something to confess.

681
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:46,219
Why?

682
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,639
I have something to confess.

683
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,119
Why?

684
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:51,159
Earlier, Jun Ha Dan said to me,

685
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:52,499
Suki, it's me.

686
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,379
I won't do it.

687
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:55,819
But I...

688
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:57,459
If I get a transfer student,

689
00:30:58,139 --> 00:30:58,919
I won't do it again.

690
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,319
Then...

691
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,059
No recommendation.

692
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:10,659
There are two people who recommend.

693
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:11,279
I won't do it.

694
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,719
But I...

695
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:14,959
If I get a transfer student,

696
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,639
I won't do it again.

697
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:16,799
If I get a transfer student,

698
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:17,739
I won't do it again.

699
00:31:17,739 --> 00:31:18,459
If I get a transfer student,

700
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:21,099
I won't do it again.

701
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:27,559
Suki.

702
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:28,499
Suki.

703
00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:29,099
Are you going to do it again?

704
00:31:32,699 --> 00:31:33,219
Right now.

705
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:34,059
Right now.

706
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,319
If I get a transfer student,

707
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:37,639
I won't do it again.

708
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:40,979
Why?

709
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,279
Why?

710
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:44,379
Why?

711
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:44,419
Why?
Why?

712
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,419
Wait a minute.

713
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,739
This is...

714
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:51,439
Wait a minute.

715
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:54,079
Wait a minute.

716
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,019
Wait a minute.

717
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:55,919
Wait a minute.

718
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:00,279
I won't do it.

719
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:01,459
I won't do it.

720
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:06,319
Are you really going to do it again?

721
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:07,639
Look.

722
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:08,699
There is evidence.

723
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:10,399
There is evidence.

724
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:11,119
There is evidence.

725
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:11,699
Suki.

726
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:12,319
It's me.

727
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,319
There is evidence.

728
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,679
Suki.

729
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:16,339
It's me.

730
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:18,999
It's written clearly.

731
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:19,959
It's written clearly.

732
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:21,559
Behind it...

733
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:21,859
It's written as fixed.

734
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,099
The next one is...

735
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:28,719
It's me.

736
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,259
The next one is...

737
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:30,979
It's me.

738
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,699
Just trust me and follow me.

739
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,019
I won't do it again.

740
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:36,279
Now, come in.

741
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,679
It's me.

742
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:40,899
It's me.

743
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:41,439
Do you have power?

744
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:44,659
Now, it's time for the last one.

745
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,059
I think the start is wrong.

746
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:48,999
As there is a saying,

747
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,179
the end of everything is important.

748
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:52,499
I will decorate the end.

749
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,379
What does that mean?

750
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,079
I...

751
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:00,679
Please include my name.

752
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:05,599
It's like an image washing machine.

753
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:05,899
It's me.

754
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,979
It's possible to recommend.

755
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:11,219
So, it's included in the list.

756
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,559
So, Minnie, Jennie, and Jona.

757
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:16,739
They are on the list of candidates.

758
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,779
But, unfortunately,

759
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,139
only two people are on the list of candidates.

760
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:23,819
Really?

761
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:28,039
So, there is a condition to be on the list of candidates.

762
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:32,299
If more than four people, including you, support you,

763
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:36,079
you will be on the list of candidates.

764
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,339
Four people?

765
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:38,999
To be on the list of candidates,

766
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:39,899
you need to have supporters.

767
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:44,139
If you have supporters,

768
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:47,639
you will be on the list of candidates.

769
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:48,199
Are you ready?

770
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:49,159
Yes.

771
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:49,899
Let's start.

772
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:52,519
Like this?

773
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,119
Yes, freely.

774
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:55,839
Like this?

775
00:33:57,459 --> 00:33:58,619
Good, Jennie.

776
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,379
Wait, wait, wait.

777
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:02,779
What's this?

778
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:03,899
What's this?

779
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:09,339
What are you going to do for me?

780
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:10,679
What are you going to do for you?

781
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:11,579
I can buy you sundae.

782
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:12,859
I can buy you sundae.

783
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,039
I'll give you a scholarship.

784
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:16,679
Why do you give me a scholarship?

785
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,519
Actually, I don't need it.

786
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,779
I'll do it for you.

787
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,359
Really?

788
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,059
If you choose me.

789
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:23,899
Really?

790
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,719
But, I can twerk in front of you.

791
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,599
I know.

792
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:28,479
Twerking?

793
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,419
But, it has nothing to do with leadership.

794
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:31,719
You need it.

795
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,099
It has nothing to do with leadership.

796
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:33,739
You need it.

797
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,939
You need it.

798
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:35,839
What?

799
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:36,559
You need it.

800
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:36,859
Why?

801
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:37,339
You need it.

802
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,799
Why do I need it?

803
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:40,919
It's our energy exchange.

804
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:42,799
Energy exchange.

805
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:45,219
Then, let's show how much you like Chuki.

806
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,219
Can you show us the acrostic poem with Chuki?

807
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:47,079
Good.

808
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:48,799
I'll go first.

809
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:49,259
Okay.

810
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:49,879
Chuu.

811
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:50,639
Chuu.

812
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:51,219
Chuu.

813
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:55,879
Chuu.

814
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:56,939
She's so cute.

815
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:58,479
What should I do?

816
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,299
I can do it.

817
00:34:59,519 --> 00:34:59,779
Chuu.

818
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:00,719
Chuu is the best.

819
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:01,619
Chuu.

820
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:02,679
Chuu is the best.

821
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,259
Chuu is the best.

822
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:09,159
I can speak Japanese, too.

823
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,759
You need to think well.

824
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:11,199
Let's shake hands.

825
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,059
I was thinking well.

826
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:19,499
Dami.

827
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,359
If you are in the same team with me,

828
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,239
I'll give you time to dance separately.

829
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:24,999
I'll give you time.

830
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,539
You can dance to KING KARD.

831
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:27,599
You can dance to Super Junior.

832
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:28,599
You can dance to PURPLE KISS.

833
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,619
You can dance to all of them.

834
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,879
And I'll give you the scholarship.

835
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:34,979
Think well.

836
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:36,759
Think well.

837
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,039
A scholarship?

838
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:40,159
A scholarship?

839
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,999
Who has more scholarship than me?

840
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:44,059
Who has more scholarship than me?

841
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,339
Will you give it to me?

842
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,539
Of course.

843
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:49,259
I can get all the scholarship.

844
00:35:49,259 --> 00:35:50,099
I got it last time.

845
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:51,079
I'll give you all the scholarship.

846
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:51,539
I'll give you all the scholarship.

847
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:02,319
We are in the same team.

848
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:09,319
I'm in the same team, too.

849
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,019
I'm in the same team, too.

850
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:11,839
We are in the same team.

851
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:12,999
Wait a minute.

852
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:14,019
We are mixed.

853
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:19,239
It's me.

854
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:19,739
It's me.

855
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:20,799
What are we doing?

856
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,199
We are talking.

857
00:36:22,419 --> 00:36:22,819
Let's hear it.

858
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:23,479
What are you talking about?

859
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:25,279
I'm just...

860
00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:25,719
This is it.

861
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,239
I'm a little more...

862
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,619
A person who has the determination to break the floor should do it.

863
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:33,499
Take it quickly.

864
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:34,319
Do you want to take it now?

865
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,279
I'm telling you that I'm going to lay it on the floor.

866
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:39,219
I'm full.

867
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,219
I think people who have a lot of experience should do it.

868
00:36:42,979 --> 00:36:43,919
I've been doing it for three years.

869
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,099
I've done it five times.

870
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:46,079
I skipped it.

871
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:48,299
Did you just walk over your cell phone?

872
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:49,799
What are you talking about?

873
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:51,139
Did you write it in your resume?

874
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:52,299
No, I didn't.

875
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,459
You only have one day.

876
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:56,339
You're out.

877
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,679
We don't have time.

878
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:00,659
We can't give you more time.

879
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:01,979
Please take a seat.

880
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:08,279
I'll go in order.

881
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:09,459
Minhee, raise your hand.

882
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,979
Justin, Chanel.

883
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:14,659
You, Minhee.

884
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:15,699
Three Minhees.

885
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:17,699
Three Minhees.

886
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:17,979
Three Jennies.

887
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:20,679
Raise your hand if you recommend Jennie.

888
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:24,419
Two people.

889
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:25,579
Don't you raise your hand?

890
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:27,259
Three people.

891
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:27,979
Three Jennies.

892
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,059
Three Jennies.

893
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,919
And the last one.

894
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,139
Trot.

895
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:35,939
Two people.

896
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:39,879
You have to be four to register.

897
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,039
You have to be four to register.

898
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:43,559
We need to gather some supporters.

899
00:37:43,879 --> 00:37:44,779
Can I talk now?

900
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:46,019
I told you.

901
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:48,119
Being a leader is not to shine.

902
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,119
It's to make you shine.

903
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,619
I'm very confident.

904
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,619
I'll give you a simple example.

905
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:58,319
We're out of time.

906
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:01,119
I can't hear the audio.

907
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,299
I'll press it for you.

908
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:05,959
It means it's not working.

909
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:07,979
Give me an example.

910
00:38:07,979 --> 00:38:08,559
Give me an example.

911
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:14,399
For example, when we talk about Leo, we may feel pressured to react.

912
00:38:19,279 --> 00:38:24,239
So, I'm going to recruit the audience from the past.

913
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:25,539
For Leo.

914
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:25,599
For Leo.

915
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:33,679
So, I'm going to recruit about five people.

916
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:37,739
I'm going to recruit the audience for Leo.

917
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:40,079
I'm going to recruit the audience for Leo.

918
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,419
Leo, do you support him?

919
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:44,879
I think he's trying to feed me.

920
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,079
Leo, do you support him?

921
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:47,979
I don't support him.

922
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:51,879
Jennie, wait a minute.

923
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:52,519
Let's talk about Jennie.

924
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,279
One vote is not enough.

925
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:58,619
Can I sing a song?

926
00:38:59,279 --> 00:38:59,719
No.

927
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:01,939
You may not be recommended.

928
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:06,579
You can recommend a song.

929
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:07,979
Let's give her a round of applause.

930
00:39:10,939 --> 00:39:12,339
I'm not going to say much.

931
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:13,799
But I'm going to have a graduation ceremony.

932
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,859
So, I'm going to sing a sad song.

933
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:17,279
I'm going to sing a sad song.

934
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:19,239
Hold your emotions.

935
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,319
I'm sorry, Jennie.

936
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:50,819
Wait a minute.

937
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:52,719
Tzuki has taken over the show.

938
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:55,559
Tzuki has taken over the show.

939
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:57,359
So, who is Tzuki going to choose?

940
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:57,999
It's important.

941
00:39:58,959 --> 00:39:59,699
Tzuki.

942
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,079
3, 2, 1.

943
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:07,679
No.

944
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:11,259
So, Jennie lost her chance.

945
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,439
There's only one vote left.

946
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:16,279
There's only one vote left.

947
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:18,379
I'm going to change my mind.

948
00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:19,699
Leo, who are you going to choose?

949
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:21,499
I'm sorry, but I'm going to sing a song.

950
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:27,999
Leo, who are you going to choose?

951
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:30,039
I'm going to choose Minnie.

952
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:34,279
So, Minnie is the first candidate.

953
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:38,939
You're going to sing a song?

954
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:39,979
No.

955
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:49,859
So, Minnie is the first official candidate.

956
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:51,579
Wait a minute.

957
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:52,959
I'm going to tell you.

958
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,299
I'm going to tell you.

959
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:59,779
Jennie, if you give a signal whenever you want, you can take it off right away.

960
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:00,819
Jennie time.

961
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:01,659
Jennie time.

962
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:02,299
Jennie time.

963
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:03,879
You can take it off right away.

964
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:05,379
Jennie time.

965
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:06,119
How long are you going to give me?

966
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:06,959
What?

967
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:07,899
15 seconds.

968
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:11,079
15 seconds is a little hard for me.

969
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:11,819
How long do you want?

970
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,139
3 to 4 minutes in Korea.

971
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:14,219
3 to 4 minutes?

972
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:14,899
What are you talking about?

973
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:15,659
I was thinking about 10 minutes.

974
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,579
I'm serious.

975
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,619
Candidates are complete.

976
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:25,139
Class president vote.

977
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:28,579
The first candidate is Minnie, who received four votes in a flash.

978
00:41:29,939 --> 00:41:30,479
She's in first place.

979
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,499
And Jonathan is in second place.

980
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:36,159
She's in first place, everyone.

981
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:53,719
From now on, we're going to have a time to verify who's the leader of Knowing Bros.

982
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:56,879
It's called the Leaders League.

983
00:41:56,879 --> 00:42:00,279
We're going to have a time to verify who's the leader of Knowing Bros.

984
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:05,559
We're going to have a time to verify who's the leader of Knowing Bros.

985
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:08,979
The first verification is persuasion.

986
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:19,699
It's important to be able to persuade the leader to go in the direction he wants.

987
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:25,109
That's why we prepared a persuasion verification test.

988
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,099
The answer is already decided, so you just have to persuade him.

989
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:32,959
You can only trust us.

990
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:36,419
You don't have to eat because of me.

991
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:42,579
I'll reveal the topic of the debate, and you pick one of the topics.

992
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:48,179
You can persuade him that the answer is correct according to the topic.

993
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:54,619
The candidates should lead the team well and do their best to show their leadership.

994
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,239
Sam Kendi!

995
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,039
You're not supposed to say that.

996
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:03,839
You're not supposed to say that.

997
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:05,679
You're not supposed to say that.

998
00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:07,399
You're not supposed to say that.

999
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,659
That's not the right answer.

1000
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:11,079
That's not the right answer.

1001
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:12,399
It's all Leo's fault.

1002
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:14,719
It's all Leo's fault.

1003
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:15,679
Leo was the one who was in the wrong.

1004
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:15,959
He was supposed to be the leader.

1005
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:18,999
He wasn't supposed to be that high-pitched.

1006
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:25,319
How do we choose a sample for the debate?

1007
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,299
After the debate, you vote to see which answer was more persuasive.

1008
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:35,019
Don't care about the candidates and vote with confidence.

1009
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:37,239
Do you understand, Jonathan?

1010
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:38,699
I understand very well.

1011
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,219
I don't think so.

1012
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:45,299
I'll reveal the topic of the debate.

1013
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:48,359
The one you dreamed of.

1014
00:43:50,939 --> 00:43:52,719
Jonathan, your reaction is too much.

1015
00:43:54,439 --> 00:43:55,719
You just said you dreamed of it.

1016
00:43:57,479 --> 00:43:58,799
Your reaction is too much.

1017
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:00,459
Please calm down.

1018
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:03,759
The one you dreamed of.

1019
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:07,959
I was trapped in a deserted island with my ideal type for 1,000 years.

1020
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:11,279
A deserted island full of roughness.

1021
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:14,479
The only one I can trust is the two of us.

1022
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:22,559
My ideal type was so scary that he hugged me and said this.

1023
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:25,939
I'll only trust you now.

1024
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:28,959
But then...

1025
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,359
A lifeboat passed by in front of my eyes.

1026
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:36,399
My ideal type didn't know the existence of a lifeboat.

1027
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:38,219
Because he was hugging me.

1028
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:39,999
He only looked at me.

1029
00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:47,339
In this situation, I...

1030
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:50,019
1. The first priority is to escape the deserted island.

1031
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,919
2. I request the lifeboat's rescue.

1032
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:55,299
3. It's not time yet.

1033
00:44:56,139 --> 00:44:58,459
4. I'll pretend I didn't see the lifeboat.

1034
00:44:58,459 --> 00:44:58,999
I'll pretend I didn't see the lifeboat.

1035
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:01,899
Let's draw lots.

1036
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:04,999
Let's start with Minnie.

1037
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:06,619
It's number 2.

1038
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:12,799
Let's start the debate.

1039
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:17,879
It's the ideal type for 1,000 years.

1040
00:45:19,659 --> 00:45:22,479
If you stay in a deserted island for a long time,

1041
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,179
you'll get to know each other better.

1042
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:28,179
You'll get to know each other better.

1043
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,139
And you'll be able to share a deeper love with each other.

1044
00:45:33,979 --> 00:45:35,899
How do you share a deeper love?

1045
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:36,819
By holding hands?

1046
00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:39,359
You can do whatever you want in a deserted island.

1047
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:47,059
Why are your eyes red?

1048
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:51,279
You can hold each other's hands.

1049
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:54,099
You can hold each other's hands.

1050
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:54,899
You can hold each other's hands.

1051
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:58,179
You can talk about deep things.

1052
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:00,499
You can see each other's personalities.

1053
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:02,719
You can see each other's personalities.

1054
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:09,939
I'm the ideal type for 1,000 years.

1055
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:12,399
I'm the ideal type for 1,000 years.

1056
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:16,959
Let's change seats!

1057
00:46:16,959 --> 00:46:17,339
Let's change seats!

1058
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:20,079
I don't think this is right.

1059
00:46:22,759 --> 00:46:25,599
I really like her.

1060
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:27,719
But I don't think it's a lie.

1061
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,119
It's easy to live in a deserted island.

1062
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:34,639
At first, you can get along with each other because you're scared.

1063
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:36,059
But things can change.

1064
00:46:36,939 --> 00:46:37,679
You can't eat.

1065
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:39,319
You can't sleep.

1066
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:40,759
You can dance.

1067
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:42,419
You have to exercise.

1068
00:46:42,419 --> 00:46:42,599
You have to love each other.

1069
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:43,719
But things can change.

1070
00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:46,159
You can't get along with each other.

1071
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:51,779
You can't share a deeper love.

1072
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:55,519
That's a negative thought.

1073
00:46:55,919 --> 00:46:57,259
You have to think positively.

1074
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:00,319
If you find something to eat,

1075
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:03,439
you can share a deeper love.

1076
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,359
But the problem is...

1077
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,059
If you spend a month in a deserted island,

1078
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:09,759
and you fall in love with each other,

1079
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:11,619
and you're back in a deserted island,

1080
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:13,199
and you're rescued.

1081
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,139
You should thank the captain for rescuing you.

1082
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:17,679
But you should thank the captain for rescuing you.

1083
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:18,739
Actually, we came back a month ago.

1084
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:20,159
Oh, my.

1085
00:47:20,779 --> 00:47:21,779
You didn't see it?

1086
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:23,159
We always like you.

1087
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:26,499
I like you, too.

1088
00:47:26,979 --> 00:47:28,419
Then you can be more romantic.

1089
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:30,079
I don't want to be with you.

1090
00:47:30,819 --> 00:47:31,539
I don't want to be with you.

1091
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,899
Then you can ask my opinion.

1092
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:36,219
Then you can ask my opinion.

1093
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:36,479
I think you're going to use it.

1094
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:41,219
We've been talking about love.

1095
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:45,759
Do you think love is greed?

1096
00:47:46,479 --> 00:47:47,199
Oh, my God.

1097
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:48,799
In this situation,

1098
00:47:49,989 --> 00:47:51,099
You're the only one who's hiding.

1099
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,339
Because I...

1100
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:54,499
Love is greed.

1101
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,019
That's how it starts.

1102
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:59,139
You can date and get married later.

1103
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:01,099
Are you going to keep doing that?

1104
00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:03,639
If you look at this, it's so sad.

1105
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:04,319
I don't have a wife.

1106
00:48:05,899 --> 00:48:07,039
I'm a high school student.

1107
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:08,599
I'm a high school student.

1108
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:09,919
I'm a high school student.

1109
00:48:12,959 --> 00:48:14,539
Sung Hoon is out.

1110
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:15,799
Let's think about it.

1111
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,219
You two went to see the real estate.

1112
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:21,719
If your girlfriend likes this land,

1113
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:23,399
I'll give you the land.

1114
00:48:24,399 --> 00:48:25,039
Later on,

1115
00:48:25,939 --> 00:48:28,639
I'll buy the land and give it to you.

1116
00:48:28,799 --> 00:48:30,039
Wait a minute.

1117
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:30,999
Everyone, focus.

1118
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,219
In this situation,

1119
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:33,939
Five audience members.

1120
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,879
It's not time to laugh.

1121
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,079
Wait a minute.

1122
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:43,039
You have to listen to Leo.

1123
00:48:45,499 --> 00:48:46,539
I'm sorry.

1124
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:48,939
That's all.

1125
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:50,739
It's okay.

1126
00:48:51,439 --> 00:48:52,339
Leo, it's okay.

1127
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,419
I'll give you the land.

1128
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:57,419
I told you, didn't I?

1129
00:48:57,419 --> 00:48:58,939
You have to survive on an uninhabited island.

1130
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:00,499
You have to overcome it.

1131
00:49:00,759 --> 00:49:01,459
That's how you get strength.

1132
00:49:02,779 --> 00:49:04,059
After overcoming the painful torture,

1133
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:07,179
You've been in love more.

1134
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:08,319
That's right.

1135
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:10,599
We can overcome everything.

1136
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:11,979
That's the mindset.

1137
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:14,699
True love is

1138
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:16,519
Whether it's an uninhabited island or not.

1139
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:17,879
It's going to happen.

1140
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,819
True love is

1141
00:49:19,819 --> 00:49:21,299
Whether it's an uninhabited island or not.

1142
00:49:21,379 --> 00:49:23,739
To put it simply,

1143
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:24,219
To put it simply,

1144
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:27,599
Imagine this situation.

1145
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:29,379
Just imagine him now.

1146
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:30,819
What would he have done?

1147
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:32,359
A rescue ship is passing by.

1148
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,619
Is that a ship?

1149
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:38,279
I'm with you.

1150
00:49:38,899 --> 00:49:43,559
I think he's emotionally supporting us.

1151
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:44,939
Okay.

1152
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,739
Close your eyes.

1153
00:49:47,919 --> 00:49:50,159
Close your eyes.

1154
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:50,479
Close your eyes.

1155
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:53,719
If you open your eyes, you'll be unlucky for three years.

1156
00:49:54,139 --> 00:49:54,899
Please close your eyes.

1157
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:58,419
A chance to escape right away.

1158
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:00,239
Ask for a rescue of the rescue ship.

1159
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,839
One, two, three.

1160
00:50:02,939 --> 00:50:03,439
Please raise your hand.

1161
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:05,519
Three seconds.

1162
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:06,719
That's it.

1163
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:08,259
Pretend you didn't see the rescue ship.

1164
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:10,699
Just throw it on the rock.

1165
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,299
Please raise your hand.

1166
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:15,339
One, two, three.

1167
00:50:15,399 --> 00:50:15,899
Please raise your hand.

1168
00:50:15,899 --> 00:50:18,819
Please lower your hand.

1169
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:19,619
Now, open your eyes.

1170
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:23,499
The first debate is

1171
00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:24,939
Min-D's victory.

1172
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:27,619
Why?

1173
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:28,719
Why?

1174
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,159
What's the score?

1175
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:36,659
It's 6 to 2.

1176
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:38,139
6 to 2?

1177
00:50:40,439 --> 00:50:41,699
Don't worry.

1178
00:50:41,879 --> 00:50:42,439
This is not the end.

1179
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:47,219
The second league

1180
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:47,259
is

1181
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:49,799
S.A.T.

1182
00:50:50,139 --> 00:50:51,019
S.A.T.?

1183
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:52,839
Isn't it very difficult?

1184
00:50:53,399 --> 00:50:54,239
When you go to college.

1185
00:50:54,799 --> 00:50:57,319
When you go to college.

1186
00:50:57,799 --> 00:50:59,019
If you want to go to a prestigious college,

1187
00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:01,779
you have to type S.A.T.

1188
00:51:02,939 --> 00:51:03,919
This S.A.T.

1189
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:06,359
is not the S.A.T. you know.

1190
00:51:07,419 --> 00:51:10,739
Jonathan, what is the S.A.T.

1191
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:14,939
It's like saying anything you know.

1192
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:17,419
It's like saying anything you know.

1193
00:51:18,479 --> 00:51:20,699
So, S.A.T.

1194
00:51:20,899 --> 00:51:21,519
S.A.T.

1195
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:22,799
It's a warning.

1196
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:28,539
It's like saying anything you know.

1197
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,299
You brought a warning?

1198
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:33,319
No, S.A.T.

1199
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:35,539
What is this?

1200
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:37,739
It's a warning.

1201
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:38,839
S.A.T.

1202
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:39,319
It's a warning.

1203
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:41,039
It's a warning.

1204
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:43,799
It's Justin Bieber.

1205
00:51:44,919 --> 00:51:46,779
It's the same African drummer.

1206
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,499
I will reveal it.

1207
00:51:49,979 --> 00:51:51,639
The S.A.T. of a foreign language you know.

1208
00:51:51,919 --> 00:51:55,339
It consists of three basic elements

1209
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:59,159
The first S.A.T.

1210
00:51:59,159 --> 00:51:59,659
Sentence.

1211
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:00,979
Sentence.

1212
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:03,079
What does it mean?

1213
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,739
In English, it's a sentence.

1214
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:06,819
Sentence.

1215
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:09,919
The second S.A.T.

1216
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:10,519
Athletics.

1217
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,119
What is the correct pronunciation?

1218
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:15,939
Athletics.

1219
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:18,119
It's a team.

1220
00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:20,679
The last T.

1221
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:21,899
Thinking.

1222
00:52:24,779 --> 00:52:26,619
So, in this leader's league,

1223
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:29,279
S.A.T. is not about winning.

1224
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:31,739
It's about

1225
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:33,679
understanding the potential of the members

1226
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:36,759
and the leader's insight

1227
00:52:36,759 --> 00:52:37,879
and wisdom.

1228
00:52:39,399 --> 00:52:40,579
The two candidates

1229
00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:42,439
will write down

1230
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:43,019
the team members

1231
00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:44,779
that they think will do the best

1232
00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:46,999
and submit it to the teacher.

1233
00:52:48,379 --> 00:52:49,339
We will reveal

1234
00:52:49,339 --> 00:52:52,079
how well they think

1235
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:52,219
about their classmates.

1236
00:52:55,279 --> 00:52:56,379
Now, the first test.

1237
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:57,759
As Chanel said,

1238
00:52:58,339 --> 00:53:00,359
these days, students

1239
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:02,359
use smartphones

1240
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:03,159
more than books

1241
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:05,499
to search and play.

1242
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,119
So, I heard that their vocabulary

1243
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:07,979
has weakened.

1244
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:11,599
Jennie, what do you think?

1245
00:53:11,879 --> 00:53:14,119
Your screen time

1246
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:15,199
is not that good.

1247
00:53:17,979 --> 00:53:19,499
So, the next test

1248
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:20,939
is

1249
00:53:20,939 --> 00:53:23,519
the Korean vocabulary test.

1250
00:53:23,859 --> 00:53:24,499
No!

1251
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:28,399
Listen to the words

1252
00:53:28,399 --> 00:53:29,079
and guess

1253
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:30,619
what they mean.

1254
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:33,839
The first

1255
00:53:34,399 --> 00:53:35,639
question.

1256
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:38,719
Big joints.

1257
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:40,719
Big joints.

1258
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:42,899
Big joints.

1259
00:53:42,899 --> 00:53:43,399
What does that mean?

1260
00:53:43,899 --> 00:53:44,559
Write it down.

1261
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:46,339
Some members

1262
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:48,379
wrote it down.

1263
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:50,879
Big joints.

1264
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:52,239
Big joints.

1265
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:53,219
I don't know.

1266
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:54,059
I don't know.

1267
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:55,519
I don't know either.

1268
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:59,639
Do I have to draw it?

1269
00:53:59,939 --> 00:54:01,539
Just guess what it means.

1270
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,459
The first question.

1271
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:06,379
What does it mean?

1272
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:08,139
One,

1273
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:10,339
two, three.

1274
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:13,939
What is it?

1275
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:16,239
And?

1276
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:19,119
Big joints.

1277
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,279
What is

1278
00:54:20,279 --> 00:54:21,679
a big joint?

1279
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:23,179
Knees.

1280
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:26,659
Shoulders.

1281
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:28,159
It means a big joint.

1282
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:30,579
And you?

1283
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:33,259
It's a big joint.

1284
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:33,719
It's the same.

1285
00:54:34,879 --> 00:54:37,159
It's a part of a bone.

1286
00:54:37,179 --> 00:54:38,039
That's a joint.

1287
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:41,539
It's a part of a bone.

1288
00:54:42,899 --> 00:54:44,639
What about Jennie?

1289
00:54:44,879 --> 00:54:45,559
A big joint.

1290
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:47,339
A big joint.

1291
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:48,219
What does a joint mean?

1292
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:49,859
A joint.

1293
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:52,619
She's dancing again.

1294
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:56,119
Jennie time.

1295
00:54:57,659 --> 00:54:57,999
Jennie time.

1296
00:54:58,359 --> 00:54:58,619
Jennie time.

1297
00:54:59,579 --> 00:54:59,799
Jennie.

1298
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:02,839
Jennie.

1299
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:03,679
Jennie.

1300
00:55:06,419 --> 00:55:07,859
Minnie's reaction is hot.

1301
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:08,719
Really?

1302
00:55:10,759 --> 00:55:12,119
It's been a while.

1303
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:12,239
It's been a while.

1304
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,379
What about Leo?

1305
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:16,399
What is it?

1306
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:19,679
I don't know.

1307
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:20,059
I know.

1308
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:23,219
What about Leo?

1309
00:55:24,499 --> 00:55:25,299
What is it?

1310
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:27,799
What is it?

1311
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:29,079
It's a big joint.

1312
00:55:29,479 --> 00:55:29,979
Isn't it a pelvis?

1313
00:55:30,879 --> 00:55:31,259
Pelvis?

1314
00:55:32,899 --> 00:55:33,759
Okay.

1315
00:55:34,819 --> 00:55:35,679
And?

1316
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:38,019
Bone.

1317
00:55:38,019 --> 00:55:39,519
A hip joint.

1318
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:41,199
A big joint.

1319
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:45,199
It's not a hip joint.

1320
00:55:45,499 --> 00:55:46,159
It's a big joint.

1321
00:55:47,939 --> 00:55:49,419
Before we talk about the meaning,

1322
00:55:49,699 --> 00:55:52,019
the answer is...

1323
00:55:54,219 --> 00:55:54,839
No.

1324
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:56,239
Why?

1325
00:55:56,939 --> 00:55:58,679
It's not a big joint?

1326
00:55:59,459 --> 00:56:01,079
It's not.

1327
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,939
I'll tell you what a big joint means.

1328
00:56:03,479 --> 00:56:04,259
A big joint is

1329
00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:05,399
A big joint is

1330
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:07,099
a joint.

1331
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,299
I really didn't learn this.

1332
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:11,639
I didn't know at all.

1333
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:12,559
I've never heard of it.

1334
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,559
I've never heard of it.

1335
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:18,679
It's that hard.

1336
00:56:20,359 --> 00:56:21,939
Let's lower the difficulty level.

1337
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:22,379
You can lower it.

1338
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:24,019
Next question.

1339
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:25,619
Soft.

1340
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:29,479
Hint.

1341
00:56:30,859 --> 00:56:32,659
Give us a hint.

1342
00:56:32,659 --> 00:56:34,239
Foreigners' chance.

1343
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:35,559
Foreigners' chance.

1344
00:56:35,919 --> 00:56:37,439
Why are you doing this to us?

1345
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:38,679
Let's just say it's soft.

1346
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,139
This is a hint.

1347
00:56:42,439 --> 00:56:43,019
I think I know what it is.

1348
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:49,599
Chanel really doesn't know.

1349
00:56:50,459 --> 00:56:52,359
But they are

1350
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:53,319
trustworthy celebrities,

1351
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:54,959
so let's say it's soft.

1352
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:58,139
If you say it like that, it changes.

1353
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:58,759
What should I do?

1354
00:56:58,759 --> 00:57:00,019
What should I do?

1355
00:57:00,819 --> 00:57:01,379
Let's say it's soft.

1356
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:04,759
1, 2, 3.

1357
00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:06,019
Soft.

1358
00:57:06,779 --> 00:57:07,879
Give us a hint.

1359
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,239
Give us a hint.

1360
00:57:10,979 --> 00:57:12,559
Chanel, you are confused.

1361
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:13,239
What is it?

1362
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:14,239
Trustworthy.

1363
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:16,359
Justin?

1364
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:19,179
Trustworthy.

1365
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:20,459
Trustworthy.

1366
00:57:20,699 --> 00:57:23,419
And Leo?

1367
00:57:23,959 --> 00:57:25,419
Like you said,

1368
00:57:25,419 --> 00:57:26,899
What's wrong with us?

1369
00:57:28,139 --> 00:57:30,959
Let's wear the same shoes.

1370
00:57:31,379 --> 00:57:31,539
Shoes.

1371
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:35,919
Don't force me.

1372
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:44,039
What's wrong with us?

1373
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:45,819
Alberto?

1374
00:57:46,179 --> 00:57:47,459
Let's say it's soft.

1375
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:48,479
Let's say it's soft.

1376
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:51,719
Let's say it's soft.

1377
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:53,919
Let's just say it's soft.

1378
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,259
Let's go, Jonathan.

1379
00:57:56,279 --> 00:57:56,619
What is it?

1380
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:57,539
Let's just say it's soft.

1381
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:00,499
I think it's legal.

1382
00:58:03,259 --> 00:58:04,599
He's good.

1383
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:07,959
Let's just say it's soft.

1384
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,359
Let's just say it's soft.

1385
00:58:11,419 --> 00:58:12,639
Don't say it's soft.

1386
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:13,639
Move.

1387
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:16,659
Don't say it's soft.

1388
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:18,379
Let's just say it's soft.

1389
00:58:18,379 --> 00:58:19,019
Let's move.

1390
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:25,059
Let's just say it's soft.

1391
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,539
What should I do?

1392
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:33,659
Let's just say it's soft.

1393
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,019
Let's just say it's soft.

1394
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:44,059
The answer is...

1395
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:44,559
Yes.

1396
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,559
The answer is...

1397
00:58:47,879 --> 00:58:48,739
The answer is...

1398
00:58:48,739 --> 00:58:49,979
Face each other and talk.

1399
00:58:51,419 --> 00:58:52,219
Face each other and talk.

1400
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:56,419
Face each other and talk.

1401
00:58:57,039 --> 00:58:57,759
Face each other and talk.

1402
00:58:57,759 --> 00:58:58,939
So, you learned the shoes, right?

1403
00:58:59,219 --> 00:58:59,459
Yes.

1404
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,939
Then, say it in a swear word.

1405
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:03,559
Hello?

1406
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:06,819
Today...

1407
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:07,939
Today...

1408
00:59:07,939 --> 00:59:09,139
We are going to shoot a show.

1409
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,799
I'm doing something right now.

1410
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,479
So, I'm going to ask you for the shoes.

1411
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:15,099
I'm going to ask you for the shoes.

1412
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:16,039
I'm going to ask you for the shoes.

1413
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,859
I'm going to ask you for the shoes.

1414
00:59:27,979 --> 00:59:29,139
How are you going to sign the contract?

1415
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:32,239
I think I'm going to have to meet him.

1416
00:59:32,879 --> 00:59:33,979
I think the shoes will be a little difficult.

1417
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:36,759
You did well.

1418
00:59:37,939 --> 00:59:40,199
You did well.

1419
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:41,459
You did well.

1420
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:46,239
I think you got it right, but it's a little difficult.

1421
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:47,699
Next question.

1422
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:53,759
What is it?

1423
00:59:56,479 --> 00:59:58,219
Is it a swear word?

1424
00:59:58,559 --> 00:59:59,439
Write it as you feel it.

1425
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:01,279
Can I write it as I feel it?

1426
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:02,279
Yes, write it.

1427
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:04,299
Write it as you feel it.

1428
01:00:06,379 --> 01:00:08,059
I don't know how to do it.

1429
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:10,799
Write it as you feel it.

1430
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,239
One, two, three...

1431
01:00:14,299 --> 01:00:15,479
Wait a minute.

1432
01:00:16,219 --> 01:00:16,939
Wait a minute.

1433
01:00:16,939 --> 01:00:16,999
You can't do this.

1434
01:00:17,779 --> 01:00:18,619
Wait a minute.

1435
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:19,399
I don't know how to do it.

1436
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:21,919
Did you hear that?

1437
01:00:26,379 --> 01:00:27,459
Jennie is a mess.

1438
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,019
And what is Leo's?

1439
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:31,679
I'm a mess.

1440
01:00:32,739 --> 01:00:33,739
Is it Japanese?

1441
01:00:34,879 --> 01:00:35,899
I'm a mess.

1442
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:37,199
What does that mean?

1443
01:00:37,859 --> 01:00:39,599
John is a mess.

1444
01:00:43,399 --> 01:00:47,099
I don't have it yet, but I hope.

1445
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:48,379
Why?

1446
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:53,279
I don't know what John is.

1447
01:00:55,399 --> 01:00:57,079
What is it?

1448
01:00:57,959 --> 01:00:59,519
Existence and failure.

1449
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,319
Existence and failure.

1450
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:03,159
Disappearance.

1451
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:03,959
Something that doesn't exist.

1452
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,859
The end of Knowing Bros is up to Boom.

1453
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:10,779
That's plausible.

1454
01:01:13,049 --> 01:01:14,699
John is a mess.

1455
01:01:21,029 --> 01:01:22,739
Is this okay?

1456
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:24,939
Calm down.

1457
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:28,799
John is a mess.

1458
01:01:29,779 --> 01:01:30,939
I don't like it.

1459
01:01:30,939 --> 01:01:32,259
John is a mess.

1460
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:32,999
I don't like it.

1461
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:36,579
John is a mess.

1462
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:37,619
John is a mess.

1463
01:01:38,439 --> 01:01:40,079
Minnie is a little serious.

1464
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:41,259
What is it?

1465
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:43,699
You said it's okay.

1466
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,399
What is it?

1467
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:48,059
You said it's okay.

1468
01:01:48,759 --> 01:01:49,599
What is it?

1469
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,659
John is a mess.

1470
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:04,139
John is a mess.

1471
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:04,919
Suki.

1472
01:02:05,499 --> 01:02:06,759
John is a mess.

1473
01:02:07,459 --> 01:02:07,979
Is it the same meaning?

1474
01:02:11,379 --> 01:02:12,159
Let's go together.

1475
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:18,289
John is a mess.

1476
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:18,989
What does that mean?

1477
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:20,609
Everyone.

1478
01:02:21,969 --> 01:02:24,589
The answer is...

1479
01:02:24,589 --> 01:02:25,749
Isn't it me?

1480
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:26,309
I think it is.

1481
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:27,349
It is.

1482
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:32,749
The answer is...

1483
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,149
John is a mess.

1484
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:37,809
Existence and failure.

1485
01:02:37,949 --> 01:02:39,769
Or survival and death.

1486
01:02:42,109 --> 01:02:44,289
The first sentence.

1487
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:45,929
We will announce the winner.

1488
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,249
The one who got the most answers is the winner.

1489
01:02:52,209 --> 01:02:52,909
Congratulations.

1490
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:57,229
John is the winner.

1491
01:02:59,289 --> 01:03:05,089
John is the winner.

1492
01:03:05,089 --> 01:03:06,509
Congratulations. John is the winner.

1493
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:11,489
John is a mess.

1494
01:03:12,969 --> 01:03:14,949
Did he pick himself?

1495
01:03:15,369 --> 01:03:16,589
I think he did.

1496
01:03:18,689 --> 01:03:21,129
I will tell you at the end.

1497
01:03:21,909 --> 01:03:23,289
I will tell you at the end.

1498
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:27,469
The next round is...

1499
01:03:27,469 --> 01:03:28,229
Athletics.

1500
01:03:28,229 --> 01:03:29,129
Athletics.

1501
01:03:30,049 --> 01:03:32,649
This time, we will test...

1502
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,149
Arm wrestling.

1503
01:03:34,529 --> 01:03:34,889
Arm wrestling.

1504
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:36,949
Let's go.

1505
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:38,689
I didn't want to say this.

1506
01:03:40,189 --> 01:03:40,949
I think it is better not to say it.

1507
01:03:41,209 --> 01:03:41,669
What do you want to say?

1508
01:03:42,729 --> 01:03:44,529
Do you want to touch my arm?

1509
01:03:45,549 --> 01:03:45,849
Touch it a little.

1510
01:03:48,049 --> 01:03:49,509
He is willing to risk his life for this kind of game.

1511
01:03:51,769 --> 01:03:53,209
Did you see my physique?

1512
01:03:54,149 --> 01:03:55,309
Justin is no joke.

1513
01:03:55,309 --> 01:03:56,429
I was in the top 4.

1514
01:03:58,709 --> 01:03:59,489
Top 4?

1515
01:03:59,709 --> 01:04:00,069
Yes, top 4.

1516
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:04,849
I was in the top 3 with 165kg.

1517
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:06,929
Top 3 with 165kg?

1518
01:04:07,029 --> 01:04:08,129
Top 3 with 165kg?

1519
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:09,509
Top 3 with 165kg.

1520
01:04:11,209 --> 01:04:12,249
I measured my body.

1521
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:15,109
My muscle mass is 23kg.

1522
01:04:17,089 --> 01:04:17,689
That's a lot.

1523
01:04:19,149 --> 01:04:20,269
Everyone, don't just do arm wrestling.

1524
01:04:20,269 --> 01:04:20,529
Don't just do arm wrestling.

1525
01:04:22,049 --> 01:04:22,569
You have to root for the leader.

1526
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:28,009
The first match.

1527
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:29,369
Leo and Alba.

1528
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:36,649
Leo and Alba are in the army.

1529
01:04:37,869 --> 01:04:39,129
I heard that arm wrestling is a technique.

1530
01:04:44,129 --> 01:04:46,049
Leo, you do a lot of exercise.

1531
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,769
I roll my legs.

1532
01:04:47,769 --> 01:04:49,029
He rolls his legs.

1533
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:50,709
I do a lot of marathons.

1534
01:04:51,609 --> 01:04:53,169
Leo's shoulders are really wide.

1535
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:55,009
He has a good physique.

1536
01:04:56,169 --> 01:04:58,069
I do a lot of exercise.

1537
01:04:59,349 --> 01:05:02,189
Yesterday, I did Lego with my roommate.

1538
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:06,209
What did you do with your roommate?

1539
01:05:06,709 --> 01:05:07,269
Lego.

1540
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:07,609
Lego.

1541
01:05:10,349 --> 01:05:17,709
I don't want to win.

1542
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:20,329
Fighting.

1543
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:22,549
Leo.

1544
01:05:25,229 --> 01:05:25,929
Fighting.

1545
01:05:45,219 --> 01:05:46,619
Leo.

1546
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:49,039
Fighting.

1547
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:49,919
Alba.

1548
01:05:53,759 --> 01:05:54,639
Alba.

1549
01:05:54,839 --> 01:05:55,679
Alba.

1550
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:00,599
Next.

1551
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,499
Zoran and Justin.

1552
01:06:04,959 --> 01:06:06,339
This is a long-awaited final match.

1553
01:06:09,439 --> 01:06:10,319
Justin.

1554
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:13,939
Minzy.

1555
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:19,079
Hello.

1556
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:23,599
Please step back a little.

1557
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:29,599
Please be careful.

1558
01:06:30,759 --> 01:06:34,279
This is a long-awaited final match.

1559
01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:35,819
You were in the top 4.

1560
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:37,799
I can do it.

1561
01:06:37,899 --> 01:06:39,179
You were in the top 4.

1562
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:46,679
And you liked exercising.

1563
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:47,039
I like exercising.

1564
01:06:48,919 --> 01:06:49,899
Ready.

1565
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:52,579
Ready.

1566
01:06:54,499 --> 01:06:55,119
Ready.

1567
01:06:56,599 --> 01:06:57,059
Wait a minute.

1568
01:06:57,519 --> 01:06:57,919
Wait a minute.

1569
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,079
Hurry up.

1570
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:05,399
He's getting more and more pressure.

1571
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:08,779
Are you interrupting?

1572
01:07:09,699 --> 01:07:11,299
I'm sweating already.

1573
01:07:11,299 --> 01:07:13,199
I'm sweating already.

1574
01:07:13,579 --> 01:07:15,239
Don't breathe too much.

1575
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:16,099
Ready.

1576
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:41,749
I like it.

1577
01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:56,089
What's so embarrassing about arm wrestling?

1578
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,189
The opponent moves back and forth.

1579
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:00,149
It's a game.

1580
01:08:04,069 --> 01:08:04,689
Justin.

1581
01:08:08,169 --> 01:08:08,789
Next.

1582
01:08:09,369 --> 01:08:10,429
Minzy and Ski.

1583
01:08:15,129 --> 01:08:16,929
Minzy, fighting.

1584
01:08:20,189 --> 01:08:21,829
This is a long-awaited final match.

1585
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:23,829
Minzy, fighting.

1586
01:08:28,829 --> 01:08:30,389
Minzy, fighting.

1587
01:08:38,889 --> 01:08:44,909
She endured it.

1588
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:02,339
There are people who play this game unconditionally.

1589
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:05,039
Chanel and Jennie, please come out.

1590
01:09:08,099 --> 01:09:09,279
Chanel and Jennie.

1591
01:09:09,639 --> 01:09:10,819
Go, Jennie.

1592
01:09:11,139 --> 01:09:12,199
Look at Chanel's eyes.

1593
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:13,659
Jennie, you have to turn it off at once.

1594
01:09:13,879 --> 01:09:14,559
Okay.

1595
01:09:16,739 --> 01:09:17,079
Ready.

1596
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:19,939
With your whole body.

1597
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:35,809
Jennie.

1598
01:09:35,809 --> 01:09:36,749
Jennie.

1599
01:09:36,749 --> 01:09:37,449
Jennie.

1600
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:41,389
Jennie, what are you doing?

1601
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:42,489
What are you doing?

1602
01:09:42,989 --> 01:09:43,529
She's dancing.

1603
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,669
She's cool.

1604
01:09:52,849 --> 01:09:54,709
Leo and Jonathan, please come out.

1605
01:09:55,089 --> 01:09:55,609
Again?

1606
01:09:57,669 --> 01:09:58,769
Leo and Jonathan.

1607
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:00,249
This is the last round.

1608
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:02,589
I like it.

1609
01:10:02,589 --> 01:10:04,029
Ready.

1610
01:10:04,589 --> 01:10:05,169
Don't pull.

1611
01:10:06,589 --> 01:10:07,229
Ready.

1612
01:10:08,549 --> 01:10:08,709
Ready.

1613
01:10:09,569 --> 01:10:10,309
Let's go.

1614
01:10:36,459 --> 01:10:37,119
Jonathan.

1615
01:10:38,779 --> 01:10:39,659
Jonathan.

1616
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:45,319
This is the last round.

1617
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:46,999
The last round.

1618
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:50,499
Good job.

1619
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,979
Now, it's the final round.

1620
01:10:56,339 --> 01:10:56,959
Nice.

1621
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:58,299
Fighting.

1622
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:00,739
You can do it.

1623
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:01,259
You can do it.

1624
01:11:01,259 --> 01:11:03,499
You can do it.

1625
01:11:03,499 --> 01:11:04,459
You are the only one who won.

1626
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:06,199
Alberto is strong.

1627
01:11:06,539 --> 01:11:07,159
Alberto, show us your legs.

1628
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,779
Alberto's legs are strong.

1629
01:11:12,139 --> 01:11:13,099
You can do it.

1630
01:11:14,259 --> 01:11:14,419
Ready.

1631
01:11:15,139 --> 01:11:15,559
Show us.

1632
01:11:15,959 --> 01:11:16,939
You can do it.

1633
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:19,139
Alberto.

1634
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:41,619
The final winner is...

1635
01:11:41,619 --> 01:11:42,259
Jonathan.

1636
01:11:42,259 --> 01:11:42,939
The final winner is Jonathan.

1637
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:52,259
If Minnie hadn't lost, she would have won.

1638
01:11:53,859 --> 01:11:55,679
Are you tired?

1639
01:11:56,139 --> 01:11:57,019
Yes.

1640
01:11:57,879 --> 01:12:01,399
I sweated a lot.

1641
01:12:02,899 --> 01:12:03,439
Good.

1642
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:05,059
Let's go.

1643
01:12:05,059 --> 01:12:07,799
Now, the last game.

1644
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,299
The last game is...

1645
01:12:10,019 --> 01:12:11,459
The memory quiz.

1646
01:12:13,019 --> 01:12:13,939
The memory quiz.

1647
01:12:13,939 --> 01:12:14,479
The memory quiz.

1648
01:12:14,759 --> 01:12:16,899
The teacher will tell you the sentence in each round.

1649
01:12:17,579 --> 01:12:18,859
You have to remember it well.

1650
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:20,679
And you have to guess the sentence.

1651
01:12:21,599 --> 01:12:22,979
In each round,

1652
01:12:23,519 --> 01:12:24,039
the one with the lowest score

1653
01:12:24,699 --> 01:12:25,599
will be eliminated.

1654
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,079
The one with the most correct answers

1655
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:31,299
will be the final winner.

1656
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:33,739
The final winner.

1657
01:12:33,739 --> 01:12:35,739
Let's start.

1658
01:12:36,739 --> 01:12:38,019
SAT thinking.

1659
01:12:38,559 --> 01:12:38,759
Let's start.

1660
01:12:39,239 --> 01:12:43,699
Jennie eats a blue lemon candy when she is depressed.

1661
01:12:45,139 --> 01:12:47,499
Leo is 16 years old

1662
01:12:47,499 --> 01:12:49,919
and he is 14cm tall.

1663
01:12:50,979 --> 01:12:57,239
The distance between Minnie's house and a bakery is 920m.

1664
01:12:59,879 --> 01:13:04,619
Chanel bought a pair of mint gloves in Myeong-dong.

1665
01:13:04,699 --> 01:13:05,299
What did Jennie do?

1666
01:13:08,099 --> 01:13:12,219
The price of ramen that Key ate in Osaka is...

1667
01:13:14,219 --> 01:13:16,119
2,580 yen.

1668
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:19,519
That's all.

1669
01:13:19,879 --> 01:13:20,379
That's all.

1670
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,979
Now, I will give you a question.

1671
01:13:23,979 --> 01:13:26,059
You have to write down the answer.

1672
01:13:27,939 --> 01:13:28,639
Write it down right away.

1673
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:30,559
You can't write it down.

1674
01:13:31,099 --> 01:13:31,979
You have to memorize it.

1675
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:32,859
This is the first question.

1676
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:37,059
Leo is 16 years old.

1677
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:38,119
How tall is he?

1678
01:13:46,569 --> 01:13:49,209
One, two, three.

1679
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:57,549
14cm.

1680
01:13:57,549 --> 01:13:58,149
Jennie is 14cm.

1681
01:13:58,429 --> 01:14:00,069
Justin is 156cm.

1682
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:07,009
Jennie is 16cm.

1683
01:14:07,329 --> 01:14:08,409
I'm in trouble.

1684
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:11,869
It's exactly 14cm.

1685
01:14:12,809 --> 01:14:14,729
We will remember it all.

1686
01:14:16,469 --> 01:14:17,649
Put it down.

1687
01:14:18,029 --> 01:14:19,009
Let's move on to the next question.

1688
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:24,409
The next question.

1689
01:14:24,409 --> 01:14:25,429
It's a chicken question.

1690
01:14:26,169 --> 01:14:27,769
You ate ramen in Osaka, right?

1691
01:14:27,989 --> 01:14:28,949
How much was it?

1692
01:14:35,009 --> 01:14:37,429
You ate ramen in Osaka, right?

1693
01:14:38,309 --> 01:14:39,429
How much was it?

1694
01:14:39,889 --> 01:14:41,929
One, two, three.

1695
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:48,149
2,860 yen.

1696
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:50,489
2,860 yen.

1697
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,529
2,580 yen.

1698
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:02,089
2,280 yen.

1699
01:15:02,089 --> 01:15:05,709
2,280 yen is too expensive.

1700
01:15:06,789 --> 01:15:09,729
It's over 50,000 won.

1701
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:13,569
2,580 yen.

1702
01:15:14,589 --> 01:15:15,849
I got it wrong.

1703
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:16,509
It's over.

1704
01:15:18,669 --> 01:15:20,149
It's over.

1705
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:23,569
Did you ask for a discount?

1706
01:15:25,149 --> 01:15:31,029
The person who will be eliminated in this round is...

1707
01:15:31,029 --> 01:15:31,809
Jennie.

1708
01:15:32,469 --> 01:15:33,389
Jennie, fighting.

1709
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:34,549
Jennie, fighting.

1710
01:15:36,209 --> 01:15:36,689
I can do it.

1711
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:38,989
Chanel went to Myeongdong, right?

1712
01:15:39,519 --> 01:15:41,269
What color were the gloves she bought in Myeongdong?

1713
01:15:42,089 --> 01:15:43,049
Please write it down.

1714
01:15:43,049 --> 01:15:45,129
What color were the gloves she bought in Myeongdong?

1715
01:15:45,129 --> 01:15:46,149
Please write it down.

1716
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:47,369
Did she buy gloves?

1717
01:15:47,829 --> 01:15:49,449
I don't know.

1718
01:15:52,189 --> 01:15:53,029
Myeongdong...

1719
01:15:53,029 --> 01:15:54,789
One, two, three.

1720
01:15:54,989 --> 01:15:55,789
Open.

1721
01:15:57,369 --> 01:15:58,489
What color is it?

1722
01:15:58,689 --> 01:15:59,309
Yellow.

1723
01:16:00,949 --> 01:16:02,629
And Chanel?

1724
01:16:03,009 --> 01:16:03,409
Mint.

1725
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:04,149
Justin?

1726
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:05,529
Red.

1727
01:16:07,789 --> 01:16:08,629
Mint.

1728
01:16:08,629 --> 01:16:09,769
Mint.

1729
01:16:10,109 --> 01:16:10,569
Mint.

1730
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:14,629
It's black.

1731
01:16:16,969 --> 01:16:17,769
Jennie.

1732
01:16:18,389 --> 01:16:20,129
I bought it, but I got a refund.

1733
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:23,589
I bought it, but I got a refund.

1734
01:16:23,989 --> 01:16:24,709
I bought it, but I got a refund.

1735
01:16:24,969 --> 01:16:25,729
I bought it, but I got a refund.

1736
01:16:25,729 --> 01:16:29,729
The answer is mint.

1737
01:16:29,729 --> 01:16:29,829
It's mint.

1738
01:16:35,669 --> 01:16:37,649
Let's guess the last question.

1739
01:16:39,429 --> 01:16:40,009
It's the last question.

1740
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,389
It's the last question.

1741
01:16:43,249 --> 01:16:45,869
There was a distance between Minnie's house and a bakery.

1742
01:16:52,069 --> 01:16:53,929
I told you.

1743
01:16:55,429 --> 01:16:56,249
I'll give you a hint.

1744
01:16:56,249 --> 01:16:56,869
How many meters?

1745
01:16:58,129 --> 01:17:00,009
How many meters?

1746
01:17:00,269 --> 01:17:00,889
In front of the house?

1747
01:17:01,929 --> 01:17:02,309
Open.

1748
01:17:03,769 --> 01:17:05,789
How many meters?

1749
01:17:06,149 --> 01:17:06,909
980.

1750
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:07,749
980.

1751
01:17:08,209 --> 01:17:12,509
It's right in front of Jennie's nose.

1752
01:17:12,909 --> 01:17:13,569
13 meters.

1753
01:17:15,929 --> 01:17:16,609
14 meters.

1754
01:17:18,209 --> 01:17:19,329
13 meters.

1755
01:17:19,789 --> 01:17:20,649
It looks delicious.

1756
01:17:21,289 --> 01:17:23,269
5 meters?

1757
01:17:23,269 --> 01:17:26,269
It's in the house.

1758
01:17:26,369 --> 01:17:27,109
5 meters?

1759
01:17:27,389 --> 01:17:28,369
It's in the bakery.

1760
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:30,089
It's in the house.

1761
01:17:32,329 --> 01:17:33,429
920 meters.

1762
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:35,269
The answer is...

1763
01:17:38,289 --> 01:17:39,029
920 meters.

1764
01:17:43,169 --> 01:17:45,389
We got the last question.

1765
01:17:46,489 --> 01:17:47,489
Daegu is out.

1766
01:17:49,629 --> 01:17:50,729
Leo is out.

1767
01:17:50,729 --> 01:17:51,669
Hyojung is out.

1768
01:17:51,829 --> 01:17:52,749
Minnie is out.

1769
01:17:53,789 --> 01:17:54,489
Jennie is out.

1770
01:17:57,249 --> 01:17:58,289
4 people are out.

1771
01:18:07,869 --> 01:18:09,369
4 people are out.

1772
01:18:10,309 --> 01:18:12,429
Let's pick the best one.

1773
01:18:15,309 --> 01:18:16,469
4 people who made it to the final round.

1774
01:18:16,469 --> 01:18:17,009
4 people who made it to the final round.

1775
01:18:18,209 --> 01:18:20,189
Let's go.

1776
01:18:24,309 --> 01:18:27,889
Justin booked a hospital on March 20th.

1777
01:18:30,169 --> 01:18:34,829
Jennie ran 7km every morning.

1778
01:18:35,329 --> 01:18:39,809
Minnie received a yellow rose and a purple Frisia.

1779
01:18:39,809 --> 01:18:40,889
She received a yellow rose as a gift.

1780
01:18:41,929 --> 01:18:43,249
If you want to go to Alberto's house...

1781
01:18:45,829 --> 01:18:47,149
If you want to go to the museum...

1782
01:18:47,149 --> 01:18:47,689
If you want to go to the museum...

1783
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:49,809
If you want to take bus 2118...

1784
01:18:50,789 --> 01:18:52,269
If you want to go to the broadcasting station...

1785
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:53,809
If you want to take bus 1208...

1786
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,129
If you want to go to Italy...

1787
01:18:56,129 --> 01:18:57,629
If you want to go to the conference center...

1788
01:18:57,629 --> 01:18:58,909
You have to take bus 8.

1789
01:19:01,009 --> 01:19:02,049
That's it.

1790
01:19:02,809 --> 01:19:03,789
That's it.

1791
01:19:04,329 --> 01:19:04,729
That's good.

1792
01:19:05,519 --> 01:19:06,309
Are you ready?

1793
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:06,429
Are you ready?

1794
01:19:06,769 --> 01:19:08,749
You have to communicate with your brain.

1795
01:19:09,989 --> 01:19:10,549
Let's go.

1796
01:19:12,009 --> 01:19:15,269
Justin booked a hospital for 2 days.

1797
01:19:16,449 --> 01:19:18,549
What day should he go?

1798
01:19:19,029 --> 01:19:20,929
He booked a hospital for 2 days.

1799
01:19:25,069 --> 01:19:27,889
He has to go 2 days earlier.

1800
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:30,109
What day should he go?

1801
01:19:30,929 --> 01:19:33,649
What day should he go?

1802
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:35,969
What day should he go?

1803
01:19:35,969 --> 01:19:37,989
Ah, it's a special day.

1804
01:19:38,309 --> 01:19:39,509
Ah, it's a special day.

1805
01:19:39,509 --> 01:19:40,949
It's a special day.

1806
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:42,689
It's written on March 18th.

1807
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:44,869
It's written on March 18th.

1808
01:19:45,669 --> 01:19:47,009
What day is it?

1809
01:19:48,069 --> 01:19:49,409
What day is it?

1810
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:50,209
What day is it?

1811
01:19:50,989 --> 01:19:52,049
Please write it down.

1812
01:19:53,229 --> 01:19:55,649
3, 2, 1.

1813
01:19:55,669 --> 01:19:56,569
It's not a question.

1814
01:19:57,889 --> 01:19:59,589
March 18th. Tuesday.

1815
01:20:00,149 --> 01:20:00,889
And Sunday.

1816
01:20:01,509 --> 01:20:03,389
Monday. Tuesday.

1817
01:20:03,389 --> 01:20:04,389
What's the answer?

1818
01:20:05,329 --> 01:20:07,709
The answer is...

1819
01:20:07,709 --> 01:20:09,209
Tuesday.

1820
01:20:12,549 --> 01:20:14,149
That's amazing.

1821
01:20:17,769 --> 01:20:19,049
It's really hard.

1822
01:20:19,829 --> 01:20:21,389
Since it's a special day, he has to go 2 days earlier.

1823
01:20:24,109 --> 01:20:25,309
My head hurts.

1824
01:20:26,969 --> 01:20:28,209
Let's move on.

1825
01:20:28,209 --> 01:20:28,869
Let's move on.

1826
01:20:28,929 --> 01:20:32,709
Jennie ran for 2 days in a week.

1827
01:20:33,289 --> 01:20:37,209
How many kilometers did she run?

1828
01:20:45,289 --> 01:20:45,829
Jennie.

1829
01:20:49,489 --> 01:20:50,029
Jennie.

1830
01:20:51,089 --> 01:20:51,529
Did you get the answer?

1831
01:20:52,409 --> 01:20:53,489
Jennie, you can write it down.

1832
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:54,489
Me?

1833
01:20:59,669 --> 01:21:00,689
3, 2, 1.

1834
01:21:00,849 --> 01:21:01,009
Open.

1835
01:21:03,209 --> 01:21:05,289
35 kilometers.

1836
01:21:05,849 --> 01:21:06,249
How about you?

1837
01:21:06,249 --> 01:21:07,409
Ah, 35.

1838
01:21:10,569 --> 01:21:12,789
The answer is...

1839
01:21:13,229 --> 01:21:13,749
30.

1840
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:16,389
The answer is...

1841
01:21:16,389 --> 01:21:16,829
35.

1842
01:21:21,289 --> 01:21:24,969
It's really hard.

1843
01:21:24,969 --> 01:21:26,729
It's really hard.

1844
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:30,129
Next question.

1845
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:33,849
What's the color of the rose that Minnie got as a gift?

1846
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:37,229
Rose?

1847
01:21:38,829 --> 01:21:39,089
Rose?

1848
01:21:42,269 --> 01:21:42,629
It's not.

1849
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:47,729
You can write it down.

1850
01:21:47,729 --> 01:21:50,189
3, 2,

1851
01:21:50,969 --> 01:21:52,649

3, 2,

1855
01:22:00,209 --> 01:22:00,229
3, 2, 1.

1856
01:22:00,269 --> 01:22:00,549
Open.

1857
01:22:01,329 --> 01:22:02,089
It's purple.

1858
01:22:03,509 --> 01:22:04,269
It's red.

1859
01:22:06,349 --> 01:22:10,409
There are 2 colors.

1860
01:22:10,949 --> 01:22:11,829
Purple and yellow.

1861
01:22:12,869 --> 01:22:13,889
What about the rose?

1862
01:22:14,169 --> 01:22:16,289
It's yellow.

1863
01:22:16,289 --> 01:22:17,029

It's purple.

1867
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:26,569
It's purple.

1868
01:22:27,169 --> 01:22:29,709
it's the last question.

1869
01:22:30,349 --> 01:22:31,369
What is it?

1870
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:34,409
The current winner is

1871
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:34,709
Chanel.

1872
01:22:35,489 --> 01:22:36,009
The current winner is

1873
01:22:36,009 --> 01:22:36,369
Chanel.

1874
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:38,389
I don't remember.

1875
01:22:38,389 --> 01:22:38,889
It's Chanel.

1876
01:22:39,919 --> 01:22:41,529
Alberto goes to many places by bus.

1877
01:22:42,869 --> 01:22:45,169
I don't remember.

1878
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:47,649
It's too hard.

1879
01:22:48,109 --> 01:22:48,509
It's too hard.

1880
01:22:48,849 --> 01:22:49,829
Alberto went to the broadcasting station

1881
01:22:49,829 --> 01:22:52,649
by bus number 1208.

1882
01:22:55,249 --> 01:22:56,769
He went to the museum

1883
01:22:56,769 --> 01:22:58,629

1884
01:23:01,129 --> 01:23:02,949
He took the bus number 8.

1885
01:23:02,949 --> 01:23:03,089
He took the bus number 8.

1886
01:23:03,809 --> 01:23:05,189
Where does Alberto want to go?

1887
01:23:11,349 --> 01:23:13,269
Write it down.

1888
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:14,249
3,

1889
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:16,609
3,

1890
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:18,589
3, 2,

1891
01:23:18,809 --> 01:23:19,649
3, 2, 1.

1892
01:23:19,949 --> 01:23:21,369
It's a house.

1893
01:23:22,509 --> 01:23:23,569
Jonathan's house.

1894
01:23:23,729 --> 01:23:25,409
Where is it?

1895
01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:27,269
It's the airport.

1896
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:29,129
That's right.

1897
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,549
Chanel's house.

1898
01:23:31,029 --> 01:23:32,329
The answer is?

1899
01:23:32,929 --> 01:23:33,429
It's Alberto.

1900
01:23:33,769 --> 01:23:35,089
The answer is?

1901
01:23:35,149 --> 01:23:37,669
It's the office.

1902
01:23:38,029 --> 01:23:38,689
That's right.

1903
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:44,769
Today's final winner

1904
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:45,549
is

1905
01:23:46,749 --> 01:23:48,269
Alberto and Chanel.

1906
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:52,109
Congratulations.

1907
01:23:53,289 --> 01:23:53,749
Congratulations.

1908
01:23:54,769 --> 01:23:56,249
You are really good at this.

1909
01:23:56,249 --> 01:23:58,109
S.A.T.

1910
01:23:58,369 --> 01:24:00,469
S.A.T. is correct.

1911
01:24:01,189 --> 01:24:02,149
It's not over until it's over.

1912
01:24:02,769 --> 01:24:03,249
Do you remember

1913
01:24:03,249 --> 01:24:04,769
that the candidates

1914
01:24:04,769 --> 01:24:05,849
wrote down the answer?

1915
01:24:07,169 --> 01:24:08,789
Let's see who got the right answer.

1916
01:24:09,389 --> 01:24:09,969
Who wrote the first sentence?

1917
01:24:10,669 --> 01:24:11,249
It's Jonathan.

1918
01:24:12,549 --> 01:24:13,989
How about Mimi?

1919
01:24:16,689 --> 01:24:18,149
She wrote the sentence like this.

1920
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:22,109
It's Leo.

1921
01:24:22,409 --> 01:24:24,249
It's Leo.

1922
01:24:24,249 --> 01:24:26,549
Leo, I think I'm good at Korean.

1923
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:28,029
Leo tried to be funny

1924
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:30,069
but he couldn't.

1925
01:24:36,729 --> 01:24:41,269
I laughed a lot.

1926
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:43,489
I didn't know you laughed a lot.

1927
01:24:43,869 --> 01:24:45,489
Jonathan wrote down

1928
01:24:45,489 --> 01:24:45,829
Jonathan.

1929
01:24:46,629 --> 01:24:50,069
That's right.

1930
01:24:50,069 --> 01:24:50,589
He's good.

1931
01:24:51,309 --> 01:24:52,169
He's confident.

1932
01:24:55,189 --> 01:24:57,989
What about the second one?

1933
01:25:00,389 --> 01:25:01,429
It's Justin.

1934
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:02,589
Justin was good.

1935
01:25:03,169 --> 01:25:05,049
I knew Justin would be good at this.

1936
01:25:06,289 --> 01:25:08,509
Who did Jonathan write down?

1937
01:25:08,849 --> 01:25:10,729
He wrote down Jennie.

1938
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:13,409
Jennie.

1939
01:25:13,629 --> 01:25:13,829
Jennie.

1940
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:15,369
Jennie.

1941
01:25:15,369 --> 01:25:15,689
He said Jennie was good.

1942
01:25:18,469 --> 01:25:21,809
I thought he would win.

1943
01:25:22,509 --> 01:25:25,129
Mimi and Justin.

1944
01:25:26,369 --> 01:25:27,629
It's 1 to 1.

1945
01:25:33,249 --> 01:25:35,509
Each team has a winner.

1946
01:25:35,549 --> 01:25:35,869
Who did you write down?

1947
01:25:37,169 --> 01:25:37,429
It's Chanel.

1948
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:38,949
It's Alberto.

1949
01:25:40,249 --> 01:25:41,489
It's a tie.

1950
01:25:41,489 --> 01:25:41,669
It's a tie.

1951
01:25:41,969 --> 01:25:43,649
Let's start with Jonathan.

1952
01:25:44,309 --> 01:25:44,569
Jonathan.

1953
01:25:46,469 --> 01:25:46,889
Alberto.

1954
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:54,049
Binnie.

1955
01:25:55,369 --> 01:25:55,729
Chanel.

1956
01:25:59,329 --> 01:26:00,749
It's a tie.

1957
01:26:01,529 --> 01:26:01,769
It's a tie.

1958
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:03,289
It's a tie.

1959
01:26:03,969 --> 01:26:04,409
It's a tie.

1960
01:26:05,289 --> 01:26:06,369
The water is hot.

1961
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:07,749
Now, everyone,

1962
01:26:07,889 --> 01:26:11,009
we will have the last vote.

1963
01:26:11,549 --> 01:26:14,309
We will give you the last chance to speak.

1964
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:15,389
No. 1 candidate,

1965
01:26:15,589 --> 01:26:16,509
Minnie, please stand up.

1966
01:26:23,459 --> 01:26:24,659
I've been a representative

1967
01:26:24,659 --> 01:26:27,479
for 3 years in Thailand.

1968
01:26:28,919 --> 01:26:31,319
I think I have a lot of experience.

1969
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:34,659
My grandparents

1970
01:26:35,059 --> 01:26:38,119
have a resort in Thailand.

1971
01:26:39,499 --> 01:26:42,859
You can go there to relax.

1972
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:47,839
You can also take classes there, right?

1973
01:26:47,979 --> 01:26:48,939
You can do everything there.

1974
01:26:49,399 --> 01:26:50,639
The swimming pool is huge.

1975
01:26:51,159 --> 01:26:52,159
You can get a massage there.

1976
01:26:53,579 --> 01:26:54,959
You can also see the deer.

1977
01:26:57,039 --> 01:26:58,859
The deer is the best.

1978
01:26:59,099 --> 01:27:01,019
You can see the deer as much as you want.

1979
01:27:01,019 --> 01:27:01,299
It's a tie.

1980
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:03,779
Shall we vote?

1981
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:07,959
No, we don't need to vote.

1982
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:08,499
It's a tie.

1983
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:10,819
It was a story about Minnie

1984
01:27:10,819 --> 01:27:11,659
who can even film overseas.

1985
01:27:14,899 --> 01:27:16,159
Now, Jonathan.

1986
01:27:16,559 --> 01:27:20,039
This is the last chance to speak.

1987
01:27:20,039 --> 01:27:21,579
I've listened to all of your speeches.

1988
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:24,419
At the end of your speech,

1989
01:27:24,659 --> 01:27:25,279
you always said,

1990
01:27:25,339 --> 01:27:26,259
I'm good at this.

1991
01:27:26,259 --> 01:27:27,799
I'm the best.

1992
01:27:28,339 --> 01:27:29,719
I didn't say you're the best.

1993
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:31,859
Hold on, Minnie.

1994
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:37,599
Don't let her down.

1995
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:41,639
I'm not good at this.

1996
01:27:42,519 --> 01:27:43,579
I'm not good at this.

1997
01:27:45,959 --> 01:27:47,259
I'm not good at this.

1998
01:27:48,279 --> 01:27:50,019
I'm not good at this.

1999
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:50,579
I'm not good at this.

2000
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:51,859
Don't scream.

2001
01:27:54,139 --> 01:27:55,799
You still have a chance.

2002
01:27:57,119 --> 01:27:58,099
I'm going to find

2003
01:27:58,099 --> 01:27:59,599
a famous place in Korea.

2004
01:28:02,119 --> 01:28:03,879
I'm going to film in Korea.

2005
01:28:07,339 --> 01:28:15,259
I'm going to vote for Minnie.

2006
01:28:16,059 --> 01:28:16,719
I'm going to vote for Minnie.

2007
01:28:21,739 --> 01:28:22,339
She's crying.

2008
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:22,639
Please give her a hug.

2009
01:28:24,819 --> 01:28:25,739
I'm so sad.

2010
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:26,699
I'm going to cry.

2011
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:29,559
I'm so sad.

2012
01:28:30,519 --> 01:28:31,339
Let's vote.

2013
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:33,859
You can choose one of them

2014
01:28:33,859 --> 01:28:35,379
or vote for another.

2015
01:28:35,599 --> 01:28:37,519
One person will go to the voting place

2016
01:28:37,519 --> 01:28:39,939
and write down the name of the person

2017
01:28:40,559 --> 01:28:43,219
And we will include the teacher

2018
01:28:44,299 --> 01:28:45,299
and the teacher's assistant.

2019
01:28:46,839 --> 01:28:47,479
There are teachers' assistants.

2020
01:28:48,599 --> 01:28:49,239
They are here.

2021
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:52,699
Let's vote one by one.

2022
01:28:53,219 --> 01:28:53,839
Leo, you can start.

2023
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:56,159
This is amazing.

2024
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:57,279
He's doing it right.

2025
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:01,479
He's doing it right.

2026
01:29:02,139 --> 01:29:04,759
He's trying to hide it.

2027
01:29:04,819 --> 01:29:06,259
He's trying to hide it.

2028
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:08,659
You can hide it.

2029
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:10,019
You can come out and put it in here.

2030
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:11,819
This is my first time.

2031
01:29:12,939 --> 01:29:14,259
Chanel, you can go in.

2032
01:29:14,259 --> 01:29:15,959
Let's see if they have changed their minds.

2033
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:18,299
Or will they vote for Minnie

2034
01:29:18,299 --> 01:29:22,039
and go to the resort

2035
01:29:22,039 --> 01:29:22,599
where everyone can have fun.

2036
01:29:23,459 --> 01:29:24,199
And see the deer.

2037
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:25,059
And see the deer.

2038
01:29:25,739 --> 01:29:26,199
And go to the beach.

2039
01:29:26,979 --> 01:29:30,479
The voting is over.

2040
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:31,419
Now,

2041
01:29:31,939 --> 01:29:32,779
I'm going to announce

2042
01:29:32,779 --> 01:29:33,679
in front of you.

2043
01:29:35,059 --> 01:29:37,859
No.1 is Minnie.

2044
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:40,179
And No.2 is

2045
01:29:40,179 --> 01:29:40,539
Jonathan.

2046
01:29:40,539 --> 01:29:41,359
Now,

2047
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:44,239
the voting begins.

2048
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:46,479
The first vote.

2049
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:46,999
Start.

2050
01:29:48,859 --> 01:29:50,439
This is my first time.

2051
01:29:52,299 --> 01:29:53,459
Jonathan.

2052
01:29:54,579 --> 01:29:58,439
The second one.

2053
01:29:58,519 --> 01:29:59,239
This is amazing.

2054
01:30:00,619 --> 01:30:01,199
Jonathan.

2055
01:30:03,059 --> 01:30:05,699
He's going up.

2056
01:30:06,059 --> 01:30:06,779
What is this?

2057
01:30:06,779 --> 01:30:07,099
What is this?

2058
01:30:08,099 --> 01:30:09,219
What is this?

2059
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:12,639
Minnie.

2060
01:30:15,959 --> 01:30:16,559
Minnie.

2061
01:30:17,299 --> 01:30:18,399
Now, it's 2 to 2.

2062
01:30:19,259 --> 01:30:20,199
It's 2 to 2.

2063
01:30:21,619 --> 01:30:22,439
It's a tie.

2064
01:30:23,339 --> 01:30:23,939
Next.

2065
01:30:29,019 --> 01:30:29,619
Jonathan.

2066
01:30:29,619 --> 01:30:30,119
Jonathan.

2067
01:30:30,839 --> 01:30:31,919
Jonathan.

2068
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:38,219
What is this?

2069
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:40,379
It's close.

2070
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:43,359
It's a tie.

2071
01:30:46,919 --> 01:30:47,279
It's a tie.

2072
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:47,919
It's a tie.
Are you going to reveal

2073
01:30:47,959 --> 01:30:48,659
what you voted for?

2074
01:30:50,139 --> 01:30:52,859
Why do you keep asking questions?

2075
01:30:52,859 --> 01:30:54,479
I'm just curious.

2076
01:30:56,699 --> 01:30:57,499
Jonathan.

2077
01:30:58,259 --> 01:30:59,159
We both like Africa.

2078
01:31:00,019 --> 01:31:01,019
Go, Africa.

2079
01:31:02,179 --> 01:31:03,899
Everyone, I'm with you.

2080
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:04,979
Next.

2081
01:31:05,799 --> 01:31:06,599
Minnie.

2082
01:31:10,379 --> 01:31:11,699
You can't go like this.

2083
01:31:12,519 --> 01:31:13,179
You can't go like this.

2084
01:31:13,939 --> 01:31:14,779
It's 3 to 3.

2085
01:31:16,279 --> 01:31:17,079
It's 3 to 3.

2086
01:31:18,519 --> 01:31:21,139
Why am I so nervous?

2087
01:31:22,139 --> 01:31:23,459
Minnie.

2088
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:27,519
Next.

2089
01:31:28,839 --> 01:31:29,299
Minnie.

2090
01:31:29,939 --> 01:31:30,299
Jonathan.

2091
01:31:31,239 --> 01:31:31,639
Minnie.

2092
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,299
Don't look at it like that.

2093
01:31:46,139 --> 01:31:47,419
Next.

2094
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:52,379
I...

2095
01:31:53,159 --> 01:31:54,099
It's Minnie.

2096
01:31:54,499 --> 01:31:55,139
Minnie.

2097
01:31:57,959 --> 01:31:59,799
No, no.

2098
01:32:00,339 --> 01:32:01,179
I'm the only one left.

2099
01:32:01,499 --> 01:32:01,819
Isn't it a tie?

2100
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:03,879
It's a tie.

2101
01:32:06,459 --> 01:32:07,079
Jonathan.

2102
01:32:10,219 --> 01:32:10,299
Jonathan.

2103
01:32:10,299 --> 01:32:10,599
Jonathan.

2104
01:32:10,739 --> 01:32:12,799
The first president

2105
01:32:12,799 --> 01:32:14,019
of Knowing Bros

2106
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:17,019
is Minnie.

2107
01:32:21,139 --> 01:32:21,999
Oh my god.

2108
01:32:32,839 --> 01:32:34,879
I want to go to Thailand.

2109
01:32:36,299 --> 01:32:37,879
I really want to go to Thailand.

2110
01:32:40,039 --> 01:32:40,919
Minnie.

2111
01:32:41,779 --> 01:32:42,039
Congratulations.

2112
01:32:44,259 --> 01:32:44,899
Until the day

2113
01:32:44,899 --> 01:32:46,319
everyone goes to Knowing Bros,

2114
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:47,959
start.

2115
01:32:47,959 --> 01:32:49,659
Go, go.

2116
01:32:49,799 --> 01:32:50,799
Let's go.

2117
01:32:51,559 --> 01:32:55,819
You're already here?

2118
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,039
Teacher, a friend is here.

2119
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:01,699
If I were to describe it in one word,

2120
01:33:02,559 --> 01:33:03,419
it's a super car.

2121
01:33:07,059 --> 01:33:08,279
Today's show is

2122
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:09,319
a show to hide

2123
01:33:09,319 --> 01:33:11,679
your partner's hobby.

2124
01:33:12,099 --> 01:33:12,699
It's been 5 days.

2125
01:33:14,749 --> 01:33:15,539
Is it Yuqi?

2126
01:33:15,539 --> 01:33:17,299
But she's a female idol.

2127
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:20,039
She had constipation 3 days ago,

2128
01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:21,319
but she got better yesterday.

2129
01:33:24,249 --> 01:33:25,639
I'm so sorry.

2130
01:33:26,039 --> 01:33:26,859
Oh my god.

2131
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:28,859
It's a game to build

2132
01:33:28,859 --> 01:33:30,299
physical friendship.

2133
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:38,619
The person in the middle

2134
01:33:38,619 --> 01:33:40,019
wins.

2135
01:33:45,539 --> 01:33:46,999
Oh my god.

2136
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:49,399
Oh my god.
