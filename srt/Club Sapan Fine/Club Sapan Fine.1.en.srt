00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,190
Young ladies.

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,720
Have you ever disappointed in love?

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,740
So hurtful and dumb.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,960
How did you get through it?

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,830
Going to a party?

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,050
Too ordinary.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,970
Or open a table to cry about it?

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,700
So yesterday.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,740
Things like this you need gossip about it!

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:35,000
Since our establishment, we've collected
8 super dumb love stories.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,940
All of them to teach us...

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,950
if you get hurt then
remember that person.

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,600
Get hurt and endure it is dumb!!!

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,060
If you're ready, welcome
everyone to the radio program...

Sawasdee kha, I'm DJ Toen,
everyone's old friend.

28
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,110
I believe there are
many kinds of love.

29
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,590
There is perfect love
and there is undesired love.

30
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,210
There's also these stupid love...

31
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,920
the kind that engraved in the
heart and will never be forgotten.

32
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,470
Alright, if you don't know where
to vent it out, please come here.

Because this is the
Club Sapan Fai radio program!

34
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,070
So our topic today titled...

35
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,120
"Everything you said is untrue,
how dumb of me to still believe you".

36
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,810
I give special one for you.

37
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,130
God, who came with this topic.
So straight to the point.

38
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,730
So, now we have a call coming in.

39
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,550
Sawasdee kha.

40
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,920
<i>Sawasdee kha, P'Toen.</i>

41
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,800
Introduce yourself.

42
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,210
<i>My name is In.</i>

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,070
<i>Today...</i>

44
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,540
<i>I'm going to tell
you a story of a thief.</i>

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,770
The thief I'm talking about is
the worst person I've ever met.

46
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,780
OK, miss.

47
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,200
How is a thief related to love?

48
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,080
How cruel was it?

49
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,110
N'In, tell us.

50
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,220
First of all,
if you read my profile...

51
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,010
you'll know that
I'm a beautiful woman...

52
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,000
rich...

53
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,010
have a good life.

54
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,480
And most importantly...

55
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,570
I have a perfect and
handsome boyfriend.

56
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,850
So beautiful.

57
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,710
Do you like it?

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,960
P'Boom.

59
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,400
Don't buy
things too often for me.

60
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm courteous.

61
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,710
Is that so?

62
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,970
Good.

63
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,110
Then, I don't have to
buy anything next time, right?

64
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,260
I'm kidding.

65
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,700
Let's get some dinner,
I've reserved a place.

66
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,880
Alright.

67
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,840
If that's the case,
let me change my earrings first.

68
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,670
I'm gonna pair them with
the necklace you bought me.

69
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,960
Actually, we can just
go for dinner as you are now.

70
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,070
You're already
very beautiful as you are.

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,480
P'Boom, you're doing it again.

72
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,970
Where are they?

73
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,480
What's wrong?

74
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,720
I can't find my earrings.

75
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,720
Maybe you put
them in your handbag.

76
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,010
I remember that
I really put them here.

77
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,440
Are they in the box?

78
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,520
What are you laughing at?

79
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,990
A forgetful woman like you,
I can always take of you.

80
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,870
P'Boom.

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,640
You're already beautiful as you are.

82
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,700
But I think nothing
in the world is perfect.

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,430
Same as my life.

84
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,710
Although everything
are all looks perfect...

85
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,870
there are things that
are still lows in my life, which is...

86
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,540
What should we eat?

87
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,710
Going out while
exposing that breast out?

88
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,460
On, wanna join us for dinner?

89
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,910
This restaurant is good.

90
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,830
Go...

91
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,450
both of you.

92
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,020
Go ahead,
I don't to be a third wheel.

93
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,990
Because...

94
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,940
P'In said that you'll
buy a big meal for me, right?

95
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,480
You're so kind to your brother.

96
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,670
Yes.

97
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,210
But it's a pity
we can't eat together.

98
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,330
- P'Boom.
- Yes?

99
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,280
Why don't you wait for me in the car?

100
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,770
I need to talk
to my brother for a bit.

101
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,350
OK, I'll wait in the car.

102
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,130
On, I'm leaving now.

103
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,690
- OK, Sawasdee krub.
- Sawasdee krub.

104
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,600
I'll be right with you.

105
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,530
Always getting on my nerves.

106
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,820
No job, all day just...

107
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,720
How do you know that I don't work?

108
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,420
Sitting and
sleeping at home all day.

109
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,920
Look, you don't even
put away your junk foods.

110
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,370
Is your work called "Lazy Selling"?

111
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,540
Aren't you
embarrassed to the guest?

112
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,020
It's our house.

113
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,460
Just act natural,
no need to have so many rules.

114
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,010
Getting on my nerves?

115
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,990
You wanna play?

116
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,280
Yes?

117
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,580
On!

118
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,690
I'm talking to the phone.

119
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,340
- So what?
- I'm talking to the phone.

120
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,610
It's a customer,
aren't you embarrassed?

121
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,370
Hello.

122
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,720
The only thought that
will get me to stay with him is...

123
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,790
I thought of him as
the house watchdog.

124
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,690
Are you still thinking
about the earrings?

125
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,930
How about this?

126
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,590
The next time I come back,
I'll buy you a new one.

127
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,880
That's not necessary, P'Boom.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,180
Tomorrow,
I'll look for it more thoroughly.

129
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,000
So, when will you be back again?

130
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,590
Maybe next Saturday.

131
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,460
I don't know if
anyone here will miss me.

132
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,760
I will miss you just like you miss me.

133
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,840
I miss you all the time.

134
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,510
Can you handle that?

135
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,660
You always exaggerating.

136
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,150
It's the truth.

137
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,450
Like I said...

138
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,910
our life are not perfect.

139
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,380
In the end,
what I didn't expect to encounter...

140
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,170
it happened.

141
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,520
He didn't even keep away his stuffs.

142
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,430
Didn't even shut
down his laptop after use.

143
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,580
Genuine second-hand jewelry store.

144
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,250
Second-hand jewelry rental/buying shop.

145
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,910
Second-hand jewelry shop with good price.

146
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,330
Yes, as I said, other things are hard to sell.

147
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,250
Best selling second-hand jewelry.

148
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,140
You saw it.

149
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,800
I know that you need money.

150
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,150
But this kind of thing
takes time, you need to wait.

151
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,480
Don't tell me...

152
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,180
OK, I will try my best to find it
for you, just two or three days.

153
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,870
At that time, I didn't want
what I thought to be the case.

154
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,630
So I rush to check my
things in my room.

155
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,200
Everything seems to be in order.

156
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,850
But when I look more carefully...

157
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,610
I realized that aside from
the missing pearl earrings...

158
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,870
there's also a set of crystal
drop-shaped necklaces and earrings...

159
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,760
but only the necklace is left.

160
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:05,070
A set of olive leaf gold jewelry with
bracelets, earrings, rings and necklaces.

161
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,610
most are all missing.

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,610
Even the Reflect the Light
set that I love and cherish...

163
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,450
just the bracelet and earrings left.

164
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,610
On.

165
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,530
OK, OK, OK.

166
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,830
Actually, I want to ask you, how do
you remember so much and so detailed?

167
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,830
But what I know most right now...

168
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,230
what made you sure it was
your brother who took everything?

169
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,240
Why didn't you think there's a thief sneak
into your house and stole your stuff?

170
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,950
If it really was a house thief...

171
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,760
why didn't they took them all?

172
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,540
Why is he being so selective?

173
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,030
<i>Besides, there's only
the two of us in the house.</i>

174
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,640
If it's not On, who else would it be?

175
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,380
But wait.

176
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,140
What about that guy, your boyfriend?
He used to came into the house, right?

177
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,010
At first, he did come
and visit from times to times.

178
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,290
But what lunatic would give you
something and then steal it himself?

179
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,810
After hearing what
you said, it might be N'On.

180
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,800
So, what's next for the story?

181
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,710
I was so mad at the time.

182
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,990
But I suppressed it because I believe
that my brother is not that kind of person.

183
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,260
So I went and talked nicely to him first.

184
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,450
Confess to me right away,
that you are selling my stuff, right?

185
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,290
Are you crazy, P'In?

186
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,840
Don't pretend you don't know.

187
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,970
I saw that you were searching
for a secondhand jewelry store.

188
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,640
Then my jewelries are gone.

189
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,270
You were talking to the
phone earlier, what's that mean?

190
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,680
There's no secret in this house, right?

191
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,050
Secretly looking my computer,
eavesdrop on my phone calls.

192
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,860
My girlfriend owns
a secondhand jewelry store.

193
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,090
Are you crazy?

194
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,070
Wait, wait.

195
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,260
So, you're not
gonna confess that you...

196
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,630
3rd Mother

197
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,700
On.

198
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,200
If your phone ringing again...

199
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,180
I'll throw it away.

200
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,170
On.

201
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,470
you're selling my stuff, right?

202
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,300
On! Tell me now!

203
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,730
Ai'On, confess!

204
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,160
How can I do that to you?

205
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,950
Ever since I was born...

206
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,910
there are only the two of siblings.

207
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,200
Why do you like to beat me up?

208
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,800
If our parents knew,
what whould they say?

209
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,170
They taught you to love your brother.

210
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,610
Have you?

211
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,750
I have always respected you.

212
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,190
But you...

213
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,850
Do you think I'll give up on this?

214
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,990
I will never let you go!

215
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,100
I'll tell mom that you stole my stuff!

216
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,330
I'm going to tell
mom you beat me every day.

217
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,430
Where can I go?

218
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,090
You come to slander me as a thief.

219
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,630
Mom won't believe you.

220
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,020
She will.

221
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,630
Mom will definitely believe me...

222
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,160
because I have proof.

223
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
E'On!

224
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,260
This is how you wanna play?

225
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,740
This is how you wanna play?

226
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,760
If you really think I did it...

227
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,270
find some evident.

228
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,450
If no, shut up!

229
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,180
E'On!

230
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,290
Hello, yes?

231
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,410
I was playing with a dog.

232
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,630
Lampam!
<i>[ "Lampam" means insult someone that
touch upon/related to other things ]</i>

233
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,370
There's no Lampam
here, this area is Raminthra.
<i>[ Play on words because it sound similar ]</i>

234
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,830
Raminthra, your fathe...

235
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,240
I can't insult,
we share the same father.

236
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,780
I woke up a long time ago.
Who do you mean just woke up?

237
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,090
Ever since P'In and
On fought that day...

238
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,920
After a few days,
On rushed out of the house strangely.

239
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,040
I'm on the road now.

240
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,470
Yes, I'm on the road.

241
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm on a bike.

242
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,560
Do you hear the wind?

243
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,830
A car is coming.
That was so noisy.

244
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,220
How is he driving?

245
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,730
I've talked to him,
he won't bail on us.

246
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,840
Worry about him bailing,
worry about me going...

247
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,850
Nothing.

248
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,040
P', you're going the wrong way.

249
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,110
Hold on, I'm gonna scold the rider.

250
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,710
P', this is not the right way.

251
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,190
Yeah, turn back.

252
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,080
Do you want to beat me?
I have things to do.

253
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,970
Wait, I'm gonna run or I'll be late. OK.

254
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,410
Do you think
I found out too late, Ai'On?

255
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,310
He didn't put it back.

256
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,100
Didn't even turn off the fan!

257
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,540
You're dead meat.

258
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,350
Which way was it?
I can't remember.

259
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,170
First left, left. Then...

260
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,510
Is that a human?

261
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,690
It looks like a human.

262
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,030
But...

263
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,530
a quiet market like this...

264
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,390
who is he selling to?

265
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,590
Why is it getting darker?

266
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,420
On.

267
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,990
Don't you want to buy a piece today?

268
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,580
I have many of that already.

269
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,650
They're all beautiful here.

270
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,800
No, it'll be broken when I buy it.

271
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,880
Miss, buy a watch.

272
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,290
It's cheap.

273
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,840
Why is it getting scarier?

274
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,360
Don't tell me...

275
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,470
you're drug addict?!

276
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,900
Everything I saw at that time...

277
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,560
made me stop believing On.

278
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,980
Are you really stealing
my stuff to buy drugs, Ai'On?

279
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,820
How could you do this?

280
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,470
P'Toen, I was suspicious
and confused back then.

281
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,300
I thought...

282
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,850
what did I do wrong?
How bad was I taking care of him?

283
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,720
<i>Or am I too
emotional for my brother?</i>

284
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,820
But when I look at it again...

285
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,650
it's clearly his nature.

286
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,290
Ai'On!

287
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,230
Who are you?!

288
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,780
Thief!

289
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,840
P'In?!

290
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,490
How did you find me?

291
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,160
You jerk little brother!

292
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,280
You're really selling my stuff!

293
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,780
Caught you red-handed.
What are you gonna say now?

294
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,650
What is this, On?

295
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,990
Don't pretend to not know.

296
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,560
You two work
together to sell my stuff?

297
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,530
That's not it.
You got the wrong idea.

298
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,850
Shut up.

299
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,520
I remember which
of my stuff is missing.

300
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,210
What?

301
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,090
Pearl earrings,
a set of olive leaf gold jewelry...

302
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,730
and my Reflect
of the Light collection.

303
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,470
In addition..

304
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,060
Why don't you open and look?

305
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,190
Fine, On.

306
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,710
It's not it, right?

307
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,760
My girlfriend buys second-hand
stuff. This guy sells them.

308
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,990
Then...

309
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,210
Then why are you
being sneaky about it?

310
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,670
I'm getting married.

311
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,800
But I don't have enough money.

312
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,070
So I took the jewelry
at home and sold it first.

313
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,750
But only at this market because my
future mother-in-law knows a lot of people.

314
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,140
Afraid that people might tells her about this,
it'll be an embarrassment to her.

315
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,670
So I asked him to come when...

316
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,550
others stores aren't open yet.

317
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,370
Other shops not open yet?

318
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,460
Is it really that clear?

319
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,590
The "Night Market"
sign as you're entering here...

320
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,760
didn't tell you that?

321
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,890
Songkran Night Market

322
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,400
I wasn't looking.

323
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,660
Arrogant, bossy, short-sighting!

324
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,050
It's not enough that
you misunderstand others.

325
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,550
You didn't even look around!

326
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,910
At the time...

327
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,830
everyone feel sorry and took
pity that I misunderstood my brother.

328
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,400
Just then there's a woman coming in...

329
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,380
as accidental as
it was written in a novel.

330
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,320
She was wearing the same
necklace and earrings I was looking for.

331
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:59,270
At first, I thought anyone
might have a similar jewelry.

332
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,390
But 2 similar jewelries?

333
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,110
So I went away from my brother...

334
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,010
- even though I was
still felt guilty about it.
- Wait!

335
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,280
P'In!

336
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,790
Did you see that?

337
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,130
She pushed my head.

338
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,030
Was it my fault?

339
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,740
I'll be back!

340
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,900
P'In!

341
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,220
I tried very hard to calm myself
even though I'm about to burst.

342
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,900
Aside from those two
that are same as mine...

343
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,030
She has another
set of olive leaf jewelry.

344
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:38,600
There is no way that this woman
is anything else except the thief.

345
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,280
So did she realized...

346
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,860
that you were following her?

347
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,970
No, she had no idea.

348
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,730
I was very quiet.

349
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,090
I finally caught you, E'thief.

350
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,060
What did you say?

351
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,100
E'thief!

352
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,780
You can talk nicely, what thief?

353
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,920
You're the thief!

354
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,670
You're the thief!

355
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,170
I've been following you for a while.

356
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,830
All sneaky and ghostly.

357
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,000
Before you went to that
store and sell your stuff.

358
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,000
Confused as to how I knew?

359
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,770
It's the necklace you're
wearing. It's made of chains.

360
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,000
With a round pearl strung on it.

361
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,080
It can only be ordered at that
store and not available elsewhere!

362
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,650
Look at yourself first.
What you're wearing doesn't match!

363
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,140
Because the whole set is with me.

364
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,970
Yes, that's true!

365
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,240
Take it off and give it to me now.

366
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,360
If you take it off and give it
back to me, I won't sue you.

367
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,700
If not...

368
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,280
I'll lodge a police report.

369
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,710
You even dare to sue me?

370
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,110
It's me who should lodge
a police report. Give it back.

371
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,210
You should give
me back what's mine.

372
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,390
Give what's mine!

373
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,750
Are you gonna
steal my whole outfit?

374
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,680
This bitch has
a very long arms. Come here!

375
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,310
You slapped me?

376
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,970
Yeah, so what?!

377
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,780
So what, you said?

378
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,210
You slapped me, didn't you?!

379
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,240
Bitch, let me go!

380
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,370
Excuse me, P'.

381
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,790
P'In.

382
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,760
Calm down, P'.

383
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,040
What are you doing?

384
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,540
What's the matter?

385
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,230
I'm going to
teach this thief a lesson!

386
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,980
Thief?!

387
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,100
E'On, are you helping me or her?!

388
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,960
Oh yeah. Hey, calm down.

389
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,390
You two, calm down!

390
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,910
What are you fighting for?

391
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,570
We...

392
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,550
don't have to use violent.

393
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,910
Nosy!

394
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,190
Give me back what's mine!

395
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,700
These are given by my boyfriend,
why did you stole them?!

396
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,570
You're the one who stole it!

397
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,590
Where did you stole them?

398
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,220
Hit her on the ground, hit her!

399
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,270
Serve you right.

400
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,920
You shouldn't play with fire.

401
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,310
Or you'll get beaten.

402
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,330
I know right?

403
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,220
That's you.

404
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,290
E'On!

405
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,180
So, you're claiming that your boyfriend
bought you these jewelries, right?

406
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,310
Yes!

407
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,340
You too?

408
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,460
Yes.

409
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,530
I've asked my colleague
to call your boyfriend over.

410
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,010
He's on the way.

411
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,840
We'll listen to his testament
again before making a decision.

412
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,950
What more do you
want to hear, Mr. Policeman?

413
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,840
Just arrest her. It's obvious!

414
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,470
Arrest her too.

415
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,020
The evidences are
clearly right in front you.

416
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,580
Arrest her.

417
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,770
Who's boyfriend is he?

418
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,110
- Mine!
- Mine!

419
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,610
Darling.

420
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,860
Honey.

421
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,500
P'Boom.

422
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,470
Nosy!

423
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,690
Honey, do you have a mistress?

424
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,950
You're the mistress.

425
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,020
You're the mistress!

426
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,250
You're the mistress!

427
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,950
Hey, you stole
my boyfriend, didn't you?

428
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,340
Do you know how hard
it is to find a decent man?!

429
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,700
Calm down.

430
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,040
You shameless!

431
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,190
Mr. Policeman...

432
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,990
Hey, calm down!

433
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,260
I'm confused, Miss.
I'm really confused.

434
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,150
The people all over the country who are listening are stunned, Miss In.

435
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,270
So, what exactly is the truth?

436
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,270
Who stole whose stuff and
who snatched whose boyfriend?

437
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,230
The truth is...

438
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,250
no one snatches the others' boyfriend.

439
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,620
P'Boom confessed that he
really did date 2 people at once.

440
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,440
The other woman didn't know too.

441
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,170
As for the jewelries...

442
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,490
he stole from one of
them and gave it to the other.

443
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,150
So he won't have to buy a new one.

444
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,100
So cute.

445
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,720
It goes well with the pearl
necklace you gave me.

446
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,410
I'll put it on for you to see.

447
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,730
Look, I keep it here...

448
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,380
Where is it?

449
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,630
I put it here, do you remember?

450
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,150
I remember.

451
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,600
You always forget things.

452
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,500
No, honey. I'm very
thorough when keeping things.

453
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,980
I don't think I'd forget things like this.

454
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,530
It's alright.

455
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,160
a rambunctious woman like you...

456
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,720
is cute.

457
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,350
By the way...

458
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,330
you got a present now...

459
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,140
but I haven't received my reward yet.

460
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,550
He was never
caught so he keep doing it.

461
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,800
Until things turn out the way you see it.

462
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,040
That bitch Boom!

463
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,670
That jerk!

464
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,790
Sorry, listeners, but I really can't stand it.

465
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,470
What kind of guy is this?
Stingy and date 2 person at once.

466
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:53,630
Whoever has a bomb,
throw one at his house and kill him!

467
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,990
Now that you know, you cut
off the relationship with him, right?

468
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,120
Yes!

469
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,040
I was so angry.

470
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,250
So I thought I will definitely never
waste my tears for that kind of man.

471
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,690
Calm down, get a hold of yourself.

472
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,530
You're not dead yet.

473
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,090
Calm down.

474
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,290
That's how it is, Mr. Policeman.

475
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,970
As for you two ladies,
since both of them are victims...

476
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,840
how do you want to deal with it?

477
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,290
I need a time off.

478
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,620
Mr. Policeman,
is she gonna hit me again?

479
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,490
Come here.

480
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,870
You're crying and look
like Joker now. Come here.

481
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,210
Don't look at him.

482
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,460
Don't look at his eyes!

483
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,890
I don't take to
heart about the jewelry.

484
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,330
But we can't let
anyone deceive us again.

485
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,040
I think he deserves the punishment.

486
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,440
We won't be deceived again!

487
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,490
Yes!

488
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,690
So he can't deceive anyone else!

489
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,780
Yes!

490
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,810
OK?

491
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,230
Mr. Policeman.

492
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,710
I don't take to
heart about the thieving.

493
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,840
All the good times we had together.

494
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,680
But...

495
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,700
But I...

496
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,070
I'm breaking up with P'Boom.

497
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,430
From now on, we'll be separated.
I don't want to see his face again.

498
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,870
OK, clear.

499
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,210
What about you, Miss Arging?

500
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,270
I won't pursue the
case of the stealing jewelry.

501
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,200
It's all external stuff,
you can buy it anytime.

502
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,800
But...

503
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:35,720
I don't where else to find
another decent guy like him.

504
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,440
Honey, I forgive you.

505
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,610
I'll continue to date him.

506
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,920
OK, clear.

507
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,360
That's not what we talked about.

508
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,690
That's not what we talked about.

509
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,250
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

510
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,710
That's not what we talked about!

511
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,820
Mr. Policeman, you should arrest her!

512
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,560
Mr. Policeman, help me. Arrest her.

513
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,100
P'Boom, run! Mr. Policeman.

514
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,140
P'Boom!!!

515
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,270
Like that?

516
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,070
In, so how? They just
walk away with such a swagger?

517
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,880
My God, my Lord.
After listening to your story...

518
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,000
it really matches our topic.

519
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,740
"Everything you said is untrue,
how dumb of me to still believe you".

520
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,800
<i>But in the end, I'm hurt.</i>

521
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,850
Because the dumbest
person in this case...

522
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,830
is me.

523
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,850
In, dear.

524
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,910
Honestly...

525
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,710
I think...

526
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,840
the dumbest person in this case...

527
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,790
is not you.

528
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,290
Who then?

529
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,810
<i>Oh, In.</i>

530
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,930
Who then?

531
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,620
Why only these left?

532
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,670
Boom, you asshole!

533
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,880
To whom you're
stealing from me now?!

534
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,520
Remember girls...

535
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:27,890
In the war of love,
