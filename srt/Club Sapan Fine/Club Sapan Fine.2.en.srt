It's to let everyone know that we are not alone
in this world that eats grass instead of rice.
<i>[ It refers to buffalo because buffalo in Thai is
"kwai" a slang for calling someone "stupid" ]</i>

13
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,920

It's no strange that he is so hot.

35
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,330
The mistake of an ordinary
girl like me, I was too careless.

37
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,460
Do you have a problem?

Look at her.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,880
Don't do it, E'Pan.

41
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,000

Let's do it tomorrow.

59
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,770
I can give it to him for you.

E'Pan, are you
trying to cut me off?

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,250
Because you're not willing to do it.

62

63
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,780

Yes, it's mine.

But next time,
if you wanna give it to me...

83
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,940
you should give
it properly by hand.

84
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,060

Of course.

91
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,400
Shit.

92
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,410
Do you know
that all the gifts he got...

93
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,100
he never eat them.

94

but he also drank some.

96
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,030
Seriously...

97
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,730
did you put some
drugs in it or something?

98
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,200
What drugs?

99
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,720

which biker punk did
you take my soy milk to.

105
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,890
P'Chang is not a biker punk.

106

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,030

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,450

111
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,640
She's my friend.

No.

And I heard that
here is very delicious.

125
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,180
So I came to buy some.

126
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,100
But next time you don't
have to come and buy.

127
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,670
I can give it to you.

it to you for today.

How can I do that?
Whoever buys, they have to pay.

It's alright.

you don't have to pay them, right?

134
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,460
Besides, it's a leftover.

00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,600
I mean...

136
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,480

137
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,380
In that case...

138
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,920
I won't be courteous.

139
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,570
But...

140
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,040
I need to ask something of you.

141
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,600
If the next time you
want give me soy milk...

142
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,340
put it in this tumbler.

It's so clear now.

152
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,500
What then?

153
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,320
Then you charged towards
him and confessed to him?

would confess their love, right?</i>

157
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,300
<i>From then on...</i>

158
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,600
<i>I give him soy milk in

In the hopes that one day...

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,870
he'll come and ask
me to be his girlfriend.

161
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,810
If I can get up before
class in the morning...

162
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,110
sometimes, I secretly gave
it to him in his classroom.

163
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,240
Or sometimes,
when we has playing sports.

164
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,660

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,270
To promote metabolism!

183
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,740
If that's the case,
I can add something else for you.

184
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,570
The reason
I put lemon basil seeds...

185
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,810
is because I...

186
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,850
I...

187
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,530
I love you!
<i>[ Maengluk = lemon basil, ruk = love.
"Luk" and "ruk" sounds identical ]</i>

188
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,690
I love you!

189
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,280
Moonoi.

190
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,290
Moonoi, Moonoi.

191
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,100
I like you.

192
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,790
But as a sister.

193
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,350
That's not true.

194
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,860
Then what about the tumbler
with a picture of pig and heart?

195
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,500
Soy milk...

196
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,890
is packed in plastic bags, right?

197
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,330
It will be hot to hold.

198
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,420
Besides, I had that tumbler.

199
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,940
It's really nothing special.

200
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,930
Besides, back then...

201
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,250
I didn't know your name is Moonoi.

202
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,390
If I made you misunderstood...

203
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,570
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,020
I don't believe it.
I don't believe you.

205
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,670
Because...

206
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,830
Is it because you
already have a girlfriend?

207
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,480
No.

208
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,840
Or is it because you
already have someone you like?

209
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,500
Also no.

210
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,530
Or is it because...

211
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,090
you're gay?

212
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Yes, that's right.

213
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,990
Are you really gay?!

214
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,500
Don't be so loud.

215
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,630
Thank you...

216
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,490
for the soy milk all these time.

217
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,980
But...

218
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,500
I'm really sorry
that we can't date.

219
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,030
Don't tell anyone, OK?

220
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,760
P'Chang is gay?

221
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,020
P'Chang likes guy?

222
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,670
P'Chang is not into girls?

223
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,650
P'Chang is gay, P'Chang is guy.

224
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,870
P'Chang likes guy?

225
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,070
<i>Since then,
P'Chang went to study in Bangkok.</i>

226
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,860
<i>And he never came and
passes by our house anymore.</i>

227
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,440
<i>As for me...</i>

228
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,260
<i>I was sad and crying for about...</i>

229
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,190
This is the case for at least 3 months.

230
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,720
<i>about half an hour, P'Toen!</i>

231
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,790
Moonoi,
why did you get over it so quick?

232
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,800
<i>I was lucky.</i>

233
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,510
<i>I have a good
friend who advised me.</i>

234
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,310
You. I think, honestly...

235
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,170
P'Chang is not gay.

236
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,160
Bitch, I heard it
with my own 2 ears.

237
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,920
He lied to you.

238
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,890
He might have a
reason that he can't you about.

239
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,180
By lying that he's gay?

240
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,950
Are you crazy?!

241
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,340
Listen to me.

242
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,290
What your
mother used to say is true.

243
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,910
Don't let me
curse you with that too.

244
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,750
The reason she said that to you...

245
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,170
because...

246
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,910
because you're a sakoy.

247
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,370
You bastard! Why?!

248
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
So what if I'm a sakoy?

249
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,300
Don't be mad at him.

250
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,460
He probably didn't want to say directly that
he doesn't like a sakoy like you, that's all.

251
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,390
Then, it's not hard.

252
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,070
I'll change myself.

253
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,690
I'll stop being sakoy!

254
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,980
What do you want to be then?

255
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,940
I'll...

256
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,580
focus on my study, of course.

257
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,250
I'll study and get into the
university in Bangkok so I can find him!

258
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,320
Where are you going now?

259
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,040
To stop being a sakoy.

260
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,870
But before that,
I need to sell the bike.

261
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,470
Dumbass.

262
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,080
That's my bike.

263
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,700
People say that love is so great...

264
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,770
that it makes us change ourselves
and have courage to move forward.

265
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,130
At first, I didn't believe it.

266
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,470
But when faced it myself,
I realized that...

267
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,360
it's really true, P'Toen.

268
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,770
What are you looking at? Or I'll...

269
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,780
I said goodbye to my sakoy life.

270
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,030
and focus on my
study like never before.

271
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,470
For my sole purpose.

272
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,240
That is to be able to follow
P'Chang to study in Bangkok.

273
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,180
2 years have passed.

274
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,250
2 years have passed..

275
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,740
And in the end...

276
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,690
in the end, I...

277
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,690
It's quite heavy.

278
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,830
Do you want to eat some?

279
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,240
No.

280
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,920
Next time, don't accept it.
Reject them sometimes.

281
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,620
Not giving people false hope.

282
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,310
What do you mean?

283
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,980
They worked hard
to give them to me.

284
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,650
I feel sorry for them.

285
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,940
There, a new girl is here.

286
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,240
This time, it's a freshman.

287
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,500
Is that Moonoi?

288
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,210
You knew her?

289
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,250
My junior back in high school.

290
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,950
Then I give you from the
same neighborhood to catch up.

291
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,220
But don't forget
our appointment tonight.

292
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,280
The soy milk is still
the best in the world.

293
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,260
Thank you for the soy milk.

294
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,860
I haven't drink it for so long.

295
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,720
I miss it.

296
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,410
We haven't seen
each other for so long.

297
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,510
You're not gonna catch up a bit?

298
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,660
You've changed a lot.

299
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,550
I almost didn't recognize you.

300
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,990
I just want to
give back your tumbler...

301
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,870
and leave.

302
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,970
And...

303
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,830
sorry for bothering
you with your girlfriend.

304
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,750
Girlfriend?

305
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,260
What girlfriend?

306
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,830
The girl earlier.

307
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,510
I think it's a misunderstanding.

308
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,890
There's nothing
between me and Luktan.

309
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,880
I don't believe you, you're lying.

310
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,490
She and I are just in the
same year Cheerleader friends.

311
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,970
Since you're new here.

312
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,050
You probably didn't know...

313
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,370
that...

314
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,610
P'Luktan is a ladyboy.

315
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,650
Lies.

316
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,280
Who's gonna believe it
with her being that beautiful?!

317
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,930
Here.

318
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,310
Then, look at this.

319
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,010
When we were freshmen,
she still had a flat head.

320
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,400
So, what's your story...

321
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,520
that you got here?

322
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,420
I quit being sakoy
and focus on my study.

323
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,730
It's good that you're
thinking of your future.

324
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,410
I'm happy for you.

325
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,220
If P'Luktan is not your girlfriend.

326
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,890
That means you're
currently single, right?

327
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,720
All this time...

328
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,570
that you had
to lie that you're gay...

329
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,480
was because
I was a sakoy, right?

330
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,890
But now...

331
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,910
I've changed myself.

332
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,620
Is it possible...

333
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,860
if...

334
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,110
Moonoi.

335
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,480
I'll be honest.

336
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,350
I never hated you...

337
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,650
that you're sakoy.

338
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,160
But...

339
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,850
I can swear to it.

340
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,880
I'm not into girls.

341
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,270
Liar!

342
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,580
You're to blame
for me being like this.

343
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,260
Take responsibility of it!

344
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,000
What do you want
to be responsible of?

345
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,900
It's a good thing.

346
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,400
I don't care!

347
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,020
But I'm glad...

348
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,720
that I can be your motivation.

349
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,240
But I really can't be with you.

350
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,080
I better go to class.

351
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,190
But don't forget...

352
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,020
don't tell anyone about this.

353
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,670
I have to go now.

354
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,450
P'Chang is gay.

355
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,300
P'Chang is gay!!!

356
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,270
Then that means,
it's all your own fantasy, right?

357
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,500
Because in the end,
P'Chang is gay.

358
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,450
So what then?

359
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,370
That means you got heartbroken
again and changed your goals, right?

360
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,920
<i>I almost changed it.</i>

361
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,850
<i>But luckily I called E'Pan
and asked for her advise.</i>

362
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,760
I don't think P'Chang is gay.

363
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,280
Listen to me, I think...

364
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,370
the reason he
doesn't want you is because...

365
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,640
you're...

366
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,880
an ordinary girl.

367
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,880
Bitch, what the hell?

368
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,420
I can't even be an ordinary girl.

369
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,000
I've quit being sakoy,
what else should I do?!

370
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,770
You!!!

371
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,160
I can't take it anymore.

372
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,240
I don't want to stay in
Bangkok anymore, I wanna go home.

373
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,770
What did you say?

374
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,670
If you come home...

375
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,300
don't ever call me "Mom" again.

376
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,950
<i>Listen to me...</i>

377
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,490
before...

378
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,170
I never seen any good in you.

379
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,230
<i>But now, do you know...</i>

380
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,430
how proud I am of you?

381
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,960
<i>Promise me...</i>

382
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,190
that you'll fight to the end.

383
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,860
Don't run away.

384
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,630
<i>Don't give up.</i>

385
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,610
Very good.

386
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,170
<i>Pan.</i>

387
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,380
What do you
think my mom said earlier...

388
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,320
what does she mean?

389
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,870
I think...

390
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,930
it's about...

391
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,570
Don't tell me it's about P'Chang?

392
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,110
I don't think...

393
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,740
<i>E'Pan!</i>

394
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,130
<i>I get it now.</i>

395
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,820
<i>It's my fault for
underestimated myself.</i>

396
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,530
For P'Chang...

397
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,230
an ordinary girl like me is not enough.

398
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,960
<i>If P'Chang is a cheerleader...</i>

399
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,880
I have to be a cheerleader like him.

400
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,400
<i>You'll see...</i>

401
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,910
I won't back down,
I will fight till the end.

402
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,790
I won't give up!!!

403
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,550
Club application

404
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,550
Club <u>Cheerleading</u>

405
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,040
Too many filter, huh?

406
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,020
No.

407
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,850
You're a freshman.

408
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,780
If you don't have experience,
I think it's a bit difficult.

409
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,290
If it's dancing experience, then I can dance.

410
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,450
I'll show you.

411
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,980
Nong, nong.

412
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,860
If it's the university's
cheerleader dancing, it's not like this.

413
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,640
That's alright, I'm a good learner.

414
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,380
My mom said
I must fight till the end.

415
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,840
I can't give up.

416
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,300
I think I can get
enroll in this club, this year.

417
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,030
OK.

418
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,870
This way, please.

419
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,220
Yes.

420
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,990
- Thank you.
- Yes, you're wlecome

421
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,670
Next is number 8, Moonoi.

422
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,350
You can sit now.

423
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,570
Alright.

424
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,530

437
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,520
Please.

438
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,230
Try again next year.

439
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,740
Excuse me.

440
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,450
That means we're all here passed?

441
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:50,230
Congratulations, you're the
university's next cheerleader!

442
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,260
After this, get changed and call your family
to inform them that you'll be late for sure.

443
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,670
Because we're gonna go celebrate.

444
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,790
P'Oh will be the sponsor.

445
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,820
Alright, as the representative
of the last year's Cheerleader...

446
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,290
I would like to congratulate you all.

447
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,440
Tonight, we celebrate to the fullest.

448
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,190
But no matter what, we're students.
Getting drunk is not appropriate for us.

449
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,980
Our next activities is drink.

450
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,620
Drink for our health.

451
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,230
Everyone...

452
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,350
drink. What are you waiting for?

453
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,900
Are you drunk, Moonoi?

454
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,340
How will you go back today?

455
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,240
Do you want me to give you a ride?

456
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,740
You don't have to try to hit on me.

457
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,920
Because I...

458
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,420
already have someone I like.

459
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,560
Who? Mind telling me?

460
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,890
Is he from our university?

461
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,280
It's P'Chang.

462
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,170
All these time...

463
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,350
I've been trying my best to
be someone worthy of you.

464
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,040
Until today...

465
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,530
I got into the cheerleader!

466
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,490
Am I good enough for you now?

467
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,420
Not yet.

468
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,490
See? You always give
false hope to people.

469
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,030
Stop it, it's annoying!

470
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,850
Um...

471
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,350
do you remember
what we talked about?

472
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,960
I was telling you the truth.

473
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,190
No!

474
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,370
I don't believe you!

475
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,070
Why would I lie?

476
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,990
I can swear.

477
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,400
Wait, wait, wait.

478
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,830
What's this?

479
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,340
What is this about?

480
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,180
Tell us, what's this about?

481
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,280
What is this about?

482
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,420
Well, P'Chang...

483
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,490
- he's...
- Wait!

484
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,050
I told you...

485
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,200
not to tell anyone.

486
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,730
What are you guys on about?

487
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,590
Tell me, I wanna know.

488
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,460
Well, P'Chang told me that he...

489
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,690
is gay!!!

490
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,990
Ai'Chang?!

491
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,450
He can't be.

492
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,600
Yeah, never.

493
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,310
How can I not tell?
He's such a talker.

494
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,630
That's right.

495
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,210
P'Chang...

496
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,260
lied that he's gay.

497
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,640
And he's always been rejecting
love since high school until now.

498
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,100
Think about how it makes me feel?!

499
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,740
Ai'Chang, you knew her for so long.

500
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,990
If you don't like her, then reject her.

501
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,040
Don't be a coward.

502
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,950
Yes, if you tell me the truth...

503
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,880
I'd feel better.

504
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,890
Why do you have
to lie that you're gay?!

505
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,090
Ai'Chang!

506
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,610
Be a man.

507
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,650
Tell her the truth and move on.

508
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,200
I like guys.

509
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,330
I'm gay, happy?

510
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,140
The reason I didn't
tell you was because...

511
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,820
Because I like P'Oh.

512
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,100
Me?

513
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,040
Damn it, Chang.

514
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,420
Enough.

515
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,970
Stop lying...

516
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,410
Ai'Chang!

517
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,280
Are you happy now?

518
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,090
It's not true! It's not true!

519
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,810
It's not clear enough for you?

520
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,470
Alright.

521
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,810
What are you gonna do now?!

522
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,000
No!

523
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,360
Don't do it!

524
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,990
No!

525
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,950
Don't!

526
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,160
It's not true!

527
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,960
P'Chang is not gay!

528
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,250
OK.

529
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,970
I'll give you a summary.

530
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,230
Your case is a short one.
You're heartbroken because he's gay.

531
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,060
<i>Wait, I'm not finished.</i>

532
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,140
What now?! What else is not finished?!

533
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,110
He's gay, he smack his friend's lips!

534
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,560
<i>Yes, I went home and ask
my friend for an advise once more.</i>

535
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,840
Nowadays...

536
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,690
guys kissing each
other is just a joke.

537
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,630
It was because me.

538
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:02,100
<i>[The present]</i>

539
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,440
I've been pestering so hard on him.

540
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,600
But a man is like  bird.

541
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,460
He need to go out and
explore this vast world for awhile.

542
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,770
<i>After some time,
he'll be back to love us.</i>

543
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,230
Hold on.

544
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,490
<i>Pay attention and listen to me.</i>

545
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,330
I admire your perseverance, Moonoi.

546
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,060
But what's the point?

547
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,920
Ever since I started
this radio program, I think...

548
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:28,360
you are the dumbest one
so far that I listened to.

549
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,810
Dumb? Dumb how?

550
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,130
I don't feel like I'm dumb.

551
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,140
If you're not,
then why are you calling?!

552
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,490
<i>Because P'Chang likes
listening to this show very much.</i>

553
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,230
I'm just calling to say...

554
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,840
I've graduated.

555
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,990
I'm going to the company he work
at for a job interview tomorrow.

556
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,880
<i>Thank you so much
for willing to accept my call.</i>

557
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,600
Sawasdee kha.

558
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,520
OK, viewers,
at least give her a compliment.

559
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:08,120
She uses love to be the
driving force to make her life better.

560
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,280
Anyway, that's all for today.

561
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,650
See you at the same time next week.

562
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,970
If I hadn't been
driven mad to the hospital.

563
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,040
That's all for today. Sawasdee kha.

564
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,420
<i>My girlfriend is beautiful.</i>

565
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,460
<i>But every day at 7PM,
a number comes in calling her.</i>

566
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,400
<i>She's dating two at once for sure
if the other party calls frequently...</i>

567
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,880
<i>Top?</i>

568
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:48,510
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

569
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,910
<i>[Mystery Number]</i>

570
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,700
<i>♫ There’s only dumb, dumb, dumb ♫</i>

571
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,740
<i>♫ There’s only dumb only the dumb ♫</i>

572
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,880
<i>♫ Can you handle her? ♫</i>

573
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,990
<i>♫ Do you want her to be with you? ♫</i>

574
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,930
<i>♫ There’s only dumb, dumb, dumb ♫</i>

575
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,800
<i>♫ There's only dumb only the dumb ♫</i>

576
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,310
<i>♫ Can you handle her? ♫</i>

577
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,360
<i>♫ Do you want her to be with you? ♫</i>
