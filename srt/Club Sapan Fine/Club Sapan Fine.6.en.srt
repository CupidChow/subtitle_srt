Sawasdee kha, Club Sapan Fai is here.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,460
A program that allows everyone
to share dumb love experiences.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,740
Because we'll never
let you be dumb alone.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,170
Yes!

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,490
Come, come, come.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,930
Our topic today is...

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,900
"Dumb couple,
will never let it go even in death."

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,960
Yes, it's a fierce topic.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,040
Come, anyone who wants to share
their experience today can call us.

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,920
Here comes the first call.

Turn off the radio first.

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,850
How slick of you to
call and turn on the radio.

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,710
I'm sorry, I was nervous.

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,950
I'm a long time fan of your show.

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,690
But I didn't dare to call.

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,730
Oh my.

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,710
Your voice sounds handsome.

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,020
What is your name?

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,520

33
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,100
So, what is the
story you want to tell me?

34
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,590
My love story started when...

35
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,240
I got in my first
year to the university.

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,430
Before this, I'm...

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,680
just an ordinary guy.

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,050
I never interested in love.

39

Applause!

45
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,960
I never had anyone that I like.

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,780
And never had anyone who
made my heart beating fast.

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,840
But then...

48
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,410
Alright,
let's move to the next game.

49
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,540
Each color team has to
send a representative up. Start.

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,570
Seniors, choose. Go.

51
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,700
- This game is very close...
- Pick someone else.

52
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,100
What are you doing?

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,240
What's going on?

54
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,950
Alright, are you ready?

55
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,850
If you're ready, start!

56
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,220
Oh dear.

57
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,770
Just a little bit more.
OK, team pink wins! Applause.

58
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,010
Just a little more,
I was about to get fin.

59
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,910
Alright, the next
representative. Go!

60
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,740
Move, move.

61
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,370
Don't be discouraged.

62
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,070
You can win at other games.

63
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,130
No.

64
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,200
My name is Ko.

65
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,870
Ang.

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,820
So...

67
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,000
What a coincidence!

68
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,060
It's like we're born to be pairs.

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,130
My name is Ko
and your name is Ang.

70
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,810
It's like Kobori and Angsumalin.
<i>[ Kobori and Angsumalin are main characters from
novel "Koo Gum/Karmic Couple" set in WWII where

71
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,440
P'Tle.

72
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,100
Do you believe...

73
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,940
that it's the true in this world...

74
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,260
the person we meet for the
first time, we immediately know...

75
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,060
that we're born to be pair.

76
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,830
Pair...

77
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,770
Pair...

78
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,570
A couple!

79
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,700
From that day on,
my relationship with Ko...

80
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,430
has become more
and more like boyfriends.

81
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,510
At the same time I fell
in love with him day by day.

82
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,590
It seems like in the whole world...

83
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,470
there's really only the two of us.

84
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,530
Wow, wow, wow...

85
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,230
Hearing your voice so manly like
this, that means you're truly in love.

86
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,640
A little.

87
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,630
Honestly,
I don't want to believe it myself.

88
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,220
But at the time...

89
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,820
I really felt it.

90
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,450
Yeay, I won!

91
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,910
That maybe...

92
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,830
I might just...

93
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,630
waiting for the right person.

94
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,750
The one who will
be my couple forever.

95
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,980
Finally...

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,700
I've decided...

97
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,130
that I will tell
Ko my feelings for him.

98
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,170
I like you

99
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,670
Excuse me.

100
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,220
You're not from our faculty, right?

101
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,750
This is our faculty's table.

102
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,260
I'm meeting someone here.

103
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,820
But...

104
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,190
I'm sitting here.

105
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,720
Plus, there's plenty
of other empty table.

106
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,310
Is there your name on this table?

107
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,810
I'm asking, is there
your name on this table?

108
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,220
What's your name?

109
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,230
I don't see any.

110
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,770
Every table in the
university are public properties.

111
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,740
That means every
student has the right to use it.

112
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,570
Have some manners.

113
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,400
So your family...

114
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,380
didn't teach you any manners?

115
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,980
In public, if the table is occupied...

116
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,840
Isn't that bothering
and intruding other people?

117
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,040
You bitch.

118
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,590
I'm just sitting here,
is that even intruding?

119
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,170
Absolutely, it's freaking eyesore.

120
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,270
What's going here?

121
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,850
Why didn't you
tell me you're here?

122
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,740
So...

123
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,910
you guys knew each other?
Why do you guys seem so close?

124
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,290
No.

125
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,020
Don't tell me you know...

126
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,730
Then, introduction is in order.

127
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,380
Deko, this is Ang.

128
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,100
My close friend whom
I always mentioned.

129
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,120
Ang, this is Deko.

130
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,580
She's...

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,170
his girlfriend.

132
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,770
That's right.

133
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,830
Nice to meet you.

134
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,210
Angsumalin.

135
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,260
Do you know that in
this world, there really is...

136
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,090
someone that we meet
for the time, we can guess that...

137
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,050
they are born
to be our eternal rival.

138
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,800
<i>[Karmic Couple]</i>

139
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,100
Oh my God!

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,330
Oh dear, oh dear,
oh dear! It's ruined!

141
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,230
Who would've thought...

142
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,670
that you always thought
all this time that Ko is gay...

143
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,710
or it was just all in
your imagination, right?

144
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,980
<i>Well...</i>

145
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,060
<i>when I thought about it...</i>

146
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,870
Ko has never told me clearly...

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,080
whether...

148
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,190
he likes men or women exactly.

149
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,360
So frustrating, damn!

150
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,640
So what happened next?

151
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,480
<i>From that day on...</i>

152
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,110
Ko and I are close as always.

153
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,860
But what is different...

154
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,060
is there is E'Deko in our lives.

155
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,700
I bought this, wanna taste?

156
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,840
Taste this one.

157
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,340
Sitting together every day,
almost every hour.

158
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,220
- Delicious?
- Sticking around all over.

159
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,810
Honestly, I have my suspicious.

160
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,470
But I keep it to myself.

161
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,820
Until in the end,
I can't take it anymore.

162
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,210
I have to know the truth
from Ko's own mouth.

163
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,870
Ko, I'm gonna ask you straight.

164
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,240
Don't you feel
unomfortable having E'Deko...

165
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,760
Ang, don't call her "E".
<i>[ "E" is like feminine version of "Ai". It's derogatory but girls
tends to call each other that when they're extremely close
or as use it as an insult. It can be translated to "bitch" ]</i>

166
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,190
Khun Deko.

167
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,760
She came tag along every
time, every day. It's annoying.

168
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,690
I really wanna know...

169
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,450
how did you hit on a girl like that?

170
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,980
I didn't, she hit on me first.

171
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,050
How? Tell me.

172
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,860
That day,
I went for lunch at her faculty.

173
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,590
She saw me, then she came to
me and asked me to be her boyfriend.

174
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,770
What a slut.

175
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,130
But it's quite fun
with her around, right?

176
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,940
I like it.

177
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,110
She's straightforward
and broad-minded.

178
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,810
But like...

179
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,110
doesn't mean love, right?

180
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,330
Ko...

181
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,120
I can tell.

182
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,990
When you're with her...

183
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,700
you might seem happy.

184
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,050
I'll be back.

185
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,720
But, just being happy...

186
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,500
it...

187
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,640
doesn't mean you love her.

188
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,310
Lovers...

189
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,510
when they look
at each others' eyes...

190
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,970
their hearts beat fast.

191
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,260
When they're apart...

192
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,190
they can't stop
missing each other.

193
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,830
When they smile...

194
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,760
they never bored.

195
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
I think...

196
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,130
you're dating her...

197
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,750
can hurt her without intention.

198
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,110
Don't you afraid of hurting her?

199
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,650
Don't worry about that.

200
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,900
Someone like me...

201
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,620
after trying but
it's not the right one...

202
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,170
it's better than
never started it at all.

203
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,750
Even when he
really wants to break up...

204
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,510
I won't be sad.

205
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,860
Don't worry, Ang.

206
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,070
I'm a straightfoward person.

207
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,320
Unlike someone around
here who do things secretly.

208
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,690
Right?

209
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,860
Who?

210
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,240
Won't you know.

211
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,550
I know everything.

212
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,890
No need to lie.

213
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,470
Ko, how pity.

214
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,940
Your friend has a good looks.

215
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,180
He's very handsome.

216
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,610
But pity he's...

217
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,650
I'm what?

218
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,290
Don't tell me...

219
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,650
that you like him?
No way, he's mine.

220
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,060
Don't ever hit on him,
understand? It's forbidden.

221
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,340
Ko.

222
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,610
I bought a strawberry
cake for you. Do you want it?

223
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,790
Yes, yes.

224
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,790
Looks delicious.

225
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,760
Straw(Sa-tor)berry cake...
<i>[ "Sa-tor" is a slang for "liar" ]</i>

226
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,090
is very delicious.

227
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,090
Ko, I think we should
do our assignments.

228
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,650
Or we won't be
able to submit it on time.

229
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,430
Today?

230
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,620
You can't,
I want to go out today.

231
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,180
I want to be with you at a quite and
peaceful place where no one can interrupt.

232
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,550
You're the one interrupting,
we're doing assignment.

233
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,110
If you want to do assignment,
then do it by yourself. Go.

234
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,100
We need to do it in pair.

235
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,820
No way,
he needs a peaceful place...

236
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,770
We have an assignment.

237
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,430
- A quite place.
- Assignment.

238
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,510
- A quite place.
- Assignment.

239
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,970
Please? A quite place.

240
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,110
What do you think? Am I smart?

241
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,860
We can do assignment
and in a quite place.

242
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,950
Very smart.

243
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,580
But it's unfortunate
that there's a third wheel.

244
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,810
I can't get all lovey-dovey.

245
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,680
Got one, wants two.

246
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,210
What are you secretly say?

247
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,760
Why? What are you gonna do?

248
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,140
- Do you have a problem?
-Come on, wanna piece of me?

249
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,210
- Why are you so loud?
- Bring it.

250
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,040
Can I listen to it too?

251
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,040
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

252
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,150
<i>(What do you want?!)</i>

253
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,200
<i>(Why, faggot?)</i>

254
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,330
Faggot, your father!
<i>[ It's the way Thai people say like "faggot,
my ass". They use "your father" ]</i>

255
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,580
<i>(My dad?! Bastard!)</i>

256
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,680
<i>(I mean you, you bitch!)</i>

257
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,700
<i>(Really? I have this, do you have one?)</i>

258
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,790
<i>(I have this foot, wanna eat?!)</i>

259
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,720
<i>(Bring it! Come here!)</i>

260
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,810
<i>(Bitch!)</i>

261
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,860
<i>(Shameless!)</i>

262
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,920
<i>(Whore!)</i>

263
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,000
<i>(Cheap!)</i>

264
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,100
<i>(Idiot!)</i>

265
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,380
<i>(You're the idiot!)</i>

266
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,460
<i>(Slut!)</i>

267
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,510
<i>(Idiot!)</i>

268
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,720
Why did we got kicked out?

269
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,440
Yeah, we didn't make any sound.

270
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,170
Yeah, we didn't break any rule.

271
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,730
Can you not agree with me?

272
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,120
Do you think I want to?

273
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,290
Hey, don't talk nonsense.

274
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,550
Help me think where
we can do our assignment.

275
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,220
But now that I mention it...

276
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,970
You two look well-matched.

277
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,750
- That's not true!
- That's not true!

278
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,920
See? You even
say it at the same time.

279
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,450
You look like best friends.

280
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,530
How exciting.

281
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,410
We're gonna have so
much fun tomorrow for sure.

282
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,830
Is there something tomorrow?

283
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,050
How can you forget?

284
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,060
We'll have a birthday
party at the condo tomorrow.

285
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,470
We'll have a birthday
party at the condo tomorrow.

286
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,910
That moment...

287
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,090
I realized that the most
important moment in my life...

288
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,990
is about to happen.

289
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,880
Because someone who
doesn't like to drink like Ko...

290
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,960
is about to open a big opportunity.

291
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,930
This is an important war...

292
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,510
to make Ko realize that...

293
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,030
his heart has always
been my dependency.

294
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,730
From that moment on,
I've been came knocking on his gate.

295
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,400
Hold on, hold on. Stop for a moment.

296
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,230
When you say you're gonna make him
realize that his heart is your fight...

297
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,840
you're gonna go all out and
tonight will be Sodemacom, right?
<i>[ Sodemacom is an old famous song usually heard
in pub and it's a slang for unrestricted flirting ]</i>

298
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,590
Well...

299
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,040
exactly.

300
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,360
You're not pulling
your punches, what's next?

301
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,960
But the war this time...

302
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,270
there's a vital enemy.

303
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,880
And I have to find a way...

304
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,600
to deal with her.

305
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,330
P', do you sell sleeping pills?

306
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,790
The one that will fall
asleep immediately after taking it.

307
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,770
Nong, we don't sell
that kind of drug here.

308
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,980
We just have...

309
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,320
How many types there are,
I take it all.

310
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,760
On Ko's birthday, we had a party
after we finish our assignments.

311
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,330
Cheers!

312
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,530
So I started to take action
to deal with that third wheel...

313
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,860
which is to put all the drugs
I bought into E'Deko's drink.

314
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,620
Cheers.

315
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,400
Luckily she's a dumbass and
doesn't realize she's being drugged.

316
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,460
Time passes quickly until finally...

317
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,260
My plan succeeded.

318
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,610
Deko?

319
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,650
Deko?

320
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,980
You're drunk?

321
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,390
But myself was wasted...

322
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,200
to a point of fainting too.

323
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,170
When I regain my consciousness...

324
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,080
everything gets dark...

325
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,910
and quiet.

326
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,290
It's so quiet that
I can hear my heart beating.

327
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,680
I feel on my body...

328
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,790
a touch...

329
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,980
slowly approaching
me from the bottom up.

330
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,520
I immediately knew
that it's Ko's hand.

331
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,900
His soft touch.

332
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,890
I can't believe it in my head.

333
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,260
Every time he kisses...

334
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,220
it makes my body warm.

335
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,440
My little stomach started to react.

336
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,380
My heart is about to explode.

337
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,480
The image in
my head turned all white.

338
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,330
<i>In the end...</i>

339
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,000
I can't stop myself...

340
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,830
and squeeze the
man in front of me.

341
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,270
Come...

342
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,530
come...

343
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,820
come...

344
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,690
Shit! Battery's out!

345
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,860
E'Ang!

346
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,690
Where did he go?
Why it got cut off now, staff?

347
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,940
How could you just leave like this?!

348
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,810
Oh dear!

349
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,510
The charger?
Where is the charger?

350
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,920
E'Angsumalin...

351
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,870
OK, the show must go on.

352
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,080
Let's just let our
imaginations do the rest.

353
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,350
Come, let's take the
second caller that we put away.

354
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,120
Sawasdee kha.

355
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,310
<i>Sawasdee kha.</i>

356
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,430
You can come in now.
What's your name?

357
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,120
<i>I'm Deko.</i>

358
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,020
Hold on,
the signal wasn't clear before.

359
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,550
What was your name again?

360
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,940
<i>Didn't you hear me?</i>

361
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,690
It's Deko.

362
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,600
D-E-K-O. Deko.

363
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,090
Damn, ill-fated.

364
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,710
E'Ang, you poisonous snake, you despicable!
How could call and insult me?!

365
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,900
OK, OK, OK.

366
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,330
OK, I got it.

367
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,000
But you need to stop screaming,
you're gonna break my ears.

368
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,880
P'Tle, I'm not gonna let
him smear my name like this!

369
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,190
Alright, then you finish the story.
Let's clear this today.

370
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:43,020
Gladly. My story begins ever since
I asked Ko to be my boyfriend.

371
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,910
A guy who is cute,
warm and considerate.

372
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,500
You're here?

373
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,310
But there's also this third wheel...

374
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,380
and that is E'Ang.

375
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,910
I hate him the
first time I saw him.

376
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,430
I don't why he likes to
look for trouble with me.

377
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,240
To a point of my relationship
with Ko didn't go anywhere.

378
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,210
Until finally...

379
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,580
Is there something tomorrow?

380
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,310
We'll have a birthday
party at the condo tomorrow.

381
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:23,650
Here comes the opportunity for
Ko and I to quickly grow closer.

382
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,340
But first...

383
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,810
I need to get rid of this
third wheel named E'Ang.

384
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,700
P', do you sell anesthetic?
The one that can put out an elephant.

385
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,120
We don't sell anything like that.

386
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,740
There's only...

387
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,600
How many types there are,
I take it all.

388
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,710
Cheers!

389
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,670
That night...

390
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,980
I planned to take out E'Ang.

391
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,090
Have you eat this?

392
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,330
Luckily he's an idiot and my
plan can be successful and completed.

393
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,760
Cheers!

394
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,720
But I don't know why my
head felt dizzy and passed out.

395
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,850
When I woke up, it's dark.

396
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,220
I saw a guy was sleeping.

397
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,840
At the time,
I knew it was definitely Ko.

398
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,530
Then I...

399
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,380
touched his body with my hand.

400
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,080
He let out his breath softly...

401
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,470
until I can't control myself.

402
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,010
Don't tell me that...

403
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,620
That's right.

404
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,970
We got into it in the dark.

405
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,740
More...

406
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,790
more...

407
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,310
more and finally...

408
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,050
He can't stop himself.

409
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,580
Oh no!!! That can't be!

410
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,100
Gays and women are
not meant to be together!

411
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,130
It's wrong!

412
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,190
Right, P'?

413
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,560
I can't stand it.

414
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,020
I almost got a husband
but got a ghost instead.

415
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,780
Go, dear.

416
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,870
Hurry to the temple, make merit and and
use holy water to get rid of bad luck.

417
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,030
Release all the bird,
fish and everything to the temple.

418
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,330
Get rid of them all.

419
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,450
What's next?

420
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,710
Well...

421
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,060
have you ever
lost anything so severe?

422
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,960
We will face stages of adjustment.

423
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,600
The first stage is...

424
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,490
refusing the truth.

425
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,310
After that, we'll face
the second stage, which is...

426
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,480
anger.

427
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,200
What the?

428
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,340
Didn't you know that I'm not Ko?

429
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,090
Are you blaming it on me?

430
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,950
Then followed by the third stage.

431
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,680
Bargaining with oneself.

432
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,740
God...

433
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,060
please turn back time, will you?

434
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,980
I promise to be a better person.

435
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,170
Wait.

436
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,570
Where's Ko?

437
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,450
Shit!

438
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,930
Then the fourth stage...

439
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,200
is sadness.

440
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,450
<i>So the last stage
will be at what number?</i>

441
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,540
Stage of mental preparation.

442
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,410
In the end...

443
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,250
we both agreed that...

444
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,500
we absolutely won't
let Ko know about this.

445
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,980
And consider it...

446
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,020
as the worst thing
that ever happened to us.

447
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,840
This is really bad, right?

448
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,260
True.

449
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,070
Well, like you said...

450
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,720
If you can
experienced bad things...

451
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,210
good things will
happen to your life later, right?

452
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,660
Yes.

453
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,290
But you know what?

454
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,770
Actually there's
one thing we agreed on.

455
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,050
Actually, about Ko...

456
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,750
I felt it for some time now...

457
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,700
that he doesn't love me.

458
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,410
I also know...

459
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,450
that Ko...

460
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,350
only sees me as a friend.

461
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,520
Honestly...

462
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,600
I was just fooling myself every day...

463
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,830
that I have hope.

464
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,240
We are so pathetic.

465
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,520
True.

466
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,860
Do you know what I'm thinking?

467
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,750
What?

468
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,450
At least the person
who did it with me...

469
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,740
is you.

470
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,670
It's better than being taken
advantage of by some random person.

471
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,830
If I have to
have sex with any woman...

472
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,860
it'll be you.

473
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,960
Well...

474
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,080
it's probably the most OK.

475
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,200
Don't you fall in love with me.

476
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,520
Jerk, are you dreaming?

477
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,130
Dream on.

478
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,020
Promise me.

479
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,170
That Ko will never
find out about this.

480
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,400
Yes.

481
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,160
But only with Ko,
I will share this with everyone else.

482
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,820
You jerk, is that challenge?

483
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,180
I'm gonna post in on Facebook.

484
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,140
Fine, I'll block you.

485
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,720
You dare? I block you first.

486
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,650
- My bag.
- You dare?

487
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,700
When I thought about it...

488
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,160
we really do share similarities.

489
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,680
I think sometimes...

490
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:13,040
person whom we thought born
to be our enemies and adversaries...

491
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,440
they might born to be...

492
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,190
our rivals forever.

493
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,990
There you go,
listeners. Every love story...

494
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,350
if we look at carefully,
there might be...

495
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,520
Wait.

496
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,640
I'm not finish.

497
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,920
What now?
What is it not finish yet?!

498
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,710
Tell me!

499
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,470
Deko, where were you?

500
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,810
Who's that?

501
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,090
Your boyfriend?

502
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,500
No!

503
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,510
He's a friend.

504
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,680
- He's really a friend.
- You haven't introduced him.

505
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,160
No need to, go inside.

506
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,510
He's a friend.

507
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,760
<i>(Is he your brother?)</i>

508
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,270
<i>(Nosy!)</i>

509
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,110
<i>(I want to know.)</i>

510
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,640
<i>(No way!)</i>

511
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,610
<i>(I want to know.)</i>

512
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,380
<i>(No!)</i>

513
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,470
<i>(Why not?)</i>

514
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,480
<i>(That's my brother!)</i>

515
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,280
<i>(Oh?)</i>

516
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,510
<i>(Go away!)</i>

517
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,600
From that moment on,
he fell in love with my brother.

518
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:38,200
<i>And he's been coming to
my house every day as my friend.</i>

519
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,000
- I can't stand it anymore.
I won't tolerate him anymore.
- Calm down, Deko. Listen to me.

520
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,150
- I'm not calming down,
not letting this go, I can't stand it.
- Deko, listen to me.

521
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,420
Will it help by telling you?

522
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,060
Calm down, please. Deko.

523
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,670
Deko!

524
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,190
Don't turn on the radio,
you're breaking my ears!

525
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,540
P'?

526
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,640
I didn't turn on any radio.

527
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,530
You exposed me?!

528
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,980
You did it first!

529
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,170
If someone find one, what then?

530
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,960
Hold on, don't play victim. You nuts!

531
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,300
<i>[Club Sapan Fai]</i>

532
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,140
<i>Bring it!</i>

533
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:38,410
Alright, dear listener.
Our show as to end here for today.

534
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,310
Hope N'Deko and N'Ang
pay attention to the listeners.

535
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,730
Today the DJ will
say goodbye to everyone.

536
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:49,250
As the old saying,
"being with good friends bring virtue but
being with evil friends will bring misfortune".

537
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,710
That's all for today,
see you next time on Club Sapan Fai.

538
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,730
Sawasdee kha.

539
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,980
<i>Are you telling me that you
