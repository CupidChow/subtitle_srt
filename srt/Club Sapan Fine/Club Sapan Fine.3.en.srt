Sawasdee krub, welcome to
our radio show, Club Sapan Fai.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,090
This sound is more
powerful than the sound effect.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,290
Alright, our show as usual...

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,150
is to let listeners call in to
share their own dumb love stories.

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,220
Because everyone
must once be dumb in love.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,260
Some applause.

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,760
Our topic for today is...

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,550
"The cow is yet to recover,
the buffalo comes butt in".
<i>[ This is an idiom meaning "a new trouble
comes in before the old ones could be fixed".
Also, "buffalo" is a slang for "stupid" in this context ]</i>

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,650
If anyone has any dumb love story,
let's share it here together.

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,520
You can call and share with us.

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,110
A call came as soon as I finished telling
you the topic. Our show is the real deal.

<i>My name is Mameow.</i>

23
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,620
OK, N'Mameow. Please introduce
yourself and what's the story?

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,010
<i>I'm a tomboy.</i>

25
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,080
<i>I was just having my first girlfriend.</i>

00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,760
<i>I'm going to tell you
about that girlfriend today.</i>

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,870
What kind of a person is this girlfriend?

28
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,100
<i>She's beautiful and sexy.</i>

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,810
<i>And I'm an ordinary,
plain-looking person.</i>

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,080
<i>Her exes are all guys.</i>

31
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,300
<i>So my friends don't trust her too much.</i>

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,730
Your friends doesn't trust her
but what about you? Do you trust her?

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,890
<i>Well...</i>

34
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,330
<i>I do.</i>

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,100
<i>But I have my worries.</i>

36
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,470
<i>Because her job
is bit over-the-top.</i>

37
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,580
Over-the-top? How's that?

38
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,670
Premium quality nail
polish suitable for all skin tones.

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,750
Interested?

40
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,840
Very interested. Yes, yes.

41
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,160
- Let's give it a try.
- OK.

42
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,310
Your nails look
healthy after using them.

43
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,980
Do you think it's good?

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,770
Good, good, good.

45
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,390
Then I'll buy every color.

46
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,310
Of course.

47
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,670
Here you are.

48
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,190
So...

49
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,150
how many more
shades do I have to buy...

50
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,880
in order to get your number?

51
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,430
There is no such
promotion in this store.

52
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,490
Because I...

53
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,850
already have a girlfriend.

54
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,180
I love her so much,
I will never cheat on her.

55
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,740
But she always ensure me...

56
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,610

64
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,230

65
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,480
miss...

66
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,970

you could go anywhere.

68
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,430
will you trust me?

69
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,260
You two are just different majors!

70
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,570
Your faculty is on
the left building, E'Beebee.

71
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,660
And yours is on the
right building, E'Booboo.

72
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,910
Do you have to turn this
into a distance relationship?

73
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,830
Then...

74
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,000
I should go to my class now.

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
See you later, Booboo.

76
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,930
Pay attention in class, OK?

77
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,590
Yes.

78
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,760
Bitch.

79
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,510
Bye-bye.

80
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,030
E'Meow.

81
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,320
E'Meow!

82
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,520
Do you think
E'Chokpink really loves you?

83
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,190
I think she's weird.

84
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,180
You never had any lover,
what do you know?

85
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,700
This is only your first girlfriend,
you have no room to talk.

86
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,720
I just found out that your
E'Beebee dated so many people before.

87
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,680
And they're all guys too.

88
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,020
E'Kim.

89
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,200
Tell him.

90
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,120
You girlfriend, Chokpink
never dated a tomboy.

91
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,690
There's no way of figuring out what type she
clearly likes based on the guys she dated.

92
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,220
She doesn't date
none of them too long.

93
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,050
And her boyfriends there were
middle school students, college
students, office workers, and bosses.

94
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,850
But what they all
have in common is...

95
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,720
that they all very handsome.

96
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,900
Hey, hey, hey.

97
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,820
Don't call me cruel.

98
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,950
From what I've observed from her...

99
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,900
I think she dates
you because of money.

100
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,760
I also heard that she likes to take
her lovers to expensive restaurants.

101
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,020
When she took her lovers
to an expensive restaurant...

102
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,940
her lovers must pay for it.

103
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:49,110
All of it.

104
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,210
It's my treat.

105
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,070
I was the one who
wanted to eat here.

106
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,870
Hey, E'Meow.

107
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,090
She only treated you
sushi one time and you already
believe that she really loves you?

108
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,520
She didn't lie to
me like others said.

109
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,190
Crazy!

110
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,000
Then you can just
propose marriage like in a novel!

111
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,980
But that's not all that happened.

112
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,730
Hello.

113
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,660
See?

114
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,070
The owner of the
credit card called to check on it.

115
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,770
She's dating two
people at once for sure.

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,150
If you don't believe it,
go and uncover the suspicious.

117
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,130
You go take a good
peek at the incoming number.

118
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,180
If it's the same call
coming in so often, then...

119
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,690
it is sure.

120
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,410
What time is it, Booboo?

121
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,010
It's almost 7 PM.

122
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,230
Beebee.

123
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,600
You go take a good peek
at the incoming number.

124
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,400
If it's the same call
coming in so often, then...

125
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,030
If it's the same call
coming in so often, then...

126
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,040
it is sure.

127
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,960
it is sure!

128
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,500
So, is it sure?

129
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,070
<i>Well...</i>

130
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,790
Since then, every day at 7 PM...

131
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,820
there will be
unsaved number calling her.

132
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,860
No matter where she is,
or what she's doing...

133
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,500
she will answer the
call in secret, every time.

134
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,260
When I asked who's calling...

135
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,690
she'd just lied.

136
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,140
My dad's calling.

137
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,230
I was hungry, so I went
down to buy fried bananas.

138
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,780
I got a new job, Booboo!

139
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,910
You said the number
call at every 7 PM, right?

140
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,630
Yes.

141
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,910
I know what to do.

142
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,130
Hoola girl!

143
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,880
Are you OK?

144
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,850
You're great. Fighting everyone.

145
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,040
You'll be energize
from morning to night.

146
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,090
<i>Hello, Tob speaking.</i>

147
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,120
<i>Hello?</i>

148
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,640
<i>Is this a game?
Calling me without speaking.</i>

149
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,060
<i>Hello?!</i>

150
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,180
<i>Are you so free?</i>

151
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,420
<i>What do you want?</i>

152
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,250
Boo, I'm home.

153
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,750
It's so tiring today.

154
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,390
I'll go to bed after shower.

155
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,130
Yes!

156
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,790
Then I search for that number...

157
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,260
when I press it...

158
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,530
I found it, P'.

159
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,780
So I look at his profile.

160
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,450
It's a guy.

161
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,460
He's handsome.

162
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,260
After that...

163
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,560
<i>[I called but why didn't you pick up?]</i>

164
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,270
I went to read at her text messages.

165
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,330
There's only him sends the messages.

166
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,200
<i>[I called but why didn't you pick up?]</i>

167
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,200
When are you free to meet up?

168
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,910
But there's none from
her that reply to them.

169
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:55,550
<i>[I called but why didn't you pick up?]</i>

170
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:55,550
<i>[Don't pretend to forget about us
When are you free to meet up?]</i>

171
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,870
It's like it got deleted.

172
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,810
So I...

173
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,100
decided...

174
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,550
to call and clear things up.

175
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,220
Hello, Tob.
Are you free tomorrow?

176
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,170
Come and see me at the university.
I need to talk to you.

177
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,700
He also really believe
that I was Chokpink.

178
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,640
How stupid.

179
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,250
I like! Mameow!

180
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,850
You're just acting as her, right?

181
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,880
So then what? You handled
him on the meeting day, right?

182
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,840
Who asked to meet
in such a hot place like this?

183
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,440
E'Meow,
are you sure he'll be here?

184
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,810
He will.

185
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,700
There, that's the guy.

186
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,740
So handsome, dude.

187
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,760
Have you set the
appointment with Chokpink?

188
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,550
She's here.

189
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,480
Pink?

190
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,870
Tob, what are you doing here?

191
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,840
There it is.

192
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,350
I think she's very suspicious.

193
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,050
Meow, be on stand by.

194
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,630
When I get the chance,
I'll release the queue myself.

195
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,280
You're the one
who set this appointment.

196
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,140
I had to take leave from my work.

197
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,350
Why would I want to meet you?

198
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,820
I set this up.

199
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,710
I know everything.
This guy is the one you
talk to everyday, right?

200
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,170
I want to clear this up
on who will you choose.

201
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,460
Choose what?

202
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,380
What do you mean...

203
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,360
when you said you
secretly set this up?

204
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,740
Well...

205
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,900
I admit that he's the one
I've been talking to everyday.

206
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,320
But he's not
my boyfriend or my fling.

207
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,170
Then why do you have
to talk to him everyday?

208
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,030
Because I'm her creditor

209
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,480
Guys...

210
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,820
Mameow, dear.

211
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,730
It's a flick, right. A flick!

212
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,310
Then about you
suspected the phone number...

213
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,210
did Chokpink mad at you?

214
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,630
<i>What's left of it.</i>

215
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,010
So what now?

216
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,660
You're wasting my
time to earn money.

217
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,860
After sitting in the car for so long,
I thought you had money to pay me back.

218
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,310
What now, Pink?

219
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,560
Pink!

220
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,680
Beebee!

221
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,380
Wait.

222
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,360
Are you simply
just gonna leave like that?

223
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,570
I wasted a lot
of time coming here.

224
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,390
How much
did Chokpink owe you?

225
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,930
I'll pay for it first.

226
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,170
So...

227
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,100
Stop.

228
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,870
Don't pay for her.

229
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,170
Pink!

230
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,550
Where are you going?

231
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,130
Let's get to know each other.
What's your name?

232
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,010
I heard that you like to eat beans, right?
<i>[ There is a slang "thua dum/black bean"
means "anal sex between men" ]</i>

233
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,700
Help, help!

234
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,950
Help!

235
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,500
Help!

236
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,370
Pink.

237
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,390
Hold on.

238
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,390
I'm sorry.

239
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm sorry.

240
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,070
I was afraid
you cheated on me.

241
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,290
I overthink things.

242
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,360
Next time, if there's anything,
I'll ask you directly.

243
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,330
Let's talk nicely.

244
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,220
I'm sorry.

245
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,300
I won't do this again.

246
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,490
It's alright.

247
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,780
It's my fault for
keeping it secret from you.

248
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,890
You have it all with you.

249
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,220
As for me, I have to work...

250
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,830
earn money...

251
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,990
for the tuition fee...

252
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,360
I even have to owe money.

253
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,500
I don't want  you to think that
I date you because of money.

254
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,830
I never think of you like that.

255
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,030
The reason I got uncontrolled...

256
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,500
because I was
afraid that you didn't love me.

257
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,790
How about this?

258
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,160
I'll pay for it first.

259
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,920
When you have money...

260
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,870
you pay me back slowly.

261
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,580
But...

262
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,560
OK?

263
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,630
So you won't have to
talk to anyone else every day.

264
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,880
I can pay whatever amount it is.

265
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,460
So to ease us both.

266
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,670
Don't.

267
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,490
It's 30,000.

268
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,390

Thank you.

look at appearances, right? Kimyong?

00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,600

When the two of them reconciled,
we'll be the stay dogs.

277
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,720
Money received.

things didn't go as expected.

281
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,070
Chokpink!!!

282
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,100
After I paid her the debt...

283
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,910

come back to the condo anymore.

Until I went to her
workplace to find her.

OK.

292
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,840
Pink, I need to talk to you.

293
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,270
I'm working. We'll talk later.

294
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,270
Why are you
running and avoiding me?

295
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,360
If there's anything, let's talk.
Don't disappear like that.

296
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,410
Why are you acting
like you're lying to me?

297
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,980

We'll talk when I'm done.

301

Are you comfortable?

302
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,140
Very.

303
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,490
Wanna try?

304
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,390
Yes.

00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,270
You're Ai'Pink's
new girlfriend, right?

306
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,560
We met the other day.

307
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,100
Do you remember me?

308
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,920
That expression, this means
you got abandoned after
you helped her pay off her debt.

309
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,620
How do you know?

310
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,890
Before I became her creditor...

311
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,480
I used to date her.

312
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,050
Ai'Pink likes to borrow money from
her current boyfriend to pay back her ex.

313
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,230
Like this.

314
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,000
I can't tell.

315
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,480
She looks like
she really loves me.

316
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,370
Same old trick.

317
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,040
Let me guess.

318
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,940
She deceived you by
making you trust her completely...

319
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,870
by creating a couple's name.

320
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,610
Do you have one?

321
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,050
Booboo.

322
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,170

When I completely trusted her...

326
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,280
she treated me to
an expensive restaurant.

327
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,230
to cover up rumors
of her borrowing money.

328
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,850
In the end...

329
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,850
she abandoned me.

330
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,050
It's clear now.

331
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,550
Can I ask you something?

332
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,570
Why do you have to only
call and talk to her at 7 PM?

333
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,050
This shop has different
break time for each employees.

334
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,740
My break is at 7 PM.

335
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,670
I called her immediately
when I'm on break.

336
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,930
I was afraid that
she'd take too long to pick up,
so I have time to pester her.

337
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,590
Why didn't you tell
me when we met before?

338
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,060
Everyone has to eat.

339
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,380
I took leave that day too.

340
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,780
I was afraid
I went there for nothing.

341
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,140
Sorry.

342
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,460
But I worked hard to save money
that I instead help her pay her debt.

343
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,210
I spent 30,000 for that.

344
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,770
30,000?!

345
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,010
Are you crazy?!

346
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,260
Who's dumb
enough to lend that much?

347
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,210
Even I who lent her 3000...

348
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,800
she didn't even pay me even
when I pestered her every day.

349
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,240
No, it's 30,000.

350
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,480
She said 3...

351
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,800
It's clear now.

352
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,200

353
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,870

<i>(Booboo)</i>

364
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,020
I've found out that I've
become an unknown caller.

365
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,600
After I saw with my own eyes
that I was deliberately deceived.

366
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,260
So I thought, I won't let anyone else
to get deceived by her anymore.

367
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,460
Chokpink, Phawinee Wannachai.
Student ID 13550576.

368
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,930
She's a swindler...

369
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,530
who lied and said that she need to pay 30,000 in debt but only needed 3000!

370
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,420
She disappears as soon as she gets the money!

371
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,370
I'm not the first to be scammed!

372
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,110
She made me think she loves me...

373
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,810
then scammed my money away!

374
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,830
What's her name?!

375
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,660
Chokpink!

376
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,470
What is she?

377
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,190
A swindler!

378
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,150
What's her name?!

379
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:49,830
Chokpink!

380
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,170
- What is she?
- A swindler!

381
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,100
What's her name?!

382
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:52,870
Chokpink!

383
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,270
- What is she?
- A swindler!

384
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,440
Yes!

385
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,690
Chokpink!

386
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,270
A swindler!

387
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,620
Chokpink!

388
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,260
A swindler!

389
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,510
Stay away from her.

390
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,760
Hurry up and post
it on social media.

391
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,640
Don't let her have a place stand,
don't let her have a place to sleep
and don't let her have a place sit.

392
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,490
True, true, true.

393
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,410
Don't let her reincarnate.
Look at her face, remember her face!

394
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,410
Remember her face!

395
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,190
Don't let her deceived you!

396
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,910
Finally...

397
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,850
we revealed the
bright road to the society.

398
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,640
So that they'll know she really is.

399
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,450
Thank you guys so much.

400
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,100
I think Pink should
learn a lesson this time and dare
not deceive anyone else anymore.

401
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,630
At least that
glasses guy will realized this.

402
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,390
That glasses guy.

403
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,730
You're Khun Mameow, right?

404
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,980
Have a sit.

405
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,710
My name is Pee,

406
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,170
Look at this.

407
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,730
Here's the clear evidence
captured on last Tuesday.

408
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,050
You slander
Khun Chokpink in public.

409
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,240
So...

410
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,480
it's a violation of Article 123,
Chapter 11 of the Contract Law.

411
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,550
Maximum Penalty, imprisonment
not exceeding 5 years or be
fined not more than 500,000 baht.

412
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,300
Or both.

413
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,940
I've made a police report.

414
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,690
Today, at 17:30 PM...

415
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,050
let's go to the police station.

416
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,780
You...

417
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,800
Let's go, Moomoo.

<i>and a lot of fines, P'Toytoen.</i>

421
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,790
This is extreme, Mameow.

422
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,020
I don't know which sound effect
to use to express my grief for you.

423
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,920
Got a first lover, in addition
to get deceived and lied to...

424
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,660
you also have to go to the police
station and go to court to pay the fine.

425
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,120
Are you going to recover
the debts you paid for her?

426
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,150
<i>I don't want to even if I can.</i>

427
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,180
<i>I thought about it.
Enough is enough.</i>

428
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,550
After listening to you...

429
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,640
please do some merit, dear.

430
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:51,620
Anyway, thank you so much
for coming to see us today
to share such a dumb love story.

431
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:55,440
Hope all the viewers who are
listening, about the money thing...

432
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,380
if it can be avoided, don't lend
or borrow other people's money

433
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,780
Otherwise, there will be a
lot of trouble in the future.

434
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,580
That's all for
today's Club Sapan Fai.

435
