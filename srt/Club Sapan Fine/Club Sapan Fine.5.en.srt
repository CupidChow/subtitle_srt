9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,410
It's here!

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,090
Welcome to all listener
to the show, Club Sapan Fai.

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,670
We've heard a lot of
dumb stories on the show.

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,010
But some stories
are just so ridiculous.

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,820
But love is also a lesson.

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,560
Although there is a bad
side but also allows us to grow.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,260
Our topic for today is,
The Dumb and Nonsense Love.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,740
No matter how bad it is,
if there's substance in life or
not which I'm sure there's not.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,220
Let's listen to our caller,
here it comes.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,990
Sawasdee kha.

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,060
Sawasdee kha, I'm Kim.

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,800
Oh, Kimberly.

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,090
OK, Kim. What's your
ridiculous but valuable story?

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,820
<i>My dumb love story
aside from being fuzzy...</i>

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,600
<i>it also made my life fail.</i>

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,260
Kim, you're using
Sunthorn Phu's poet, right?

25
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,420
Tell me, tell me.

26
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,130
It happened during
my high school time.

27
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,840
Sawasdee krub.

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,530
We are the 4 Seasons!

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,780
Let me hear some noises!

30
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,990
P'Pae is the vocalist
of the 4 Seasons band.

31
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,920
The whole school knows this band...

32
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,620
because of his handsomeness.

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,110
But I know him...

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,590
because of the
accident that day.

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,660
P'Pae!

36
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,630
Wave! He waved to me!

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,200
Are you alright?

38
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,100
Are you hurt anywhere?

39
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,310
Yes.

40
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,020
Who is that bitch?

41
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,440
She's my old friend
since junior high school.

42
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,560
Junior high school?

43
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,040
Take it.

44
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,440
Let me help.

45
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,720
Are you alright?

46
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,700
Can you walk?

47
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,280
With your permission.

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,540
P'Pae, he...

49
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,630
Are you gonna
compete with me?!

50
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,490
I want to hold him too!

51
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,110
He's mine!

52
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,630
What's wrong...

53
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,770
I'll hit you.

54
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,450
Ever since he
carried me to the infirmary...

55
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,300
he disappeared.

56
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,030
When we met,
we'd just say hello.

57
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,190
He would just wink
at me when I met him.

58
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,850
But my close friend said that I'm...

59
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,830
Slut!

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,120
Just by looking at a
guy like this is not a slut.

61
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,110
The word "crazy about a guy"...

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,100
can be used on you.

63
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,310
Your mouth is
as despicable as always.

64
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,300
I'm just looking at him.

65
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,530
Look.

66
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,780
There many people who likes him.

67
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,220
His good aura...

68
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,350
certainly didn't made me fell
during the start of the semester.

69
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,400
Did you wait long?

70
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,130
Not really.

71
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,420
But, actually...

72
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,620
you don't have to treat me.

73
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,370
It's alright.

74
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,950
I want to do it as an apologies.

75
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,200
I fell until our lips met like that.

76
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,480
Don't worry about that.

77
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,630
You can drop on me again.

78
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,870
What's that?

79
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,810
No, it's nothing.

80
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,390
How coincidence.

81
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,760
The first day, you fell.
Today, I fell off the stage.

82
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,570
But now...

83
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,420
I'll drop...

84
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,200
Drop...

85
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,280
Drop...

86
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,880
You scared me!

87
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,930
E'Mond!

88
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,560
Sorry, my friend
is not acting normally.

89
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,290
I invited her to join because
it's not appropriate for us to
be alone just the two of us.

90
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,200
It's alright.

91
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,590
Have a seat.

92
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,280
You don't feel disgusted if I blow
the shrimp for you like this, right?

93
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,710
No.

94
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,430
But...

95
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,810
if you give them all to me...

96
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,790
I'm afraid that
you won't get to eat.

97
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,170
It's alright.

98
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,310
I always like to serve people.

99
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,030
What do your
family do for living?

100
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,230
My dad is a...

101
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,320
COO of an oil company.

102
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,000
You mean CEO?

103
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,590
Yes, CEO.

104
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,430
- A CEO.
- That's right, CEO.

105
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,560
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,560
This place is delicious.

107
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,560
I go to Japan very
often and they eat like this.

108
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,230
- Because it's a soup, like this?
- Yes.

109
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,530
Bill, please.

110
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,600
That's alright, I'll pay for it.

111
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,810
No need to feel courteous.

112
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,160
Everything is 730 baht.

113
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,600
- 700...30 baht.
- 730 baht.

114
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,640
Kim, I forgot to
withdraw my money.

115
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,320
Can I borrow yours first?

116
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,530
I'll withdraw it later.

117
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,650
It's my treat
but you pay it first.

118
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,310
I forgot to withdraw money.

119
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,740
Sorry, sorry.

120
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,750
Sure thing.

121
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,080
- How much?
- 730 baht.

122
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,740
OK, you give 750.

123
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,450
Balance is 20 baht.

124
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,660
Thanks.

125
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,870
Is this for tip?

126
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,510
You're quite charitable.

127
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,240
My family said that
it's important to give.

128
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,620
Whenever I can help,
I should. Even if it's only a little.

129
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,760
P'Pae, we only just had dinner once.

130
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,700
But touching hands on
first day is not appropriate.

131
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,220
Although it's first time,
you got my heart.

132
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,310
It maybe a bit rush...

133
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,880
but...

134
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,350
Will you be my girlfriend?

135
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,170
Isn't it too rush, P'Pae?

136
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,970
You should take time
getting to know each other first.

137
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,150
OK.

138
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
Isn't it to fast?

139
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,210
But I understand,
it's a teenager's hormones.

140
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,630
You're fin into it, right?

141
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,870
<i>I was super fin,
it's like I went to the heaven.</i>

142
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,200
<i>But who would've thought...</i>

143
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,170
that I was about
to fall so badly instead.

144
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,180
From that moment on, I date him.

145
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:08,340
{\an4}<i>[I miss you so much]</i>

146
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,660
This world has turn pink.

147
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,340
{\an4}<i>[After school,
I'll treat you for a meal]</i>

148
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,150
No matter where you look at,
there are flowers everywhere.

149
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,350
But my friend said that...

150
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,970
He's just begging to eat.

151
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,380
That's crazy.

152
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,150
You're...

153
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,080
You're... thinking too much.

154
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,690
He said he wanted
to treat you for a meal...

155
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,170
but make you pay
and never pay you back.

156
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,260
Is he really a son
of an oil company CEO?

157
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,190
He always said
that he'll pay me back.

158
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,460
That day...

159
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,610
P'Pae...

160
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,940
about the money that
lend it to you that day...

161
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,060
Why?

162
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,360
You don't have to pay them all,
we can share half each.

163
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,890
365 baht.

164
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,110
It's so happen that
I have to pay my rent.

165
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,450
It's alright, I told you...

166
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,030
that it will be my treat.

167
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,390
for this and that other day, OK?

168
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,830
Alright.

169
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,050
Thank you.

170
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,790
I thought you...

171
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,390
Put it for you?

172
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,370
Yes.

173
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,520
My plate is full,
so I borrow yours for a bit.

174
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,080
If they're grill too long,
they will dry.

175
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,820
OK.

176
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,090
It's very delicious,
the meat is very soft.

177
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,410
Wake up!

178
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,230
So, did he pay or you did?

179
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,190
I forgot to bring my wallet again.

180
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,020
Kim, can you pay first?

181
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,980
I'll transfer it to you later.

182
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,940
It's 598 baht.

183
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,100
Thank you.

184
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,060
Kim.

185
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,350
Wait for me up front,
I'm gonna go to the toilet for a bit.

186
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,400
It'll only take a second.

187
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,230
See, I knew it!

188
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,620
He's begging for meal, for sure.

189
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,720
He may be pay me
back in one lump sum.

190
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,050
I told you, his family is rich.

191
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,980
He lied about being rich.

192
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,260
Trust me.

193
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,650
Do you have proof?

194
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,400
The tear mark is about 3.4 cm...

195
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,940
looks like a centipede tore mark.

196
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,910
Where did you get
the photo of his tore pants?

197
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,330
I took it myself.

198
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,140
Take that pattern...

199
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,080
and compare it with this.

200
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,920
He might just be frugal.

201
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:30,070
Currently it is fashionable
to dress up expensive things
to look less expensive.

202
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,500
But it's a tear on the
crotch not on the knee.

203
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,800
If he's rich as he says he is...

204
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,730
he won't be wearing the same
pants to school everyday, right?

205
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,710
If I can proof this,
it would make you open your eyes.

206
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,040
Sawasdee kha, my friends.

207
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,230
The topic I'm talking about
today is the picture in my heart...

208
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,870
which I took it with all my heart.

209
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,900
Here, look.

210
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,940
This line here
matches the one in here.

211
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,510
Where?

212
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,910
This.

213
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,900
There are many meanings
hidden in this pictures in my heart.

214
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,250
I want you guys
to look at it carefully.

215
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,760
Zoom it.

216
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,150
I am zooming it.

217
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,690
I can't see it.

218
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,500
When you see it, you'll scream...

219
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,750
Shit!

220
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,690
Look carefully.

221
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,100
Shit!

222
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,480
It's here, can't you see it?

223
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
It's clear.

224
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,160
Sompohn, you're the principal's son.
Why did you took this kind of photo?!

225
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,480
Teacher, it's not mine.
It must be on someone else' screen.

226
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,270
I will report this to your father!

227
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,360
Teacher!

228
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,360
It's not from my screen.

229
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,780
At that moment,
my pink world was destroyed.

230
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,720
About the tore crotch pants...

231
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,590
I set a meeting
with him to clear things up.

232
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,110
Kim, you suddenly
staring at my crotch...

233
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,770
Suddenly you call me here...

234
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,180
what's wrong?

235
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,670
Do you have anything to tell me?

236
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,190
What?

237
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,780
I...

238
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,800
know the truth already.

239
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,950
About what you kept a secret.

240
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,210
But I rather hear
it from your mouth.

241
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,190
Since you already know the truth...

242
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,260
I'll say it then.

243
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,530
The truth is...

244
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,940
The truth is...

245
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,720
My parents went overseas.

246
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,200
I've been living in
the condo alone lately.

247
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,680
The room is so big.

248
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,330
I'm very lonely.

249
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,010
If tonight I sleep in
your room, will be possible?

250
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,940
Will that be a good idea?

251
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,580
If you're feeling uncomfortable,
I'll prepare a bag...

252
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,700
A bag?!

253
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,880
I mean a sleeping bag.

254
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,070
Sleeping bag.

255
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,670
I can prepare
my own sleeping bag.

256
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,870
You'll sleep on the bed...

257
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,400
and I sleep on the floor.

258
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,340
OK.

259
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,240
That's how it is?

260
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,070
You must have rejected it, right?

261
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,830
<i>That's crazy, P'.</i>

262
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,470
<i>I'm a girl, OK.</i>

263
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,130
Kim.

264
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,800
Yes?

265
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,940
Can I turn on the air conditioner?

266
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,140
It's so hot.

267
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,280
Sure thing.

268
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,410
It won't comfortable sleeping.

269
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,680
I lso think...

270
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,190
it's quite hot tonight.

271
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,590
So close.

272
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,670
<i>If you don't talk
about it to P'Pae tonight...</i>

273
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,800
I'll kill you tomorrow.

274
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,810
Shit...

275
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,960
Kim.

276
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,560
May I take my clothes off?

277
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,480
It's sticky, I'm all sweaty.

278
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,370
Kim.

279
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,620
Yes?

280
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,220
Can I plug in?

281
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,150
You want to plug...

282
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,620
Can I plug in...

283
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,550
Plug in...

284
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,200
my phone?

285
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,700
My battery almost out,
only have 2% left.

286
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,830
Can I use it?

287
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,700
I thought you
were gonna plug in me.

288
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,100
What's that?

289
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,010
- Plug in... that's right, phone.
- Phone.

290
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,470
Go on ahead.

291
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,550
P'Pae.

292
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,460
About the money...

293
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,440
In the end, I can't find
the right time to talk to him.

294
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,970
I thought he
might be gone by tomorrow.

295
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,350
But...

296
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,160
Fuck, attack them!

297
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,690
Back me up, let's go.

298
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,480
Shit, I died.

299
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,930
Yeah, just a minute.
I'm resurrecting.

300
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,890
Shit, so stupid. Move in!

301
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,580
Did you go? Go!

302
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,690
Did you go?

303
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,540
So, he came back and set
up  mess in your room, right?

304
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,470
Why didn't you chased him out?

305
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,210
I don't understand it myself either.

306
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,160
I know that I'm a fool.

307
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,910
But what can I do?

308
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,600
My dream boy is
right in front of me.

309
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,400
So I endure it.

310
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,370
You do know that a
human's patience has limit.

311
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,730
I can't stand it anymore!

312
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,800
I can't stand you either!

313
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,610
The first meal, 730 baht.

314
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,650
Moo kratha, 598 baht.

315
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,310
The air conditioner is
turned on to 24 degrees all day...

316
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,370
and the air conditioner
consumes 18,000 BTU of electricity

317
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,230
Stop!

318
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,120
You never scold
me this long before.

319
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,720
It shows and needed scolding.

320
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,270
Even though he has problems...

321
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,000
he has good points in him.

322
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,280
How so?

323
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,040
He is a guy who
cares about others.

324
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,510
Think about it.

325
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,280
Who would send me to the
infirmary the first time we met?

326
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,180
Even though he acts like a hobo...

327
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,490
a beggar.

328
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,780
I still can't forget his good deeds.

329
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,160
But if you see this?

330
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,970
This is P'Pae's neighborhood.

331
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,950
I got this from a senior in grade 11.

332
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:17,640
Some say he stole money
so the whole class rejected him.

333
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,300
This too.

334
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,770
This was when I fell...

335
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,900
and P'Pae
carried me to the infirmary.

336
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,480
This clip was given
to me by a friend in class 6.

337
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,960
It has nothing to
do with being rich or poor.

338
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,160
But the question is...

339
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,010
Do you want to
have a thief as boyfriend?

340
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,560
Kim, I'm here.

341
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,750
Let's go home.

342
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,010
But I'm hungry,
wanna have shabu?

343
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,460
Kim...

344
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,480
Kim, calm down.

345
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,120
Go back and pack
your things from my room.

346
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,840
So, how was he
after you caught him?

347
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,210
He tried to say something.

348
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,350
But I didn't listen.

349
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,380
I was extremely angry.

350
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,400
I can't accept that he's a beggar.

351
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,380
But if it's a thief...

352
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,870
I can't tolerate.

353
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,300
That's correct.

354
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,490
Dear listeners, listen to me.

355
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,290
We can be born poor but no matter
how poor we are, we can't turn into a thief.

356
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,780
Poor and thief are spelled differently.
They're not the same thing at all.
<i>["Jon/poor" and "Jor/thief" sounds almost identical ]</i>

357
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,540
What happens next?

358
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,570
Mond continues to investigate.

359
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,500
We found out that his family are
in worse condition than we thought.

360
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,650
His father is a drinker,
an alcoholic and a gambler.

361
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,410
And his mother sells
papaya salad by herself.

362
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,190
This is what we call there's
a complexity due to his background.

363
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,330
Then, did you got
soft after you knew this?

364
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>After that...</i>

365
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,320
<i>P'Pae disappeared from my life.</i>

366
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,770
A month has passed until
there's another school concert.

367
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,710
<i>♪ From today, we're still far apart ♪</i>

368
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,480
<i>♪ Our watches
never stop at the same time ♪</i>

369
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,630
Again!

370
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,960
That's crazy,
I don't like him anymore.

371
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,630
Better.

372
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,960
Here, happy birthday.

373
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,570
Really?

374
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,100
Thank you.

375
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,690
So cute.

376
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,620
Those who are screaming for him...

377
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,070
probably doesn't know
what kind of person he is.

378
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,460
You really don't
want to expose him?

379
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,390
Just let it go.

380
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,530
The reason he hasn't been
exposed is because his life is already pitiful.

381
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,030
Thank you so much
everyone for cheering us today.

382
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,120
Before I go off the stage...

383
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,890
I have something
to confess to someone.

384
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,670
Some time ago, I met a girl.

385
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,820
I first met her when
I carried her to the infirmary.

386
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,420
I met her again
when I fell from the stage.

387
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,550
When I realized it, I...

388
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,090
already fell in love with you.

389
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,710
You were very nice to me.

390
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,060
But I reciprocated
by hurting your feelings.

391
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,130
As time went by, the more I feel that...

392
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,710
I can't cut you out of my life.

393
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,280
I want to ask for one
more chance from you today.

394
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,340
All the time, she always
been given a lot to me.

395
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,960
Let me do something for once today.

396
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,880
Happy Birthday, Kim.

397
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,260
Actually, I kept it at first...

398
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,470
with the intention of selling it.

399
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,100
But when I got to know you...

400
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,350
I had a change of heart.

401
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,550
Kim, wait for me upfront.

402
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,860
I need to go to the toilet for a bit.

403
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,930
It'll only take a second.

404
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,740
I want to tell you...

405
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,040
actually I've intended to
return it to you for a long time now.

406
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,650
But if I returned it to you...

407
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,660
you will know that I stole it.

408
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,640
If that happens...

409
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,600
our relationship will fell apart.

410
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,140
So I don't want
it to end up like that.

411
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,170
Because I like you.

412
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,810
You make me into a better person.

413
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,640
Let's date, Kim.

414
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,660
My friend will be a
fool to date  guy like you.

415
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,680
OK.

416
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,780
Am I a dog around here?

417
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,900
Idiot.

418
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,090
I see you spend a lot of money.

419
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,160
You like to give
charity and like to help people.

420
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,380
I'm worried that you won't be able to save
money, so I bought you a piggy bank.

421
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,750
Thank you.

422
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,090
Save every day...

423
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,640
so you won't be as poor as me.

424
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,800
But I don't have
anything I want right now.

425
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,480
But I promise
I'll save money every day.

426
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,730
Then...

427
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,710
save money to buy me a guitar, OK?

428
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,700
Calm down.

429
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,780
Idiot!

430
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,130
E'Pae!

431
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,980
I feel sorry for buffalo for
using the word "kwai(buffalo/stupid)".

432
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,130
This guy has reached a higher level.

433
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,380
No matter what you say to him,
it won't change his nature.

434
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,030
What then? Did you curse him?

435
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,590
Who am I going to curse?

436
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,100
We've been
living together until now.

437
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,310
He's sleeping
and snoring next to me.

438
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,890
Hold on, Kim.

439
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,970
Honestly, I wrote it down.

440
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,670
He deceived you for meal,
stole your phone...

441
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,630
lied to you that he
had a change of heart...

442
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,500
but in the end, bought
you a piggy bank, am I right?

443
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,340
<i>At least now he
only beg me for food.</i>

444
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,810
<i>He's not a thief anymore.</i>

445
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,990
<i>That means he has grown up.</i>

446
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,320
Kim!

447
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Listeners.

448
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,520
We do the Club Sapan Fai
show because...

449
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,570
in the hope that
this dumb love stories...

450
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,290
will makes us grow as a person.

451
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,320
When did he grow up?!

452
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,490
He did all these and she still
accept him? Oh dear, listeners.

453
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,240
Ever since this show
started airing, Kim here is...

454
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,280
the man of the match, for real.

455
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,420
I really hope and have big hope that...

456
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,540
whoever listening to this
program, don't be like this girl.

457
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,910
Whoever encounters a
similar situation, leave immediately.
Why are you enduring it so much?

458
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,800
I'm pissed!

459
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,960
Let's end it here, I really can't
stand it anymore. Sawasdee kha.

460
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:44,560
Hurry and find something to eat,
I'll be there later.

461
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,950
