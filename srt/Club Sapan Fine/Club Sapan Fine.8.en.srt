00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,980

Club

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,090
I dream...

9
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,030
of wanting to have a wedding
like this since I was eight.

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,880
It'll have a lot of flowers.

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,600
A fluffy wedding dress
and all of this ambiance.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,140
Like a romantic love movie.

13
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,880
I think there's no
need for a wedding.

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,290
Just register is enough.

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,780
Just register is enough.

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,030
Just register is enough.

17
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,470
Unsure

18
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,310
<i>Just thinking about
what he said that time...</i>

19
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,940
<i>it makes me gone crazy!</i>

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,840
Calm down, calm down.

21
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,280
Can I please do the
intro of the show first, OK?

22
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,390
Sawasdee kha. Sawasdee kha
to all listeners of Club Sapan Fai.

23
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,630
We're talking to
Miss Biew, our new caller.

24
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,900
Our topic today is
"Can I make a choice?"

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,440
Can it make you less dumb?!

26
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,310
Alright, Miss Biew.

27
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,960
How long have you and
Mr. Max known each other?

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,570
<i>Since high school.</i>

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,740
<i>I love and always been
trying to get close to him.</i>

30
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,440
<i>But when it come to that...</i>

31
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,500
<i>I can't accept it!</i>

32
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,010
About what, Miss Beau?

33
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,540
28...

34
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,970
29...

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,040
30.

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,520
Now you can swallow.

37
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:16,490
Chewing food carefully 20 to 30 times
before swallowing is actually pretty good.

38
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,360
However, who will count this specifically?

39
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,320
Now back to the real concern...

40
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,810
P'Max, about the wedding, I think...

41
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,980
I get you.

42
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,920
But I think it's
just a waste of money.

43
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,420
But I...

44
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,290
Eat this first.

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,990
Or it will get cold.

46
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,920
Open up.

47
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,060
Very good.

48
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,200
What were you saying?

49
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,420
4...

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,880
5...

51
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,230
6...

52
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,650
7...

53
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,250
8...

54
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,770
9...

55
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,690
However many times I
want to chew is up to me, right?!

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,490
Stop!

57
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,580
Why don't you just break up with him?

58
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,810
He didn't do anything wrong.

59
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,180
He's just boring.

60
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,650
However, I don't understand...

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,950
as to why doesn't he
care about marriage at all?

62
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,420
Hold on.

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,720
So you're not OK with him being bored
or him not wanting to get married?

64
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,540
E'Beau, I think P'Max...

65
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,900
is not that handsome.

66
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,850
Or do you want to have...

67
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,500
a gentlemen...

68
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,430
who is handsome, rich...

69
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,560
still single.

70
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,130
Let's do an election.

71
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,770
Biew, this is the
legendary VIP package.

72
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,190
Extremely cool, I'm telling you.

73
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,140
Everyone!

74
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,950
Today is my birthday!

75
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,270
Drink all you want, it's my treat!

76
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,380
Nong, please arrange us the
most expensive set meal in the bar.

77
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,880
E'Beau, do you want any...

78
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,490
Wait, wait, wait!

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,100
We can do this?

80
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,200
Of course.

81
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,600
We can do anything here.

82
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,700
Be yourself.

83
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,630
4, 5, 6, 7...

84
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,200
That's right,
we have to be ourselves.

85
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,240
In the end...

86
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,130
the gentleman fell to me, P'Tle.

87
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,380
Cheers.

88
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,750
I was happy...

89
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,650
and enjoy the
most in my life, P'Tle.

90
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,630
Enjoy until...

91
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,160
- P'Max?
- N'Beau!

92
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,310
Pick up your phone.

93
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,450
<i>N'Beau, pick up your phone.</i>

94
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,730
<i>[P'Max]</i>

95
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,580
<i>N'Beau, pick up your phone.</i>

96
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,780
<i>N'Beau...</i>

97
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,390
I might enjoyed too much.

98
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,360
Tonight, go out with me again?

99
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,790
Tonight, go out with me again?

100
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,530
Actually, I didn't
intend to do it this way.

101
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,660
It might be because I was too drunk.

102
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,700
So I lose consciousness.

103
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,920
Wait, oh dear.

104
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,160
Miss Beau, you're so hot.

105
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,430
So much peppers, giving you the
whole garden won't be enough.

106
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,890
So that means you
breaks up with P'Max, right?

107
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,770
<i>Not yet.</i>

108
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,030
<i>I wasn't sure back then.</i>

109
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,120
<i>I thought only
about trying new things.</i>

110
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,480
Is that possible?

111
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:10,910
When I was with P'Joe I feel
like I'm close to someone special.

112
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,190
He takes care of my
desire without any restriction.

113
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,550
And we spent the
whole night until late night.

114
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,560
Dancing.

115
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,070
- Drink.
- Bottoms up!

116
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,710
Then dance.

117
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,790
Keep looping like that.

118
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,440
Cheers.

119
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,910
At that time...

120
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,180
I don't know...

121
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,380
how I got to that point.

122
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,020
The point of only
spending my night life...

123
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,160
that I forgot my daytime life.

124
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,360
Excuse me, can we sit here too?

125
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,770
Yes, please.

126
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,350
Beau.

127
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,230
Beau?

128
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,260
Is there something wrong?

129
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,190
Nothing.

130
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,510
I was too busy with
work so I got less sleep.

131
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,730
You can't do that.

132
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,490
If this goes on...

133
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,810
you'll get office syndrome.

134
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,400
At that time...

135
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,850
my gulty feeling suddenly awakens.

136
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,360
Take time to rest
and adjust your breathing.

137
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,550
Why do I have to be this tired?

138
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,590
Such a nice person is in
front of me the whole time.

139
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,860
But then...

140
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,210
If it is simple stretching...

141
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,240
it can be done anywhere!

142
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,930
It can be done anywhere!

143
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,290
No, not here.

144
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,970
Put your hands together like this.

145
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,150
Please, please.

146
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,620
Then put your fingers like this...

147
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,370
then put them on your
hand and  shoot it up high.

148
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,250
Then take a deep breath...

149
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,570
- No, no, no.

150
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,570
for 5 seconds like this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

151
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,340
If you want to do it better...

152
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,290
- Shit!

153
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,290
- You have to squat too.

154
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,040
1, 2...

155
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,090
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

156
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,890
One more time.

157
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,460
Do you see this? Beau, look.

158
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,390
Look, Beau, look at here.

159
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,320
Let's do it again, look.

160
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,710
Don't forget to squat.

161
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,590
1, 2...

162
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,600
- When I thought about it...

163
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,600
- 3, 4...

164
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,640
Thinking about
that it's tiring and fun...

165
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,140
at least, it's fun.

166
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,730
The champion is N'Beau!

167
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:19,850
That's crazy,
if anyone dares then come on!

168
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,990
Come on!

169
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,380
Go, go, go!

170
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,330
But here we go again, P'Tle.

171
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,790
As much fun as it is with P'Joe...

172
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,520
Boss

173
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,770
But if it keeps up like this...

174
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,590
if my body doesn't fall apart,
my life will be destroyed.

175
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,900
And I don't see any
way to know P'Joe better.

176
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,650
So I thought...

177
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,720
I have to do something.

178
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
P'Joe!

179
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,040
I think we've spent too
much time on enjoyment.

180
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,620
I want the other side of you too.

181
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,640
I want to see your world.

182
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,610
N'Beau.

183
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,450
Everything you see here...

184
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,620
is my whole world!

185
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,910
Am I right, guys!?

186
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,870
Excuse me.

187
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,680
- E'Pear, E'Pear.
- What?

188
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,340
Help me hold off P'Joe.
I'll escape first.

189
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,040
Wait, where are you going?

190
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,500
I can't take it anymore!

191
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,320
Just seeing him makes
me want to throw up.

192
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,860
You can't! How are
you going to go home?

193
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,290
You! Shit...

194
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,070
Save me!

195
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,120
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

196
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,380
OK, sorry.

197
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,590
Thank you.

198
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,400
OK.

199
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,590
<i>[Pear]</i>

200
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,890
What's up?

201
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,630
<i>E'Beau, where are you?</i>

202
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,070
Last night, I...

203
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,880
went to sleep in his room.

204
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,620
Jay is my type of guy.

205
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,150
Our age is not so different.

206
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,540
But because he's
often repeating grades..

207
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,670
he's still in his fourth year.

208
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,400
Every night after party...

209
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,530
I will go visit hm at his room.

210
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,770
You can't party
heavily like this every night.

211
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,390
Take care of yourself too.

212
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,200
Because he...

213
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,490
knows how to please me.

214
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,010
Bring up your feet.

215
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,750
- What are you doing?
- Wash your feet.

216
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,920
No need!

217
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,050
- No need!
- Come.

218
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,030
I noticed you like to wear high heels.

219
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,480
He's even romantic, P'Tle.

220
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,660
I'm feeling ease.

221
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,660
This may be the fate of thousands
of miles for letting us be together.

222
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,840
Every time I'm near N'Jay...

223
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,300
it makes me feel...

224
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,700
Hot.

225
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,090
Turn on the aircond.

226
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,490
It's not that hot.

227
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,110
It's hot.

228
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,730
Hot.

229
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,120
Jay?

230
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,520
Anyhow, Jay is still a kid.

231
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,420
The money is parents gave him, sometimes
it's enough and sometimes it doesn't.

232
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,070
I'll make money
quickly and return it to you.

233
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,000
I promise.

234
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,250
It's alright, it's just a little.

235
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,660
I promise, really.

236
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,680
- I promise.
- OK.

237
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,300
I'm gonna sell this.

238
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,040
How much baht will you get?

239
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,650
He can go now.

240
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,090
Jay.

241
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,320
My mom will give me money by
the end of the month, I will pay you back.

242
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,360
Don't do that.

243
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,910
I'll pay you back as
soon as I get the money.

244
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,480
My massage
usually costs 100 an hour.

245
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,070
I've been giving you massages, how many
hours do you want me to massage you?

246
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,720
OK.

247
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,490
Lie down, lie down.

248
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,100
I'll massage your back.

249
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,780
I just finished tending
the avocado orchard.

250
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,910
This one is matured now.

251
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,030
Is it cute?

252
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,550
This one too.

253
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,230
These are all avocado.

254
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,340
It's cute indeed, P'Tle.

255
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,050
But if he expects me to eat
avocado for dinner every night...

256
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,540
it'd unbearable.

257
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,740
- Yeah.
- <i>Also, think about it...</i>

258
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,440
<i>If I'm going to spend money
on little boys all the time...</i>

259
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,400
P'Tle, can I borrow 800,000 to buy a guitar?

260
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,370
P'Tle, can I borrow 800,000 to buy a guitar?

261
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,740
<i>acting like we're in puppy love phase.</i>

262
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,760
<i>People will take me
for a bad woman, right?</i>

263
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Yes, so true!

264
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,090
What you did was absolutely right.

265
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,190
Nowadays, this puppy
love thing is wrong, right?

266
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,650
<i>That's right, P'Tle.</i>

267
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,490
Then, Miss Beau...

268
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,100
have you made your decision yet?

269
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,020
Who can make that choice?

270
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,160
If you can't choose...

271
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,660
then let me recommend
you the daily selection.

272
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,110
If you check in here for the first time,
you will receive a 10% discount.

273
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,410
I'll do that.

274
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,270
Sounds great. E'Beau, check in.

275
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,910
Let me check you in.

276
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,720
Although life is bitter...

277
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,440
dessert is still sweet.

278
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,520
Post.

279
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,560
Beau.

280
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,800
Is there something wrong u
ploading a status like that?

281
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,230
{\an4}<i>[Max]</i>

282
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,230
Think about the people who
have had a harder life than you...

283
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,670
so you'll know how
comfortab le your life is.

284
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:46,370
I miss you, haven't see you for so long.
Do you want to party with P'Joe tonight?

285
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,480
{\an4}<i>[Joe]</i>

286
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,480
I miss you, haven't see you for so long.
Do you want to party with me tonight?

287
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,150
You, I lost my car. I'll come to you.

288
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,610
{\an4}<i>[Jay]</i>

289
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,610
You, I lost my car,
I want to borrow some money

290
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,460
I want to borrow some...

291
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,910
All of them...

292
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,670
I'm so sick of them.

293
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,160
All of them...

294
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,640
The first one is an idiot.

295
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,610
Another one...

296
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,510
Only partying in his brain.

297
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,630
No, listen to me first.

298
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,630
The final one...

299
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,610
almost perfect...

300
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,940
But I have to help him pay for
gas, car, electricity and water.

301
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,350
Those 3 people...

302
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,750
why there aren't
any good person at all?

303
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,060
3 people?!

304
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,230
You're all here!

305
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,830
Have you eaten?

306
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,170
I have to go.

307
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,040
What does this mean?
Are you dating 3 people at once?

308
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,350
But you'll choose me, right?

309
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,700
- What's going on? I need an answer.
- You're cheating.

310
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,230
So, you'll choose me, right?

311
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,340
-N'Biew, are you dating 3 at once?
- So what now?

312
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,940
I'm waiting for your answer.

313
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,690
But you're choosing me, right?

314
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,270
- I want your answer.
- Please answer.

315
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,710
At that time, if I have to really choose...

316
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,970
N'Jay...

317
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,740
is like a dream guy.

318
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,060
But I don't know if
I can live with him in real life.

319
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,590
As for P'Joe...

320
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,760
Even though he's handsome...

321
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,240
rich...

322
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,980
But in his world, besides feasting...

323
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,550
I don't see any other future.

324
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,130
As for P'Max...

325
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,990
right now...

326
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,630
he's the most kind with me.

327
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,360
But he's boring.

328
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,580
But what he did...

329
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,550
because he really loves me.

330
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,200
- Beau, tell me.
- Tell me.

331
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,510
For that case...

332
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,400
I have to choose.

333
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,000
N'Beau, are you gonna answer me?

334
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,210
Choose!

335
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,610
- N'Beau, choose me!
- N'Beau tell me.

336
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,510
Choose!

337
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,260
I choose...

338
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,120
Beau, you didn't chew
properly again, didn't you?

339
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,090
I told you to eat slowly.

340
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,840
At first, I thought it was
because I was too anxious.

341
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,140
But who've thought...

342
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,740
I'm pregnant!

343
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,850
Girl, I think you should go and
get a proper check-up with a doctor.

344
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,690
3 months?!

345
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,860
It's already 3 months...

346
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,700
I haven't met N'Jay yet then.

347
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,730
Absolutely not P'Max.

348
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,410
He'll wait to do
those things after marriage.

349
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,250
So...

350
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,410
Where are you going?

351
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,900
So... the child's father...

352
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,480
is that jerk P'Joe?

353
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,340
<i>Yes.</i>

354
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,980
My God!

355
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,750
So in this case,
he takes responsibility, right?

356
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,650
<i>He did.</i>

357
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,460
In the end, I got married as I wished.

358
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,800
But the wedding didn't
give me a happy ending.

359
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,940
Because P'Joe is P'Joe.

360
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,190
Even when 'm pregnant...

361
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,960
he still go out partying.

362
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,700
Then why did you give in to him,
don't just accept this kind of thing.

363
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,540
<i>I've tried.</i>

364
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,870
But it was my own stupidity.

365
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,260
A good man was already there for me...

366
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,200
<i>If I wasn't too idiotic that day...</i>

367
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,620
it wouldn't be like this in the end.

368
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,410
Then you accept the fate you choose?

369
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,930
So how many months
have you been pregnant?

370
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,090
<i>9 months.</i>

371
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,940
Is it near to giving birth?

372
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,290
<i>Yes.</i>

373
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,660
<i>Near, very near!</i>

374
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,530
<i>P'Tle, it looks like my water breaks!</i>

375
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,090
- Beau, hold on.
- <i>What should I do, P'Tle?!</i>

376
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,810
Don't joke around, Beau.

377
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,880
Beau!

378
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,950
Oh dear. Beau, calm down!

379
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,300
Get a hold of yourself, deep breath.

380
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,840
Where did you say you were?

381
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,110
OK, yeah. I get it.

382
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,460
Staff!!!

383
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,820
Hurry up,
someone is about to give birth!

384
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,730
Beau, don't hang up,
give me P'Joe's number.

385
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,130
I'll inform P'Joe.

386
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,730
Staff, call the hospital.

387
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,010
What do you think...

388
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,890
of these 8 dumb stories?

389
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,410
No matter how chaotic
or how ruined  the view is...

390
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,550
You're as rough as you used to.

391
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,520
P'Pae!

392
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,280
I love you!

393
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,570
2, 3...

394
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,830
But if we look
at it in a positive way...

395
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,240
it's a life experience.

396
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,220
So, move on!

397
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,550
Continue to live with pride.

398
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:25,950
I call to tell this to your show is to
remind everyone that whoever you want
to love, you have to be sensible about it.

399
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:33,650
Most importantly, if when there's
any dumb stories don't forget to
call and gossip it with Club Sapan Fai!

400
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,980
That's all for today.

401
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,030
See you on
the next opportunity.

402
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,900
Bye.

403
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,140
<i>♫ Let you be lucky in love ♫</i>

404
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,470
<i>♫ My heart ached until I got used to it ♫</i>

405
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,800
<i>♫ Tells me she love me over and over
again and lied to me over and over again ♫</i>

406
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,290
<i>♫ In truth, she's unfaithful ♫</i>

407
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,020
<i>♫ Even someone endures a lot like me ♫</i>

408
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,910
<i>♫ Surrender to you easily ♫</i>

409
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,570
<i>♫ No matter how much
you endure it more than me ♫</i>

410
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,410
<i>♫ Even a slut can't stand it ♫</i>

411
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,300
<i>♫ There’s only dumb, dumb, dumb ♫</i>

412
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,150
<i>♫ There’s only dumb only the dumb ♫</i>

413
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,480
<i>♫ Can you handle her? ♫</i>

414
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:21,690
<i>♫ Do you want her to be with you? ♫</i>

415
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,550
<i>♫ There’s only dumb, dumb, dumb ♫</i>

416
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,400
<i>♫ There’s only dumb only the dumb ♫</i>

417
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,520
<i>♫ Can you handle her? ♫</i>

418
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,800
<i>♫ To take her to be with you? ♫</i>

419
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,180
<i>♫ Let me go let me fly ♫</i>

420
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,830
<i>♫ I don't want to endure dumb love ♫</i>

421
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,630
<i>♫ Oh without you, I'm fine ♫</i>

422
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,310
<i>♫ Oh without you, I won't die ♫</i>

423
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,780
<i>♫ Let me go let me fly ♫</i>

424
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,610
<i>♫ I don't want to endure dumb love ♫</i>

425
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,080
<i>♫ Oh without you, I'm fine ♫</i>

426
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
<i>♫ Oh without you, I won't die ♫</i>
