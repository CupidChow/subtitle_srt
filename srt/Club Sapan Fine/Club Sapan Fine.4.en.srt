<i>[The Love We Miss]</i>

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,390
Sawasdee kha,
welcome back to Club Sapan Fai.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,570
Give a bit of applause.

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,220
Let's continue to listen to
our usual dumb love stories.

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,930
Today, we're going
to talk about first love.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,470
I believe that the first love will still
leave a deep impression on everyone.

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,420
Me too.

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,870
Dear listener, I met my first
love at the BTS this morning.
<i>[ BTS = Bangkok Mass Transit System ]</i>

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,700
I still thinking about him until now.

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,830
Is he nice to me?

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,670
No.

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,960
He just sat next to me and then left.

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,410
Alright, our for topic for today...

21
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,350
The Dumb Love that We Miss.

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,850
If ready, let's listen to the
first call that awaits us now.

23
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,140
Sawasdee kha.

24
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,150
<i>Sawasdee krub.</i>

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,540
What's your name?

26
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,760
<i>I'm Pink...</i>

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,180
<i>Pom.</i>

28
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,080
Mr. Pom, right?

29
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,920
What is it that you want to gossip to me?

30
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,040
<i>It's about me got to meet
my first boyfriend once again...</i>

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,320
<i>after we haven't seen
each other for many years.</i>

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,780
Sis, one Thai papaya salad.

33
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,110
Yes, coming.

34
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,350
One spicy grits.

35
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,630
Almost done.

36
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,630
Ai'Pom, when are you
going to change your car?

37
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,790
That's my business.

38
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,840
You don't have
to pretend to be manly.

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,330
I'm not afraid of you.

40
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,970
Don't be so fierce.

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,990
How can I not?
Look at my chickens!

42
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,380
My roast chicken has turned
into smoked chicken now.

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,030
How you this? Why don't you
contracted to all of my shirts?

44
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,460
So I would have a lot of
money to buy a nice car.

45
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,980
Why don't you
contracted my chicken first?

46
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,020
Seriously...

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,070
You bought so many clothes from
the clothes factory every morning.

48
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,320
You sew, cut and sell them on your own,
don't you want a husband to help you out?

49
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,270
Working so busy like this, how am
I suppose to have time to find a boyfriend?

50
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,460
Won't it be good for
you to lose weight a little?

51
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,150
Being fat like this, it's hard for
you to find a boyfriend and work.

52
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,500
Look at me, nice and small.

53
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,180
A mouth like yours is gonna get
you banged and lose all your teeth.

54
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,530
No need, I'll lick it everyday.

55
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,150
It's because of that mouth of yours.

56
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,920
Guys like girls who are polite and decent.

57
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,990
In fact, someone as beautiful as me...

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,710
there must be a lot
of people approaching me.

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,870
Now that I mention it...

60
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,690
I miss my first time.

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,320
Then why do you think of him?
It's been seven or eight years.

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,520
You even lives
in different provinces.

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,800
I think you should open
your heart for someone else.

64
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,320
Someone as small as you
need someone to look after.

65
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,290
That's the best word you've ever said.

66
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,050
I'm very small, my waist is sized 24.

67
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,930
How smooth.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,230
I'm going inside.

69
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,370
Can you do it?

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,370
Yes, I do it everyday.

71
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,070
To Rang.

72
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,860
Our story has ended a long time ago...

73
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,700
but my feelings are still
the same all these years.

74
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,280
Since moving to Bangkok...

75
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,180
I still miss you.

76
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,480
I miss when we were together.

77
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,690
I miss us watching the
birds in the fields together.

78
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,750
Shit, what are you doing?

79
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,090
Sorry, I won't tease anymore.

80
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,460
I miss when you bit my ear.

81
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,180
I miss when you whipped
my back with a wooden root.

82
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,890
It hurts but feel so good.

83
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,350
Ready?

84
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,590
The couple shirts that I sew for us...

85
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,280
I hang it on the wall wherever I go.

86
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,250
I know I shouldn't bother
you with this kind of letter.

87
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,250
You probably have a
new lover and a new life.

88
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,030
But I can't stop my feelings.

89
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,880
I'm sorry if these letters
are making you uncomfortable.

90
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,760
But I just want you to know that...

91
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,320
There will never be
a love like yours again.

92
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,750
Pom.

93
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,330
Wingzap, Nugget, come here.

94
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,170
What's wrong?

95
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,570
Your mouth is so wide open.

96
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,710
Uncle Saman, why do you never close your house gate?

97
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,020
Is that even roosters?
They're fierce like dogs.

98
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,320
Raising roosters, we need to provide
freedom for them so they'll be healthy.

99
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,180
They're so cute.

100
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,600
Right?

101
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,830
Wingwing, Getget.

102
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,980
E'Getget, E'Wingwing

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,940
You be careful,
I'm gonna slaughter and eats them.

104
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,100
Before you kill them,
I'll have them kill you first.

105
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,410
If you let them loose again,
I'll kill both the roosters and the person.

106
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,070
- How's that?
- Don't listen to him.

107
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,640
Get out of here.

108
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,390
You watch your mouth.

109
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,670
Why are you sleeping here?!

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,960
What now?

111
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,440
- Wake up!
- Just a moment.

112
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,580
Just a moment.

113
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,090
- What a moment?
- Just a moment!

114
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,290
My neighborhood doesn't
welcome homeless people!

115
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,080
Just a moment!

116
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,370
Why are you
bothering him, he's drunk.

117
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,100
Why is he sleeping here,
I don't like it!

118
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,780
Or I'll let my roosters bite you.

119
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,730
Just a moment!

120
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,950
Get up!

121
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,460
Just a moment.

122
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,920
I don't like this!

123
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,320
Get up!

124
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,500
Uncle, just a sec.

125
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,670
Rang?

126
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,940
It's really you, Rang.

127
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,180
Pom?

128
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,020
Rang.

129
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,320
Pom.

130
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,000
How are you here?

131
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,000
Are you looking for me?

132
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,620
Yes.

133
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,770
I asked your friend
of your whereabout.

134
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,180
So I came here but
I didn't know which house at first.

135
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,180
But I have to find you.

136
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,400
Our hearts matched.

137
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,760
I miss you.

138
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,920
You still keep this?

139
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,390
I washed it clean,
never wore it you know.

140
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,390
So...

141
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,050
Why are you all bruised?
What happened?

142
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,800
If I tell you...

143
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,180
I fear you might feel uneasy.

144
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,330
It's alright.

145
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,560
You can tell me,
you can tell me anything.

146
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,470
Well, I'm...

147
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,880
a fugitive.

148
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,910
Well, I'm...

149
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,670
a fugitive.

150
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,380
Dear God, a fugitive?!

151
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,490
So what did you do?

152
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,540
Kidnapping? Robbed a
rich businessman? Bombing?

153
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,950
Have you reported to the police?
Call the police!

154
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,060
Calm down.

155
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,300
You're more shocked
than I was back then.

156
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,300
Fugitive of what?

157
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,320
Kidnapping? Robbed a rich
businessman? Bombing? Sexual assault?

158
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,920
Or stealing money?

159
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,410
It's not a big case.

160
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,680
I'm not hiding
you or anything, am I?

161
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,660
I just need to
stay here for 2-3 days.

162
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,530
No way.

163
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,970
If you don't tell me...

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,170
get out of my house...

165
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,390
Strong enough?

166
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,320
You can stay here
for a few days.

167
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,280
OK.

168
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,130
Shit.

169
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,630
Is he asleep or dead?

170
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,770
I was so into it.

171
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,030
E'Sis!

172
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,210
What are you doing here?

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,320
Come out here.

174
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,620
Damn.

175
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,170
There's biting ears too.

176
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,740
You said you don't have a
boyfriend and miss your old boyfriend.

177
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,780
That's him.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,130
My old boyfriend.

179
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,640
How?

180
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,120
You said he went missing, right?

181
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,290
I'm confused myself.

182
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,170
He suddenly showed up at my
front door, all dirty and bloody.

183
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,390
Bloody?

184
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,670
What is your old
boyfriend been up to?

185
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,520
Rob...

186
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,840
He got robbed by
robbers on the road.

187
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,040
Really?

188
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,420
Is there even robbers
in our neighborhood?

189
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,230
It happened when
he's on his way here.

190
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,520
There's nothing in
our neighborhood, it's safe.

191
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,350
It really is fate.

192
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,670
This means he came
he intentionally for you, right?

193
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,310
Yes, he miss me too.

194
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm sleepy, you're not sleepy?

195
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,420
Not yet.

196
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,400
Go home, I'm sleepy.
I need to take care of him first as well.

197
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,850
Alright.

198
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,230
Take it slowly tonight.

199
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,140
You can bite ears...

200
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,390
but don't go bite somewhere else.

201
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,380
You're crazy!

202
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,250
Where are all my
stuff in the refrigerator?

203
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,660
My money.

204
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,550
Nothing left.

205
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,090
You're late.

206
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,650
Let's have breakfast.

207
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,570
Did you secretly took
my money and bought these?

208
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,460
I only took it to buy some stuffs.

209
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,890
I noticed there's only chicken
and chicken feet in the fridge.

210
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,760
So I cook it for you.

211
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,150
Why didn't you tell me first?

212
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,650
I thought you stole my money.

213
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,960
Open up.

214
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,350
It's good.

215
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,540
It taste the same as when you
cooked for me when we were kids.

216
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,980
You've eaten the liver,
how about some feet?

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,720
Chicken feet?

218
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,980
My feet!

219
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,900
Wait, wait, wait!

220
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,800
Pom, dear!

221
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,670
Our show is for general audience
not to a specific audience group.

222
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,500
What are you thinking?

223
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,310
We were just...

224
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,660
Harder!

225
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,220
Harder!

226
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,680
You are as extreme as before!

227
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,920
Do you like it?

228
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,690
I like it...

229
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,530
I'll keep hitting you like this.

230
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,430
So, what are you running from?

231
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,710
It's nothing.

232
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,960
I wasn't happy there.

233
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,530
My neighborhood were gossiping
that I got possessed by a ghoul.

234
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,450
Can you not lie?

235
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,910
Just tell me.

236
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,720
So we can settle it toget....

237
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,820
So we can what?

238
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,350
So that we'll
know which side is better.

239
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,670
Left...

240
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,010
or righttt...

241
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,300
How about we use this?

242
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,930
What is that noise?

243
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,290
I was gonna take some water.

244
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,750
He's gone.

245
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,730
What is it, Sis?

246
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,750
What? Why are you dragging me?

247
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,420
When you were out,
I saw your boyfriend looking
around Uncle Saman's house.

248
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,520
Don't tell lies.

249
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,790
Look at my face.

250
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,780
Do I look like a liar?

251
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,290
Alright, what is it about? Tell me.

252
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,250
Your boyfriend went sniffing and
looking at Uncle Saman's front gate.

253
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,710
Like he's gonna steal something.

254
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,500
But I accidentally hit something.

255
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,280
When I look again, he's gone.

256
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,600
That's cause you're stupid.

257
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,040
Besides, my boyfriend is my
boyfriend. He's not a thief.

258
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,180
What if he really is a thief?

259
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,130
And if my things are missing,
where can I find them?

260
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,530
- And who...
- Stop!

261
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,150
Tell me what is he running from?

262
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,950
He's not running from anything.
He's my boyfriend.

263
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,150
Stop lying.

264
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,130
Your boyfriend cam here
with wounds all over his body.

265
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,070
Immediately
asked to stay with you.

266
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,310
I think he's more of
a refuge than missing you.

267
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,380
I think he stole something...

268
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,310
or robbed someone...

269
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,470
and he's wanted by the police.

270
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,200
You're bit too much.

271
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,630
What the heck, this is nonsense.

272
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,130
- No, no, no.
- What were you talking about?

273
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,100
I want some peppers.

274
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,850
To eat with cold papaya shred.

275
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,660
What are you doing?

276
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,200
Tell me.

277
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,370
Why did you went inside
Uncle Saman's house?

278
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,330
Who is...

279
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,780
Uncle Saman?

280
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,970
The house with the chickens.

281
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,870
What did you stole from him?

282
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,820
Don't come close to
me within two meters.

283
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,140
I won't give in.

284
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,990
Tell me why did
you went into his house?

285
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,020
I was gonna go in
and play with the roosters.

286
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,640
You're lying.

287
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,360
If you don't tell me the truth...

288
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,030
get out of my house.

289
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,970
Pack your things.

290
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,900
Stop.

291
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,710
Ai'Rang, don't get any closer.

292
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,980
You're bleeding.

293
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,890
What should I do?

294
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,060
Let me see.

295
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,950
Got you!

296
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,070
Let me go!

297
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,240
If you want to feel this fin again...

298
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,540
you need to let
me continue stay here.

299
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,990
Make me can't walk out
of the house tomorrow.

300
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,150
OK?

301
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,020
Young man.

302
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,260
Young man.

303
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,540
Excuse me.

304
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,140
Yes?

305
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,780
Can you come here for a sec?

306
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,340
Sawasdee kha.

307
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,140
What's wrong?

308
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,820
Have you seen this person?

309
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,990
Can I see?

310
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,060
Never.

311
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,460
He's good looking.

312
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,140
What's the matter with him?

313
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,980
This man...

314
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,480
killed my children.

315
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,210
This man...

316
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,810
killed my children.

317
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,400
Is he a murderer?

318
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,870
<i>I was shocked too.</i>

319
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,420
<i>Back then, I thought the
Rang I used to know already died.</i>

320
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,670
Then you have to call the police, right?

321
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,630
<i>I didn't report to the police.</i>

322
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,920
But I reported it to...

323
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,960
Sis, come down here.
I have something to tell you.

324
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,480
Me too, quick.

325
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,740
Hurry down.

326
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,560
I have something to tell you too.

327
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,070
But mine is a
matter of life and death.

328
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,260
Mine too.

329
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,300
Me first.

330
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,430
Me first!

331
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,340
But mine is about my boyfriend.

332
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,110
Mine is also about your boyfriend.

333
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,690
Really?

334
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,730
You first then.

335
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,070
Just now, I saw your boyfriend crawl
into Uncle Saman's house holding a knife.

336
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,960
What about you?

337
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,270
Earlier...

338
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,970
someone named SiaTong,
he came looking for Ai'Rang.

339
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,270
he said Ai'Rang killed his children.

340
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,800
What did you say just now?

341
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,950
Holding a knife.

342
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,690
What is he going
to do to Uncle Saman?

343
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,020
We can't let this go,
we need to help Uncle Saman quick.

344
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,480
Hurry up, let's go!

345
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,110
Sis, it's locked.

346
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,990
What now?

347
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,780
Paay attention to where he is.

348
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,020
The front door is shut.

349
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,280
What is he doing?

350
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,010
Sis Jeab?

351
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,680
Pom!

352
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,050
Pom!

353
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,200
Pom!

354
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,770
Pom!

355
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,060
Pom.

356
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,260
Pom.

357
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,630
Hear me out.

358
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,130
No.

359
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,500
Why are you like this?

360
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,760
I'm the same old me.

361
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,090
Just more sadist.

362
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,800
But...

363
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,380
you like it too, right?

364
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,420
Sadist enough to crawl into
Uncle Saman house with a knife?

365
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,810
Then why did you
killed SiaTong's children?

366
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,410
How do you know that?

367
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,930
He came looking for you here.

368
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,310
This is how you are.

369
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,470
I've tried.

370
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,490
But I can't, it's...

371
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,350
It's my nature.

372
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,110
Then what is Sis Jeab fault?

373
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,600
Why did you hurt her?

374
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,820
Pom, open up.

375
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,420
- No.
- Pom!

376
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,690
I'm not open it.

377
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,940
Pom, open the door!

378
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,340
- No.
- Open it!

379
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,080
No!

380
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,020
Pom, open up.

381
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,080
Pom!

382
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,870
Open up.

383
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,470
Don't do this.

384
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,970
Why are you doing this?

385
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,130
Can we talk this out nicely?

386
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,310
Please don't do this.

387
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,420
Let's talk this out nicely, Rang.

388
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
Don't do this, Rang.

389
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,350
I knew that you must be lied to me.

390
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,850
So I came after him.

391
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,520
This punch is for Audi.

392
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,130
This punch is for Isuzu.

393
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,880
This punch is for Subaru.

394
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,320
And...

395
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,040
this punch is for Lamborghini.

396
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,620
Hold on Sia.

397
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,280
All of these are
your children's name?

398
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,790
Of course.

399
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,990
My children,
I raised them properly.

400
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,280
Like an egg in a stone.
<i>[ It means over-protective ]</i>

401
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,130
But you inhuman bastard.

402
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,890
The reason you came to me...

403
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,710
is just to find
a place to hide, righht?

404
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,040
you didn't miss me, right?

405
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,850
Scumbag.

406
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,380
Do you know...

407
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,060
how hard it is to have a child?

408
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,310
That's right!

409
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,700
You have to get pregnant.

410
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,550
That's right!

411
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,540
Hard to give birth.

412
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,310
That's right!

413
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,600
It's hard to break out of the shell,
the hair to grows, the beak to hardens.

414
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,630
That's right!

415
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,400
Sia...

416
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,880
are they people or rooster?

417
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,530
Rooster, of course.

418
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,910
Talking to you for so long and you
thought I was talking about people?

419
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,470
Then when you said "children",
is it people's children or rooster's?

420
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,860
Rooster!

421
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,430
He ate all seven of my roosters.

422
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,240
When he saw them,
he killed them, boiled and ate them.

423
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,320
Chickens worth millions...

424
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,350
only worth a few hundred now.

425
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,850
What does this mean?

426
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,370
Don't you know...

427
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,420
that your boyfriend
is a chicken maniac.

428
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,100
To a point the the people
in our neighborhood are rumoring...

429
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,720
that your boyfriend
has a ghoul inside him.

430
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,700
What?

431
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,710
You didn't know?

432
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,560
I know that when were kids...

433
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,020
he likes to eat chicken.

434
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,210
But I didn't think
he'd grow to be like this.

435
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,370
What is this, Rang? Explain.

436
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,890
I told you to hear me out.

437
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,260
Wingzap! Nugget!

438
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,630
Wingzap! Nugget!

439
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,130
Uncle Saman?

440
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,130
Sis Jeab?

441
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:20,850
Yeah.

442
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,980
I thought you all are dead.

443
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,940
I fell and hit my head.

444
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,400
When I woke up, I saw Uncle
Saman walked in from the market.

445
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,010
My roosters,
has anyone seen my roosters?

446
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,130
Oh, the roosters?

447
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,080
Here they are.

448
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,750
Wingzap, Nugget!

449
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,500
My children.

450
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,770
Don't tell me...

451
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:48,060
the reason you were sniffing
and looking at Uncle Saman's house
is to kill his roosters to eat them?

452
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,760
His roosters are delicious.

453
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,530
That's a fighter
roosters meat, don't you know?

454
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,030
It's so delicious.

455
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,610
But I swear
that I'm not a ghoul.

456
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,760
Don't you even...

457
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,190
Don't.

458
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,870
eat my children!

459
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,820
What the fuck is this?

460
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,500
I thought so too.

461
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:14,490
From that day on, SiaTong
and Uncle Saman didn't think
about taking revenge on Ai'Rang.

462
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,240
<i>They pity him for his sickness.</i>

463
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,770
So you continue to care for him?

464
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,060
<i>Who could do that?</i>

465
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,240
After that incident, I chased him out.

466
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,690
I call and tell this to your
show is to remind everyone...

467
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,670
that old love that we miss,
no need to miss it so much.

468
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,250
people can change all the time.

469
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,760
Whoever you want to love,
you have to be sensible about it.

470
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,030
That's the end, right?

471
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,530

this is just lies, it's not real.

481
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,470
It's bullshit.

482
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,870
About your story, be honest.
Was it you or him who killed the roosters?

483
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,070
I think you're the one
who ate the chickens, right?

484
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,380

This ghost just
dropped a bomb and gone.
