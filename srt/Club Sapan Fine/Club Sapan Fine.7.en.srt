Give me some noise.

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,340
But the point is,
I didn't say anything wrong.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,230
I have to say hello to your listener...

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,400
Because our Club
Sapan Fai has a live now!

12

00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,020
everyone can leave a
message and chat together.

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,880
Today, aside from having a live...

20
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,130
we have to talk a
little bit about the internet.

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:01,550
Today, we will talk
about the internet love.

22
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,270
Although we have the internet...

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,670
we can still be fooled like before.

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,020
Our topic for today is...

25
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,270

26
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,970

<i>[Someone who's not dumb profile]</i>

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,130

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,030
Sawasdee kha.

30
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,810
<i>I'm Pete.</i>

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,940
OK.

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,020
<i>I'm a photographer.</i>

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,600
<i>I'm the owner of
photography shop Pete O Graphy.</i>

34
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,860
<i>Anyway, I'm counting on you to
promote. I've sent it to your page.</i>

35
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,520
<i>[Sawasdee krub, P'Tle
Want to promote your store? Let me see.]</i>

36
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,780
This is my profile, please promote too

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,520
You're quite handsome, Mr. Pete.

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,270
Quite the good-looking.

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,860
Well, not to that extend.

40
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,650
I'm just a normal guy,
nothing special.

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,210
I've always been ignored.

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,660
My only good quality is my photography.

43
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,950
My photography skills are very good.

44
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,950
You can compare it to heaven.

45
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,940
Because I shoot many genres.

46
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,180
Whether it's...

47
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,420
potrait...

48
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,380
street...

49
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,310
landscape...

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,090
city scape...

51
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,650
architecture...

52
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,790
candid...

53
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,920
sport...

54
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,060
white light...

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,090
food...

56
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,020
product.

57
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,100
If we talk about competitions, I've
participated in countless competitions.

58
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,480
I also won
many prizes in competitions.

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,890
More than enough.

60
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,560
But now, I don't participate.

61
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,480
Because I want others to win too.

62
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,000
So I went to collaborate
with famous magazines.

63
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,180
I also became the
brand ambassador for...

64
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,310
the brand that produces camera.

65
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,880
To the point that the professor in my
university saw my talent and asked me...

66
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,920
to be the president of the photography
club when I was in second year.

67
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,200
In this circle...

68
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,610
they...

69
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,090
have a name for me.

70
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,780
They called me...

71
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:52,790
Photographer...

72
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,390

77
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,950
No.

78
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,600
There are many people
who know me in the circle.

79
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,170
They called me Photographer...

80
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,170
Used long lens to zoom on girls.

81
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,830

Ai'Sri, Ai'Mee, you idiots!

86
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,490
For you, I'm willing to waste my time
taking cosplay photos for the two of you.

87
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,850
Have you ever been grateful?

88
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,810
Have you ever been grateful?

{\an1}but how

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,020
What is that?!

100
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,100
Where?

101
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,230
Here it is.

102
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,370
How am I wrong?

103
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,760
There's no photo of us, only girl's.

104
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,220
- Bastard
- Shameless.

105
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,110
So?

106
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,840
So?

107
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,090
You have to understand.

108
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,790
Do you understand that the peace of mind of
a photographer is when they find something
beautiful, they would want to capture it in film.

109
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,470
I mean the SD card.

110
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,060
But I'm not a filthy
person as you say I am.

111
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,070
For real.

112
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,800
For real.

113
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,190
You think it's funny?

114
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Let's go.

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,040
So disappointed in you.

116
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,080
- I almost put anesthetic in you.
- You better watch it.

117
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,740
Next time,
if there's no photo of mine...

118
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,320
Who got automatically tag?

119
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,560
Auto tag...

120
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,880
that means she's a friend.

121
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,430
I'm sending a hi-res photo.

122
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,010

I don't like people looking at
the camera, it looks unnatural

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,620
It's like it's missing its soul

In the beginning, I taught her to take photos.

264
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,660

265
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,660

270
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,580
Why wipe it off?  Eat it all don't spill

271

277
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,710

Even though we never
see each other face to face...

282
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,040

283
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,040

How is it good? It's not expensive

286
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,040
It will make the background blurry

287
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,800
we feel so close to each other.

288
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,840
As if our hearts are connected

289
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,070

327
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,160

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,150
Oh, so expensive

333
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,150
Let me borrow yours

334
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,150
Really?

335
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,150
Will you? Hahaha

336
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,900
Later...

337
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,770
we started talking.

338
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,750
But in order not to make
Petch's family suspicious...

339
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,140
we only chat during lunch break.

340
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,520
Although only that...

341
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,420
it makes my lunch break...

342
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,380
my most happy time.

343
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,990
More than that,
Petch is a fan of Japanese band idol.

344
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,200
Izakaya42, like me.

345
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,890
we even like the same song.

346
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
It's like...

347
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,950
we're born together.

348
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,100
If this isn't fate,
I don't know what to call it.

349
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,400
Finally...

350
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,170
I am willing to
sacrifice my favorite collection.

351
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,630
And give it to
her as a birthday present.

352
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,950
Do you know why?

353
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,360
Petch.

354
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,350
Did you received the gift I sent?

355
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,760
I did.

356
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,820
But is it OK?

357
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,130
It's a limited edition and you
can only buy it at the concert.

358
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,460
Anything that makes you happy...

359
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,090
it will make me happy too.

360
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,210
Today, it's...

361
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,240
what day is it today?
Why do you seem weird?

362
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,570
Something's wrong?

363
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,150
Will you be my girlfriend?

364
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,880
But...

365
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,520
You do know that...

366
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,980
that my mom is very fierce.

367
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,710
If my mom knows
I'm dating someone...

368
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,440
My mom will kill me for sure.

369
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
Petch.

370
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,460
Love...

371
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,460
will have obstacles.

372
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,000
But if we unite...

373
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,550
we can go through it.

374
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,300
It's not impossible, P'Pete.

375
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,520
You don't understand.

376
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,370
My mom really is very strict.

377
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,800
Even after class, my mom
immediately pick me up an go home.

378
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,930
She even watches over
me during tuition class.

379
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,000
Even if we really date...

380
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,860
it would be nothing but...

381
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,690
Where we are now...

382
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,200
I'm already in my
most happy in my life.

383
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,120
Let's date.

384
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,960
Pete

385
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,960
Petch

386
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,280
Jealous of me?

387
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,460
You're jealous of me, right?

388
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,090
I told you, this is the benefits
of being a photographer like me.

389
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,330
Wait, wait.

390
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,850
Calm down.

391
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,170
Are you telling me that all these time...

392
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,420
you've never met her once?

393
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,490
She's only in 12th grade,
how can I force her?

394
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,540
I'll wait until she's
ready then meet her up.

395
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,230
How could you
know that your Petch here...

396
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,640
is a real person...

397
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,750
and not a fake one?

398
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,760
Haven't you heard the news...

399
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,780
about people using
fake photos to deceive people.

400
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,010
You asked a girl
to be your girlfriend...

401
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,700
even though you never
met her in real life?

402
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,980
<i>But we talked every day.</i>

403
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,410
We're closer than
those meeting in real-life.

404
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,180
Your friend warned you like that...

405
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,110
and it doesn't make you doubt at all?

406
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,140
Ai'See, you're exaggerating.

407
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,600
Or you...

408
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,310
I...

409
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,570
I what?

410
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,390
You lie to him to scare him...

411
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,660
and you're
keeping him for yourself.

412
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,680
Do you like him?

413
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,130
Do you like him?

414
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,080
Are you crazy, you idiot?
Did you watched too much drama?

415
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,550
I would never like him.

416
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,930
Him?

417
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,090
He smells and ugly.

418
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,100
I would never into a guy
like him, it makes me sick.

419
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,610
Do you think I'd like you?

420
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,490
You ghost-face.

421
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,940
That's cruel.

422
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,500
Who are you calling ghost?

423
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,750
You're the ghost.

424
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,270
Actually, I'm aware
that I'm not that handsome...

425
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,900
but I'm not that bad.

426
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,790
You don't have
to insult me that much.

427
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,920
What o you get from that?

428
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,680
Will everything gets better?

429
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,880
Ai'Pete.

430
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,940
Enough.

431
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Come here.

432
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,420
Come here.

433
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,370
Come here.

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,820

444
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,100
You already lose your
Izakaya collection to her.

445
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,480
What will you lose after this?

446
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,920
That 100,000 baht lens?

447

What?

448
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,580
She didn't ask anything from me,
I was the one who gave it to her.

449
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,420
What do you guys want from me?

450
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,340

do to make you believe?

Here, it's not difficult.

Use the Izakaya stuff that you
gave her as an advantage.

453
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,730
The end.

454
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,930
Ai'See.

455
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,480
What else are
bothering you guys this time?

456
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,940
Fine.

457
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,230
Forget it.

458
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,710
I'm suspicious because...

459
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,720
these fake photo used to
deceive people on the internet...

460
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,560
are really so many.

461
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,690
Fine if it's a real photo...

462
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,930
but about her mother is strict,
I think it's clearly an excuse.

463
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,100
The real her might
already has a boyfriend...

464
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,300
seeing her being pretty like this.

465
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,760
I don't want to believe...

466
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,080
that she would even want to date you.

467
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,440
Are you really not suspicious at all?

468
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,390
Tomorrow morning...

469
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,630
skip class and come with me.

470
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,550
Ai'Pete.

471
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,100
Don't tell me you're...

472
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
I'm very confident...

473
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,970
that Petch didn't lie to me.

474
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,240
But...

475
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,360
But we got nothing to
lose to secretly check on her.

476
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,120
Damn it, fatty.

477
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,190
Fuck, what the hell?

478
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,730
I want to enter.

479
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,360
But we can't enter.

480
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,570
Ai'Pete, what now?

481
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,200
I've got an idea.

482
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,890
But, Ai'See...

483
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,320
you have to help me.

484
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,980
Me?

485
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,730
You.

486
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,290
- Me
- Yes.

487
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,780
I'm really sorry.

488
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,890
We'll give it back to you soon.

489
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,580
Shall we?

490
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,100
Our plan is to have Ai'See
went in undercover as a student...

491
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,660
for her to find a hidden place...

492
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,050
for us to spy.

493
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,040
Hey, Ploy.

494
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,400
What happened to you?

495
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,470
Shiro, I was tied up by some unknown
people and I managed to escape.

496
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,640
So...

497
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,430
Are you hurt?
What did they do to you?

498
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,640
Nothing, they just stole my uniform.

499
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,540
Goo thing that my
mom bought a new one.

500
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,920
There were 3 of them.

501
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,950
One of them
took my clothes to wear.

502
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,110
Stole your uniform?

503
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,880
Why did they do that?

504
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,770
I don't know.
I don't know anything.

505
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,430
I'm so confused.

506
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,820
Ploy.

507
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,070
They're the one
who stole my uniform!

508
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,810
Ploy, call the guard.

509
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,660
Alright.

510
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,640
Ai'Sri, go.

511
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,600
You go.

512
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,210
Ai'See.

513
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,330
Why are you here?

514
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,350
What are you up to?

515
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,050
Calm down.

516
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,250
We can explain.

517
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,760
If you don't want to get hurt,
don't fight back.

518
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,970
There's no need for violence.

519
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,290
Actually...

520
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,310
This morning...

521
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,330
What is that?!

522
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,040
Where?

523
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,140
- The guard is here.
- What?

524
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,790
What the hell?

525
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,390
You guys go on ahead,
I'll handle things here.

526
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:55,870
Where?

527
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,150
- There's nothing there.
- Go!

528
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,850
Let's run!

529
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,860
<i>Announcement. Dear students, currently there
are 2 boys secretly entered the school.</i>

530
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,680
<i>Please be careful.</i>

531
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,710
<i>Anyone who sees them,
please report it immediately.</i>

532
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,690
<i>I repeat, currently there are 2 boys...</i>

533
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,120
Pete.

534
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,080
Did you hear what
the announcement said?

535
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,920
I don't care about the announcement
right now, look at the rewards here.

536
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,680
Smile.

537
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,660
- Ai'Pete!
- What?!

538
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,730
Focus!

539
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,850
You are here to follow Petch.

540
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,040
Don't make
Ai'Sri's sacrifice be in vain.

541
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,300
Focus.

542
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,140
Pay attention.

543
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,710
I'm sorry, I got distracted.

544
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,240
So cute.

545
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,170
What?!

546
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,550
It's a guard.

547
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,210
There they are, catch them!

548
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,120
Boys!

549
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,610
In disguise!

550
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,400
Secretly taking
photos here to boot.

551
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,140
No, we didn't take photos.

552
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,900
Get ready to be put in jail.

553
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,760
No, no...

554
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,790
I can explain this.

555
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,710
Both of us...

556
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,880
are not psychopath.

557
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,730
We're just...

558
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,070
What is that?!

559
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,250
There!

560
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,410
What's your problem, Ai'Pete?

561
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,540
Help!

562
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,910
At that time...

563
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,730
I was so desperate.

564
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,530
<i>But...</i>

565
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,210
<i>I can't let my friend's
sacrifice be in vain.</i>

566
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,590
Suddenly...

567
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,370
I thought of a plan.

568
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,640
Plan?

569
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,240
What plan?

570
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,090
<i>Normally...</i>

571
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,510
<i>Petch and
I will talk in the afternoon.</i>

572
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,560
Because her school only allows the
use of mobile phones during lunch break.

573
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,310
and Petch's ringtone...

574
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,700
is Rainbow Melody by Izakaya42.

575
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,450
it's our favorite song.

576
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,610
That means...

577
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,740
if I call her...

578
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,450
and the ringtone play this song...

579
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,200
the owner of that phone...

580
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,430
is definitely Petch.

581
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,860
Petch!

582
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,370
Ai'See.

583
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,390
Don't tell me you pretend
to be Petch to deceive me?

584
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,890
Pretend, my ass!

585
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,000
You're calling me, look!

586
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,390
Shit, I called the wrong person.

587
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,250
But, wait.

588
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,260
Why is your ringtone...

589
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,040
Rainbow Melody?

590
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,550
I'm one of the fanclub too.

591
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,620
I went with you to
the touching hands event.

592
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,880
Don't you remember?

593
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,500
Oh yeah.

594
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,690
Then if there's nothing else,
I won't bother you anymore.

595
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,230
Excuse me. I'll go now.

596
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,360
See you.

597
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,190
Sit.

598
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:11,920
<i>[Discipline Room]</i>

599
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,620
It's these three.
I remember them well.

600
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,070
In that case,
it will the police duty then.

601
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,600
But, headmistress...

602
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,910
I came here for a reason.

603
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,500
I...

604
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,920
I came here to follow someone.

605
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,480
Do you know someone
name Petch from 12th grade?

606
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,150
Petch?

607
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,720
What is her real name?

608
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,060
There so many
12th grader named Petch.

609
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,370
Petch Praiya.

610
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,430
Petch Praiya, it's Petch Praiya.

611
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,530
Petch Praiya.

612
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,740
- Petch Praiya?
- Yes, Petch Praiya.

613
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,330
Petch Praiya...

614
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,330
No one here with that name.

615
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,180
I remember all my friends' names.

616
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,640
Photo. I have a photo.

617
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,310
I'll open the photo
and let you see it first.

618
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,130
Open it.

619
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,440
Headmistress.

620
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,830
Can I go back to my class?

621
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,380
I've wasted too much time already.

622
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,470
Ploy.

623
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,960
The teacher said you don't
have to go to class anymore.

624
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,810
So you can be there with the police.

625
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,830
Are these the psychopaths?

626
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,440
Ai'Pete.

627
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,750
They really looks like psycho.

628
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,780
Pete.

629
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Petch?

630
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,790
Petch.

631
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,220
I'm Pete.

632
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,850
- Pete?
- Yes, Pete.

633
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,170
- Pete?
- Yes, Pete.

634
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,540
- Pete?
- Yes, Pete!

635
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,090
Who?

636
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,190
What is this?

637
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,510
This is fake.

638
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,130
It's clearly a fake.

639
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,390
And this Izakaya band...

640
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,990
I never knew about them.

641
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,110
I really went
to the cosplay event.

642
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,780
But the person who
were chatting with you...

643
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,240
is not me.

644
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,480
It's not even my ID.

645
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,100
That's about it.

646
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,440
But...

647
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,540
the person who can
take my photos and do this...

648
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,720
must be someone
in this school for sure.

649
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,260
Who?

650
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,360
Yes.

651
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,970
This fake Petch...

652
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,870
must be your close friend, N'Koi.

653
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,760
Can you think...

654
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,720
of anyone who took you the
Izakaya event and take a photo of you?

655
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,690
And the culprit...

656
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,540
is among us.

657
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,690
The real person...

658
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,000
must be fat...

659
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,090
large...

660
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,760
likes to use violence...

661
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,720
that no one wants.

662
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,260
So you definitely use fake photos.

663
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,320
Take it out and show it.

664
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,070
Hurry up.

665
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,750
Ploy?

666
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,010
Ploy?

667
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,840
You pretended to me?

668
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,970
Why?

669
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,350
Ploy, did you use Facebook in secret?

670
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,620
Didn't you say to me about not
playing with Facebook until you graduated?

671
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,900
You promised me, didn't you?!

672
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,190
What is this?

673
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,760
You even deceived others.

674
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,460
I didn't.

675
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,300
I just want to
live like everyone else

676
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,970
You don't understand.

677
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,600
What I don't understand?

678
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,040
Explain to me.

679
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,570
Tell me.

680
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,260
Tell you?

681
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,970
When did you ever listen to me?

682
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,700
You just order, order and order.

683
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,010
You never listen to me.

684
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,540
- Let me go.
-Explain it to me.

685
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,330
I'm not letting you go.

686
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,500
If I tell you then that'll be it,
you never listen. You never listen!

687
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,830
I am, Ploy.

688
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,550
I said, explain it to me.

689
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,860
I'm not going to explain. Let me go!

690
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,760
No.

691
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,090
What is that?!

692
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,180
So...

693
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,680
The culprit is Ploy.

694
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,940
It's because her
mother is very fierce.

695
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,600
Very strict.

696
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,970
It's the school's discipline teacher.

697
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,400
In order to prevent others from
reporting about her playing Facebook...

698
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,690
Ploy used a fake
name and profile photo.

699
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,310
But Ploy has no bad intention.

700
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,290
She just wants to use
Facebook like everyone else.

701
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:11,120
I think this Ploy
who used the fake photo...

702
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,070
She has her reasons for doing that.

703
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,370
But the real her is
good looking too, isn't she?

704
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,930
If you understood her then...

705
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,670
just say sorry and date.

706
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,740
You like each other, right?

707
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,940
<i>We can't.</i>

708
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,370
<i>A guy like me focus what's in the heart.</i>

709
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,570
<i>However she looks is not important.</i>

710
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,100
<i>Besides...</i>

711
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,500
Wait, Pete. Just a minute.

712
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,190
Someone, I don't know who,
sent something to the page. It's a lot too.

713
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,680
Just a moment, let me read this.

714
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,830
Don't listen to him

715
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,830
P'Tle!

716
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,830
I'm Ploy, the same as in the story

717
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,830
Aren't you suspicious as to why I didn't
recognize Ai'Pete from the beginning?

718
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,710
Actually, I think...

719
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,760
what happened today is fate.

720
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,040
Honestly,
the person I was chatting to...

721
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,930
whoever it was, I don't care.

722
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,890
However, I just feel...

723
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,690
that I really love you.

724
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,320
Do you know why?

725
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,750
You are...

726
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,010
like a beam of light that shines on me.

727
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,940
Shall we use an old-fashioned way?

728
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,010
We'll chat through letters.

729
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,950
Sounds good, Ploy?

730
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,410
Can we...

731
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,580
be couples?

732
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,820
Don't come closer.

733
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,540
I'm really going to call the police.

734
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,250
Don't come closer,
don't come closer!

735
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,400
I'm really going to call the police.

736
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,150
Don't come closer, don't come closer!

737
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,270
Don't come closer!

738
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,800
People in my circle of friends...

739
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,020
they called me...

740
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,110
I know that I'm not handsome...

741
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,450
I'm not that bad.

742
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,830
In this matter,
I also sympathize with Ploy.

743
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:02,850
You're not done?

744
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,280
Not yet. It's almost climax.

745
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,220
If it's me, I'd create a new photo.

746
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:13,520
But do you understand that if
love started with cheating, what will
happen in the future? I can't accept it.

747
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,690
You're not done yet?

748
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,250
You're not free to talk?

749
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,370
You still not done
with deceiving, E'Pete?!

750
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,300
Ploy said that she
only use a fake photos.

751
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,650
But you are no better.

752
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,950
You even used a
photo editing software.

753
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,700
Oh, no shame!

754
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,300
What photo editing software? I...

755
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,660
I don't use that.

756
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,290
Ploy sent me a photo.

757
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,750
Do you want me to
share it on my homepage?

758
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,900
Then, please excuse me.

759
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,160
<i>I have some business to attend to.</i>

760
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
<i>But don't share my photo
in your page, I beg of you.</i>

761
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,880
<i>I'm hanging up now.</i>

762
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,690
Listeners...

763
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,020
let's sum it up.

764
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,970
Changes is there for a reason...

765
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,900
and internet is there for the fools.

766
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:03,630
Think about it, even someone
like me almost got fooled by Pete.

767
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:09,720
So today, I think i should go to
learn how to edit pictures like Ai'Pete.

768
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,130
I should look better that way.

769
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:17,630
<i>Alright, that's all for
today. See you next week on
Club Sapan Fai. The club is close.</i>

770
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,470
<i>Sawasdee to all
live viewers and listeners.</i>

<i>I have three grooms to choose from.</i>

774
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,250
<i>P'Max</i>

775
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,580
<i>Eat first.</i>

776
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,160
<i>Good.</i>

777
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,950

<i>Cheers.</i>

<i>And N'Jay.</i>

780
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,530
<i>So, Ms. Beau.</i>

781
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,040
<i>Have you decided yet?</i>

782
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,860
<i>I think we've spent too
much time having fun already.</i>

783
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,950
<i>I think...</i>

784
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,330
<i>I should choose.</i>

785
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,380
