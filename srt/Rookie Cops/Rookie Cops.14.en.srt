1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,422
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,191
NAMGI: Do you really want to know
what kind of person your father is?

3
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,195
You'll see.

4
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:33,074
That laptop. I'm sure it will end up
in Jo Hansol's hands.

5
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,161
Did you hand over the laptop
to the investigation unit?

6
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,581
You got the laptop from my father, right?

7
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:40,832
Yes. So?

8
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:47,630
SEUNGHYUN: Are you saying my father
just gave away what Tak's brother got...

9
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,216
risking his life?

10
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,971
That's how trashy your father is.

11
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,270
UGON: Don't blame
your father too much.

12
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,065
He must have his reasons.

13
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,067
If he hadn't told you what they were,

14
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,652
there must be reasons for that too.

15
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,574
(dramatic music)

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,164
(music fades)

17
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,917
(somber music)

18
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,377
-(tire screeches)
-(Giyong grunts)

19
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,297
(handbrake creaks)

20
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,049
(seatbelt clicks)

21
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,551
(door opens)

22
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,265
GIYONG: Well...

23
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:44,270
-What are you doing at this late...
-Why did you kill my brother, Hyunsoo?

24
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,857
Why are you asking me that?

25
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,859
You know everything!

26
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,237
What happened to your brother was

27
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,741
-very unfortunate...
-Is it true that you sold out...

28
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,077
(breathes shakily)
...my brother?

29
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,539
TAK: I need your honest answer.

30
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,749
(breathes shakily)
Was it you

31
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,752
who told them

32
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,588
my brother was in the club?

33
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,842
SEUNGHYUN: What do you mean?

34
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,098
(music fades)

35
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,310
(dogs barking in distance)

36
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,729
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,984
Dad. What is he talking about?

38
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,113
Let's talk inside.

39
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,491
It seems like
there's some misunderstanding.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
No!

41
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,872
(dramatic music)

42
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,253
Let's talk here. I need to know too.

43
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,922
I also want to know
why you gave the laptop to Jo Hansol.

44
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,509
Hey. What do you mean by that?

45
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:01,973
(sobs)

46
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,809
Were you...

47
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:05,727
(breathes shakily)

48
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,979
...in league with Jo Hansol?

49
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,065
(scoffs)

50
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,902
Wow. I did not see this coming.

51
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,069
(Tak breathes shakily)

52
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,156
-Did you know all this too?
-Tak.

53
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,326
-I didn't...
-TAK: Yes, you did!

54
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,536
(breathing angrily)

55
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,996
Was it fun?

56
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,165
TAK: Did you have fun?

57
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,085
Was it fun acting like you
didn't know my brother

58
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,546
and making a complete fool of me?

59
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,714
SEUNGHYUN: Tak.

60
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,843
You.

61
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,346
Don't call my name, you bastard.

62
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,098
I don't have a friend like you.

63
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,395
(thuds)

64
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,114
Let's get inside.

65
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,908
SEUNGHYUN: Father.

66
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,332
I'm not sure if I have ever known you.

67
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,087
Tell me. What is the real you?!

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,930
I made the best decision I could
for the team.

69
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,434
If the same thing happens again,
I'd make the same choice.

70
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,978
Stop making excuses.

71
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,815
I regret ever wanting to become...

72
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,734
someone like you.

73
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:49,038
EUNKANG: When Pandora's box was opened,
all kinds of wickedness slipped out.

74
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,000
That day,

75
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,962
we may have opened a box
that should not have been opened.

76
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,089

77
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,348
EPISODE 14

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,061
-Long time no see.
-(indistinct chattering)

79
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,104
Hi.

80
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,067
(uplifting music)

81
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,487
Isn't this cute?

82
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,406
-Isn't it?
-Yes, it's cute.

83
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,324
(exclaims)

84
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,000
(uplifting music continues)

85
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,680
-Come on. Let's do it quickly.
-It has to be clean.

86
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,599
Why is there so much hair on the floor?

87
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,642
Well, we're hairy. And there's two of us.

88
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,894
Are you shedding?

89
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,522
-I thought they were yours.
-They're all from your bed.

90
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,107
You're right. Sorry.

91
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,901
Gosh. So much hair.

92
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,277
(grunts, sighs)

93
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,280
Okay! Spotlessly clean now.

94
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,365
This is--

95
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,783
(object clatters)

96
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,120
-You have a problem with me?
-Why were you standing there?

97
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,663
-So it's my fault?
-Daeil.

98
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,499
-Are you saying it's my fault?
-Geez!

99
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,167
Just sweep it already.

100
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,754
(birds chirping)

101
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:20,880
Mmm.

102
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,882
JUYOUNG: I missed this.

103
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,134
Our cafeteria food is the best.

104
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,095
Food in my hometown
didn't taste like home.

105
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,263
Because this is my hometown. That's why.

106
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:30,848
(Hanna chuckles)

107
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,184
By the way, Hanna, why were you so busy?

108
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,477
ARI: You didn't come for the PA.

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,438
Everyone who volunteered
for Police Academy got ten points each.

110
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,816
Oh. I had a situation.

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,486
-How have you been, Eunkang?
-Yes, I've been all right.

112
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,029
(munching)

113
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,364
(suspenseful music)

114
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,699
I was chasing traces of the devil.

115
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,370
Excuse me.

116
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,913
(eerie music)

117
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,706
(both grunting)

118
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,791
(Eunkang yelps)

119
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,501
EUNKANG: I think they're after
this laptop.

120
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,920
Zero, zero, two, zero.

121
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:03,881
(glass clinks)

122
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,341
It's Jo Hansol.

123
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,262
He was looking for the laptop because
of the watch that can identify him.

124
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,226
I can't tell you right now.
I'll tell you when things get clearer.

125
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,270
What the heck are you talking about?

126
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,231
Right. Did you unlock the laptop?

127
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,441
Yeah.

128
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,985
Thanks to you, we found the password

129
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,530
by typing in every possible combination
one by one the whole night.

130
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,614
Thanks.
(chuckles)

131
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,742
What do you mean?
What about a laptop and a password?

132
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,954
-BUMJU: Hi, guys.
-Hi.

133
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,666
JUYOUNG: Why are you alone? Where's Daeil?

134
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,210
(sighs)
He already ate.

135
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,839
He doesn't want to eat with me anymore
because we're not roomies anymore.

136
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,424
You're not roommates?

137
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,177
Daeil and Tak switched rooms.

138
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,470
ARI: Tak?

139
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,388
BUMJU: You didn't know?

140
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,223
I heard it was Tak's request.

141
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,851
(indistinct chattering)

142
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,686
(crockery clanging)

143
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,830
I thought he discussed it with you.

144
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,625
Tak suddenly called and told me about it.

145
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,668
(objects clattering)

146
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,633
(clears throat)

147
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,928
DAEIL: Hey, did you guys have a fight?

148
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,722
No.

149
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,893
Hey. I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

150
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,605
If that's what's going on,
I'll switch back.

151
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,693
No. Just keep unpacking.

152
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,408
(sighs)

153
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,535
What's going on?

154
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,703
-Something's off.
-(door opens)

155
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,715
(somber music)

156
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,893
TAK: Seunghyun.

157
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,438
I don't regret using violence then.

158
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,732
(grunts)
And that person said

159
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,945
when you need to protect someone,
it's okay to use violence.

160
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:36,117
Sometimes, I think I might've
ended up here because of him.

161
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,036
Thanks to him,
I met you and the other guys.

162
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,372
And now you're my brothers.

163
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,082
So be nice to me.

164
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,293
(sighs)

KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

(somber music continues)

167
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,109
What do you think?

168
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,281
It's pretty.

169
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,538
Is everything all right these days?

170
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,166
Yes.

171
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,006
I've been thinking about it,

172
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,176
and since we found the video
in the laptop,

173
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,094
you started to talk less.

174
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,472
EUNKANG: And you barely answer your phone.

175
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,518
You also went to Professor Cha's place
without telling me during Police Academy.

176
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,439
I've been waiting for you to tell me,
but it looks like

177
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,691
something is definitely up,

178
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,402
seeing that Tak even switched rooms.

179
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,404
Switching rooms isn't a big deal.

180
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,324
It's normal to change your room
when the new semester begins.

181
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,451
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

182
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,412
Come on and tell me.
Did something happen after that?

183
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,752
Sorry. I'll tell you later.

184
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,755
Later? Later when?

185
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,842
I don't know what's going on,

186
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,638
but whatever is in your head,
you have to tell me.

187
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,974
Who knows? Maybe you'll realize
it wasn't that serious while telling me...

188
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,892
Eunkang.

189
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,727
(somber music)

190
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,729
Right now,

191
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,107
I have so much going on in my mind.

192
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,985
Can I tell you
after I collect all my thoughts?

193
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,866
I'm sorry. I have to go now.

194
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:45,913
(clicks tongue)

195
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,290
Seunghyun...

196
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,252
(Eunkang sighs)

197
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,633
SOONYOUNG: Today, I, the Dean,
am your special lecturer.

198
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,343
(sucks teeth)
Mm...

199
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:06,267
You've heard of terms like
psychopath and sociopath, right?

200
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,856
Do you know how to identify a psychopath?

201
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,901
-Through the PCL-R test, ma'am.
-SOONYOUNG: That's right.

202
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,905
According to the test,
out of a maximum score of 40,

203
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:24,660
the cut-off score
for the label of psychopathy is 25.

204
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,664
The infamous serial killer Yoo Youngchul

205
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,541
got 38 points.

206
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,171
Experts say psychopaths make up

207
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,090
about 2% of the general population.

208
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,717
(chuckles)

209
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,846
Which means
there might be one of us in here.

210
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,931
-Mm...
-(class clamoring)

211
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,808
(Soonyoung laughs)
But the problem is

212
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:52,354
that one's psychopathy
can only be discovered by their crimes,

213
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,191
which is why
it's hard to detect beforehand.

214
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,612
Now, let's have a look
at the psychopathy checklist.

215
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,739
All right.

216
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,326
"Being articulate is considered a charm."

217
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,328
1. BEING ARTICULATE IS CONSIDERED A CHARM

218
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,662
"Impulsiveness.

219
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,792
Need for stimulation in everyday affairs

220
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,460
and proneness to boredom."

221
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,547
SEUNGHYUN: "Being articulate
is considered a charm."

222
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,507
(ominous music)

223
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,801
HANSOL: Do what you want to do.

224
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,262
Then I will buy your dream.

225
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,515
SEUNGHYUN: "Need for stimulation
in everyday affairs...

226
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,768
-...and proneness to boredom."
-(women laughing)

227
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,353
We meet again.

228
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,439
You look a lot like your father.

229
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,067
Can't we be on the same team?

230
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,487
SEUNGHYUN: Is he a psychopath?

231
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:46,450
If you find a psychopath around you,

232
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,369
what should you do?

233
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,120
SOONYOUNG: The answer is,

234
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,915
"Avoid the person as much as possible."

235
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,626
Because psychopaths

236
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,837
can manipulate others

237
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,422
to get what they want.

238
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,968
(indistinct chattering)

239
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,554
Bumju. Do you know why
Tak didn't come to class?

240
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,597
BUMJU: No. He didn't say anything.

241
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,932
I realized he didn't come
after class started.

242
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,017
Where'd he go?
He didn't read my messages either.

243
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,899
STUDENT WITHDRAWAL FORM

244
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,446
(breathes deeply)

245
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,494
-What is this?
-It's a withdrawal form.

246
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,205
TAK: I need my advisor's signature
to complete the form.

247
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,542
Is there a problem?

248
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,379
-No, sir.
-UGON: Then why are you suddenly...

249
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,549
You were doing all right here.

250
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,554
I thought I could settle in if I tried,

251
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,765
but it doesn't seem to be my thing.

252
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,269
I feel suffocated in here.

253
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,564
(exhales sharply)

254
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,817
-(paper rustles)
-(Ugon sucks teeth)

255
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,406
I can sign the form,
but I think I have the right to know why

256
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,617
if you think of me as your teacher.

257
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,954
(suspenseful music)

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,084
(wind chimes tinkle)

259
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,008
Hey.

260
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,719
GIYONG: Gosh.

261
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,221
-It's been a while.
-Yes, sir.

262
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,139
(Giyong chuckles)

263
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,352
(exhales sharply)
I was going to call you actually.

264
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,396
I heard Seunghyun
was staying at your place.

265
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,689
(chuckles)
Yes, sir.

266
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,232
The police station called me

267
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,153
-and said you took him as his guardian.
-Yes. He didn't want to call home.

268
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,863
Then I suppose...

269
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,866
(breathes deeply)
...he told you about what happened.

270
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,868
Yes.

271
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,912
Thanks.

272
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,247
-I ordered it.
-Okay.

273
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,165
(bottle fizzes)

274
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,126
-Let me fill your glass.
-I have an appointment after this.

275
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,712
I see. It won't take long.

276
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,214
Cheers.

277
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,678
GIYONG: Is that why you called me?

278
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,015
UGON: You know a student named Kim Tak.

279
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,767
He handed in a withdrawal letter.

280
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,355
(exhales sharply)

281
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,898
(suspenseful music)

282
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,483
(gulping)

283
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,113
He said he's sick of everything

284
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,448
and disillusioned with the police.

285
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,410
(exhales sharply)

286
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,869
(Giyong clears throat)

287
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,746
What are you trying to say?

288
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,125
Was it you who handed over Hyunsoo...

289
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,794
to CEO Jo?

290
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,255
(tense, suspenseful music)

291
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,175
I had a lot of regrets after Hyunsoo died.
Since I was the one who recommended him.

292
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,386
I told you you weren't responsible.

293
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,512
(sighs)

294
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,059
(gulping)

295
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,437
(breathes deeply)

296
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,273
But someone has to take responsibility.

297
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,402
And I overheard
what you said on the phone then.

298
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,529
(rain pattering)

299
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,406
GIYONG: I planted a mole.

300
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,074
His name is Kim Hyunsoo,

301
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,702
a KNPU student.

302
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,039
UGON: At first, I thought
you were talking to headquarters.

303
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,498
But then...

304
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,418
...it hit me that you might not have been.

305
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,337
Who were you talking to then?

306
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,173
If I say you're wrong,

307
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,967
would you believe me?

308
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:41,727
(cellphone buzzing)

309
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,231
(cellphone buzzing continues)

310
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,318
(wind chimes tinkle)

311
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,285
INMYEON: Hey, why aren't you
answering your phone?

312
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:01,997
Hello, sir.

313
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,500
My gosh. Look who's here.

314
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,918
(Inmyeon laughing)

315
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,169
It's been a while.

316
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,380
INMYEON: Excuse me.
Give us another glass, please.

317
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,715
(chuckles)

318
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,427
I heard you're at the school now.

319
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,222
-Yes, sir.
-(laughing)

320
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,223
I heard

321
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,267
you're a legal advisor at a law firm.

322
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,646
Oh, it's just to pass the time.

323
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,272
(laughing)

324
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,735
You wanted to meet an hour later
because of him?

325
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,779
You should have asked me to join you.

326
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,615
(laughing)

327
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,203
No, sir. I have an appointment today.
But please. Have a great time.

328
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,039
Oh, okay.

329
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,500
(chuckles)
What a shame.

330
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,087
I thought we could have
a little Seoul office reunion here.

331
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,339
-(Inmyeon chuckling)
-UGON: I'll see you next time.

332
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,091
(laughing)

333
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,511
Gosh.

334
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,764
He hasn't aged at all.

335
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:05,185
When we were younger,
he looked older than me.

336
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,814
-Maybe I should take care of my skin too.
-(gulping)

337
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,526
Oh, boy. Careful now.

338
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,369
All right.

339
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,747
I called a chauffeur.
He'll be here in a minute.

340
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,207
(groaning)

341
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,544
Wait here.
I'll go get you some hangover cure.

342
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,588
GIYONG: Inmyeon.

343
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,090
-Yes?
-It was you, right?

344
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,301
What?

345
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,346
You're the one...

346
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,642
who tipped off Damos then.

347
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,519
(foreboding music)

348
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,149
(eerie music)

349
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,401
CHIEF DEPUTY INVESTIGATOR KIM INMYEON

350
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,236
-(rain pattering)
-GIYONG: I planted a mole.

351
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,530
His name is Kim Hyunsoo,

352
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,407
a KNPU student.

353
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,534
Why are you telling me this now?

354
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,996
So? Where is this student?

355
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,415
All right.

356
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,876
I'll talk to the Commissioner.

357
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,252
(suspenseful music)

358
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,513
-(cellphone beeps)
-(phone line ringing)

359
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,974
Is there a waiter called

360
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,352
Kim Hyunsoo there?

361
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,812
Thank you for telling us.

362
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,399
We'll take care of the rat.

363
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,695
(laughing)

364
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,824
Why do you ask?

365
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,035
You knew it all along.

366
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,330
Was that really necessary?

367
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,123
You know...

368
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,293
who were on the list.

369
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,008
(somber music)

370
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,100
Can I have some time alone?

371
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,328
(suspenseful music)

372
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,669
(clicking)

373
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,926
VIP LIST
CHIEF DEPUTY INVESTIGATOR, REBECCA

374

COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, ANASTASIA
CHIEF DEPUTY INVESTIGATOR, REBECCA

376
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,105
KIM INMYEON

377
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,819
(Inmyeon laughing)

378
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,656
(men clamoring)

379
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,747
-(indistinct chattering)
-(group clamoring)

380
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,923
(Inmyeon laughing)

381
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,633
(crockery clanging)

382
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,638
Oh, you're here.
(laughing)

383
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,933
(breathing shakily)

384
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,393
INMYEONG: Hey!

385
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,728
Giyong!

386
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,857
Hey!

387
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,485
Hey!

388
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:42,903
Hey.

389
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,154
Giyong!

390
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,198
Giyong.

391
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,785
If we don't cover up the list...
(breathing nervously)

392
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,745
...we're all done for.

393
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,957
We can't burn down the whole house
just to catch one bug.

394
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,960
Inmyeon! Are you crazy?

395
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,713
You know what we've done
to catch those guys!

396
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,591
I know how you feel. But listen to me...

397
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,843
just this once.

398
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,889
-Giyong.
-No.

399
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,350
I don't care about Sinyu Club
or whatsoever.

400
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:17,312
I definitely can't cover this up.
(breathing angrily)

401
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,691
Giyong! The honor of the police
is on the line!

402
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,988
I'm not doing this for Sinyu Club.

403
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,324
If that list gets out,

404
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,369
imagine what people will think
of the police.

405
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,372
INMYEON: The guilty cops do deserve
the humiliation,

406
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,792
but it'll put our innocent colleagues
to shame too.

407
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,919
Can you handle that?

408
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,630
Is that what you want?

409
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,303
INMYEON: Giyong.

410
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:55,392
Do you know what I've learned
after being a cop for 30 years?

411
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,145
This thing called justice is...

412
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,565
a kind of business.

413
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,067
It can be negotiated.

414
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,487
There's no right or wrong in business.

415
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,198
It's all for survival.

416
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,492
Back then,

417
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,328
we, the police,

418
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,624
made the decision to survive.

419
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,168
Stay strong.

420
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,753
Giyong.

421
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,342
(suspenseful music)

422
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,553
So how many do we have today?

423
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,597
Four, sir.

424
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,392
We have the girls prepared
just like last time.

425
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,144
Those losers.

426
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,231
Why can't they just listen to me
and play in the club? Why the villa?

427
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,691
There's the video leak issue.

428
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,610
EUISEOK: So I don't think
it's a good time now.

429
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,195
Let's give them what they want.

430
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,742
Gosh. It gets on my nerves.

431
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,787
Is there any good news?

432
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,499
What about the KNPU kids?

433
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,293
The dead kid's brother
sounded interesting.

434
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,961
(eerie music)

435
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,049
Kim Tak went to Commissioner Wi
after talking to you

436
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,593
and had a big fight with Seunghyun.

437
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,932
(snickering)

438
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:23,730
I thought I could play with him a bit,
but it went so easily.

439
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,903
HANSOL: Wasn't there a girl too?
The one with the laptop.

440
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,780
Ko Eunkang is quiet.

441
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,408
But now the semester has started
and everyone is at school,

442
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,369
it is not easy to keep an eye on them.

443
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:42,832
(snaps finger)

444
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,544
Why don't you plant a kid then?

445
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:50,924
I was actually looking for a KNPU student
to help us spy on them.

446
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,718

(phone line ringing)

456
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,628
I sent you all the money I made
from tutoring, so don't call me.

(Hanna sighs)

458
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,549
I can't do the tutoring job
during the semester.

459
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,760
I gave you all of my savings.

460
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,220
HANNA: How much debt are you in?

461

What?!

462
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,689
HANNA: You're crazy.

463
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,065
How much again?

472
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:43,953
Let's talk about the details later.
And please give this note to Ari.

473
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:49,042
Ari, I'm quitting school.

474
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,420
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier.

475
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,633
I don't think I'm police material

476
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,176
nor

477
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,887
your boyfriend material.

479
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,518
He didn't even tell you?

480
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,561
No.

481
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,480
EUNKANG: What is going on?

482
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,859
-Is he still not answering?
-No. His phone is still off.

483
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,446
What a jerk.

484
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,492

Please leave a message after the tone.

494

You'll be charged after...

(sobs)

497
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,115
Where on earth are you?

DECEASED, KIM HYUNSOO
1984 MAY 22 - 2007 FEBRUARY 16

501
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,093
Hyunsoo, I'm such an idiot.

502
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,720
(sobs)

503
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,264
I had no idea how you died

504
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,392
and I didn't even think to look into it.

505
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,978
I had no idea...

506
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,734
how scared and lonely you must've been.

507
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,445
I was such an idiot
letting you go like that.

508
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,655
(sobbing)

509
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,866
I'm really so sorry.

510
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,036
Hyunsoo.

511
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,747
What am I supposed to do?

512
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,292
Come on! Tell me!

513
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,045
(whimpering)

514
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,184
(sniffles)

515
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,393
(clears throat)

516
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,525
Where have you been?

517
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,193
I went to see Hyunsoo.

518
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,946
Today isn't even his death anniversary.

519
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,280
Why'd you go all of a sudden?

520
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,035
(cellphone chiming)

521
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,126

CHATS

524
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,428
BUMJU: Dude, what's wrong?
Are you in Gimhae now?

525
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,930
JUYOUNG: Tak, where are you now?

526
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,139
EUNKANG: Is everything okay?

527
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,685
ARI: Please pick up the phone.
Everyone is worried.

528
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,186
(sniffles)

529
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,104

(exhales sharply)

531
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,945
TAK: Grandma, do you need any help?

532
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,781
-I'm good.
-Let me help you.

533
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,041
Is something wrong?

534
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,002
No.

535
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,712
Yes, there is.

536
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,923
Then why else would you be here?
You should be at school now.

537
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,009
TAK'S GRANDMOTHER: You said
you loved school.

538
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:33,558
Grandma, you have to go buy spring onions
at the market, right? I'll go.

539
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,270
(door slides open)

540
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,191
(train chugging)

541
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,533
BUMJU: We can't reach Tak.

542
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,744
This is serious.

543
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,120
We're all panicking here.

544
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,122
DAEIL: Gosh. Give him a break.

545
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,874
It's obviously a relationship problem.

546
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,877
You should tell Ari
that she should just apologize to him.

547
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,545
Ari seemed clueless too.

548
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,880
DAEIL: Ari doesn't know either?

549
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,089
Well then...

550
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,550
There must be a situation.

551
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,929
I want to quit school all the time too.

552
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,181
Don't worry and just wait.

553
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,600
He'll collect his thoughts
during the weekend and come back.

554
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,810
By the way, when are you coming back?

555
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,145
I'm on leave this weekend.

556
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,438
Do you have plans?

557
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,481
Plans?

558
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,526
A memorial service! My family
has a very important memorial service.

559
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,654
Anyway, don't worry about it.

560
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,907
See? This is what happens
when I don't take care of you guys.

561
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,534
I've been busy,
but I really should take some time

562
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,703
to lead the group now.

563
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,123
Bumju, I'll call you later.

564
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,459
-Okay.
-DAEIL: I have to go. Sorry.

565
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,877
Okay, bye.

566
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:44,963
(phone beeps)

567
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,549
You called a chauffeur, right?

568
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,971
Hey. What took you so long?
I've been waiting.

569
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:57,600
I'll make up for it
with my amazing driving skills, sir!

570
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,562
(somber music)

571
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,443
EUNKANG: I've been waiting for you
to tell me, but it looks like

572
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,987
something is definitely up,

573
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,989
seeing that Tak even switched rooms.

574
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,199
Wait. Ari.

575
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,579
EUNKANG: It's not like Seunghyun
to not do anything about this.

576
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,790
Gosh. This is frustrating.

577
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,170
(keypad clacking)

578
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,631
EUNKANG: Seunghyun, can we talk?

579
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,097
-(message tone)
-SEUNGHYUN: Sorry. I'm a bit tired today.

580
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,016
-(object clatters)
-(sighs)

581
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,194
(keypad clacking)

582
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,113
SEUNGHYUN: Tak.

583
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,868
If this is because you feel
uncomfortable around me, I'll quit school.

584
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,828
So come back.

585
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,714
STUDENT WITHDRAWAL FORM

586
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,593
(page riffles)

587
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,515
NAME: WI SEUNGHYUN

588
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:32,570
(cellphone buzzing)

589
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,239
(cellphone buzzing)

590
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,493
Hey. What is it?

591
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,661
EUNKANG: You said you'd see me today.
Hurry and come on out.

592
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,913
I need to talk to you.

593
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,625
EUNKANG: Over here.

594
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,629
Hop in.

595
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,422
You said you wanted to talk.

596
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,636
-We'll talk there.
-Where?

597
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,929
You'll see.

598
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,765
Where are we going?

599
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,684
I said you'll see.

600
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,480
(sighs)
I'm not in the mood to go anywhere.

601
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,607
We're going to see Tak.

602
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:14,904
You wouldn't tell me what happened,
so I wanted to talk to him.

603
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:18,199
But then I thought
you might want to talk to him more.

604
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,742
So you're in.

605
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,704
Eunkang, turn the car around.
Thank you for worrying about me,

606
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,415
-but this is not something you can fix.
-No.

607
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,502
If I were in trouble,
you would've helped me too.

608
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,338
I've never seen you so distressed.

609
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,049
EUNKANG: If it was your fault,
apologize to him.

610
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,552
If it was Tak's fault, nag him about it.

611
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,721
Man up and face the problem.

612
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,600
I know it takes courage to apologize.

613
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:49,397
I've got your back,
so don't worry and go for it.

614
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,236
(liquid boiling)

615
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,114
(breathes deeply)

616
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,827
Welcome.

617
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,917
(light music)

618
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,712
Hello.

619
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,046
Hello.

620
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,470
-(water running)
-(plates clanging)

621
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:31,689
I feel so bad putting someone else's
precious daughter to work.

622
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:35,276
It's okay. My parents run a restaurant,
and I used to help them a lot too.

623
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,945
(crockery clanging)

624
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,659
If you're finished, come and try this.

625
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,785
Okay.

626
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,831
It looks amazing.

627
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,042
Thank you.

628
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,590
Mm-mm.

629
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,717
It's so good.

630
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,137
I wonder why you came here
all the way from school.

631
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,556
Did Tak get in trouble?

632
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,099
No, not at all.

633
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,060
Tak is such a great student at school.

634
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:13,731
He's really popular too
because he's athletic and kind.

635
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,107
Is that so?

636
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:20,696
He may not be very talkative
and seem a little cold,

637
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,698
but he has a warm heart.

638
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,283
(munching)

639
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,577
Just like his brother.

640
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,873
Tak has a brother?

641
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,418
(somber music)

642
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,849
SEUNGHYUN: I'm sorry.

643
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:53,145
That's the only thing I can say
on behalf of my father.

644
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,148
I know this won't make you feel better,

645
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,486
but I thought I should say it.

646
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,780
(Tak sighs)

647
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,367
You don't have to be sorry.

648
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,204
I thought about it,

649
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,333
and it's not like you knew
what your father did

650
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,711
to my brother.

651
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,173
Your father says he didn't do it and...

652
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,261
I can't shed any light on this now.

653
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,389
So...

654
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,517
I can't blame you.

655
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,896
(breathes shakily)
So, yes. I get it.

656
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,981
(emotive music)

657
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,025
But you know what?

658
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,276
(sobs)

659
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,279
My head can understand,

660
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,407
but my heart...

661
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,701
My heart can't.

662
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,413
(breathes shakily)
Whenever I see you at school,

663
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,791
I'll be reminded of your father
and my brother.

664
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,587
So I'm not sure if I can even stand
being in that place.

665
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,505
But still, you shouldn't quit school.

666
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,051
-I'll quit.
-TAK: No.

667
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,678
Being a cop
wasn't my original dream anyway.

668
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,390
TAK: Unlike me,
you've always wanted to be a cop.

669
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,976
-I think it's right that I leave.
-Tak.

670
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,149
I think we've talked enough.
Have a safe trip back.

671
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,738
(sighs)

672
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,200
(engine revving)

673
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,503
(emotive music continues)

674
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:54,683
(door closes)

675
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,855
You're home, sir.

676
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,483
Gosh. Already?
(groaning)

677
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,611
(grumbling)

678
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,406
-Here.
-Thanks.

679
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,200
(grunting)

680
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,414
-All right. Here.
-Thank you.

681
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,541
(man yawning)

682
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,252
-Thank you!
-Sure.

683
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,421
-I'll work harder!
-Okay.

684
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:24,839
(chuckles)

685
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,842
The pay is better in the outskirts. Sweet.

686
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,844
(sucks teeth)
Wait.

687
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,431
Maybe I can do another round
while I'm out here.

688
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,558
(sucks teeth)
Let's see.

689
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,476
(dogs barking in distance)

690
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,478
No.

691
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,441
WAITING FOR NEXT CALL...

692
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,942
DAEIL: What? 150,000 won?

693
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,610
Wait.

694
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,488
Gapyeong isn't so far from here.

695
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,452
What a lucky guy you are, Daeil.

696
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,537
330-1, SEOA-MYEON, GAPYEONG-GUN
ACCEPT

697
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,496
(chuckles)

698
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,540
(blows air)

699
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,041
(whimsical music)

700
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,681
TAXI DRIVER: Gosh, why is it
so dark around here?

701
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,975
It should be around here.

702
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,477
(breathes deeply)

703
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,313
Strange. This is the address.

704
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,193
Sir, I'll just get off over there.

705
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:28,777
Okay.

706
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,613
(engine rumbling)

707
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,991
(engine revving)

708
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:37,703
(sighs)

709
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,834
Where is this place?

710
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,253
Darn it.

711
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,088
(keypad clacking)

712
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,966
-(phone beeps)
-(phone line ringing)

713
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,093
Hello, sir. I'm your chauffeur.

714
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,096
I think I arrived at the address.
Where are you?

715
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,642
A villa?

716
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,435
Villa?

717
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:05,189
DAEIL: Okay. All right.

718
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,066
(phone beeps)

719
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,488
Why are there so many cars here?

720
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,449
-(phone buzzing)
-Huh?

721
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,994
HYEONJONG: Silver, 4408.

722
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,498
I opened the door, so start the car
and wait. I'll be right there.

723
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,209
Silver, 4408?

724
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,171
Silver...

725
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,801
23M 4408

726
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,934
All right.

727
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,854
(door closes)

728
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,237
-(engine starts)
-(exclaiming)

729
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,491
(sniffs)
This is one nice car.

730
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,868
(clock ticking)

731
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,664
(engine rumbling)

732
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,131
Damn it.

733
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,008
(sighs)

734
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,138
I'M STILL WAITING, SIR.
WHEN ARE YOU COMING?

735
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,182
Gosh! It's already been 30 minutes.

736
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,855
Damn it.

737
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,107
(sighs)

738
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,537
(car window slides open)

739
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,291
(reflective music)

740
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,375
(sighs)

741
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,004
DAEIL: That is a lot of stars.

742
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,927
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

743
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,516
(cellphone buzzing)

744
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,852
YOO DAEIL

745
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,437
DAEIL: Next time, I'll video call you.

746
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,440
If you answer it,

747
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,193
we'll start dating.

748
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,944
(cellphone buzzing continues)

749
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,946
MISSED CALL
YOO DAEIL

750
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,827
YOO DAEIL
SENT A PHOTO

751
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,537
YOO DAEIL

752
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,498
One star for memories,

753
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,418
one star for love, and one star for Daeil.

754
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,297
Looking at these beautiful things,
it reminds me of you.

755
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,590
(chuckles)

756
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:02,449
INPYEONG REST AREA

757
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,326
-SEUNGHYUN: Want some coffee?
-Yes.

758
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,662
-Wait here. I'll go get it.
-Let's go together.

759
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,045
You must be tired.
Give me the key. I'll drive.

760
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,966
I wish I could, but I can't.

761
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,260
I'm the only one insured.

762
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:22,886
(chuckles)

763
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,013
(sips)

764
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,226
I didn't know you guys had such a problem,

765
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:34,148
so I was frustrated and upset.

766
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:39,486
I couldn't tell you because
I thought you'd be disappointed in me.

767
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,406
Why would I? It's not your fault.

768
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,533
Anyway, my father handed over

769
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,954
both Tak's brother and the laptop.

770
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,998
But to be honest,

771
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,250
I still can't believe it.

772
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,379
SEUNGHYUN: I'm not sure what's true

773
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:58,964
and what's not.

774
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,258
Whether it's true or not,

775
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,802
it's neither your or Tak's fault.

776
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:09,808
So don't act like you two are enemies
from feuding families.

777
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,852
What are you, Romeo and Juliet?

778
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:12,895
(chuckles)

779
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,651
Tak needs some time to process all this.

780
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,737
EUNKANG: So don't be upset.

781
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:25,240
Let's be patient and wait for him.

782
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,493
(reflective music)

783
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,494
(sighs)

784
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:33,624
You know I'm more worried
about you than Tak, right?

785
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,169
Cheer up.

786
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,671
I'm here for you.

787
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,216
You're here for me?

788
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,051
(laughs)

789
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,512
(sips)

790
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,976
(cellphone buzzing)

791
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:54,770
Hold on.

792
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,772
(cellphone buzzing)

793
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,358
-Hi, Daeil.
-DAEIL: Hey, Seunghyun. Look at the stars.

794
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,317
Stars?

795
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,402
What stars?

796
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:06,114
DAEIL: Gosh. Don't you have emotions?

797
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,953
Bumju and I were similar
in that sense, but you...

798
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,373
(clicks tongue)
I've got to change my roommate.

799
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,334
Stop saying nonsense. Where are you?

800
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,877
Me?

801
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,089
I'm in Gapyeong.

802
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,715
SEUNGHYUN: Gapyeong? Are you on a trip?

803
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,175
No, I'm not.

804
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,970
-DAEIL: I'm a chauffeur.
-A chauffeur?

805
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,721
SEUNGHYUN: What if you get caught?

806
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,557
I'll be fine.

807
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,726
Gosh. You're such a nerd
and such a coward.

808
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,645
You know what?

809
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:41,817
There's nothing a man can't do
for the woman he likes.

810
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,571
A real man does anything for her,
no matter how dangerous.

811
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,447
-SEUNGHYUN: You're crazy.
-What?

812
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,866
(chuckles)
Who is she?

813
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,618
Well, that's a secret.

814
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,412
Anyway,

815
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:57,666
I was reminded of my roommate while
looking at the stars, so I called you.

816
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:58,625
SEUNGHYUN: Are you done working?

817
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,337
No, I'm waiting for my client,
but he won't come out.

818
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,341
So I was thinking of practicing
my driving around here.

819
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,759
SEUNGHYUN: You must be tired.
It's getting late.

820
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:08,969
(women screaming in distance)

821
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,387
(foreboding music)

822
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,514
(women screaming continues)

823
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,058
What was that?

824
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,103
-Hey, did you just hear that?
-Hear what?

825
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,855
DAEIL: I think I just heard something.

826
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:20,981
Maybe there's a fight.

827
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,983
SEUNGHYUN: Then just call the police.

828
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,359
Don't get involved.

829
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,111
You'll be in trouble
if the school finds out.

830
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,154
All right. Hang up.

831
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:28,739
Okay.

832
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:29,698
(cellphone beeps)

833
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,200
It was Daeil.

834
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,083
(imitates static on radio)

835
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,168
Detective Lee.

836
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,963
Detective Yoo is on his way.

837
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,257
(exhales sharply)

838
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,594
(shouting)

839
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,554
-HANJU: Come here!
-(gasping)

840
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,181
(men exclaiming)

841
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,099
-HANJU: Come here. Right now!
-INMYEON: Sir.

842
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,268
-HANJU: That little...
-INMYEON: Sir, please be generous.

843
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,729
-DUKJIN: Hey.
-HANJU: Kick her out of here!

844
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,230
DUKJIN: Oh, no. Be careful.

845
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,315
INMYEON: Come on.

846
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,566
-HANJU: Let go of me!
-(knocks on door)

847
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,692

(door creaks open)

849
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,489
Who are you?

850
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,658
I'm a chauffeur.

851
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,160
And my client wasn't coming out. So...

852
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,413
-A chauffeur?
-Yes.

853
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,498
(suspenseful music)

854
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,169
HANJU: Hey, who called a chauffeur?

855
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,547
-I have to go, so...
-You punk.

856
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,841
INMYEON: Sir.
(laughing)

857
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:33,053
Mr. Oh is new here, so he didn't know.

858
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,264
-HANJU: My gosh.
-Just let him go.

859
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,777
-EUISEOK: Just leave.
-Okay.

860
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,072
It's 150,000 won.

861
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,120
Thank you.

862
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,920
DAEIL: Well, I guess
I didn't have to worry.

863
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,882
I got the money, so...

864
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,175
(chuckles softly)

865
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,140
But...

866
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,267
-(women screaming)
-(men exclaiming)

867
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,519
-HANJU: Come here, you!
-INMYEON: Sir.

868
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,148
I'm sure I heard something.

869
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,330
-DUKJIN: Come on. Sit down.
-Where'd you think you were going?

870
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,083
If you're going to be perverts,
just let us go.

871
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,626
HANJU: What?

872
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,462
Let us go.

873
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,255
-You little...
-Wait!

874
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,924
-That little... Come here!
-Sir.

875
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,385
-Come here! What did you say? Pervert?
-Hey.

876
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,137
-No! Stop it!
-That's hot!

877
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,388
No. Sir.

878
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,475
What the...

879
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,060
-WOMAN 1: Let us go!
-Are they really assaulting women?

880
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,019
HANJU: You rotten whore!

881
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,396
Wait. Calm down, Daeil.

882
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,899
What should I do in this situation?
What should I do first?

883
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:09,900
Right.

884
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,443
(bottle shatters)

885
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,361
-I've got to call the police.
-(breathing heavily)

886
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:17,824
No.

887
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,367
Evidence.

888
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,329
Collect evidence. Evidence first.

889
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,288
(thrilling music)

890
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:24,664

00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,958
(breathing heavily)

892
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,298
DAEIL: That's the victim...

893
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,593
-HANJU: Out of my way!
-...and that's the perpetrator.

894
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,637

896

DAEIL: And these are all witnesses.

897
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,392
Legally, this is foul play.

898
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,770
And foul play can be
sentenced up to ten years of imprisonment.

899
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,313
-Come here!
-DAEIL: Or suspended for...

900
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,232
ten years... No, hold on.

901
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,441
It can be sentenced
up to seven years of imprisonment,

902
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:55,654
up to ten years of suspension,
and a fine of up to ten million won.

903
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,697
Up to a ten million won fine.

904
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:58,740

Who does he have a crush on?

928
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,395
He didn't tell me who it was.

929
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,439
Could it be Hanna?

930
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,523
No way.

931
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:58,109
It could be. Remember when they
showed up together in Gangneung?

932
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,946
There was something going on
between the two then.

933
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,074
That can't be right.

934
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,786

00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,971
(screaming)

986
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,851
(water bubbles)

987
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,921
(foreboding music)

988
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:19,871
(phone line ringing)

989
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,333
EUNKANG: As all kinds of wickedness
popped out of Pandora's box,

990
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,711
Pandora quickly slammed the lid back down.

991
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:30,173
But there was one last thing
remaining inside the box.

992
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:31,966
And that...

993
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,676
was hope.

994
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,305
Ever since,

995
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:42,060
humans believe hope is the last thing
they can hold onto.

996
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,771
I wonder

997
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:50,401
what hope Daeil held onto
in the last moment.

998
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,163
(gentle music)
