1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,254
JUYOUNG: So? Is she going to make
statements for us?

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,131
No.

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,552
SEUNGHYUN: She said she could hand us
the bankbook where she got paid,

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,178
but no more than that.

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,473
Well, it's not an easy decision for her
to make such statements.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,600
You never know what Jo Hansol would do.

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,811
She was our only hope.
(sighs)

8
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,647
We still have hope.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,733
Because the plan's changed.

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,109
(suspenseful music)

11
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,820
-I'm going to meet Jo Hansol.
-What?

12
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:32,115
I'll meet him
and get his confession in person.

13
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,367
Then we'll have hard evidence.

14
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,911
Hey. Do you realize
how absurd that sounds?

15
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,496
Why would he want to meet you?

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,790
Right. He wouldn't want to
meet Ko Eunkang.

17
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,375
That's why...

18
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,923
I'm going to disguise myself
as Lee Eunha and sneak in.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,341
ARI: What?

20
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:55,555
No. Jo Hansol's people saw us
meeting Lee Eunha that day.

21
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,973
EUNHA: Follow me.

22
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,606
SEUNGHYUN: He'll try
to keep her mouth shut.

23
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,983
I don't want to put you in danger.

24
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,861
Then how else are we going to meet him?

25
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,617
EUNKANG: I'm a KNPU student.

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,327
I can protect myself.

27
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,165
Hey, are you sure you'll be okay?

28
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,917
It'll be all right. You know me.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,585
-Do you really think so?
-Yes.

30
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,837
-I'm so worried.
-(chuckles)

31
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,592
(suspenseful music continues)

32
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,015
HOSEOK: This is Lawyer Park Hoseok
of Damos' Strategic Planning Department.

33
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,435
Secretary Shin's offer from the other day

34
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,270
still stands.

35
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,731
We'll also increase the amount.

36
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,068
(keypad clacking)

37
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,363
Lee Eunha is going to the police station
tomorrow morning at seven.

38
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,697
(message tone)

39
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,993
(intense suspenseful music)

40
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,297
(tire screeching)

41
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,260
(Eunkang whimpering)

42
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:17,887
(Eunkang yelps)

43
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,564
(grunts)

44
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,734
(engine revving)

45
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,572
(tire screeching)

46
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,619
(panting)

47
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,205
(upbeat thrilling music)

48
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,127
EUNKANG: Juyoung.

49
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,628
Is the GPS tracker working?

50
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,715
JUYOUNG: It's been working.
We're following them now.

51
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,384
-Do you think Eunkang will be all right?
-SEUNGHYUN: Not sure.

52
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,094
I didn't know they'd do that.

53
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,804
Where are they headed?

54
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,222
To Gangnam.

55
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,975
I think they're going to Damos Hotel.
They're headed in that direction.

56
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,102
Okay. I'll go there too.

57
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,776
(Eunkang yelps)

58
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,654
HOSEOK: You can go now.

59
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,742
(music stops)

60
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,327
(foreboding music)

61
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,042
(Eunkang panting)

62
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,377
(Eunkang grunts)

63
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,837
(eerie music)

64
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,258
-(whispers) Are you awake?
-(Eunkang gasps, panting)

65
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,636
(laughing)

66
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,640
-(Eunkang breathing heavily)
-(Hansol exclaiming)

67
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,684
(Hansol grunts)

68
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,605
Where were you going this morning?

69
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,982
HANSOL: To the police station?
(slurps)

70
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,985
-(Eunkang muffled whimpers)
-(coughing)

71
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,326
I told you to leave the country quietly.

72
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,662
(Eunkang muffled grunting)

73
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,331
(Hansol moaning mockingly)

74
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,791
What are you saying?

75
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,959
Release her.

76
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,085
(Hansol sniffs)

77
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,504
(suspenseful music)

78
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,424
(music intensifies)

79
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,013
(Eunkang pants)

80
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,474
(foreboding music)

81
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,520
(breathing heavily)

82
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,815
Aren't you...

83
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,820
(theme music)

84
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:45,994
What's wrong?

85
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,705
Are you disappointed I'm not Lee Eunha?

86
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,790
(Eunkang breathing heavily)

87
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,458
(suspenseful music)

88
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,210
EUNKANG: I had this feeling

89
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,046
that you'd kidnap Lee Eunha.

90
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,715
And...

91
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,259
I was right on the money.

92
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,471
Oh...

93
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,932
That's it, right? The Mirror Room?

94
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:13,187
Now I get where we are.
This is where you had the drug party.

95
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,983
-I saw it on Min Haeji's laptop.
-What are you trying to do here?

96
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,361
So I guess this is your hideout.

97
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,529
Don't.

98
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,661
You even disguised yourself
to sneak in here.

99
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,164
There must be something
you want to say to me. Shoot.

100
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,750
Min Haeji.

101
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,044
You killed her, didn't you?

102
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,339
Yup.

103
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,551
(beeping)

104
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,223
My gosh. Did he just admit
that he killed Min Haeji? Did you hear?

105
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,850
What is it? What did he say?

106
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,851
(shushes)

107
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,689
EUNKANG: That was quick.

108
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,399
(machine beeping)

109
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,277
-Why did you kill her?
-Because she acted up.

110
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,363
Just like you right now.

111
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,574
Well, she blackmailed me

112
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,160
with some secret video she took.

113
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,204
HANSOL: Like a rat.

114
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,247
So you killed a person for that?

115
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,839
Everyone dies.

116
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,759
(slurps, gulping)

117
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,432
It's a shame
she had to die so early though.

118
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,227
I could've played with her
a little longer.

119
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:40,483
This is why you shouldn't be reckless
and should know your place.

120
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,984
You devilish prick.

121
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,113
(laughing maniacally)

122
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,239
Devilish?

123
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,491
Are you done now?

124
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,828
HANSOL: I gave you some time
so you could say your last words.

125
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:54,914
You didn't think

126
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:59,001
you'd be able to
walk out of here alive, did you?

127
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,545
If I'm going to die anyway,

128
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,631
there's something I want to say

129
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,426
since this is my last chance to speak.

130
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,469
Something you want to say?

131
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,517
What is it?

132
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,229
(breathes deeply)
I did a bit of analysis on you.

133
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,567
-Would you like to hear?
-All right. Go on.

134
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,860
(intense suspenseful music)

135
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,320
BUMJU: Let's say you manage
to meet him.

136
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,364
How will you possibly get his confession?

137
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,324
We should think of a way.

138

EUNKANG: You've held a lot of followers,
events and posted a lot of selfies online.

140
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,253
I guess you love attention

141
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,629
like a celebrity.

142
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,631
-Okay.
-EUNKANG: But...

143
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,177
seeing that you framed Secretary Shin
for everything,

144
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,930
you're irresponsible, and you lie a lot.

145
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,684
EUNKANG: You like gambling
and extreme things, don't you?

INTERVIEW WITH CHANGUI CEO JO HANSOL

151
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,153
You're one of those pretentious
and competitive types...

152
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,030
(grunting)

153
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,243
...who can't stand to lose.

154
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,372
I think I get what kind of person you are.

155
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,417
You're irresponsible
and never feel guilty.

156
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,129
You like one-dimensional stimulation
and hate to lose.

157
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,799
You want to have everything
under your control.

GROUP: A psychopath?

159
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,806
What do we do? Professor said
we should avoid psychopaths at all costs.

160
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,974
Avoid?

161
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,478
We'll use those traits
to extract his confession.

162
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,771
Do you have any plans?

163
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,358
First, we need him to lose his cool.

(breathes deeply)

165
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,239
(foreboding music)

166
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,492
SEUNGHYUN: When you're agitated,
you make mistakes,

167
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,703
and say things you don't mean to say.

168
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,251
So? What kind of person am I?

169
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,838
In front of people, you're like
a smart and progressive self-made CEO

170
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,217
who succeeded
without your father's help, but in fact,

171
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,012
you're just an idiot
who can't do anything without bribery.

172
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:15,930
(eerie music)

173
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,348
You're incompetent.

174
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,518
(chuckles)

175
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,727
I mean,

176
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,896
you act like you're so great,

177
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,357
but you're just a loser
obsessed with the number of followers.

178
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,277
You may seem like a hero to innocent kids,

179
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,863
but you're completely helpless
around those who have real power.

180
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,326
In fact, I heard no one in the industry
actually cares about you.

181
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,872
That's why everyone thought
Secretary Shin was the CEO.

182
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,376
Wait. Were you actually just a puppet?

183
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,628
HANSOL: Shut up!

184
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,423
EUNKANG: Jo Hansol.

185
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,258
You are...

186
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,845
a loser who can't do anything on your own.

187
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,391
A loser hiding behind
Secretary Shin's skirt.

188
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,727
(stammering)
Loser? Did you call me a loser?

189
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,896
Who's a loser? Who's the loser?!

190
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,273
HANSOL: Hey.

191
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,485
Secretary Shin
didn't do anything without my permission!

192
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,154
Stop lying.

193
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,114
The sexual bribery at the villa...

194
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,283
Shut it! I made him do it!

195
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,160
It was my order!

196
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,956
There's nothing he can do
without my order!

197
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,583
Sir.

198
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,793
Don't touch me.

199
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,671
Nobody messes with me.

200
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,383
Whether I do drugs or kill people...

201
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,386
whatever it is, you just do as I say.

202
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,512
Okay?

203
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,100
You all live off my money.

204
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,393
Keep talking if you dare.

205
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,437
-Come on. Talk.
-(Eunkang grunts)

206
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,355
Talk.

207
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,988
(beeping)

208
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,411
-(high-pitched static)
-(both grunt)

209
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,704
(intense, suspenseful music)

210
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,873
-What do we do?
-What happened? Is she caught?

211
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,041
JUYOUNG: Damn it.

212
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,797
-How's Eunkang?
-I think she got caught.

213
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,717
Seunghyun!

214
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,177
(foreboding music)

215
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,346
(beeping)

216
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,267
This is why you were talking nonsense.

217
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,361
(static)

218
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,080
So what was your plan
after recording this?

219
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:50,292
Will your friends storm in and save you?

220
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:51,919
Is that it?

221
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,422
Let's see.

222
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,215
(sucks air, groans)

223
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,008
Let's see.

224
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,148
There he is.

225
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,488
(thrilling music)

226
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,365
(grunts)

227
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:30,833
(grunts)

228
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,674
(grunts)

229
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,178
(groans)

230
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:51,896
(grunts)

231
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,315
(yelps)

232
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,836
-Hey, Seunghyun!
-(screaming)

233
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,093
(grunts)

234
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,306
(screaming)

235
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,822
(screams)

236
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,866
Wait, you little...

237
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,328
-Damn it, do you have a death wish?
-(screaming)

238
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,371
(grunts)

239
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,083
My gosh.

240
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,045
Juyoung!

241
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,881
-BUMJU: Juyoung...
-(electric buzzing)

242
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,054
Hey! Are you all right?

243
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,808
(bouncers screaming)

244
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,397
(screams)

245
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,816
(grunting)

246
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,491
(bouncers grunting)

247
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,078
ARI: How did I look?

248
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,583
What now?

249
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,668
What the hell? Are they zombies or what?

250
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,628
Let's run for now.

251
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,138
Get them!

252
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,644
(engine starts)

253
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,360
(engine revving)

254
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,778
(tire screeches)

255
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,781
FRESH CLEANING

256
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,369
(Hansol guffaws)

257
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,831
(laughing)

258
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,085
All your friends are running away.
(chuckling)

259
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,254
HANSOL: Gosh.

260
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,631
(exclaims)

261
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,467
Hey.

262
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,760
(foreboding music)

263
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,098
This is why you put your trust in money,
not people.

264
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,976
People can betray, but money never does.

265
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,519
You don't know what you're saying.

266
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,272
My friends aren't like that.

267
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,321
Then let's make a bet and see who's right.

268
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,538
-(cellphone beeps)
-(phone line ringing)

269
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,624
HOSEOK: Come in.

270
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,919
(suspenseful music)

271
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,302
(door closes)

272
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,142
You two know each other, don't you?

273
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,602
HANSOL: Hmm?

274
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,605
(suspenseful music intensifies)

275
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,400
(bouncers screaming indistinctly)

276
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,902
(tire screeches)

277
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,697
(bouncers clamoring)

278
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,870
(tire screeches)

279
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,541
FRESH CLEANING

280
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,168
(bouncers clamoring, panting)

281
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,052
(thriller music)

282
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,698
(safety pin clicks)

283
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,409
(fires)

284
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,745
(tear gas grenades clatter)

285
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,290
(bouncers clamoring)

286
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,252
(teargas hissing)

287
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,132
(bouncers clamoring, shouting)

288
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,306
(bouncers coughing, clamoring)

289
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,899
(music fades)

290
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,987
(laughs)

291
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,113
(suspenseful music)

292
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,450
Hey, there's nothing in the world
that money can't solve.

293
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,496
You see, that friend of yours.
That boy who died while chauffeuring.

294
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,207
Getting rid of his phone, the dashcam,

295
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,542
and the security footage.
I did all that with money.

296
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,419
(scoffs)

297
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,674
You can't cover things up
with money like that forever.

298
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,804
Everything will be revealed one day,
including your true colors.

299
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,972
You still haven't come to your senses yet.

300
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,809
(foreboding music)

301
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,357
(Hansol exclaims)

302
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,986
HANSOL: Beating some sense into you
must be the best way.

303
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,034
(foreboding music intensifies)

304
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,039
(music stops)

305
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,255
No. Then it wouldn't be any fun.

306
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,422
(suspenseful music)

307
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,262
(eerie music)

308
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,723
You do it.
Put some sense into your friend.

309
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,476
(tense, suspenseful music)

310
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,653

-Damn it.

314
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,721
-Yes, Professor.
-Hey.

315
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,181
UGON: Hey, Ari.

316
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,182
Where are you now?

317
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,268
What on earth are you guys planning?!

318
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,562
We're going to catch Jo Hansol...

319
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,479
What?

320
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,149
Where are you right now?

321
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,066
(music stops)

322
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,616
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

327
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,651
You come to your senses!

00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,110
(Hansol grunts)

329

00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,199
THIS IS LAWYER PARK HOSEOK

333
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,580
He asked you to spy on us?

334
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,625
HANNA: He made me the offer
through Secretary Shin once.

335
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,543
I turned him down then,

336
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:58,173
but since Secretary Shin got arrested,
some lawyer called Park keeps calling me.

337
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,050
Don't worry.

338
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,635
I ignored all his calls.

339
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,681
Then why are you saying this now?

340
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,308
I thought I could be a double agent.

341
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,559
A double agent?

342
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,605
As much as Jo Hansol wants to know
what you guys are up to,

343
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,024
we need information about them too.

344
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,152
EUNKANG: So you're going to act like
you accept their offer

345
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,321
and tip them off about us.

346
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,281
(speaking indistinctly)

347
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,284
HANNA: I'll gain their trust
and see what they're up to.

348
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,410
Yes. That's correct.

349
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,121
I want you to pay me first. With cash.

350
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,420
What if they find out?

351
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,088
Isn't that too risky?

352
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,340
That's why we should make it work.

353
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,969
I thought you were all ready
to take on that much risk.

354
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,680
(Hansol grunting)

355
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,473
Are you crazy?

356
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,517
Yes, I'm crazy, you bastard!

357
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,894
Hey... Hey!

358
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,565
What an idiot. This is for my dead friend.

359
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,608
(groans)

360
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,114
HANSOL: How dare you...

361
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,866
(thrilling music continues)

362
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,000
GI HANNA

363
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,835
HANNA: Eunkang is in the secret room.

364
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,261
(bouncers screaming in distance)

367

BOUNCER 1: Darn it.

368
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,228
Seunghyun. We'll take it from here.
You go look for Eunkang.

369
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,939
(bouncers grunting, coughing)

370
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,232
BOUNCER 2: Damn it.

HANSOL: Hey.

375
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,134
-You must have completely lost your mind.
-(grunts)

376

-Right?
-(Hanna whimpering)

377

(Eunkang breaths heavily)

378
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,891

-HANNA: Oh, no.
-(Eunkang grunts)

388
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,169
Damn it. You're both crazy.

-Are you okay?
-Yes.

399
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,577
Hurry and catch Jo Hansol.

400
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,370
Don't worry about us. Go.

Seunghyun.

452

You have

453
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,181
the right to remain silent.

454
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,226
You have the right to an attorney.

455
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,940
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

I...

am going to take you down with me.

460
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,284
Suit yourself.

461

I'm ready for anything.

462
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,041
You're going to regret this.

GIYONG: No.

464
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,752
I'm actually proud

465
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,047
that my last duty as a cop

466
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,550
was arresting you.

Yes, sir.

HOSEOK: Sir!

475
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,299
Remain silent.

476
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,052
Don't say anything until I get there.
They've got no evidence anyway.

477
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,596
I think we do.

(upbeat music)

479
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,607
Everything's recorded here...

480
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,358
so you remain silent.

481
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,495
Thanks for the text.

482
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,371
You'll get a bonus.

483
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,677
Wait until I call you.

484
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,678
Okay.

485
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,020

Blood...

488
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,404
Get lost, mister.

489
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,989
Put him in the car.

490

(grunts)

491
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,749
(gasps)
Is your arm all right?

492
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,792
No, it's not.

493
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,211
-(both chuckling)
-Let's take you to the ambulance.

(uplifting music)

495
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,344
Gosh. You really took the cake,

496
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,097
you fearless brats.

497
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,474
(yelling) How could you do
all this without telling...

498
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,560
You guys...

499
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,395
are in trouble.

500

00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,898
Especially you!

502
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,484
-Yes?
-Forgery of official documents.

503
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,486
-Forgery of signature.
-TAK: I forged...

504
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,988
the signature.

505
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,364
It's my fault.

506
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,744
No, sir. I forged the document.
It's my fault.

507
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:15,957
No, sir. It was my idea
to forge the document. I'm sorry.

508
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,166
Huh?

509
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,295
UGON: You little...

510
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,010
Get in!

511
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,304
What?

512
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,263
What?

513
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,849
You have to go talk to the police
as witnesses.

514
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,475
UGON: Hurry and get in.

515
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,938
GROUP: Yes, sir.

516
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,651
(engine starts)

517
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:45,904
(sighs)

518
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,865
(engine revving)

519
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,331
ARI: Were you the one
who called the police, Professor?

520
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,666
UGON: Yes, you brat.
Who else would have done that?

521
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,585
I take care of my students.

522
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,213
JUYOUNG: My gosh.
You're such a loving professor.

523
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,340
UGON: Be quiet.

524
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,507
JUYOUNG (in low voice): Okay.

525
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,890
Are you okay?

526
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,186
Yes.

527
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,357
I won't be home...

528
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,026
for a while.

529
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,656
I need to investigate the Jo Hansol case

530
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,492
and I'll be investigated as well.

531
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,410
GIYONG: When the investigation is over,

532
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,455
I might get arrested, so...

533
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,500
take care of Mom.

534
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:42,961
Okay.

535
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,840
(sighs)

536
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,717
Dad.

537
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,227
(emotive music)

538
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,770
I'm sorry.

539
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,192
(exhales sharply)

540
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,987
You don't need to be sorry.

541
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,698
GIYONG: You did well.

542
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,575
Chin up.

543
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,247
(chuckles)

544
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,679
(engine starts)

545
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,850
(engine revving)

546
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:47,942
(sobs)

547
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,412
-MALE PROTESTER 1: Jo Hansol!
-(camera shutters click)

548
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,373
-MALE PROTESTER 2: Kill him!
-MALE PROTESTER 1: Jo Hansol!

549
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,334
FEMALE REPORTER 1: For cases of drug use,
manslaughter, bribery, and other crimes,

550
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,129
CEO Jo Hansol of Changui Investment
was arrested

551
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,965
shocking the nation
with his heinous criminal activity.

552
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,092
MALE PROTESTER 3: Take down Damos Group!

553
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,635
PROTESTERS: Take it down!

554
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,597
FEMALE REPORTER 2: People
are not only angry at Changui Investment,

555
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,057
where its CEO committed crimes,

556
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,810
but also at Damos Group,
which Jo Hansol was going to take over.

557
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,688
As the boycott campaign
on Damos Group spreads...

558
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,607
In front of Damos Group's
Gwanghwamun headquarters,

559
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,109
demonstrations calling for reforms of
conglomerates are taking place for days...

560
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,819
FEMALE REPORTER 3: Changui Investment's
CEO Jo Hansol

561
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,529
was considered the next chairman of Damos,

562
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,199
but this is going to hinder him
from taking over the business.

563
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,826
CHANGUI CEO JO HANSOL ARRESTED

564
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:42,789
(phone camera clicks)

565
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,541
Man, this photo is going to be
a family heirloom.

566
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,293
Hey, send the photo to our group chat.

567
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,294
EUNKANG: Okay.

568
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,172
All right!

569
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,590
(group exclaiming, clamoring)

570
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,841
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

571
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,759
HEESOOK: This is...

572
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:59,514
for arresting that bastard Jo Hansol.
It's on the house.

573
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,723
(group cheering, applauding)

574
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,600
Drink as much as you want.

575
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,978
-The drinks are on me today.
-(all laughing)

576
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,730
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

577
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,067
YANGCHUL: I thought my daughter
was the only reckless one,

578
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,570
but it seems like you guys
are just as feisty as her.

579
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,823
-As young people call these days...
-What?

580
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,366
(chuckles)
You're like the Avengers!

581
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,535
(all laughing)

582
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,956
Though Eunkang
is the feistiest one among us.

583
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,958
Is that so? Enjoy the food.

584
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,460
Finish it all, okay?

585
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,586
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

586
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,629
Thank you.

587
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,257
But seriously, what I did was nothing.

588
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,261
Hanna was the one who gave Jo Hansol
a blow at the crucial moment.

589
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,306
And Tak and Seunghyun saved us.

590
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,102
No. If it weren't for you guys,
we wouldn't have been able to get him.

591
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,148
Right?

592
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,451
(sighs)

593
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,299
(somber music)

594
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,858
What's with all of you?

595
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,986
Aren't you going to drink?

596
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,540
(emotive music)

597
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,711
(clears throat)

598
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,672
How about we make a grand toast?

599
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,925
Bumju, you say it.

600
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,013
I love you, my friends.

601
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,850
-ALL: I love you, my friends!
-(glass clinks)

602
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,485
(gulping)

603
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,695
(smack lips, sighs)

604
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:33,876
(music stops)

605
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,137
(Juyoung clears throat)

606
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,599
-Let's dig in, guys.
-BUMJU: Enjoy.

607
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,850
TAK: Enjoy.

608
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,102
ARI: Enjoy.

609
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,562
COMMISSIONER OF EAST GYEONGGI
PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY SUMMONED

610
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,023
Commissioner,
would you like to say a word?

611
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,650
-Sir, please say a word.
-Sir, please explain what happened.

612
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,485
-Please say a word.
-Please say a word.

613
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,820
Did you know all about it?

614
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,614
-(reporters clamoring)
-(camera shutter clicks)

615
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,408
MOM

616
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,536
SOOKJA: Seunghyun, it's all
a misunderstanding.

617
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,080
Your father is not that kind of person.

618
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,045
BOTH: Are you all right?

619
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,758
Of course, I am. It's a proud battle scar.

620
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,596
I will never let you get hurt again.

621
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,350
Don't worry too much about your father...

622
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,978
(emotive music)

623
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,523
I had a dream.

624
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,692
In the dream,

625
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,361
I was a boy, and caught a criminal
with my father.

626
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,864
I was...

627
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,074
so proud of him.

628
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,242
GIYONG: Seunghyun.

629
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,080
You have the right to remain silent.

630
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,333
You have the right to an attorney.

631
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,626
I'm sorry.

632
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,420
(Giyong exhales sharply)

633
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,297
You did well.

634
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,091
Chin up.

635
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,013
SEUNGHYUN: It made me so happy.

636
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,100
I felt like he turned back
to the person I used to know.

637
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,525
Everything will be all right now.

638
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,745
(camera shutter clicks)

639
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,997
FEMALE REPORTER 4: Please say a word
to the people.

640
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,123
FEMALE REPORTER 5: Please say a word.

641
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,959
Do you admit your fault?

642
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,628
Our country...

643
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,048
will trust us.

644
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,133
I'll do my best to cooperate
with the investigation.

645
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,386
I'll do my best to cooperate
with the investigation.

646
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,014
Although I think
I'm being falsely accused,

647
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,017
I will speak about it later.

648
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,395
Does that mean
you don't admit to the charges?

649
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,854
(reporters clamoring)

650
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,356
TRUTH WILL BE UNCOVERED

651
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,359
HE'S JUST A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE ME
THE OPPOSITE PARTY IS SLANDERING ME

652
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,362
How are you running this school?
You're supposed to keep them in check!

653
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,115
Because of some kids
who think they're heroes,

654
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,242
Congress and the prosecution
are investigating us now.

655
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,743
What will you do about this?

656
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,703
I'll take responsibility for it
and resign.

657
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,164
The dean's resignation won't be enough.

658
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,041
CHANGHO: We need something stronger.

659
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,793
Uh...

660
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:24,505
How about the abolition of the school?

661
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:28,050
As a matter of fact,
Congress and the press

662
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,929
have been criticizing KNPU
as the source of corruption.

663
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:35,599
We should give them what they want
to shut their mouths.

664
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:39,645
Still, we can't ditch
the students for our sake.

665
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,440
We're the ones who can protect the police.

666
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,692
CHANGHO: We need to avoid
the immediate problems first.

667
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,610
SOONYOUNG: It seems like...

668
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,989
there was a misunderstanding.

669
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,783
I'm not saying

670
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,411
I'll take full responsibility for it
and resign.

671
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,705
I'm saying everyone here

672
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,874
should resign.

673
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,126
-You can't drag us into this.
-What?

674
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,503
-Who's going to take care of security?
-Are you out of your mind?

675
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,172
(police executives clamoring)

676
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,048
-From her position, right?
-First things first--

677
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,593
Is there anyone here

678
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,345
who is not involved with the Sinyu Club?

679
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,764
-(clears throat)
-Sinyu Club...

680
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,642
-We're all...
-SOONYOUNG: It is what we did.

681
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,103
We turned a blind eye to it...

682
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,813
(suspenseful music)

683
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,150
...and our juniors have corrected it.

684
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,277
SOONYOUNG: We should all
be ashamed and resign.

685
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,989
We were given this authority to take
responsibility in a situation like this!

686
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,327
Before coming here today,

687
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,996
I met Commissioner Wi Giyong.

688
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,083
If no one steps up
to claim responsibility,

689
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,169
Commissioner Wi

690
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,964
might make a big announcement.

691
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,304
It turned out...

692
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:02,269
that he knew a lot more than I thought.

693
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,606
(police executives clamoring)

694
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:12,363
We will take full responsibility
for what happened and resign.

695
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:17,201
Though we, unqualified officers,
resign today, from now on, the police

696
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,996
will carry out a fundamental reform
and become the forces

697
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,498
for the people.

698
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,458
TOP-RANKING POLICE OFFICIALS ALL RESIGN

699
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,631
Gosh. What's happening?

700
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,383
It seems we really
caused some big ripples.

701
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,677
Even the dean is resigning.

702
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,970
ARI: What do we do?

703
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,808
(electronic voice) Doors are opening.

704
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,686
(emotive music)

705
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,802
(sighs, chuckles awkwardly)

706
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,433
So you're leaving.

707
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,475
Well...

708
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,354
When you leave, you should leave quietly.

709
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,481
(reflective music)

710
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,066
Please...

711
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,485
take good care of the kids.

712
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,743
EUNKANG: Dean Kim.

713
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,752
We're sorry.

714
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,712
You're leaving because of us.

715
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,256
I'm leaving thanks to you.

716
00:43:55,466 --> 00:44:00,054
Please continue
to be righteous and honorable cops.

717
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,641
SOONYOUNG: The future of the police

718
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,226
is in your hands.

719
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,025
Attention.

720
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,904
SEUNGHYUN: Present arms.

721
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,214
EUNKANG: When you try to correct
the wrongs,

722
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,966
you'll be faced with great pain
and countless ordeals.

723
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:41,762
(engine starts)

724
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,640
They say no flowers bloom
without being swayed.

725
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,103
I wonder if that applies to us too.

726
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,653
Will we manage to bloom a decent flower?

727
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,786
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

728
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,163
YOU WHO PASS THROUGH THIS PLACE
ARE TRUSTED BY THE COUNTRY

729
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,959
TAK: You disappointed me greatly.

730
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,503
The close-order drill
is the most basic training here.

731
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,255
(yelling)
How will you do anything

732
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,674
if you don't know the basics?

733
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,885
Get your act together. We'll start over.

734
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,929
Fall into eight lines.

735
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,931
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

736
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,475
(uplifting music)

737
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,978
Get your act together!

738
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,524
Move faster.

739
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,192
HANNA: Stay in your line!

740
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:40,070
I'm Wi Seunghyun,
President of KNPU Student Council.

741
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,364
SEUNGHYUN: You all did a great job.

742
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,284
If you have any questions
about school life,

743
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,121
the Promotions Corps seniors will be happy
to answer all your questions.

744
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:52,249
ARI: Hello. I'm Shin Ari,
head of the Promotions Corps.

745
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,043
If you have any questions
about school life or the Promotions Corps,

746
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,587
please feel free to ask me anytime.

747
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,214
ARI: I told you the Promotions Corps
is the face of the school.

748
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:03,385
Your thoughtless acts
can tarnish the school's image.

749
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,846
-Sorry, ma'am.
-MALE STUDENT: We'll get it right, ma'am.

750
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,307
Get your act together.
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

751
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,227
Gosh. Take it easy, girl.

752
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,114
We're from the Cyber Crimes Unit.

753
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,868
-I know. What got hacked this time?
-We'll tell you on the way.

754
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,873
ARI: While training at Headquarters
during the summer vacation,

755
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,043
Juyoung caught a hacker
who hacked the police intranet.

756
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,464
She became a cybercrime specialist
who was called for help occasionally.

757
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,300
(students clamoring)

758
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:46,386
JUYOUNG: The undisputed
best husband material, Bumju,

759
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,515
somehow never had a girlfriend.

760
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,516
Hello, sir.

761
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,600
JUYOUNG: But then...

762
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,144
I'm Song Soohyun, a KNPU freshman.

763
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,773
You're from my high school, right?
I heard about you getting accepted here.

764
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,399
Here...

765
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,986
(chuckles)
Who is it for?

766
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,364
Seunghyun? Or Tak?

767
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,158
-You can just tell me. I'll call him.
-No.

768
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,994
I came to this school because of you.

769
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:15,123
When you visited our school to promote
KNPU, I was completely taken by you.

770
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:18,877
(chuckles)

771
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,306
I told you to do it, didn't I?

772
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,058
Are you really a KNPU student?

773
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,768
HIGH-QUALITY ORGANIC VEGETABLE JUICE

774
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,937
SENIOR OFFICER: How many times
do I have to tell you?

775
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,438
What brings you here?

776
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,440
To encourage my juniors.

777
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,483
Sir.

778
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,819
Don't be mean to my juniors.

779
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,363
When have I ever done that?

780
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,489
(chuckles, sucks teeth)

781
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,783
They say people don't change.

782
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,829
Speak for yourself. Stop making trouble
and think before you act.

783
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,832
I'm graduating soon.
I've got everything under--

784
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,208
(Eunkang exclaiming)

785
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,587
I said, think before you act!

786
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,423
-(Eunkang grunts)
-Darn it.

787
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,676
Who the heck are you?

788
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:08,677
Me?

789
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,637
(upbeat music)

790
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,431
A KNPU student.

791
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,310
MC: Now, let's begin

792
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:20,856
the 2021 Inaugural Ceremony
for New Lieutenants.

793
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,109
EUNKANG: The first year of our 20s
seemed to never end,

794
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:27,696
but time passed faster than a taser,
and we were graduating before we knew it.

795
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,323
And...

796
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,700
I realized.

797
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,119
HUMANE POLICE OFFICER'S OATH

798
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,579
I pledge.

799
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,914
STUDENTS: I pledge.

800
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,040
One.

801
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,334
STUDENTS: I will be
a humane police officer

802
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,462
who protects everyone's freedom
and rights.

803
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:44,963
One.

804
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,382
-I will be a just police officer who
-EUNKANG: I've always wanted

805
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,343
-enforces the law according to conscience.
-to find my dream since I was little.

806
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,510
EUNKANG: I realized that's...

807
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,637
One.

808
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,265
-STUDENTS: I will be a kind police officer
-to become a fair and warm-hearted cop

809
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,602
-who protects the disadvantaged.
-who protects people's freedom and rights.

810
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,813
-Lieutenant Ko Eunkang.
-I think that's my dream.

811
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,609
Our daughter has grown into a fine person.

812
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:07,945
(Heesook sniffles)

813
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,697
You've been a wonderful mother.

814
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,615
(chuckles)

815
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,076
I didn't do anything.
She grew up all by herself.

816
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,203
-You've been a wonderful father too.
-(both chuckling)

817
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,580
I'm so proud of her.

818
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,999
She seemed so clueless
when she just got in, but now...

819
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,751
(whimpers)

820
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,003
Why are you crying on a happy day?

821
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,383
MC: The President's Award
is presented to Wi Seunghyun

822
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,512

Oh, right.

828
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,123
I forgot to take photos.

829
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,916
I need to take photos.

00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,660
What do you think?

839
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,329
My students aren't that bad, right?

840
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,958
They're just kids though.

841
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,961
The real world is harsh.

842
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:50,839
(chuckles)

843
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,558

your students turned out all right.

How are you?

858
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,168
That thing...

859
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,338
you couldn't finish ten years ago...

860
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,757
I did it

861
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,510
with my friends.

862
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,182
Are you proud of me?

863
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,063

864
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,107
(emotive music)

865
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,738
Hyunsoo.

866
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,618
HYUNSOO: I was worried about you

867
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,205
because you were all alone with Grandma.

868
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,416
But now, you have great friends.

869
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,751
You did well.

870
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,919
Hyunsoo.

871
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,965
Now...
(breathes shakily)

872
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,888
...you really...
(sniffles)

873
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,434
...look like a cop.

874
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,604
Hyunsoo.
(sniffles)

875
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,939
I will be a great cop

876
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,776
for you and me.

877
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,320
You will.

878
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,657
Keep it up just as you are

879
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,826
and stay strong.

880
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,662
Don't think you're alone.

881
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,499
I'll always...

882
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,004
be in your heart.

883
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,215
(exhales sobbingly)

884
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,270
SEUNGHYUN: Attention.

885
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,898
Present, arms.

887
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,653
(crowd applauding)

888
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,532
EUNKANG: The first year of our 20s
was more passionate...

889
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,119
SEUNGHYUN: And intense
than anyone else's.

890
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,881
(footsteps approaching)

891
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,441
Congratulations on your graduation.

892
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,609
You too.

893
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:47,784
(romantic music)

894
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,248
EUNKANG: Fear always comes with hope.

895
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,792
If I, a clueless freshman,

896
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,920
had not met you, who is my hope...

897
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,424
SEUNGHYUN: If you weren't there for me

898
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,510
during the darkest

899
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,555
and toughest time...

900
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,937
EUNKANG: I'm not sure
if we could have gone through all this.

901
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:30,744
But if I have to do this
all over again to meet you...

902
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,580
SEUNGHYUN: I'll gladly do so,

903
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,957
anytime.

904
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:49,262
We still don't know ourselves
what kind of people we are.

905
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,140
EUNKANG: But we know one thing for sure.

906
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:55,060
HANNA: We are better people
than yesterday...

907
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,484
TAK: And we will become
even better tomorrow.

908
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,573
ARI: We are now heading towards
the beyond,

909
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,326
which seems impossible to get to...

910
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,245
BUMJU: while holding hands
in support of each other.

911
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,332
JUYOUNG: No matter how hard
our journey is going to be...

912
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,292
EUNKANG: If you...

913
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,378
ALL: And I...

914
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,670
Are together...

915
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,841
DAEIL: Whatever! Let's go!

916
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,802
SEUNGHYUN: Let's go.

917
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,308
(upbeat music)
