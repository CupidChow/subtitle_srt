00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:06,923

2
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,858
(uplifting music continues)

3
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,031
(chuckles)

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,206
(music fades)

5
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:43,710
JUCHAN: Hey.

6
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:44,753
SUNYU: Hey.

7
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,758
(sentimental music)

8
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,428
(indistinct chatter)

9
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,142
(chuckles)

10
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:05,857
(gasps)

11
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,824
(sighs)

12
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,495
(whimpers)

13
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,540
JUCHAN: Hey, you.

14
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,752
Eunkang?

15
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:28,838
(sighs)

16
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,298
Is that you, Eunkang?

17
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,345
(exhales sharply)

18
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,513
(breathes deeply)

19
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,641
(chuckles awkwardly)

20
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,021
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,274
(stammering)
Well...

22
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,486
It was so stuffy in there,
so I came out to get some fresh air.

23
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,238
EUNKANG: But then I realized
the moon was so bright.

24
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,739
And I ended up here.

25
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,866
I should get going. Bye.

26
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,660
(gasps)

27
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,079
This isn't the way.
(chuckles awkwardly)

28
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,456
JUCHAN: Eunkang.

29
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,582
(gasps)

30
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,545
(indistinct chatters)

31
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,429
If you're wearing glasses,
fold one finger.

32
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,056
Oh, come on.

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,349
Hey, dude. This isn't fair.

34
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,517
Wait. Halt.

35
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,227
I was only wearing it temporarily.

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,854
I usually don't wear glasses.
You know that.

37
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,981
Really? Then I changed my mind.
(sniffs)

38
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,316
If you were temporarily wearing glasses,
fold your finger.

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,943
-(chuckles)
-Are you kidding me now?

40
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,822
-All right. Is it my turn?
-Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,367
(quirky music)

42
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,165
If you use a Gyeongsang dialect,
fold a finger.

43
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,294
Oh, no. Poor him.
Looks like he wants you to drink.

44
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,795
Well, I think it's a good idea.

45
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,464
Oh, no! You're barely hanging in there.

46
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,467
All right. It's my turn, right?

47
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,635
Yes.

48
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,265
If four of your fingers are folded,
fold one finger.

49
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,101
(all laughing, cheering)

50
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,311
Bravo.

51
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,355
-Nice!
-Drink, drink, drink, drink

52
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,024
Hey!

53
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,027
-Wait. Isn't that a bit...
-You sure you can handle that?

54
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,944
(laughs)

55
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,404
-You can do it.
-Man, that's...

56
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,990
-You can do it.
-ALL: There goes the drink

57
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,993
ALL: Drink, drink, drink, drink

58
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,995
-ALL: Drink, drink, drink, drink
-(singing stops abruptly)

59
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,122
(Tak chugging)

60
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,916
Hey, you got the wrong one.

61
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,584
I told you it'd be a waste of a drink.

62
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,463
Wait. Where is Eunkang?
I haven't seen her for a while.

63
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,673
-Eunkang?
-Yes.

64
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,177
I think she went to the bathroom.
I saw her leaving earlier.

65
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,637
-ARI: What's taking so long?
-JUYOUNG: Really?

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,096
DAEIL: All right. Let's move on.

67
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,059
JUCHAN: You got me.
I thought I was being careful.

68
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,310
(bulb flickering)

69
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,436
(sentimental music)

70
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,271
You'll keep it a secret, right?

71
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,732
What?

72
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,275
(mumbles)

73
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,694
Of course. I will.
(chuckles awkwardly)

74
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,948
I didn't see anything. Don't worry.

75
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,743
I couldn't tell you because both of us
are in the Student Council.

76
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,912
-We've been dating for a while.
-I see.

77
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,166
I really didn't see anything,

78
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,586
so please tell her
she doesn't have to worry.

79
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,756
Thanks for understanding.

80
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,591
No worries.

81
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,014
(alarm clock ringing)

82
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,099
ROOKIE COPS

83
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,518

84
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,597
ROOKIE COPS

85
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,016
RESEARCH AND LECTURE HALL

86
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,684
YUGON: Why are you here?

87
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,811
MALE STUDENT: To learn
about security policies

88
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,646
for keeping people safe and happy.

89
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,605
(smacks lips)

90
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,940
(cheerful music)

91
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,569
I thought the interview was over.
You got in already.

92
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,780
Let's be honest.
Some of you must've applied

93
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,742
because this school is tuition-free
and guarantees you a job.

94
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,452
YUGON: And that's okay.

95
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,038
I did the same 25 years ago.

96
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,086
Why did you come to this school?

97
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,630
(clears throat)

98
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,549
I came here...

99
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,469
because I want to investigate

100
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,804
cases.

101
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,765
But...

102
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,102
cops aren't the only ones
who investigate cases.

103
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,145
Pardon?

104
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,315
Sherlock Holmes isn't a cop,
but he conducts investigations.

105
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:01,611
I'm saying you don't need to be a cop
if you want to do investigations.

106
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,697
But cops are... cool.

107
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,698
(class clamoring)

108
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,657
Okay.

109
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,868
Then let's find out the differences

110
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,870
between private detectives
and police officers.

111
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,375
YUGON: People like Sherlock Holmes
are called private detectives.

112
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,920
Private investigation
is still illegal in Korea,

113
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,298
but anyway, both private detectives and
police officers conduct investigations.

114
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,008
Then how are they different?

115
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,676
The biggest difference is...

116
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,554
who they work for.

117
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:33,226
We, police officers, solve criminal cases
in order to promote peace in society

118
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,020
while private detectives work
for their clients, which are individuals.

119
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,815
They solve problems for specific groups
of people and make profits.

120
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,692
Thus, the biggest difference between them

121
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,113
is whether they were hired
by the state or individuals.

122
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,073
That's the difference.

123
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,742
(quirky music)

124
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,537
(panting)

125
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,249
INSIK: Gosh.

126
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,709
(scoffs)

127
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,296
(door creaks)

128
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,351
(door closes)

129
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,982
YUGON: You're late on your first day.

130
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,119
(breathes heavily)

131
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,580
I guess it's too generous to say
you're late.

132
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,416
Because the class ends in five minutes.

133
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,628
I'm sorry, sir.

134
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,797
YUGON: Why are you late?

135
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,888
Here, you can't catch up with classes
if you drink and oversleep all the time.

136
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,016
If that's the college life
you were expecting, you'd better quit.

137
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,894
In my experience, students like you
can't hold out here for long.

138
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,604
No, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

139
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,314
You don't have to say sorry to me.

140
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:06,444
You should rather be sorry to yourself
for already forgetting why you came here.

141
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,030
YUGON: That's it for today.

142
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,698
CLASS: Thank you, sir.

143
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,953
I want you to write a report

144
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,582
about what you're going to do here
for the next four years. Understood?

145
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,876
Yes, sir.

146
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,962
(crockery clanging)

147
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,047
Mmm.

148
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,883
-It's tasty.
-Gosh, I feel so sick.

149
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,720
This is why you should drink moderately.

150
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,639
I knew this would happen.
You were drinking too much.

151
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,225
You should have stopped me.

152
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,060
What is she saying?

153
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,396
Wow. This is why they say
humans are ungrateful.

154
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,689
Don't you remember?

155
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,608
(upbeat music)

156
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,112

-You lost.

166
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,795
This is my drink, right?

167
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,256
-I'll drink it for you.
-JUYOUNG: Hey, wait. Again?

168
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,340
ARI: What's gotten into her?

169
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,675
GROUP: ♪ Three, six, nine,
three, six, nine ♪

170
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,677
-DAEIL: Eleven!
-JUYOUNG: Come on. Drink up.

171
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,345
All right.

172
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,514
(group humming)

173
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,515
(Ari gasps)

174
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,434
-BUMJU: Hey.
-ARI: Hey, you should stop drinking.

175
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,603
-JUYOUNG: What's wrong with her?
-ARI: Stop drinking.

176
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,896
-Stop drinking.
-JUYOUNG: What's wrong with her?

177
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,147
-Drink.
-Drink. Hold on.

178
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,941
-I'll drink it for you.
-Hey, you should stop drinking now.

179
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,651
Let go. It's mine.

180
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,861
BUMJU: Man. She's drinking so much.

181
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,364
Did I?

182
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,157
ARI: By the way,
where were you last night?

183
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,743
You were gone for a while. Then you
suddenly showed up and started drinking.

184
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,121
You put Seunghyun
through a lot yesterday.

185
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,290
Seunghyun? Why?

186
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,041
(laughing)

187
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,918
I love you, Juyoung!

188
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,129
-You little brat. I'm going to arrest you.
-Hey!

189
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,591
-Hey.
-ARI: She must have lost her mind.

190
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,883
My gosh.

191
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,260
Unbelievable.

192
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,012
-What? What is this?
-Hey.

193
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,263
-Come here.
-Get on his back.

194
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,472
Carry her.

195
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,974
(both grunting)

196
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,559
EUNKANG: Guys.

197
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,769
Be quiet and go to bed.

198
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,479
Thanks.

199
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,981
I'll go clean up the room.

200
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:07,940
-But...
-Okay.

201
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,651
-JUYOUNG: Thank you so much.
-Come on. Where are you going?

202
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,653
Let me come with you!

203
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,322
Gosh, stop moving. You're heavy.

204
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,033
(retching)

205
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,702
EUNKANG I didn't do anything strange,
did I?

206
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,745
(insect buzzing)

207
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,372
(grumbles)

208
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,708
You've got to be kidding me.
Eunkang, that idiot...

209
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,667
(retches)

210
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,669
Jeez.

211
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,966
Gosh.

212
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,518
(sighs)

213
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,188
I don't know
what kind of a ruckus you made,

214
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,440
but his face was so haggard
when he came back.

215
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,817
JUYOUNG: I would have left you
on the street, if I were him.

216
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,071
When he arrived to our room yesterday,

217
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,615
he seemed somewhat really shocked.

218
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,741
ARI: Didn't he?

219
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,786
As if he saw something he shouldn't have.

220
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,332
-Really?
-You didn't kiss him, did you?

221
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,458
(all gasp)

222
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,752
I love you, Seunghyun.

223
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,795
I love you, Eunkang.

224
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,006
EUNKANG: Stop it! You guys are crazy!

225
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,342
-Hey, Seunghyun is over there.
-What do we do?

226
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,427
-JUYOUNG: Eat up.
-ARI: Okay.

227
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,555
-Why does he have to be sitting there?
-JUYOUNG: So think about it.

228
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,556
ARI: Yes.

229
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,392
-JUYOUNG: Think about it.
-ARI: Yes.

230
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,143
(munching)

231
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,694
-Hi.
-Hi.

232
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,948
Sorry. I was a bit drunk last night.

233
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,366
A bit?

234
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,034
You were completely wasted.

235
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,537
It seemed like
it was your first time drinking.

236
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,497
Why did you drink so much?

237
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,083
I was feeling a bit...

238
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,003
I mean, now Cheongram Education is over

239
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,631
and I'm an official student of KNPU,
I was feeling excited.

240
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,050
So I went a little overboard.
(chuckles awkwardly)

241
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,885
But...

242
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,389
I didn't do anything strange, right?

243
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,017
Strange?

244
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,854
What do you mean?

245
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,731
(sighs in relief)

246
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,607
I was so worried.

247
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:18,320
Well, I may get drunk,
but I never cross the line.

248
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,321
(chuckles)

249
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,032
Anyway, thanks for helping me yesterday.

250
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,368
Bye, then.

251
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,081
(chuckles)

252
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,044
(retches)

253
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,509
Why do I feel like

254
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,387
I'm missing something?

255
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,057
You.

256
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,311
Yes, sir. KNPU freshman Ko Eunkang, sir!

257
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,897
-You were late this morning, weren't you?
-Pardon?

258
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,026
-Yes, sir.
-And you didn't salute me.

259
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,486
Salute?

260
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,946
You'd better get your act together.

261
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,782
Don't you know basic etiquette at school?

262
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,784
Sorry, sir. I'll get it right, sir.

263
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,660
Taking classes
is a student's fundamental duty.

264
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,162
One report for being late to class.

265
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,540
One report for dressing untidily
and running around campus.

266
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,585
One report for ignoring me
even though you saw me!

267
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,797
Write these three reports

268
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,800
and hand them in to me
by the end of the day.

269
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,093
-Yes, sir.
-Answer properly.

270
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,679
Yes, sir.

271
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,273
(sighs)

272
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,111
EUNKANG: I thought
Cheongram Education was over.

273
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,780
Are we doing it again?

274
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,533
ARI: Of course, it's not over.
Only the Training Corps got disbanded.

275
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,452
The seniors who were in the corps
are all in the Honorary Student Council.

276
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,537
Honorary Student Council?

277
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,914
Right. You were late today.

278
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,792
The members of the Honorary
Student Council can give you punishments

279
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,503
when you dishonor the school
or violate school regulations.

280
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,255
It's like a student guidance department.

281
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,673
(indistinct chattering)

282
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,300
And Hyuk is the top member there.

283
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,221
You should have told me!
What am I going to do?

284
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,266
Well, obviously,
your college life is doomed now.

285
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,183
(gasps)

286
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,561
The next four years are going to be
pretty exciting for you.

287
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,605
There's hope though.
Our seniors will graduate one day.

288
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,816
Until then, hang in there. You can do it!

289
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,651
-JUYOUNG: Ari, Ari, Ari, Ari!
-ARI: Yes?

290
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,821
They assigned us to new dorm rooms.
And we're roommates.

291
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,156
-Wow! Really?
-(cheering)

292
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,659
What about me? Who's my roommate?

293
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,287
(gasps)

294
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,580
What?

295
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,958
JUYOUNG: I'm glad
you've recovered quickly.

296
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,626
Yes, sir.

297
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,963
As you probably know already,

298
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,299
your punishment has been canceled.

299
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,427
-Thank you, sir.
-You don't have to thank me.

300
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,597
If anyone,
you should thank Ms. Ko Eunkang.

301
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,641
Ko Eunkang?

302
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,729
After you got injured, Ms. Go filed
a complaint against the school.

303
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,814
Which is why Cheongram Education
had been abolished,

304
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,734
and naturally,
your punishment was canceled.

305
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,154
Anyway...

306
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,407
we have some unfinished business

307
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,618
between us.

308
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,163
(somber music)

309
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,463
You still didn't tell me
who gave this to you.

310
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,631
(suspenseful music)

311
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,972
-(women laughing)
-HANNA'S MOTHER: I told you to drink it.

312
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,059
SEVEN STAR

313
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,186
My gosh! Look at you!

314
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,022
Oh, no. Be careful.
I'll see you the day after tomorrow!

315
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,315
-HANNA'S MOTHER: Put your seat belt on.
-WOMAN: Please come again.

316
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,900
-HANNA'S MOTHER: Bye.
-(car door closes)

317
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,360
WOMAN: Good night.

318
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,488
(chuckling)

319
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,865
WOMAN: Oh.

320
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,994
Hanna!

321
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,748
Hanna!

322
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,292
(vehicle honking)

323
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,961
Maybe she didn't hear me.

324
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,464
That disrespectful wench.
Where did she get that from?

325
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,510
Who else? You, obviously!

326
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,803
(laughing)

327
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,806
(birds chirping)

328
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,350
(school speaker chiming)

329
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,564
FEMALE STUDENT 1: Hey, Hanna.
Look at you, studying.

330
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,732
(students laughing)

331
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,985
-(groans)
-(laughing)

332
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,236
What was that?

333
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,195
FEMALE STUDENT 2: Move.

334
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,488
(laughing continues)

335
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,865
FEMALE STUDENT 1: Is she really studying?

336
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,492
(somber music)

337
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,785
FEMALE STUDENT 2: Hey.

338
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,162
Don't you smell alcohol?

339
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,706
(laughing continues)

340
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,790
FEMALE STUDENT 1: Gross.

341
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,458
My dad said...

342
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,753
her mom's coworkers came to his clinic.

343
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,547
To get tested for STDs.

344
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,007
STUDENTS: Really?

345
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,466
That's gross.

346
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,679
(laughing continues)

347
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,639
(students laughing, giggling)

348
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,604
FEMALE STUDENT 2: What are you looking at?

349
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,025
Hey, you should come to my dad's clinic
to get tested too.

350
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,452
(somber music continues)

351
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,581
What are you looking at?
What the hell are you looking at?

352
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,749
(foreboding music)

353
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,085
-(thuds)
-(female student 2 screaming)

354
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,712
(female student 2 shuddering)

355
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,424
MALE (on PA): Currently here
at West Gangneung Police Station...

356
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,139
Your mom isn't answering the phone.
Do you have any other guardian?

357
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,390
No.

358
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,308
(parent scoffs)

359
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,894
Even if she answers,
she'll be too drunk to come over.

360
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:47,024
Gosh, what are you glaring at?
Stop glaring at me!

361
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,777
You think you're so great
because you're the top student,

362
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,278
but I'm going to teach you a lesson.

363
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,614
I'll set up a school violence committee
and get you expelled.

364
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,741
-You'll see!
-Your daughter picked on me first.

365
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,909
She hit me first too!

366
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:01,872
Hey! How is a playful push
the same as attacking with a weapon?

367
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,956
It was self-defense.

368
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,333
What? Hey!

369
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,417
(slams desk)

370
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,923
Look. These are
all the complaints we received.

371
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,344
They're all saying
your husband is treating fake patients.

372
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,304
CCTV IN USE

373
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,890
NAMGI: Once this gets out,
it's going to cause quite a stir.

374
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,725
(phone ringing in distance)

375
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,893
(somber music)

376
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,395
(parent grumbles)

377
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,313
(scoffs)

378
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,482
(door closes)

379
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,905
(engine revving)

380
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,826
Excuse me...

381
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,747
Thank you.

382
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,003
Hey, if you have a criminal history
on your school record,

383
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,421
you won't be able to go to a good college.

384
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,175
It was reckless of you. Go home now.

385
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,847
(foreboding music)

386
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,100
(beeping)

387
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,520
-A spy cam?
-Set it up during the training.

388
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,731
But why do you...

389
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,235
NAMGI: I'll tell you why later.

390
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,904
Please do me this favor.

391
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,827
YUGON: I guess you need more time.

392
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,748
Fine.

393
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,709
(breathes deeply)

394
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,337
But I want you to keep this in mind.

395
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,965
You can't fix what's already happened,

396
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,759
but what you're going to do in the future

397
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,888
is up to you.

398
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,524
(exhales)

399
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,825
(door lock chimes)

400
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,077
(door creaks open)

401
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,583
(door lock chimes)

402
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,589
(Eunkang clears throat)

403
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,136
I picked one randomly
because you weren't here.

404
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,596
If you want, we can switch.

405
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,766
(clears throat)

406
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,559
It's okay.

407
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,028
(clears throat)

408
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,080
BUMJU: I'm unpacking now.

409
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,958
(chuckles)
Don't worry.

410
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,419
The food here is great,
and all my colleagues are nice.

411
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,048
My roommate?

412
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,636
He's nice. He's not ordinary though.

413
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,889
(disturbing quirky music)

414
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,567
(door shuts)

415
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,156
(exhales slowly)

416
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,414
(breathes heavily)

417
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,261
(exclaiming)

418
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,391
It's here. This is the place.

419
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,143
What do you mean?

420
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,937
(sighs)
I don't care.

421
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,986
My uncle hit the jackpot in his business,

422
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,572
so he built a three-story building
in Gapyeong and moved there.

423
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,866
Then he started to have nightmares
and see things every night.

424
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,200
He also got sick for no reason.

425
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:11,580
DAEIL: His dog suddenly died
and his wife got into a car accident.

426
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,166
His life became a mess. Do you know why?

427
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,417
Water veins?

428
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,795
Bingo. There was a water vein
under the house he built.

429
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,590
After he found that vein,
all those symptoms disappeared.

430
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,300
(sighs)
You're lying again.

431
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,761
Come on. It really happened.

432
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,931
Some mysteries of the universe
cannot be explained by science.

433
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,183
(sighs)

434
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,769
This is a spiritual matter.
I can't explain everything.

435
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,604
Anyway,

436
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,273
you guys are really lucky.

437
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,485
DAEIL: You're going to get
a good night's sleep thanks to me.

438
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,320
Okay.

439
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,866
The water vein is now completely blocked.
Put it back now.

440
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,454
Move, for God's sake.

441
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,795
(exhales sharply)

442
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,381
Man, this is nice.

443
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,843
Hey, if you're done, go.
Why are you lying on my bed?

444
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,887
I don't want to. I want to stay here.

445
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,473
-What's wrong with him?
-I guess we need to take action.

446
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,600
(action music)

447
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,897
Guys, what are you doing?
Is this how you repay my kindness?

448
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,402
(metal clatters)

449
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:28,448
ORANGEADE

450
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,533
ARI: Aww...

451
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,159
Really?

452
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,702
(chuckles)

453
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,913
Of all the girls, why her?

454
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,874
-It's like Sleeping With the Enemy.
-I don't know.

455
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,751
Freshmen are supposed to
use the assigned room,

456
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,128
so I can't change the room.

457
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,047
Even if you could,
no one would like to be her roommate.

458
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,590
Everyone hates her.

459
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:50,262
Anyway, whenever I walk into the room,
it's like walking on eggshells.

460
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,181
Why do you have to be nervous around her?
She should be thankful to you.

461
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,933
I mean, she got out
of solitary confinement

462
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,018
thanks to the abolishment
of Cheongram Education.

463
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,272
She should be really grateful to you.
You're the one who made it happen.

464
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,399
She would never do that. You know that.

465
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,776
You know what she said?

466
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,905
CHEERFUL INDIE SONGS

467
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,367
(door chimes)

468
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,953
Hey, can I listen to music?

469
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,581
I'd like to stay quiet in the room.

470
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,542
Oh...

471
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,210
Okay.

472
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,255
Let's try not to bother each other.

473
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,215
And let's stay out of
each other's business.

474
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,303
Are you saying
you don't even want to talk?

475
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,889
If you have something to say,
leave a note.

476
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,599
ARI: No way!

477
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,769
Maybe she's doing that on purpose.

478
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,021
To piss you off.

479
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,107
-(slams table)
-Don't let her walk all over you.

480
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,358
I'm ignoring her too.

481
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,444
Good.

482
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,322
Seriously, she has no shame.

483
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,115
ARI: Gosh.

484
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,201
MIKANG: Hello?

485
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,036
When are you coming home?

486
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,621
You said you'd come
when the training's over.

487
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,581
I'm going this weekend. Why?

488
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,249
Mom wants to know what you want to eat.

489
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,792
Uh...

490
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,793
Fried shrimp?

491
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,962
-Except that.
-Why?

492
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,005
I had it yesterday.

493
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,007
(scoffs, grumbles)

494
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,011
If you're not going to listen to me,
why did you even ask?

495
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,013
(door chimes)

496
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,141
(coughs)

497
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,981
(whispers)
I'll call you back later. Okay. Bye.

498
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,859
(keyboard clacking)

499
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,167
(sighs)

500
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,962
(Eunkang exhales sharply)

501
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,715
(keyboard clacking)

502
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,345
I CAME TO THIS SCHOOL BECAUSE

503
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,391
(sighs)

504
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,394
Obviously, it's because...

505
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,896
(sentimental music)

506
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,981
(exhales sharply)

507
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,361
(gasps)

508
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,247
(indistinct chattering)

509
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,603
-(Eunkang shrieks)
-(thuds)

510
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,729
(students gasp)

511
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,065
(students clamoring, laughing)

512
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,579
(sighs)

513
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,544
(chuckles awkwardly)

514
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,602
(groans)

515
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,271
(grunts)

516
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,111
You should have been careful.

517
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,280
You're so clumsy.

518
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,201
-Did you see that?
-It was impossible to miss it.

519
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,370
It was such a loud thud.

520
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,582
Hurry up and put it on.
So it doesn't leave a scar.

521
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,799
(groans)
Man, that's a big scar for a girl.

522
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,429
Thanks for the bandage,
but don't pick a fight with me.

523
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,972
I'm not in the mood.

524
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,934
-Is everything all right?
-Gosh, that burns.

525
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,688
(groans)

526
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,818
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

527
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,028
-Is it fun?
-What?

528
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,030
School. Is it fun?

529
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,281
(chuckles)

530
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,409
Who goes to school for fun?

531
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,535
What else then?

532
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,786
(birds chirping)

533
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,538
A sense of responsibility.

534
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,457
I do my best to be responsible
for my decision.

535
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,751
Whether it's fun or not.

536
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,337
So I can see.

537
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:39,008
Well, I'm not the type of person
who can be patient with everything.

538
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,220
I used up all my patience
preparing for the CSAT.

539
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,264
I can't do that in college anymore.

540
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,225
I mean, we're college students,

541
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,102
but everything's just like
back in high school.

542
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:52,355
Look. We wake up early in the morning,
put our uniforms on, and take classes.

543
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,815
Then we eat at the cafeteria
and do our homework.

544
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,692
And why do I have to write
so many letters of apology?

545
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,068
To become a better writer?

546
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,319
(sighs)

547
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,156
Dealing with a roommate I can't
get along with is stressing me out too.

548
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,782
It sucks.

549
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,285
You knew it'd be a communal life here.

550
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,413
I did. But there's literally no fun here.

551
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,459
We're wasting our youth
and this nice spring weather.

552
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:16,045
This was not the college life I expected.

553
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,548
So what?

554
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,884
Are you going to quit?

555
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,344
I'm considering it.

556
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,264
Maybe I should take the CSAT again.

557
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,392
Then what was all the fuss about?

558
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,604
You're the one who encouraged the kids
and made things complicated.

559
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,064
SEUNGHYUN: If you were going to quit,
you should have quit before coming.

560
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,192
You took away
someone else's chance to learn here.

561
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,737
Hey, that's not fair.
I'm being serious here.

562
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,071
Because you're being pathetic.

563
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,324
It's only been a week
since school started.

564
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,576
SEUNGHYUN: Why did you start this
in the first place?

565
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,829
And I thought I could trust you.
I must have lost my mind.

566
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,792
Huh?

567
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,919
What's wrong with him?

568
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,963
I can't even say it's not fun?

569
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,132
Unbelievable.

570
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,052
What a great excuse.
I know that's not the reason.

571
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,680
(exhales)

572
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,100
Hey. Wake up.

573
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,354
Come on. Let's go.

574
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,980
-Let's go.
-(groaning)

575
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:19,859
(sighs)

576
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,074
(exhales sharply)

577
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,368
(quirky music)

578
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,328
(sobs)
Juchan.

579
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,915
This isn't fair.

580
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,836
(Eunkang sobbing)
Juchan.

581
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,296
Don't go out with Sunyu.

582
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,049
Do you know why I came here?

583
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,969
You said you wanted to study with me.

584
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,931
Why did you say that
when you already had a girlfriend?

585
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,184
I... I...

586
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,312
Why did I come here...

587
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,356
(whimpering)

588
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,316
(Eunkang whimpering)

589
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,280
-You're doing great. See you around.
-EUNKANG: Bye.

590
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,286
SEUNGHYUN: You came here for a guy.

591
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,497
Came here to let them
know what's wrong? What a joke.

592
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,002
-What's up?
-Let go.

593
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,005
SEUNGHYUN: A blind date?

594
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,256
Yeah.

595
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,593
Since it's our first weekend off,

596
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,595
I prepared an exciting meeting.

597
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,513
(humming)
Mmm...

598
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,681
(clicks tongue)
Follow me.

599
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,349
(humming)
Mmm...

600
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,018
They're music majors.

601
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,270
Freshmen majoring in piano. Mmm.

602
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,150
Gorgeous, right?

603
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,402
-Just the two of us?
-Yes.

604
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,114
Bumju said he's meeting his family
and Tak is going to Gimhae.

605
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,367
Well... I'll think about it.

606
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,161
Don't be shy. Gosh.

607
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,496
Take the chance while you can, okay?

608
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:56,998
DAEIL: You know what?

609
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,500
Love is all about timing.

610
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,670
Cute girls like her
are almost never single.

611
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,923
Now is the time.

612
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,177
Saturday, 1 p.m. at Gangnam Station. Okay?

613
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,346
See you.

614
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,263
(uplifting music)

615
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,848
On freshmen's first leave,

616
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,225
they must put the uniforms on,
according to custom.

617
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,437
Your uniform is the proof
that you're students of KNPU,

618
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,732
so be extra careful
not to disgrace your school.

619
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,442
INSIK: One.

620
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,444
Two.

621
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,154
Three.

622
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,656
Four.

623
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,117
One, two, three, four.

624
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,287
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

625
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,998
HYUK: I wish you all safe trips.

626
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,375
Understood?

627
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,501
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

628
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,669
Go.

629
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,254
Thank you, sir!

630
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,131
(indistinct chattering)

631
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,218
I'll see you later.

632
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,681
(sizzles)

633
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,350
(somber music)

634
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:04,607
REST IN PEACE

635
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,943
(woman 2 whimpering)

636
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:16,703
CHANGUI VENTURE CAPITAL CO., LTD
CEO JO HANSOL

637
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,803
DETECTIVE: My. All the big names
from KNPU are here.

638
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,808
DAMOS

639
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,190
(footsteps approaching)

640
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:50,111
HEAD OF INVESTIGATION DIVISION, WI GIYONG

641
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,154
(thuds)

642
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,405
NAMGI: Is that it?

643
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,867
Do you think I came to you
just to get that one superintendent?

644
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,368
(thrilling music)

645
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,328
The thing Hyunsoo left!

646
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,247
(breathes heavily)

647
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,707
Give it to me.

648
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,334
There was nothing more
than what the National Police Agency said.

649
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,252
(scoffs)

650
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,671
NAMGI: I knew it.

651
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,340
You were one of them.

652
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,473
You met Mr. Cho, didn't you?

653
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,476
Those KNPU graduates!

654
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,979
How much hush money
did they get from Mr. Cho?

655
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,025
Let go. Let go!

656
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,944
You'll see. I'll disclose everything.

657
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,237
You!

658
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,239
And the corrupt KNPU graduates!

659
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,784
I'll finish you all!

660
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,038
-Good work. Bye.
-Bye.

661
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,500
(exhales)

662
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,339
(honks)

663
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,677
It's been a while.

664
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,931
I heard you're at Gangneung.

665
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,766
You should come back to Seoul though.

666
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,894
That place doesn't deserve
a competent cop like you.

667
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,771
I'm not sure if that would ever happen.

668
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,985
-Because I'm not from KNPU.
-You haven't changed.

669
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,362
(vehicle honking)

670
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,198
Call me if you need any help.

671
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,201
(suspenseful music)

672
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,214
(sighs)

673
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,009
DETECTIVE: Seeing that he even sent
his son there,

674
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,386
he must love his power so much.

675
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,639
Apparently,
Wi's son entered KNPU recently.

676
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,392
Right. You went to the school
for a special lecture.

677
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:45,977
Have you seen him?

678
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,650
CALL, MESSAGE, VIDEO CALL, DETAILS

679
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,568
CONGRESSMAN SEO KICHUL

680
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,865
NAMGI: Yes, sir.
I came up with a different idea.

681
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,161
This time it will work.
I'll get you the details soon.

682
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,496
(door chimes)

683
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,710
(cellphone buzzing)

684
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,130
MR. KANG

685
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,673
(cellphone buzzing)

686
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,176
YUGON: But I want you
to keep this in mind.

687
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:22,096
What you're going to do in the future
is up to you.

688
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,472
(cellphone buzzing continues)

689
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,391
(sentimental music)

690
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,727
-My salary?
-Yes.

691
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,021
Why would you ask me that?

692
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,481
Actually, my wife says
I should quit all this

693
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,941
and open a bar together.

694
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,068
I heard you worked
at Gangnam police station.

695
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,196
Didn't you save up any bribe money?

696
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,697
What?

697
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,199
You little...

698
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,784
I thought you were transferred here
because you collected bribes.

699
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,912
Otherwise, why would you come
to the boondocks?

700
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:49,790
(sighs)

701
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,292
I want to be a cop too.

702
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,171
Then no one would mess with me

703
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,299
and get a decent pension
for being a civil servant too.

704
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,968
My grades are good,
so I can go to any school I want.

705
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,096
Then you should be a prosecutor.

706
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,308
(exhales)
I've considered that too,

707
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,393
but with the bar exam abolished,
I need to go to law school.

708
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,438
And the tuition costs a fortune.
I don't have that kind of money.

709
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,607
Besides, I heard connections are
super important in that field.

710
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,734
I've got nothing. It's not for me.

711
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,445
So I'm going to KNPU.

712
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,113
HANNA: It'll be easier.

713
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,657
(sighs)

714
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,408
KNPU?

715
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,538
Hey.

716
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,959
Stop cutting class
and focus on your studies.

717
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,878
(both laugh)

718
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,215
(cellphone buzzing)

719
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,636
MR. KANG

720
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,223
Yes, Mr. Kang.

721
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,272
DRIVER: Are you going straight home, sir?

722
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,943
I'm having dinner with my family today.

723
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,362
My son is on his first leave.

724
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,368
(sighs)
I wonder if he got the training all right.

725
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,830
It seemed like
there was a lot going on at the school.

726
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,791
DRIVER: Sir.

727
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,838
Seunghyun, have some more of this.

728
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,464
-Eat up.
-Okay.

729
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,216
Hold on.

730
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,886
Oh, no. You got so skinny.

731
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,807
Wait. Maybe you're ill.

732
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,600
(chuckles)
Gosh, no. I'm fine.

733
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,977
GIYONG: Enough.

734
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,229
It was just some training.

735
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,190
Just like men born in Korea
are ought to serve in the military,

736
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,276
KNPU students are ought to get training.

737
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,528
Because of
overprotective parents like you,

738
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,697
children are getting weaker and weaker.

739
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,990
(crockery clanging)

740
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,034
I'm really fine.

741
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:51,203
Cheongram Education fizzled out
at the end, so it was rather easy.

742
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,749
Right. I heard about it on the news.

743
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,460
So Cheongram Education is going to be
abolished starting next year?

744
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,211
Yes. It was a violent tradition.

745
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,047
It should have been abolished long ago.

746
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,132
This year's freshmen
worked it out together.

747
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,134
SOOKJA: I see.

748
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,931
I heard he stood against
the Training Corps with a girl.

749
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,060
DRIVER: He also collected signatures...

750
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,063
to refuse Cheongram Education.

751
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,036
GYOGAKSALU

752
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,834
Do you know what it means?

753
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,170
Gyogaksalu.

754
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,631
SEUNGHYUN: "Killing the cow
to get at the horns."

755
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,717
It means to ruin things
while trying to fix a flaw.

756
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,885
Correct.

757
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,932
I heard you stood against
the Training Corps

758
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,268
and collected signatures
to refuse Cheongram Education.

759
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,396
I did.

760
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,733
That was immature of you.

761
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,152
GIYONG: The school is a place

762
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,447
where kids from different families
with different values are gathered.

763
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,575
In order to make them all
look in the same direction,

764
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,453
someone has to teach them order
and monitor them.

765
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,247
And those who break rules
must be punished.

766
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,709
It is immature
to find it unfair and blame the punishers.

767
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,711
(slams table)
Because the police...

768
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,297
work for order and work by orders.

769
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,675
But if we're led in the wrong direction,

770
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,429
I believe we must have the courage
and responsibility to stand up against it.

771
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,222
Exactly how were you led wrong?

772
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,016
Students have personalities,
and they need to be respected.

773
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,310
But they weren't. That was the problem.

774
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:44,150
You think when you respect humans,
they would act more responsibly.

775
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,326
That's very naive of you.

776
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,469
(exhales sharply)

777
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,180
GIYONG: When you respect humans,

778
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,140
they want more.

779
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:21,604
They'll only start to claim their rights,
not willing to tolerate loss or injustice.

780
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,567
Which will result in social chaos.

781
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:33,574
What stops humans' selfishness
and such chaos is not respect.

782
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,913
It is fear.

783
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,332
(sighs)

784
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,461
(door opens)

785
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,172
(exclaims)

786
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,508
(quirky music)

787
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,472
What is all this?

788
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,394
(groans)

789
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,607
Why would you put these things in my room?

790
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,777
What the heck is all this?

791
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,113
(blows air)

792
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,119
Even a dog would be treated better
if it came back after a month.

793
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,081
(slurping)

794
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,168
YANGCHUL: Stop complaining.
We're trying to have breakfast here.

795
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,380
Did you expect the whole family
to be waiting for you?

796
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,131
We were late because we were busy.

797
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,510
Why did you ask when I was coming
if you're not going to wait?

798
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,887
As I said, she was working
on her graduation project

799
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,847
and I went to the ER

800
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,475
because one of my soccer club
members got injured.

801
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,894
And your mom was busy
working the store alone.

802
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,272
It's not even a big deal! Stop frowning!

803
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,731
YANGCHUL: If you're going
to keep frowning,

804
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,775
stop eating and go to your room.
It's annoying me.

805
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,944
Stop it. We're at the breakfast table.

806
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,404
Come on. Eat up.

807
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,406
You must be happy I'm not home

808
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,741
because you can put all kinds of junk
in my room.

809
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,451
My room isn't a closet.

810
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:03,497
Oh, the treadmill. I'll take it out.

811
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,748
I was going to. Now, eat up.

812
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,586
Well, the living room is cramped,
can't we put it in the empty room?

813
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,005
When you go back to the dorm,
you won't use the room anyway.

814
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,132
Yes, I will. I'm going to use it.

815
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:16,635
I'll quit school and move back in,
so take out all the junk inside.

816
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,722
You...

817
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,391
-YANGCHUL: You think this is your house?
-(door opens)

818
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,809
-It's my house!
-(door slams close)

819
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,103
I said I'm good!

820
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,397
Come on. It'll be a nice change of pace.

821
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,356
EUNKANG: What...

822
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,692
It's on me. I got my paycheck.

823
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,988
-But why would you...
-MIKANG: Stop talking and come in.

824
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,657
-I don't want to...
-Come on. I already made a reservation.

825
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,618
What am I going to do there?

826
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,996
(breathes heavily)
Well, obviously, I'm just lying down.

827
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,665
Tak. I really miss you.

828
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:48,876
What's wrong with you?

829
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:49,793
(scoffs)

830
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,671
Hi, Brother.

831
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,381
(Tak sighs)

832
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,799
Did you have to dress like that?

833
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,927
Girls love guys in uniform.

834
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:02,348
It's the symbol of
trust, responsibility, and masculinity.

835
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,892
It's been scientifically proven too.

836
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,102
See?

837
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,147
To be honest, this is super embarrassing.

838
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,066
Hey, I told you to stay away from him.

839
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,401
Hey, Kim Tak. That's mean.

840
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,320
I was going to set you up with someone too
if this goes well.

841
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,072
Not interested. Have fun.

842
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,700
This is killing me.
(sighs)

843
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,745
-(cellphone buzzing)
-Hey. They're here. Hang up the phone.

844
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,330
(clears throat)

845
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:28,707
Hello?

846
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,419
(gasps)

847
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,963
TAK: I hope they don't
embarrass themselves.

848
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,342
(gasps)

849
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,307
(exhales sharply)

850
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,726
(uplifting music)

851
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,652
(grunts)

852
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,324
THE 20TH NATIONAL YOUTH JUDO CHAMPIONSHIP
1ST PLACE, KIM TAK

853
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,909
1ST PLACE, SAMJEON HIGH SCHOOL
KIM TAK

854
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,327
CERTIFICATE OF AWARD

855
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,052
TAK: Grandma.

856
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,096
You said you have nightmares sometimes.

857
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,306
I heard it's all
because of the water veins.

858
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:31,019
The house seems all right,
but the store...

859
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,771
Something's off about the store.

860
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,149
(clicks tongue, sighs)

861
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,027
I've been running business here
for 20 years now.

862
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,781
If there was something with the location,
I would've shut down long ago.

863
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,032
Is that so?

864
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:46,952
(clicks tongue)

865
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:47,995
(metal clanks)

866
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,163
(sighs)

867
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,749
TAK: It looks like all the kids are gone.

868
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,084
Let's wrap it up and go home.

869
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,128
What about the leftovers?

870
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,840
I have some regulars
who drop by on their way home.

871
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,594
But I've been away for a while.
Take it easy.

872
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,471
Grandma, what are you doing? Let me do it.

873
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,847
-Come on out.
-What?

874
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,600
-What are you doing? Go get some rest.
-Jeez.

875
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,147
(water running)

876
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,111
How's school?

877
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,739
Is it tough?

878
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,658
TAK: Tough? No.
It's so much easier than judo.

879
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,077
Do you really have to study there?

880
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,370
There you go again.

881
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:34,958
You know what happened to your brother
while studying there.

882
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,586
After both my son
and daughter-in-law passed on...

883
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,504
(somber music)

884
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:42,174
...my two grandsons were my only family.
And now you're the only one left.

885
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:47,387
I can't live anymore if you leave me too.

886
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:54,061
Don't worry!
I'm going to live longer than you.

887
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,646
So don't worry.

888
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,189
(chuckles)

889
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,371
GIRL: What is it?

890
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,124
-What?
-You keep staring at me.

891
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,042
(gasps)

892
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,673
DAEIL: By the way,
did you change your hairstyle?

893
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,051
I thought you had longer hair.

894
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,010
(gasps)
Ahh...

895
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,679
-You mean, my profile picture.
-Yes.

896
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,681
(chuckles)
That's my friend.

897
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,017
-What?
-She was my best friend in middle school.

898
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,394
But then she moved to Australia.

899
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,397
I set her picture on my profile
so I can see her whenever I want.

900
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,899
GIRL: She and the two of us here are like

901
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,359
-three sisters.
-Three sisters.

902
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,360
(girls laughing)

903
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,779
BOTH: Three sisters...
(laughing)

904
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,703
By the way,

905
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,038
you have a very pure soul.

906
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,416
-Pardon?
-Do you perhaps

907
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,627
believe in the supernatural?

908
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:13,390
ARE YOU AFRAID OF DEATH TOO?
THE WAY TO ETERNAL LIFE

909
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,935
All right. I'll be right there. Okay.

910
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,730
Yes. Oh, is that so?

911
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,774
All right. Then I'll hurry and...

912
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,194
(girls giggling)

913
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:27,946
Oh, right.

914
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,949
Our senior urgently needs us. We're sorry.

915
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,910
Sure. We can meet another time.

916
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,786
Well, we should get going now.

917
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,413
-Okay.
-Okay.

918
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,165
-All right.
-GIRL: I'll call you.

919
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,416
Sure.

920
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,002
-Eternal life!
-Reincarnation.

921
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,089
Are you finished?
Yes, I'm at a pharmacy nearby.

922
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,467
I paid the bill, so you can just come out.

923
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,218
Let's go eat something nice.

924
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:51,887
-(Mikang yelps)
-(tire screeches)

925

-(engine revving)
-(lady screaming)

926
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,683
What was that?
(gasping)

927
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,435
-(engine revving)
-(tire screeching)

928
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:02,356
Please, catch him! Oh, no! My bag!

929
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,733

00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,704
Hey! Let me borrow this.

934
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,664
DAEIL: Are you okay?

935
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,415
Hey, where are you going? Seunghyun!

936
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,583
Seunghyun!

937

Whoa! Oh...

-(engine revving)
-(crowd screaming)

942

-ROBBER: Let go!
-(crowd clamoring)

959
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,281
Get off of me!

960
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,076
(grunting)
I said, let go!

961

WOMAN ON CROWD: My goodness.

00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,168
(crowd clamoring)

965
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,546
-Are you okay?
-(groans)

966
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,593
-Hey...
-(whimpers)

967
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,637
-SEUNGHYUN: You're bleeding.
-(Eunkang crying)

968
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,514
Why did you...

969
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,641
(exhales sharply)

970
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,393
You should have given him the purse
when you saw the knife.

971
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,895
You could have hurt yourself.

972
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,523
Whatever. I heard you had a blind date.

973
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,068
-What?
-Daeil told me.

974
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,654
Look at you dressed all nicely.

975
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,656
EUNKANG: Are those new?

976
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,826
No. They're old ones.

977
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,330
Daeil organized it without asking me.
We just had some tea.

978
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,709
By the way, what's with your hair?

979
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,962
Are you going to go to school like that?

980
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,255
Are you really quitting?

981
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,422
Well...

982
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,549
(scoffs)

983
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:17,884
Good thinking.

984
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,388
An overzealous cop like you
would only cause trouble.

985
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,516
For the future of Korean police,
you'd better quit.

986
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,518
Who are you to say I should quit or not?

987
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,812
Besides, the thief was caught
because of me.

988
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,981
I ran at him
because I didn't think it through.

989
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,774
If I had, I wouldn't have done that.

990
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,360
This doesn't mean I'm stupid though.

991
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:38,446
I'm actually very intellectual.
I just don't show it.

992
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,199
Well, then...

993
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,869
-stay.
-Of course, I will.

994
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,913
All right. See you next week.

995
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,878
How dare he judge me.

996
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,213
-Excuse me.
-Is there...

997
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,883
-Eunkang!
-Eunkang!

998
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,801
-Hey.
-Are you okay?

999
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,761
Let me see. Are you all right?

1000
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,264
-Did you get hurt?
-No, I'm fine.

1001
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,807
-HEESOOK: Really?
-EUNKANG: I'm fine.

1002
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,684
You scared us...

1003
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,645
Why did you do that?

1004
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,272
(cat meows)

1005
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:13,982
(Yangchul munches)

1006
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,318
(groans)

1007
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:20,822
You should have thought it through.
You could have died.

1008
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,783
When there's a fight on the street,
cops don't come right away.

1009
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:27,662
They come after
everyone is exhausted from fighting.

1010
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:31,458
I didn't know he'd wield a knife.
If I had, I wouldn't have run at him.

1011
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,544
You should be thankful
you didn't hurt yourself.

1012
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,547
My hands shook like crazy
when I got the phone call.

1013
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:39,966
(exclaims)

1014
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,761
I'm going to die if I eat all that shrimp.

1015
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,596
It's all for you.

1016
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,932
I heard you wanted to eat fried shrimp.

1017
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,142
Mom and Dad went to the fish market

1018
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,645
yesterday morning
to make you fried shrimp.

1019
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,687
(clears throat)

1020
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:57,025
But why did you have to buy 100 of them?

1021
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,027
HEESOOK: They only come
in big portions these days.

1022
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,654
Why didn't you tell me about it earlier?

1023
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,656
Because you didn't let us.

1024
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,242
You started grumbling
the moment you arrived.

1025
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,868
Eunkang,

1026
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,038
you used to be this small. And now
you're all grown up, drinking with me.

1027
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,998
-Time sure does fly.
-(Heesook laughs)

1028
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,961
Let me fill your glass. All right.
(exhales)

1029
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,463
-(glass clinks)
-(pouring)

1030
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:19,631
There.

1031
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,091
-EUNKANG: Cheers.
-Everyone, cheers.

1032
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,051
ALL: Cheers.

1033
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,930
-(slurping)
-(all exclaiming)

1034
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,807
EUNKANG: I'm the second daughter.

1035
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,933
It's fried so well.

1036
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,351
(keyboard clacking)

1037
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:32,936
(reflective music)

1038
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,647
My sister has been weak
since she was little,

1039
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,732
so many people took good care of her.

1040
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,568
ROCKFOILS

1041
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,153
(rain pattering)

1042
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,991
MAN: All right. Let's go. How was school?

1043
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,451
(indistinct chattering)

1044
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,621
WOMAN 2: Come on. Hurry.

1045
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,665
EUNKANG: On rainy days,
my mom would take an umbrella

1046
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,583
and only go to my sister's school.

1047
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:02,465
That's why I spent
my entire childhood struggling.

1048
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,176
-YOUNG EUNKANG: Give it!
-YOUNG MIKANG: Let go! What are you doing?

1049
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,678
Give it to me!

1050
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,138
-Let go!
-Give it to me!

1051
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,682
Gosh! I told you
you'll get yours next year.

1052
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,726
No! I want a new one too!

1053
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,894
Come on! Give it to me!

1054
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,021
Come on! Give it!

1055
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,356
HEESOOK: Mikang, hurry and go to school.
Come on. Hurry.

1056
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,191
Hey!
(panting)

1057
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,068
Hey! Put on your shoes!

1058
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,570
-(door shuts)
-(panting)

1059
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:27,073
EUNKANG: I was the only one
who could help me.

1060
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,533
People used to tell me...

1061
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,243
YANGCHUL: I've got
to talk some sense into her.

1062
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,997
If you act like that outside,
you'll be like the ugly duckling.

1063
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,040
(door slams close)

1064
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,586
EUNKANG: And I came to believe it.

1065
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,590
A mean ugly duckling.

1066
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,554
But here, I realized that

1067
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,724
I can encourage and help others too.

1068
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,142
STUDENTS: Ko Eunkang!

1069
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,518
(crowd clamoring)

1070
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,605
EUNKANG: Sometimes, I regret what I did,

1071
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,065
Thank you so much, Miss!

1072
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:03,151
...but then hearing "Thank you"
makes me feel good again.

1073
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,194
It was nothing.

1074
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,613
(whimpering)
Seriously, thank you so much.

1075
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,655
EUNKANG: I came to think...

1076
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:12,619
(breathes heavily)
I might actually be a pretty good person

1077
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,830
who can offer help to those who need me.

1078
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,837
Now that I think about it,
I have never deeply thought

1079
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:27,133
about what kind of person I am
or what kind of person I want to be.

1080
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:31,388
All my life, I've just been struggling
not to be left behind.

1081
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,934
So, I'd like to think about it
from now on.

1082
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,479
My future is like a blank page.

1083
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,816
And I'd like to plan it here.

1084
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,360
PROFESSOR CHA YUGON
KO EUNKANG

1085
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,821
-ARI: Hey, wait.
-BUMJU: Wait.

1086
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,781
BUMJU: What's that?

1087
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,449
SEUNGHYUN: Let's just eat.

1088
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,452
-Can't we start?
-We've only been here for a month,

1089
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,204
but this place already feels like home,
doesn't it?

1090
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,498
Right, I felt awkward at home
with nothing to do.

1091
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,999
I thought you were busy

1092
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,210
with the blind date.

1093
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,630
Shut your mouth. Stop talking about it.
It's really annoying.

1094
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,548
Come on.

1095
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,802
Ever seen anyone who puts
their friend's picture on their profile?

1096
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,637
That was unbelievable.

1097
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,140
-DAEIL: Friend's picture as a profile...
-ARI: Eunkang!

1098
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,057
Eunkang?

1099
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,684
-ARI: Eunkang!
-DAEIL: It's so...

1100
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,852
ARI: Come join us.

1101
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,522
-BUMJU: Huh?
-ARI: Come on. Hurry.

1102
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,606
ARI: Come have some food.

1103
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,901
(Eunkang gasping)
What is all this?

1104
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,695
ARI: It's a buffet.

1105
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,572
This is the chicken skewer I bought.

1106
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,615
Everyone living in Daechi-dong knows this.

1107
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,201
And these are croquettes
and twisted doughnuts Bumju brought.

1108
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,203
Apparently they're
the most famous bakery in Daejeon.

1109
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,831
And this is spicy glass noodles
that Tak brought.

1110
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,499
Let's eat!

1111
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,043
DAEIL: Wait, is this the food
from the variety show?

1112
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,795
-DAEIL: Are you sure?
-TAK: Just eat.

1113
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,298
I... almost missed the train
because I had to stop by the market.

1114
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,800
Is that so? Thanks, man.

1115
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,510
You know what? Forget it.
Stop eating that. Give it.

1116
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,762
BUMJU: Come on. Stop it.

1117
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:55,722
ARI: Do you like it?

1118
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,056
My gosh.

1119
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,475
-Wait.
-What?

1120
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,018
Where's Juyoung?

1121
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,812
ARI: I wonder what she'll bring
from Jeolla Province.

1122
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,522
Fermented skate. With pork and kimchi.

1123
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,566
-ARI: No way.
-Beef pancakes.

1124
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,775
SEUNGHYUN: Maybe she'll bring
some beef pancakes.

1125
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,736
She asked us if we liked beef pancakes
before she left.

1126
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,030
You must be right. I love beef pancakes.

1127
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,072
GROUP: Mmm...

1128
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,742
-Hi, guys!
-ARI: Ms. Woo!

1129
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,661
-GROUP: Ms. Woo!
-DAEIL: Welcome back, Ms. Woo!

1130
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,663
-ARI: Take that.
-JUYOUNG: Oh, boy.

1131
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:23,374
Man, I can't feel my arms.
(clears throat)

1132
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,251
ARI: What's this? What did you bring?

1133
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,046
Well, I can't come back from my hometown
empty-handed.

1134
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,673
-DAEIL: Gosh, you didn't need to though.
-ARI: What is it?

1135
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,053
What is this?

1136
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,221
Custard cream bread.

1137
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,682
JUYOUNG: This is super popular
in my neighborhood these days.

1138
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,977
It's not too sweet,
and it just melts in your mouth.

1139
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,479
Come on. Try it. Take one.

1140
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,234
Are you surprised? Try it.
You're going to be surprised even more.

1141
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,986
Here's one for you, Ari. Try it.

1142
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,155
Eat up.

1143
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,741
Maybe we should try it later.

1144
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,202
-BUMJU: Beef pancakes...
-You don't want to try it?

1145
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,245
Let's eat.

1146
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,705
-I'm full.
-ARI: Come on. Try one.

1147
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,958
-If you don't want to, you don't have to.
-It's tasty.

1148
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,502
-It's tasty.
-I told you it's good.

1149
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,879
-It's super popular in my town.
-It's really good.

1150
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,005
-JUYOUNG: It's good, right?
-BUMJU: Does it taste good?

1151
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,048
ARI: Yes.

1152
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,052
BUMJU: It's tasty.

1153
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,137
(Ari laughs)

1154
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,390
-JUYOUNG: I told you it's good.
-ARI: It's good.

1155
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,475
JUYOUNG: See? I told you.

1156
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,977
DAEIL: You should have some too.

1157
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,853
JUYOUNG: I'll give the leftovers
to Daeil.

1158
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:26,813
DAEIL: What?

1159
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,064
ARI: Good for you.
(chuckles)

1160
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,149
-BUMJU: Daeil, eat up.
-DAEIL: Thank you.

1161
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,026
JUYOUNG: It just melts
in your mouth, right?

1162
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,403
-ARI: It's gone.
-BUMJU: Seriously.

1163
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,904
BUMJU: The custard cream is so good.

1164
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,994
(clears throat)

1165
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,620
Did you have dinner?

1166
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,748
It's for you. I thought you wouldn't
come down to join us.

1167
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,001
I'm good. I ate at the cafeteria earlier.

1168
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,295
You can at least try it.

1169
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,508
(door opens)

1170
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,260
(door closes)

1171
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:05,059
EUNKANG: I thought I wouldn't be able
to say it if I don't say it now.

1172
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,605
Gosh.

1173
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,233
(sentimental music)

1174
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,028
As a matter of fact,

1175
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,864
I came here because I like you.

1176
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,200
-What?
-Isn't that funny?

1177
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:25,955
Who goes to college
because of a crush? It's stupid.

1178
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,415
(chuckles)

1179
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,796
Then I learned that
you and Sunyu were going out.

1180
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,423
It was so shocking.

1181
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,801
I couldn't look at your face

1182
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,261
and I didn't want to be here.

1183
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:44,307
Because I didn't come here
to become a cop.

1184
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,694
But it's okay now.

1185
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:01,741
I like my colleagues
and school life here isn't that bad.

1186
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,951
I'm getting scolded every day though.
(chuckles)

1187
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,496
So don't worry about me.

1188
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,500
Well, I guess
you've never worried about me though.

1189
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,001
I'm just moving on from you.

1190
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,962
I thought I had to tell you this.

1191
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,807
That's all I wanted to say.
I'll get going now.

1192
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,729
Eunkang.

1193
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:42,490
(chuckles softly)

1194
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,667
(birds chirping)

1195
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,545
(closing theme music)
