1
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,170
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,338
(emotive music)

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,342
-Please don't be mad.
-Whatever.

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:10,969
(sniffles)

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,138
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:15,974
(whimsical music)

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,935
Gosh. Kids these days...

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,771
I'm so jealous.

9
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,734
JUYOUNG: Hey, what are you doing?

10
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,695
(sucks teeth)
That's practically criminal now.

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,280
-Hold on.
-Hmm?

12
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,199
-Whoa. Hey.
-(Daeil exclaiming)

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,837
EUNKANG: This is so annoying.
(sobs)

14
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:46,796
(sniffles)

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,423
(blows nose)

16
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,849
What are you doing?
(chuckles)

17
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,767
What's that?

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,560
-(exclaiming)
-(laughing)

19
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,937
-(chuckles)
-You're so annoying!

20
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,939
You laughed.
(sniffs)

21
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,357
Aren't you hungry?

22
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,193
We haven't had lunch yet.

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,986
I'll go get something.

24
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,072
I'll go with you.

25
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,616
-Why won't this work?
-Hold on.

26
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,745
Okay, let's go.

27
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,085
Wait. Juyoung called me.

28
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,464
-Huh?
-(exclaims)

29
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,260
EUNKANG

30
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,222
She won't pick up the phone.
Did something happen to her?

31
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,139
EPISODE 10

32
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,974
-I wonder if she found the fraudster.
-What?

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,727
SEUNGHYUN: I talked to Daeil
on the phone yesterday,

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,897
and he said he's going to Cheongu
to find the guy who scammed Juyoung.

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,566
She asked Daeil and Bumju to go with her.

36
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,276
(snickers)
He sounded so exhausted.

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,194
Uh...

38
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,947
EUNKANG: I see. I should call her
after having lunch.

39
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,617
(Eunkang gasps)
Wait. We're in Cheongu now.

40
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,245
Do you think we might run into them here?

41
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,163
Come on. It's not like we're on a sitcom.

42
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,206
Right?

43
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,499
(chuckles)

44
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,416
JUYOUNG: Eunkang.

45
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,878
(stammering)
Juyoung.

46
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,548
What's going on?

47
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,716
Why are you coming out of that truck?

48
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,846
And you weren't answering your phone.

49
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,056
JUYOUNG: You guys...

50
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,727
Thank you, guys.

51
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,522
You drove all the way here to help me?

52
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,025
You guys are true friends.
This is true friendship.

53
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,236
My. I really had no idea.

54
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,572
I was a little upset
because you ignored my calls.

55
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,323
-What?
-(chuckles awkwardly)

56
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:43,371
No way. I would never do that. Never.
I was just so busy driving here.

57
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,123
-Seunghyun told me all about it.
-(chuckles awkwardly)

58
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,917
I tried my best to come here.
I hope we're not late.

59
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,711
DAEIL: Yes, you are.

60
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,505
-We already found him.
-You caught him?

61
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,966
Yes, about 50%.

62
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,802
We've confirmed
the package was sent from here.

63
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,761
And...

64
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,805
We're now on a stakeout.

65
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,143
By the way, how did you know we were here?

66
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,896
What? Did you call them?

67
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,147
BOTH: No.

68
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,320
-We were just passing by and saw you...
-We wanted to buy something...

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,364
Wait a minute.

70
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,035
Your statements don't match.

71
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,371
What's going on here?
I smell something fishy.

72
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,331
(Daeil sniffs)

73
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,085
-I don't smell anything.
-We thought we could buy something

74
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,546
-Yes. We've been looking for you.
-Right.

75
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,716
-EUNKANG: What are you talking about?
-We might've gotten something to eat.

76
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,218
Hey, look.

77
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,471
(upbeat suspenseful music)

78
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,604
-It's him.
-Him?

79
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,439
-Hey.
-DAEIL: All right, guys!

80
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,359
Come on. Come closer. Let's take a selfie.

81
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,777
-BUMJU: All right.
-Here we go.

82
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,153
SEUNGHYUN: The weather's so great.

83
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,031
-All right. One, two...
-Three...

84
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,960
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Please put the package on the scale.

85
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,346
It's empty.

86
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,890
I really wished I was wrong.

87
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,018
-Who are you?
-Who's getting an empty box this time?

88
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,062
You're Lee Sehyun, right?

89
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,856
(gasps)
Damn it.

90
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,233
EUNKANG: You're not going anywhere.

91
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,609
(grunts)

92
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,915
(theme music)

93
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,383
SEHYUN: Fraud? I don't know
what you're talking about.

94
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,428
JUYOUNG: Wow.
You have no shame, don't you?

95
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,680
Look.

96
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,681
(suspenseful music)

97
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,976
JUYOUNG: Hello. I saw on Second-hand City
that you're selling PC Four Pro

98
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,477
at 450,000 won.

99
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,770
Can I get a discount?

100
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,690
SEHYUN: I'm sorry. It's a brand-new one,
only unsealed.

101
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,777
JUYOUNG: I see. Could you send it today
if I wire the money now?

102
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,695
SEHYUN: Yes.

103
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,071
JUYOUNG: Tell me your bank account number.

104
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:27,201
SEHYUN: Baekil Bank, 6787-9876-33.
Lee Sehyun.

105
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,330
See? This is the account number
you sent me.

106
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,831
No, I didn't get the money.

107
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,959
-The bank account isn't mine.
-What are you talking about?

108
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,671
He said he'd deduct my debt
by 500,000 won each month

109
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,549
if I let him use my bank account.
And that's all I did.

110
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,968
I didn't even know
it was used for scamming.

111
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,679
Then what are those?

112
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,557
-You knew they were empty.
-Well...

113
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,602
I paid back all three million won,

114
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,188
but they said they wouldn't give me
the bank account back

115
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,981
until I send a thousand packages.

116
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,025
SEHYUN: That's why I was doing this.
(breathing heavily)

117
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,109
Please believe me.

118
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,862
(somber music)

119
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,866
JANGGU: Well done. Now 825 left.

120
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,620
You have 15 packages to send today.
You'd better hurry. Did you send them?

121
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,789
Why aren't you answering?
You must have a death wish.

122
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,416
-SEHYUN: I want to quit.
-JANGGU: Have you lost your mind?

123
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,004
Hey, this is...

124
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,006
He's a scary guy.

125
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,345
SEHYUN: He sends me those pictures
whenever I say I want to quit.

126
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,349
-What in the...
-JUYOUNG: Who is this guy?

127
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,601
Who made you do this?

128
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,437
You'll have to tell the truth anyway
once you're taken to the cops.

129
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,440
No! Then he will really kill me.
(breathing heavily)

130
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,358
(suspenseful music)

131
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,609
SEHYUN: I'm sorry.

132
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,735
I'm so sorry.

133
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,030
I'll give you the money for the console
and I will never do this again.

134
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,698
Please don't call the police.

135
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,666
Well, he admits his fault,
we got his apology,

136
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,585
and he's giving us the money back,
so let's just wrap it up here.

137
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,837
No way.

138
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,881
If you think about it, he's a victim too.

139
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,883
What's the point of
taking the money from this kid?

140
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,301
He's not the bad guy.

141
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,387
What else can we do? Catch the guy?

142
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,266
Sehyun, listen to me.

143
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,562
We won't report you to the police.

144
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,441
But I want you to tell us
where this guy is.

145
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,900
-What?
-DAEIL: Why?

146
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,778
Let's not make this
into a bigger problem, Eunkang.

147
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,822
Guys, stop her. Bumju, Juyoung.

148
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,782
I agree with Eunkang.

149
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,285
If we're getting the money back,
it has to be from him.

150
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,414
I'm pretty sure this boy is
not the only one he's bullying.

151
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,748
Or I'll eat my hat.

152
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,375
DAEIL: Guys. What's wrong with you?

153
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,044
Are you going to stay here
the whole night? What about school?

154
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,754
Think about it.

155
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,258
Do you think he'll let you go
when you're done sending 1,000 packages?

156
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,635
EUNKANG: I don't think so.

157
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,515
Who knows what he'll do in your name
after you send all the packages?

158
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,436
This is the best time to catch him
and put a stop to this.

159
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,439
What if he gets revenge on me?

160
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,360
EUNKANG: You can rely on us.

161
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,862
We'll turn him over to the police

162
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,573
and you'll be safe. We promise.

163
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,918
SEHYUNG: Janggu said

164
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,547
I should get him a friend's bank account
if I want to get out of this.

165
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,258
If I tell him
I have a bank account to hand over,

166
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,260
he'll probably want to meet me.

167
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,014
(cellphone buzzing)

168
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,433
Hi, Janggu.

169
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,227
Hey!

170
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,021
(whimsical music)

171
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,274
Well...

172
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,448
Hey, Miseon. Have you eaten yet?

173
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,325
(no audible dialogue)

174
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,743
You know...

175
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,663
Food...

176
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,001
You're Bumjin, right?

177
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,962
-It's been a long time.
-Hey.

178
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:06,879
(laughs awkwardly)

179
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,805
Miseon, I've got to go.

180
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,265
-Hey.
-Go!

181
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,141
(thrilling music)

182
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,784
(thrilling music continues)

183
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,888
(Bumju sighs)

184
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,015
SEUNGHYUN: Where did he go?

185
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,350
I don't know. Somewhere that way.

186
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,227
(sighs)

187
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,942
What happened?

188
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,152
What happened?

189
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,030
(all panting)

190
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,032
(clicks tongue)

191
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,908
(Daeil pants)

192
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,578
Could you call Sehyun?

193
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,833
-(pants)
-(phone line ringing)

194
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,877
-(phone line ringing)
-(gasps)

195
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,047
(somber music)

196
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,257
-He won't answer.
-Darn it.

197
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,137
BUMJU: Where are you going?

198
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,389
-Hey.
-Darn it.

199
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,433
-Let's go.
-(grunts)

200
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,731
(foreboding music)

201
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,581
STUDENT DRIVER

202
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,209
OPERATOR:
The phone is turned off. Please...

203
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,462
-Is it still turned off?
-Yes.

204
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,048
Do you think something bad
might have happened to him?

205
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,216
Don't worry.

206
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,094
He won't even come near
Sehyun for the time being.

207
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,430
We even sent him a text
that we'd report this to the police.

208
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,599
If he seems to be up to something,
we'll call the cops.

209
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,642
(sighs)

210
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,728
Maybe I shouldn't have asked him
to call Janggu out.

211
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,814
I said I'd catch him but couldn't.

212
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,945
If we hadn't done this,
he wouldn't have stopped bullying Sehyun.

213
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,114
Someone had to help him.

214
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,991
He knew the risk involved too.

215
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,369
-(sighs)
-SEUNGHYUN: Don't worry too much.

216
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,996
(vehicle approaching)

217
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,668
(engine rumbling)

218
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,882
(engine stops)

219
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,436
(door shuts)

220
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,439
Thanks, I know
driving at night isn't easy.

221
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,191
Please thank your father's friend
for the car.

222
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,360
Now go get some sleep. Don't worry.

223
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,529
All right. You too go rest up.

224
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,239
You go first.

225
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,449
You go first.

226
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,118
-I'll go when you go.
-I'm not going until you go.

227
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,661
I'll leave when you go in.

228
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,748
All right, then.

229
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,377
(smooches)

230
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,464
(romantic music)

231
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,691
(bag thuds)

232
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,156
Mikang.

233
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,574
(dogs barking in distance)

234
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,700
Hello.

235
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,494
Keep doing...
(chuckling)

236
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,495
(whimsical music)

237
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,289
...what you were doing.

238
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,213
(gate clanks open)

239
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,091
(gate closes)

240
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,052
(whispers)
Go ahead.

241
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,595
-(Seunghyun clears throat)
-(mumbling)

242
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,683
-EUNKANG: This is so embarrassing.
-(breathes deeply)

243
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,393
(chuckling)

244
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,896
-Sorry. I'll go then. Bye.
-(exclaiming)

245
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,607
Bye. Good night.
(chuckling)

246
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:38,943
(Eunkang shrieking)

247
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,403
RESEARCH & LECTURE BUILDING

248
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,198
That's it for today and this semester.

249
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,158
I appreciate your hard work
during the semester.

250
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,953
Field training at patrol divisions
starts next week, right?

251
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,204
STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

252
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,414
I'm sure you know
how to use the basic equipment

253
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,208
like radios, handcuffs, and tasers.

254
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,835
YUGON: Though it's just
a two-week training,

255
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,003
I hope you learn things
you can't from classes.

256
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,047
Especially the ones
going to the red light district

257
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,174
should be careful of drunks
when on night patrol.

258
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,884
STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

259
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,555
In case you forgot, what is
the most important thing during training?

260
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,891
"Always say hello. Then you're half done."

261
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,601
(class laughing)

262
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,687
"Always say hello. Then you're half done."

263
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,939
Also, always stay glued to your mentors

264
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,401
and always tell your colleagues
before doing anything.

265
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,443
STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

266
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,444
That'll be all.

267
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,989
STUDENTS: Thank you.
(applauding)

268
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,871
I heard you're doing the training
in your hometown.

269
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,290
Yes. My mom wants me to come down.

270
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,249
What about you?

271
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,252
I'm going to Cheongu.
Looks like I was fated with that city.

272
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,420
What a coincidence.

273
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,382
Right. Have you heard from Sehyun yet?

274
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,760
I called him last week,
but his phone was off.

275
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,138
So I just left him a text.

276
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,347
(clicks tongue)

277
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,807
I hope he's all right.

278
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,559
I'm sure he'd call if something's up.

279
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,228
-JUYOUNG: Let's go.
-EUNKANG: My gosh.

280
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,398
Don't worry about me.
And don't forget to take your meds.

281
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,358
Okay. Talk to you later.

282
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:03,986
(phone beeps)

283
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,196
(exhales sharply)

284
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,619
SUEUN PATROL DIVISION, CHEONGU
KO EUNKANG, KIM TAK, WI SEUNGHYUN

285
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,080
We're going to the same division.

286
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,958
It won't be boring at least.

287
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,085
TAK: Hey, look.
Eunkang is in our group too.

288
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,545
Oh, really?

289
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,464
How is it going?

290
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,718
-Since when?
-I don't know. Let's go eat.

291
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,553
Let's go.
(chuckling)

292
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,598
(quirky music)

293
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,851
-You scared me.
-I heard about it.

294
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,686
What?

295
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,314
You guys...

296
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,066
are in trouble.

297
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,783
You're going to Sueun Patrol Division.

298
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,826
You're going to Sueun Patrol Division.

299
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,870
What about it?

300
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,497
I heard it's the worst one.

301
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,082
DAEIL: It's the worst.

302
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,417
POLICE

303
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,794
STUDENTS: Hello.

304
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,337
This is Sergeant Park.

305
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,089
I'll do my best, sir.

306
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,131
Welcome.

307
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,386
And Mr. Kim Tak's mentor is Lieutenant Oh.

308
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,680
-Hello, ma'am.
-Nice to meet you.

309
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,016
CHIEF OF PATROL: Lieutenant Oh,
you're a KNPU graduate, right?

310
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,477
-CHIEF OF PATROL: Which class was it?
-The 35th, sir.

311
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:23,107
Our trainees are in the 47th.
They're so much younger than you.

312
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,150
-CHIEF OF PATROL: Anyway, be nice to them.
-LT. OH: Yes, sir.

313
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,779
BUMJU: I heard from a senior
who went there last year

314
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,906
that one of the mentors there
was really cocky.

315
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,992
CHIEF OF PATROL:
Ms. Ko Eunkang's mentor...

316
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,829
is Lieutenant Jin, right?

317
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:41,458
BUMJU: He treats trainees like dirt
and nitpicks at every tiny mistake.

318
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,296
I'll do my best, sir.

319
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,053
In the morning, we go on patrol
around the neighborhood,

320
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,264
mainly around the banks and big hospitals.

321
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,350
And in the afternoon, we check
the reported cases or go out to the field.

322
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,393
I see.

323
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,770
Then what are we doing today?

324
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,647
We're leaving in five minutes.

325
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,773
-Please get ready.
-Okay.

326
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,942
-I'm going to use the restroom.
-Yes, sir.

327
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,654
LT. JIN: It's so hot this morning.

328
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,031
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?
INFORMATION

329
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,115
(sipping)

330
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,368
-LT. JIN: Are you going out like that?
-Pardon?

331
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,120
I said, are you going out like that?

332
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,663
Uh...

333
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:20,998
(chuckles awkwardly)

334
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,293
Where is the equipment?

335
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,213
Oh...
(chuckles awkwardly)

336
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,257
LT. JIN: Hey, take this.

337
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,009
It's car number 11.

338
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,846
EUNKANG: Does this mean
he wants me to drive?

339
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,140
(groans)

340
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,184
I don't have a driver's license yet...

341
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,560
Who told you to drive?

342
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,605
Go and turn on the air conditioner.

343
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,398
Oh, the air conditioner.
(chuckles awkwardly)

344
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:47,900
Yes, sir.

345
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,569
And bring the equipment.

346
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,784
CONSTABLE LEE: Then are you commuting
from school every day?

347
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,701
Yes.

348
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,663
Wow. That's at least two hours
back and forth.

349
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,582
It must be tough, Lieutenant Ko.

350
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,583
(chuckles)

351
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,836
Lieutenant? She's just a trainee.

352
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,506
But she'll be a lieutenant
once she graduates.

353
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,174
LT. JIN: Now everyone is a Lieutenant.
(chuckling)

354
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,803
Without actual field experience,
you can't do the desk job either.

355
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,347
You can hardly stay out of trouble.

356
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,517
EUNKANG: Is he saying that to me?

357
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,478
BUMJU: I heard
you should never challenge him.

358
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,272
If you do,
then your grade is immediately a C.

359
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,694
I'll do my best to learn
so I don't make any trouble.

360
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,321
So please teach me lots, sir.

361
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,406
-LT. JIN: What should we eat for lunch?
-CONSTABLE LEE: What?

362
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,243
Oh, well...

363
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,953
It's hot today,

364
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,705
so why don't we have some cold noodles...

365
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,082
Let's go eat sundae soup.

366
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,086
I guess sundae soup is a better idea.
Beat the heat with heat.

367
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,045
(chuckles awkwardly)

368
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,720
PLEASE KEEP THE TOILET CLEAN
NO SMOKING

369
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,605
EUNKANG: He's so bossy.

370
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,649
SEUNGHYUN: Cheer up.

371
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,028
-Is everything okay?
-Yes, sir.

372
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,905
Don't use too much bleach.

373
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,283
-The smell makes you feel dizzy.
-I'm okay, sir.

374
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,243
-It makes us feel dizzy.
-Ahh...

375
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,870
Okay.

376
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,371
When I was a constable,

377
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,999
I bought an eco-friendly detergent
with my own money.

378
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,460
-Keep it up.
-SEUNGHYUN: Thank you, sir.

379
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:36,258
Right. Don't forget to wash
the patrol car when you're done. Okay?

380
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,718
-Yes, sir.
-Good luck then.

381
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,147
BLEACH, ECO-FRIENDLY DETERGENT

382
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,949
Uh... my friend said he needed one.

383
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,826
And since I was here...

384
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,336
TAK: I'll pay for this separately.

385
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,505
It's okay. It's a work expense.

386
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,300
Excuse me. We'd like to pay.

387
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,343
Sure.

388
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,684
Thank you, ma'am.

389
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,438
OLD LADY: My gosh, Hyun!

390
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,399
(gasps)
My baby! Where have you been?

391
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,610
I've been looking for you.

392
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,071
-My gosh.
-Hey. He's not your grandson.

393
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,239
Put your hands away.

394
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,866
Yes, he is! He's my Hyun. Right?

395
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,952
STORE OWNER: Gosh. No, he isn't.

396
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,828
She's in her dotage.

397
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,082
She's usually okay,
but she's like this every now and then.

398
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,416
-OLD LADY: Hyun...
-STORE OWNER: It's getting worse...

399
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,919
-...since her grandson ran away.
-You haven't eaten yet, have you?

400
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,171
Let's go. Come on.

401
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,091
Ma'am, where do you live?

402
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,884
(somber music)

403
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,639
(old lady grunts)

404
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,646
OLD LADY: You must've been shocked.

405
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,190
I can be really forgetful sometimes.

406
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,942
TAK: It's okay, ma'am.

407
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,569
STORE OWNER: Her grandson
is a pain in the neck.

408
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,657
He always asks her for money,
saying he's going to auditions.

409
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,325
He doesn't even go to school.

410
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,119
OLD LADY: Gosh. It's really hot.

411
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,121
Thank you.

412
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,166
LT. OH: Do you live
with just your grandson?

413
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,254
When did he leave the house?

414
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,257
It's been almost a month now.

415
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,509
Did you call the police?

416
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,178
He said I shouldn't.

417
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,140
Did he call you?

418
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,642
He texts me from time to time.

419
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,895
But I have horrible dreams these days.

420
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,982
Whenever I call him, his phone is off.

421
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,026
Can I see your phone?

422
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,617
GRANDMA, I'M DOING FINE.
DON'T CALL THE POLICE.

423
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,328
I'LL MAKE MONEY AND COME BACK SOON

424
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,912
I guess he's not missing then.

425
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,296
Don't worry.

426
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,632
If he doesn't text you
for more than a week, please call me.

427
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,676
-I'll give you my number.
-Okay.

428
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,392
LT. OH: Gosh, it's okay, ma'am.

429
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,979
Please take it.
I didn't even give you a glass of water.

430
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,689
Come on. Take it.

431
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,316
You really don't have to.

432
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,234
LT. OH: Thank you, ma'am.

433
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,778
Okay.

434
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,821
-Thank you.
-No problem.

435
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,452
-Bye.
-Bye.

436
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,162
OLD LADY: Have a safe trip back.

437
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,297
JANGGU: "Grandma.

438
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,256
(keyboard clacking)

439
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,552
I'm doing fine.

440
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,602
Don't skip meals."

441
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,062
(laughing)

442
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,111
Hurry up!

443
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,904
KANG MINSEOK, LEE SEHYUN, PARK EUNHYUNG

444
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,658
You can't go to bed
until you meet today's quota.

445
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,497
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

446
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,667
EUNKANG: It's only been three days,
but it feels like thirty.

447
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,002
Gosh. I'm already exhausted.

448
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,382
The dog days are coming soon.
Maybe we should go eat some chicken stew.

449
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,427
That's not going to solve anything.

450
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,095
Hey, look.

451
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,889
Where do you look when told
to look at the rear of a car?

452
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,683
Rear of the car?

453
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,310
-SEUNGHYUN: The trunk? The license plate?
-EUNKANG: Right?

454
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,313
See? I'm not the only one. Gosh!

455
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,525
Driver's license, please.

456
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,027
Thank you.

457
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,405
Watch the rear.

458
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,499
What are you doing? I said to look
if cars are coming from the rear.

459
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,878
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

460
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,920
I'm sorry, sir.

461
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,046
Geez.

462
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,424
All right. Thank you.

463
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,178
(laughing)

464
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,679
I'm serious.

465
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,139
Right. Sorry.
(chuckling)

466
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,266
You should've been careful.

467
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,310
He could've gotten into an accident.

468
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,686
I know I made a mistake.

469
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,231
But he's supposed to teach me
before scolding me.

470
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,025
That's only fair.

471
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,860
And he never says hello back to me.

472
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,362
It's not like I wanted to be his mentee.

473
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,074
I've got to do something about this.

474
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,369
Maybe I should have a fight with him.
Do you want to change your mentor?

475
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,246
As if you have the power to.

476
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,332
You're cleaning the restroom every day.

477
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,209
(chuckles softly)

478
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,461
(scoffs, sucks teeth)

479
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,545
(romantic music)

480
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,006
(both chuckle)

481
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,468
(both laughing)

482
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,805
EUNKANG: Hey, what are you doing
this weekend?

483
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,391
SEUNGHYUN: Spending time
with you, obviously.

484
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,893
-(chuckles)
-SEUNGHYUN: Why?

485
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,896
EUNKANG: Well, I thought
I could treat you to dinner.

486
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,981
BE A WARNING TO THE PEOPLE

487
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,860
EUNKANG: Ta-da!

488
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,404
-Wow. You finally got it.
-(chuckles)

489
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,989
I can officially drive now.

490
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,950
I passed the exam on my first try.

491
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,286
It was not easy, but I did it!

492
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,413
It's all thanks to your great teacher.

493
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,208
Whoever your teacher was,
he must've taught you well.

494
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,251
Gosh.

495
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,920
SEUNGHYUN: Wait. Is this photoshopped?

496
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,838
EUNKANG: Give it back.

497
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,298
Give it.

498
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,093
(Seunghyun chuckles)

499
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,929
Are you mad?

500
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,557
I was just kidding.

501
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,768
(smooches)

502
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,062
(giggles)

503
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,439
That's for helping me get the license.
I'm in a good mood.

504
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,235
EUNKANG: No one's here. I checked.

505
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,155
SEUNGHYUN: You know
we're in school, right?

506
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,700
Do you need any other licenses?

507
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,326
It doesn't hurt to have more licenses.

508

KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

509
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,547
(munches)

510
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,215
It's really sweet.

511
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,761
Has the plum lady heard
from her grandson yet?

512
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:42,267
She said he ran away from home before too,
but never had his phone turned off.

513
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,353
But this time, his phone is off.
So she's really worried.

514
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,105
(munches)

515
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,192
Right. Speaking of which...

516
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,485
(munching)

517
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,614
...let me know if you see this boy
while you're on patrol.

518
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,699
(munches)

519
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,994
(ominous music)

520
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,205
Where did you get this photo?

521
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,291
(munches)
From the plum lady's house.

522
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,961
TAK: Is he your grandson?

523
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,212
Yes.

524
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,304
We'll call you if we see
anyone who looks like him.

525
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,223
Sehyun, I mean...

526
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,269
-When did you say her grandson left again?
-About a month ago.

527
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,189
Maybe he didn't go home that day.

528
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,231
(suspenseful music)

529
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,400
-SEHYUN: He's a scary guy.
-Hey!

530
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,611
SEHYUN: He sends me those pictures.

531
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,571
What if he gets revenge on me?

532
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,241
EUNKANG: Tak, where does she live?

533
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:45,413
-(clacks)
-(doorbell chimes)

534
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,377
Ma'am, are you in there?

535
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,173
Ma'am, are you home?

536
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,718
-(clacks)
-(doorbell chimes)

537
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,056
(cellphone buzzing)

538
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,561
CONSTABLE LEE: Are you outside?

539
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,689
You know we go on patrol at two, right?

540
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,982
EUNKANG: Yes, I'm on my way back.

541
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,484
(suspenseful music continues)

542
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,073
GEUMEUN JEWELRY

543
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:32,836
Hello.

544
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,177
So what are you investigating?

545
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,137
What?

546
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,141
Right. Someone reported that
there were suspicious people around here,

547
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,892
-so we're investigating the area.
-I see.

548
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:52,397
Is this related to gangs
or a serial murderer?

549
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,149
-Maybe.
-Oh, no.

550
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,528
But I'm not sure if we still have
footage from a month ago.

551
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,739
(clicking)

552
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,200
There he is.

553
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,129
CONSTABLE LEE OF SUEUN PATROL DIVISION

554
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,257
-(cellphone buzzing)
-(phone beeps)

555
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,717
Yes, Constable Lee.

556
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,303
CONSTABLE LEE: Aren't you coming back?
It's almost two.

557
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,721
(clock ticking)

558
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,641
I'll be right there, sir.

559
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,018
Okay.

560
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,104
LT. JIN: What is wrong with you?

561
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,316
Do you think you're here to play?

562
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,568
What have you been doing until now?

563
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,613
-I'm sorry. I forgot...
-LT. JIN: "Forgot"?

564
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,490
What a great excuse you've got.

565
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,658
You have a lousy mindset!

566
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,205
You think you're too great
to do the stupid patrolling, don't you?

567
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,749
No, sir. That's not true.

568
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:53,792
The truth is...

569
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,629
If you're slow, work hard at least.

570
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,215
I can't believe
we have such a stupid trainee.

571
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,843
Move! Get out of my sight.

572
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,971
(phone ringing)

573
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:09,891
(door slams close)

574
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,477
(indistinct chattering)

575
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,243
TAK: Is Eunkang all right?

576
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,703
I heard she got an earful
from Lieutenant Jin yesterday.

577
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,705
She must be feeling awful.

578
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,124
I haven't talked to her either.
(grunts)

579
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,918
I thought she'd like to be alone.

580
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,504
Lieutenant Oh said

581
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,592
that Lieutenant Jin is always mean
to the trainees from our school.

582
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,721
Apparently his former boss
was a KNPU graduate

583
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,683
-and they didn't get along.
-Really?

584
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,353
Hey.

585
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,273
You should tell her
to have a talk with Lieutenant Jin.

586
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,442
Or she'll get an F. That's Lieutenant Jin.

587
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,694
He could actually do that.

588
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,322
We're off today, so maybe
we can talk about it over lunch later.

589
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,615
TAK: That sounds good.

590
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,538
Where are you going?

591
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,040
I'm going to work.

592
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,793
-But today is Sunday.
-I have a lot to do.

593
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,045
I see. Take it easy.

594
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,088
Thanks.

KNPU MALE STAFF: Would this happen
to be Ms. Gi Hanna?

605
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,801
Yes. I am Gi Hanna.

606
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,096
I heard I had a visitor.

607
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,642
Okay. You're that Shasha wench's daughter.

608
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,102
-CREDITOR 2: So that's her?
-CREDITOR 1: Hey. Where's your mother?

609
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,938
-CREDITOR 3: Where's your mom?

-Hey!

612
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,818
Everyone! Please calm down!

doing this here!

616
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,256
Excuse me, listen!

617
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,508
-CREDITOR 3: What is it?
-CREDITOR 2: Who is he?

618
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,635
-CREDITOR 4: Who are you?
-What are you doing? Use your words.

619
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,262
Who are you?
Move! Get out of the way!

620
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,222
I said, move!

621
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,390
-(grunts)
-(creditors clamoring)

622
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,975
-What are you doing?
-Get off of me!

623
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,351
I'm sorry, but I can't.

624
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,853
DAEIL: If you have something to say,
go get visitor permits.

625
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,524
Or I'll report you all...
for illegal trespassing.

626
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,192
What are you waiting for?
Come on and help me!

627
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,860
Hey, get back inside.

628
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,112
Come on. Go.

629
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,029
-Hurry...
-Hey!

630
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,074
-Who are you to say she can go?
-Hey, lady!

631
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,867
(shouting indistinctly)

632
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,619
Hey, she's running away.

633
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,330
-Hey, stop!
-Where are you going?

They're gone. All of them.

00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,233
They won't come back.

652
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,861
I warned them really intimidatingly.

653
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:35,948
I'll go, then.

Wait.

Are you going to tell other kids?

Don't worry.

I won't.

658
00:34:58,888 --> 00:34:59,972

Today is a weekend,

No.

Hello, sir.

(suspenseful music)

677
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,812
You know you usually need
an official document.

678
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,690
Of course I do.
I really appreciate your help, sir.

679
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,406
Wait. Could you show me that again?

SEUNGHYUN: Hey, Hanna.

683
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,463
Is Eunkang in her room?

-She left this morning.
-Where?

00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,008
She's working today. Didn't you know?

686
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,721
Right. I heard
Lieutenant Jin was working today.

687
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,766
I guess she went there
because she felt bad.

688
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,103
She shouldn't have gone
to the plum lady's house.

689
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,814
The plum lady?

690
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,233
The plum lady's grandson.

691
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,821
She went to her house
after seeing the photo of him.

692
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,364
Her grandson?

00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,263
You're looking for Sehyun, aren't you?

700
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,265
I didn't tell you
because I wasn't sure myself.

701
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,891
EUNKANG: I don't have time
to talk about it right now.

702
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,102
I'll send you an address now.

If you have no loyalty,

709
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,539
get your job done at least!

710
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:57,209
You can't even get 50 done

711
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,129
while all the others get 100 done!

712
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,258
I'm sorry. Please spare me.

713
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,432
I'm being generous here,
giving you a second chance. So do well.

714
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,892
I'll do well.

-Okay.
-(Janggu snickering)

No. I was just checking it out.

00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,379
-He's looking for Sehyun.
-Hop in.

810
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,177

828
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,125
We're passing Eulji Park right now.

829
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,128
Yes, Lieutenant Jin.

830
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,007
He didn't get far.

831
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,593
He's near Goeum Intersection on Route 29.

832
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,512

-(breathing heavily)
-(laughing)

844
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:41,942
By the way,
how does Lieutenant Jin know about this?

845
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,068
I reported it to him.

LIEUTENANT JIN OF SUEUN PATROL DIVISION

EUNKANG: Lieutenant Jin, I know
I have let you down in many ways.

848
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,665
But I want you to take a look
at these photos just once.

849
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,507
(phone line ringing)

850
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,968
Ko Eunkang. What are these photos?!

851
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,514
I'm glad things worked out
between you and Lieutenant Jin.

852

-I did?

859
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,785
Oh, no.

860
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,704
(sighs)

861
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,915
Let's focus on catching him for now.

862
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,583
Okay.

863
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,835

00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,921
Open the door.

Grandma.

895
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,040
My baby. You look so skinny.
What happened?

896
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,543
(sobs)
Where did you get all these scars?

897
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,295
OLD LADY: Tell me.

898
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,589
SEHYUN: Grandma.

899
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,424
I'm sorry.

900
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,051
I'll...
(sobs)

901
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,886
I won't upset you anymore.

902

Okay, my baby.

LT. OH: Ma'am.

906
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:07,064
Sehyun has to go now.
He'll be investigated.

907
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,026
OLD LADY: Go.

908
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,695
And come back to me right away.

909
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,739
When you're back,

910
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,450
we'll eat together.

911
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,701
Okay.

914
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,932
Thank you for your help, sir.

915
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,433
Hey.

916
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,394
You should have given me
an official report about it.

917
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:49,314
-You're lucky I saw your text.
-I'm sorry, sir.

918
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,484
And you were snooping around
during patrol hours,

919
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,027
acting on your own.

920
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,988
What did you expect from me, a compliment?

921
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:58,782
No, sir.

922
00:51:58,865 --> 00:51:59,950
Seriously.

923
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,786
I don't like you even to the very end.

-(keyboard clacking)
-(Lt. Jin clicks tongue)

Are you hurt anywhere?

926
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,711
No, sir.

927
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,130
(clears throat)

928
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,383
-I hit a car...
-Oh, come on!

929
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,927
That's so annoying. Geez.

-(Lt. Jin clicks tongue)
-(keyboard clacking)

931
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:22,806
I'm sorry, sir.

932
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,646
-Well, then...
-Hey.

933
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,858
Take this.

934
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,861
My wife said I shouldn't share it
with anyone else, but...

935
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,072
-You don't want it?
-I do, sir.

936
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,991
Thank you, sir.

937
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,577
It's expensive. Don't throw it away.

938
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,830
Man. It's so hot today.

939
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,290
Sir. Can I have one too?

940
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,041
Buy one yourself, you punk.

941
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,668
Come on. That's so unfair.

942
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,919

SOONYOUNG: You did a great job.

949
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:13,607
I heard you got hurt while chasing him.
Are you okay?

950
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,901
Yes, ma'am. I'm all recovered.

951
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,110
I'm all right.

952
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,153
I'm fine too.

953

SOONYOUNG: I'm glad to hear that.

954

Your brave actions
have done our school proud.

YUGON: Not just that.

956
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,121
It looks like they really poured
their blood, sweat, and tears into this.

957

Sueun Patrol Division gave all A's
to our trainees for the first time.

958
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:34,628
There's a strict mentor there
like Professor Bang,

959
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,588
so one of the trainees
always got a low grade.

960
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:41,092
SOONYOUNG: Many officers in the field
have prejudices against our school.

that you managed to win their favor.

Hello?

967
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,739
An interview?

968
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,866
Today?

969
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:08,995
Sure. I have time.
Come to school. We can do it in my office.

YUGON: Okay. Bye.

971
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,959
It must've been an emergency.

972
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,335
(Yugon laughing)

973
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,587
Are you going to be on TV this week?

974
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,214
YUGON: Yes. Tomorrow night.

975
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:22,926
-Are you going to watch?
-No. I want to skip that show.

976
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,052
(whimsical music)

977
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,472
You two really...

978
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,267
have a very good relationship.

979
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,812
Should we give you a "best couple" award?

980
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:35,563
(Soonyoung chuckles)

981
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,149
Right. The Chief of the patrol division

982
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:41,194
sent this incentive
in appreciation of your performance.

983
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:42,779
SOONYOUNG: Take it.

984
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,489
It's okay.

985
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:45,740
You have my permission.

986
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,410
Ms. Kim.

987
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,038
What I get from the networks
for the interview and the consultation

988
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,999
is all donated
to the school development fund.

989
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,794
Maybe we should just donate
this incentive to the fund too.

990
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,297
STUDENTS: Thank you.

991
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,214
(chuckles)

992
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,215
At ease.

993
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:03,967
(Eunkang chuckles)

994
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,056
(Soonyoung laughs)

995
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:13,268
This year's freshmen
are full of surprises.

996
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,563
They're a little mischievous,
but they're creative.

997
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,856
I can see that.

998
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,024
During Cheongram Education,

999
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,151
I was afraid they would
have a hard time settling in,

1000
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:25,071
but it looks like
they're all on the right track now.

1001
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,289
(live music)

1002
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,666
(crowd clamoring)

1003
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,929
(crowd cheering)

1004
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,283
(crowd cheering continues)

1005
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,999
So you're paying for this
with the incentives you got?

1006
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,210
What are you talking about?
We gave that to Sehyun's grandma.

1007
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,545
-We're splitting the bill today.
-Splitting the bill?

1008
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,005
Yes. Let's split the bill.

1009
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,507
-She says we're splitting the bill!
-What?

1010
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,967
-We're splitting the bill today!
-We're splitting the bill?

1011
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,387
Hey, he says
we're splitting the bill today.

1012
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,013
-Hey! That's nonsense!
-What?

1013
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,561
Do you know where the restroom is?

1014
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,230
What?

1015
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,232
Do you know where the restroom is?!

1016
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,401
-I don't know!
-Gosh.

1017
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:48,905
Restroom...

1018
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,542
(smooching)

1019
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,177
(footsteps approaching)

1020
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:12,971
(grunts)

1021
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,224
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
-(woman groaning)

1022
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,143
(ominous music)

1023
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:24,649
(sighs)

1024
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,700
Man. It gives me the creeps.

1025
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,663
What?

1026
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,128
(foreboding music)

1027
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,340
HANSOL: You cockroach.

1028
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,258
(object clatters)

1029
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,801
This should make you feel good.

1030
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,136
(clacking)

1031
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:59,392
(humming)

1032
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,437
(woman moaning)

1033
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,524
You like that, don't you?

1034
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,943
-(woman moaning, breathing heavily)
-How do you feel?

1035
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:10,820
(chuckles)

1036
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,491
(woman breathing heavily)

1037
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,830
(groans)

1038
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,715
Wasn't this what you wanted?

1039
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,636
-(crowd cheering)
-(live music)

1040
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,725
(crowd cheering, shouting indistinctly)

1041
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,603
-SEUNGHYUN: Can I use your phone?
-Why?

1042
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,688
It got switched with someone else's.

1043
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,441
I see.

1044
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,652
(foreboding music)

1045
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,611
Huh?

1046
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,074
How good is it?

1047
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,621
What were you saying before?

1048
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,208
You just leech off of others.

1049
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,753
(phone buzzing)

1050
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,714
EUNKANG

1051
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:18,096
(phone buzzing)

1052
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,269
(crowd cheering)

1053
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,317
Hello?

1054
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,112
(suspenseful music)

1055
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:37,240
(laughing)

1056
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,786
(crowd cheering)

1057
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,042
(upbeat music)
