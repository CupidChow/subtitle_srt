1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:03,086
SEUNGHYUN: Let me fill your glass.

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,964
Hey, drop the formalities.

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,675
Here, you can just call me casually.

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:11,928
SEUNGHYUN: There's nothing more painful
than suspecting a good person.

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,350
But actions speak louder than words.

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,353
Uyong kept texting me
with Promotion Corps stuff.

7
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,148
My phone broke that day,
and I took it to a repair shop.

8
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,692
I got it back last night,
so I didn't see the message.

9
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,986
SEUNGHYUN: If their actions
are suspicious,

10
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,196
you have to check,
no matter how hard it is.

11
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,322
(boys grunting)

12
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,408
SEUNGHYUN: Hey. Stop it.

13
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,744
(bully on video grunting)

14
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,454
I said, stop!

15
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,376
Let's not complicate things, okay?

16
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,839
You know what happens
when a KNPU student beats people.

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,344
(scoffs)

18
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,642
SEUNGHYUN: And when your suspicion
is confirmed,

19
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,062
you have only one option.

20
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,438
I'll take it.

21
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:05,982
The punishment.

22
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,945
And I want you to do the same.

23
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,372
(theme music)

24
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,047
EPISODE 6

25
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,345
(door closes, chimes)

26
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,972
Yes, I'm on my way now.

27
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,266
(chuckles softly)
Yes.

28
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,143
Sorry to keep you waiting.

29
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:43,978
JUYOUNG: Eunkang!

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,565
-Have fun.
-See you later.

31
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,818
(laughs)

32
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:51,986
(grumbles)

33
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,532
(door chimes)

34
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,743
I envy her. He asked her out again.

35
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,786
(chuckles)

36
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,956
What's the big deal? You talk like
you've never been asked out twice.

37
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,591
(in English) Sorry.
(chuckles awkwardly)

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,261
(in Korean) Hey. Did you check
the midterm grades?

39
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,638
-Oh, for God's sake!
-Come on.

40
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,473
So tell me. What grade did you get?

41
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,476
Why would you ask something like that?
It's my privacy.

42
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:24,936
I told you mine.

43
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,605
I didn't ask you. You just told me.

44
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,066
Come on. Then just tell me one thing.

45
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,527
-Are your grades better than Eunkang's?
-(sighs)

46
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,112
Higher or lower? Huh?

47
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,364
You really don't give up.
They're similar. Are you happy now?

48
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,282
Is that so?

49
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,868
Then you're in the seventh group.

50
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,286
Seventh...

51
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,121
KO EUNKANG, WOO JUYOUNG

52
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,790
Wait. Do you know everyone's grades?

53
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,377
Not everyone. Only about half.
(chuckles)

54
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,672
You should know both your enemy
and yourself to survive this jungle.

55
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,799
Oh, that's Semi.
I wonder what grade she got.

56
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,551
ARI: Semi!

57
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,513
(classical music playing)

58
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,525
-Do you like this painting?
-What?

59
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,986
Oh, I just...
(chuckles)

60
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,532
This artist likes to mix
fantasy and reality in one painting.

61
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,161
BLIND DATE GUY: This side is reality while
the other side of the door is the ideal.

62
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,746
The world of fantasy, so to say.

63
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:31,169
The artist likes to draw forests
and common objects like trees and flowers.

64
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,963
It's confusing, isn't it?

65
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,006
(chuckles)

66
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,009
The artist chose to make it abstract
to blur the line

67
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,346
between reality and ideal and eventually
to maximize the dreamy vibe.

68
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,350
(chuckles awkwardly)

69
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,603
They have really good coffee.

70
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,397
I always drink a cup of coffee
after looking at the paintings.

71
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,524
What would you like to drink?

72
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,364
EUNKANG: What? There are so many kinds.

73
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,407
Did you make up your mind?

74
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,369
I...

75
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,204
I'd like to have Americano.

76
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,956
So you like espresso.

77
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,501
But they're famous for their drip coffee,
so you should try one.

78
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,672
Do you like sour and mild-flavored coffee
or heavy, full-bodied coffee?

79
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,718
Well... I'm okay with anything.

80
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,887
-Would you like to try Geisha then?
-Okay. I'll try it.

81
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,932
I'd like to have one Geisha

82
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,434
and one Blue Mountain.

83
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,065
(somber music)

84
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,984
HONORARY COMMITTEE'S OFFICE

85
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,863
HYUNSEOK: You'll get a light punishment,
but your friend will be expelled.

86
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,456
(scoffs)

87
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:07,890
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

88
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,100
(engine rumbling)

89
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,813
(door opens)

90
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,324
-Thank you.
-Get back safely. I'll call you.

91
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,408
Okay.

92
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,626
(engine revving)

93
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,897
-(dogs barking)
-(rustling)

94
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:06,032
SINABEURO
LITTLE BY LITTLE, BEFORE YOU KNOW IT

95
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,200
-Didn't you eat?
-(munching)

96
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,368
What?

97
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,788
I did. I went to a burger restaurant
that was on TV

98
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,582
and had a burger and even fries.
I ate so many calories.

99
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,463
(fizzes)

100
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:21,881
SEUNGHYUN: Then...

101
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,926
why are you eating
like you haven't eaten anything?

102
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,887
Right. I'm not sure. I'm hungry.

103
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,472
(slurps)

104
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,182
(exhales)

105
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,227
So...

106
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,229
-did you have fun?
-Fun?

107
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,193
It was informative.
We went to an art gallery.

108
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,029
And it turned out
he knew quite a lot about art.

109
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,198
He told me about the paintings
like a curator.

110
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,785
(breathes deeply)
It was a very intellectual date.

111
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,997
-Sounds fun.
-EUNKANG: Yes, it was fun.

112
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,416
(slurps)

113
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,459
(exhales)

114
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,837
I'm a little confused though.

115
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,090
He has a good personality,
and he's nice to me.

116
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,426
I do like him,

117
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,179
but I don't really feel
comfortable around him.

118
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,225
I'm not sure if it's because I like him.

119
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,021
You know, they say
when you're interested in someone,

120
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,191
you get so nervous you can't really talk.

121
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,569
And I didn't get to talk much today.

122
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,613
"Oh, really?", "Oh, I see."

123
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,657
I was reacting like a robot.

124
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,995
But you always talk back to me.

125
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,706
Exactly. I'm not
one of those silent types.

126
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,459
But he'd only ask me
things that I don't know.

127
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,044
I couldn't talk much
because I didn't want to look ignorant.

128
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,590
Anyway, I'm not sure

129
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,135
if it's because I was nervous
because I like him

130
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,804
or if I just feel
uncomfortable around him.

131
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,055
That's stupid.

132
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,349
You don't know
if you're uncomfortable or excited?

133
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,519
It's confusing. That's why I'm asking.

134
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,730
Then meet someone who doesn't confuse you.

135
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,065
If you really like someone,
you won't be confused.

136
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,530
Just be with someone
who you feel comfortable around.

137
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,576
Someone who you can
comfortably be yourself around.

138
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,331
Whoever you're with,
you have to be part of the relationship.

139
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,125
-(rasps)
-(grunts)

140
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,461
-Did you cut yourself?
-No, I'm okay.

141
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,879
-Let me see.
-I'm really okay.

142
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,589
It happens to me all the time.
(shrieks)

143
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,717
(emotive music)

144
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,302
You're really a handful.

145
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,638
Wait here.

146
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,479
(door slide open)

147
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,573
(emotive music continues)

148
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,791
(blows air)

149
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,089
Uh...

150
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,051
(stammers)
Your hair was...

151
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:12,969
Mm-hm.

152
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,517
(clears throat)

153
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,894
That's good. Thanks. Let's go.
(chuckles)

154
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,813
Hey.

155
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,774
We should clean this up.

156
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,901
EUNKANG: Oh, right. Let's clean it up.

157
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,528
(chuckles)
I almost forgot.

158
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,530
-(can clinks)
-Oh, no.

159
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:33,906
(chuckles)

160
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,535
-SEUNGHYUN: Let me take that.
-EUNKANG: Okay.

161
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,205
(chuckles)

162
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,833
-How about yourself?
-What?

163
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,043
If you have any concerns, tell me.
I'm all ears.

164
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,461
I don't.

165
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,379
(sighs)

166
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,674
They say a problem shared
is a problem halved.

167
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,845
I guess I'm not that close of a friend.

168
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,513
-Got it.
-Gosh.

169
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:04,228
If someone is taking your friend
hostage and threatening you...

170
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,814
-EUNKANG: Who?
-SEUNGHYUN: I said, "if".

171
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,024
(in English)
Oh, okay.

172
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:08,941
(in Korean)
And?

173
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,319
You can shoot the hostage-taker,

174
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,030
but it can kill your friend.

175
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,449
What would you do?

176
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,492
Hmm...

177
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,454
I'll radio the sniper.

178
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,874
-What?
-Don't you watch American TV series?

179
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,294
When that happens,
there's always a sniper on standby

180
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,004
on the top of the building nearby.

181
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,797
So you should signal the sniper.

182
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,382
Then the sniper shoots. Bang!

183
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,593
And meanwhile, you save the hostage.

184
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,803
-(in English) Game over.
-(blows air)

185
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,513
(exhales sharply)

186
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,891
Thanks for the advice.

187
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,688
Hey, why do you think you have
only two options?

188
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,066
Try to be positive.

189
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,069
There's always a sniper somewhere
ready to save you.

190
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,780
Hello.

191
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,239
Hello.

192
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,450
Hey. Did you have dinner?

193
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,535
-Yes.
-Did you two eat together?

194
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,080
I just ran into him on my way back.

195
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,540
EUNKANG: He said he wouldn't eat,
but I forced him to eat something.

196
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,959
I see. . It's nice to see
you get along with your colleagues.

197
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,295
HYUNSEOK: Good. You should
look after your colleagues.

198
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,464
After all, colleagues are all you have.

199
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,801
I'd love to eat with you guys soon.
I'll pay for it.

200
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,803
Really? That's so nice of you.

201
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,848
Thank you.

202
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,645
So you're paying?

203
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,771
You're not a freshman.

204
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,648
HYUK: So Juchan is...

205
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,650
JUCHAN: I want to be a freshman then.

206
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,529
(suspenseful music)

207
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,963
STUDENT CENTER

208
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,344
(Hyunseok scoffs)
What are you saying?

209
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,973
You don't believe this letter, do you?

210
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,266
I know it's upsetting,
but please understand.

211
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,893
Someone tipped us off that you violated
the rule, and verifying that is my job.

212
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,811
(sighs)

213
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,188
Who is it?

214
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,609
Which bastard said
that I cheated to get good grades?

215
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,486
It's an anonymous tip-off,
so we don't know.

216
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,029
And even if we do, I can't tell you.

217
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,698
HYUK: But one thing is for sure.

218
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,367
It's one of the students
who took Professor Bang's exam with you.

219
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,746
The situation in the lecture room
and your actions were described in detail.

220
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,705
HYUNSEOK: Anonymous?

221
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,040
Then it could be all a lie.

222
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,041
Hey.

223
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,503
You remember when we were freshmen,

224
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,214
there was this guy who never studied
but always got good grades.

225
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,634
Remember there were rumors that
his uncle was a professor here?

226
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,429
Someone tipped off
that he leaked the exam papers.

227
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,972
What happened then?

228
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,516
They turned out to be not related at all.

229
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,687
This is just like that. It's slander.

230
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,358
I guess this is
all because I haven't been good.

231
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:01,238
So you're saying
you haven't done any cheating.

232
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,907
Of course not!

233
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,870
All right. Take it easy.

234
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,832
Wi Seunghyun, you bastard.

235
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,834
Does he want to play with me?

236
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,338
-(cellphone beeps)
-(phone line rings)

237
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,006
Where are you guys?

238
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,093
(car beeps)

239
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,807
POLICE SCIENCE INSTITUTE

240
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,808
Detective Kang.

241
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,394
You're Detective Kang Namgi, right?

242
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,273
Gosh. It's been a long time.
(laughs)

243
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,942
(students training in distance)

244
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:38,943
Yes.

245
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,111
What brings you here?

246
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,197
Oh, I'm going to the training institute.

247
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,491
To get training.

248
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,700
Ahh...

249
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,328
Constable... I mean,

250
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,833
Professor, I heard that you were here.

251
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,335
Right. It's been about five years
since I came back to Korea,

252
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,422
but I've been so busy with the school
I didn't get to tell people I was back.

253
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,968
-Where are you working now?
-I'm working at South Gangneung Office.

254
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,719
Oh. Gangneung?

255
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,015
KANG NAMGI

256
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,350
NAMGI: Now, if you'll excuse me.

257
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,645
Wait, Detective.

258
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,234
Do you...

259
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,487
happen to know a student named Gi Hanna?

260
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,325
"Gi Hanna"?

261
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,953
It doesn't ring a bell.

262
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,664
-Is that so?
-Yes.

263
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,748
Oh...

264
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,916
Well, then.

265
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,879
Detective.

266
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,259
I may be...

267
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,096
a bad teacher,

268
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,723
but I'll protect my students.

269
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:00,983
(sighs)

270
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,990
KNPU POLARIS
LET US INTRODUCE THE SYMBOL OF KNPU

271
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,665
PROMOTION CORPS

272
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,086
MALE EXAMINEE: I'm a high school senior,
and I want to apply for KNPU.

273
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,255
What kind of questions
do we get at the interview?

274
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,256
(keyboard clacking)

275
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,051
ARI: Thank you for your interest
in our school.

276
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,720
There aren't specific questions
for the interview,

277
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,514
but interviewees are usually asked
about the reasons why they applied,

278
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,391
books that impressed them the most,

279
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,144
and their opinions
on international affairs.

280
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,021
Did you check the number of the souvenirs?

281
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,815
(stammers)
I'll get right to it after this.

282
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,443
(keyboard clacking)

283
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,788
(foreboding music)

284
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,331
(gasps)
Oh, no.

285
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,458
(whimpering)
Sir, look at this.

286
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,505
I WAS ASSAULTED BY A KNPU STUDENT

287
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,882
Hey. Stop it.

288
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,717
I said, stop!

289
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,558
(exhales sharply)

290
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,519
Is it you two?

291
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,980
Answer me!

292
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,314
BOTH: Yes, sir!

293
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,195
Did you come to our school
to beat up people?

294
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,697
No, sir. It was an accident.

295
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,323
-"An accident"?
-Yes, sir.

296
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,952
We accidentally got caught up in a fight
while trying to protect the part-timer.

297
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,746
What do you mean,
"protect the part-timer"?

298
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,331
It's not recorded on the video,

299
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,209
but the part-timer was being threatened
before this happened.

300
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,087
As I tried to stop them,
they attacked me, and Tak...

301
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,715
Still, you beat some citizens.
Are you thugs?

302
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,009
You think you can just beat anyone
who look bad to you?!

303
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,135
No, sir!

304
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,764
This is why people say cops beat people.

305
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,100
-Do you know that?
-Does that mean...

306
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,685
we should just let them beat us?

307
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,941
-What?
-We did our best to avoid violence.

308
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,569
But some things can't be helped.

309
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,988
"Can't be helped"?

310
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,787
It's all my fault, sir.
I'll gladly accept my punishment.

311
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,872
Shut up!

312
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,500
Hyuk. Let's call the part-timer
and ask him what happened first.

313
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,294
We should check
what was actually going on.

314
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,547
He's right.
We can still punish them after that.

315
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,299
SUNYU: I'll call the billiards hall.

316
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,555
(ominous music)

317
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,777
As I was at the counter,
settling the bills,

318
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,195
they suddenly started to fight...

319
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,074
and that man started hitting people.

320
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,200
What are you talking about?

321
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,452
And that man beat the people,
venting his anger on them.

322
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,954
Why are you doing this? That's not true!

323
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,956
Then I ran away,
so I don't know what happened next.

324
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,595
Why is he doing that?
Does he hate us for some reason?

325
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,680
I have no idea.

326
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,308
(sighs)
Gosh. I can't believe this.

327
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,397
(sighs)

328
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,525
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,486
-I'm sorry I'm putting you through this.
-Don't be stupid.

330
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,696
I would have done the same
if I saw them beating you.

331
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,448
Then those punks would be
in a hospital now,

332
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,783
and things would have gotten more serious.

333
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,700
(chuckles)

334
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,703
Come on. That's a bit of a stretch.

335
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,165
Well, your punches are full of air.

336
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,042
What?
(scoffs)

337
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,753
I used to throw punches around
in middle school.

338
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,297
Kids used to call me "the Nuclear Fist".

339
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,258
Whenever we had a fight
with other classes,

340
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,760
-I was the one to sweep them all.
-(laughs)

341
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,221
Hey, check this out. I have a scar too.

342
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,514
All right. Let me see.

343
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,850
This is the scar I got from then.

344
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,019
And guess what happened to the punk
who did this to me. I gave him a punch,

345
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,063
-and it took him two weeks to recover.
-Two weeks?

346
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,356
It must've been just a scratch.

347
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,400
Quit bragging.

348
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,110
(clicks tongue)

349
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,487
(sighs)

350
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,115
What do we do now?

351
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,200
I know.

352
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,202
Hey, Seunghyun.

353
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,538
Maybe we should ask Hyunseok for help.

354
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,749
-What?
-I mean, he was there too.

355
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,751
I'm not sure if he's seen it all,

356
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,670
but hey, he should take our side.

357
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,463
We can't.

358
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,591
Why not? You've got to swallow your pride.

359
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,843
He said we should let him know
if we get in trouble.

360
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,094
No, we can't.

361
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,223
(bully grunting on video)

362
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,935
(Tak sighs)

363
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,190
Goodness. I didn't see it coming.

364
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,734
Does this mean he's the one
who posted the video?

365
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,527
It was posted from someone else's account,

366
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,322
but it's the same video, so...

367
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,824
You knew this all along?
Then why didn't you say anything?

368
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,784
Because that's not what matters now.

369
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,870
(exhales sharply)

370
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,290
Well, it's not like revealing that
will prove our innocence.

371
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,836
Right now, we should focus
on making the part-timer tell the truth.

372
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,963
(clicks tongue, sighs)

373
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,924
I'm not sure
if he'll want to see us though.

374
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,592
(sighs)

375
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,261
Then who's lying?

376
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,347
Are you suspecting your friends?

377
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,723
No, I'm not.

378
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,478
I mean, they might have
some wild sides that we didn't know of.

379
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,522
Maybe they have intermittent
explosive disorder or WSW syndrome...

380
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,775
Hey, shut up. That's nonsense.

381
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,652
DAEIL: Why do you always criticize me?

382
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,946
It must be the part-timer who's lying.

383
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,114
They wouldn't have beaten the people
for no reason.

384
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,117
But why would the part-timer lie?

385
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,995
-Technically, he was saved by them.
-(gasps)

386
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,289
-Maybe he was blackmailed.
-BUMJU: "Blackmailed"?

387
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,917
It's possible that
the bullies blackmailed him.

388
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,212
They're probably holding grudges
against Seunghyun and Tak.

389
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,463
They must have done something.

390
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,715
Do they have security cameras
in the billiards hall?

391
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,217
We can see what actually happened.

392
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,844
Actually, that was the first thing
Sunyu checked,

393
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,013
but it turned out
that they were broken since long ago.

394
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,432
They didn't repair them.
They're just dummy cameras.

395
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,600
This is bad.

396
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,062
The punishment for assaulting citizens
must be pretty severe.

397
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,897
ARI: That would be the best-case scenario.

398
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,733
If the victims report it to the police,
they can get criminal charges.

399
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,402
Then they'll be expelled.

400
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,028
(sighs)

401
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,365
Hey. Maybe we should
talk to the part-timer.

402
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,452
No, we shouldn't. It might be seen
as an attempt to win him over.

403
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,872
Anyway, I want you to keep this a secret.

404
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,041
Except the TAs,
not many students know about this yet.

405
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,669
-What about the post?
-I deleted it using the staff's account.

406
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,629
But we never know.

407
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,257
Maybe someone saw it before I did.

408
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,842
(foreboding music)

409
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,677
(indistinct shouting on video)

410
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,852
NAMGI: There's a freshman
named Wi Seunghyun, right?

411
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,478
Keep an eye on him.

412
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,398
And let me know
if he does anything strange.

413
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,068

(keyboard clacking)

415
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,619
Hi, Mr. Kim. It's me, Detective Kang.

416
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,789
Okay. I'll take a look.

417
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,000
Call me if you need the victim's contact.

418
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,376
Right. Okay.
(chuckles)

419
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,879
JUNGSIM TIMES

420
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,089
All right. Hold on a second.

FROM: KANG NAMGI
1 LARGE ATTACHED FILE UNTITLED.MP4

422
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,439
Yes, it's them.

423
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,652
Sir. They shouldn't beat people like this
if they're KNPU students.

424
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,864
The doctor said
he needs four weeks to recover.

425
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,745
DIAGNOSIS
PATIENT NAME: YANG JIHOON

426
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,955
Can I take this and have a look?

427
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,956
Sure.

428
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,043
JIHOON: For justice,

429
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,003
I'd cooperate with anything.

430
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,631
We don't need anything else.

431
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,343
The reason why we came today
after you called me

432
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,805
is actually not because
of the settlement money.

433
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,099
We just want one thing.

434
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,188
I want you to kick them out of school.

435
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,858
-You want them to be expelled?
-JIHOON: Yes.

436
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,153
Imagine what will happen to this country

437
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,697
when kids like them
become police executives.

438
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,535
They beat and blackmail innocent citizens!

439
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,537
"Blackmail"?

440
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,040
Yes. I think they were worried
we might report them to the police.

441
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,251
They said all the officers
in the police station were their seniors,

442
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,044
so there would be no point
in reporting them.

443
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,924
One of the perpetrators
is a police executive's son.

444
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,219
Is there anything else they said?

445
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,431
-Something about their fathers?
-Right!

446
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,642
That reminds me of something he said.

447
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,519
He asked, "Do you know who my dad is?"

448
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,062
"He won't let this slide."

449
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,313
Right?

450
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,442
-Right. He's right.
-He did say it.

451
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,903
This is what they call corrupt-something.

452
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,699
You see, to my parents,
I'm a precious son too!

453
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,034
(exclaiming, sighs)

454
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,077
All right.

455
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,997
Well... Right.

456
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,875
The owner of the billiards hall said

457
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,252
a part-timer was there too.

458
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,380
What? You mean...

459
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,424
-Yoonki?
-Yoonki?

460
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,925
Hong Yoonki?

461
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,179
Do you know his contact?

462
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,347
-Why?
-KIM: He's a witness.

463
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,141
He must know what happened.

464
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,394
Right.

465
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,273
I don't think you can reach him though.
He's not answering anyone's call.

466
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:49,821
We heard this from the owner.
But sir, does his statement even matter?

467
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:54,075
We have an obvious victim here,
and we're all witnesses. Am I wrong?

468
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,245
-JIHOON: Gosh. It's hurting even more.
-Right.

469
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,164
All right, then.

470
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,209

KIM SUNYEONG

472
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,089
Hey, Mr. Kim.

473
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,135
It's been a while.
It's been years, actually.

474
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,137
What's up?

475
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,264
(birds chirping)

476
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,693
We just managed to smooth
over the Cheongram Education issue.

477
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,362
And now this?

478
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,034
You're supposed to guide your students!

479
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:37,994
I'm sorry, ma'am.

480
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,672
What are the students doing now?

481
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,092
They're grounded until
the disciplinary committee is set up.

482
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,720
I heard one of them was Wi Giyong's son.

483
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,973
Yes. He's not the one
who committed the assault though.

484
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,517
He was on the scene.

485
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,105
I thought Mr. Wi was a top freshman
and a model student.

486
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,856
So we're trying to figure out
what happened.

487
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,235
The two students involved in this incident
are claiming innocence.

488
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,781
Professor Cha, I want you
to find out what happened.

489
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:15,824
Yes, ma'am.

490
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,704
This might be a more serious problem
than just expelling one student.

491
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,622
In the worst-case scenario,

492
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,833
we might not be able to recruit
any freshmen next year.

493
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,630
I know the journalist,
so I asked him to wait one more day,

494
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,632
but he'll write about it tomorrow.

495
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,136
I want you to find a solution
before that happens.

496
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,016
(sighs)

497
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,482
(phone line ringing)

498
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,654
Eunkang. I want you to be my sniper.

499
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,241
BILLIARD HALL OWNER: I said I don't know.

500
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,826
Please. Just this one thing.

501
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,707
I really don't know.

502
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,209
How do I know where he went?
He just suddenly quit.

503
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,295
Then please at least tell me his address.

504
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,756
He must have given you his résumé
when he applied for the job.

505
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,341
His address must be written there.

506
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,134
I threw it away already.

507
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,804
And even if I knew, I can't tell you.
It's his privacy.

508
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,560
Actually, my friend

509
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,064
has a crush on Yoonki.

510
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,608
(sobs)

511
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,693
(sniffles)

512
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,031
Could you please...

513
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,119
let her see him one last time?

514
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,206
"One last time?"

515
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,750
My friend is...
(sobs)

516
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,960
(whimpers)
...very ill.

517
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,505
(sighs)

518
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,298
(grumbles)

519
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,258
(suspenseful music)

520
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,220
BILLIARD HALL OWNER: I don't know
the exact address.

521
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,639
I just heard he lived
near the last bus stop.

522
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,058
BILLIARDS CLUB

523
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,310
Man. I haven't done
such method acting in a while.

524
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,978
(cellphone buzzing)

525
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,605
Hey, Juyoung.

526
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,650
Text me the address. We'll be right there.

527
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:14,901
(cellphone beeps)

528
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,695
She found a lead. Let's go.

529
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,115
I can't go. I'm going to the
Promotion Corps' meeting.

530
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,199
You didn't say that.

531
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,951
I forgot about it.

532
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,286
I can't miss it.
It's a very important meeting.

533
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,206
Then just the three of us will go.
Let's go.

534
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,624
Be careful.

535
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,546
JUYOUNG: Gosh.

536
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,923
This neighborhood is big.

537
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,843
I'm not sure if we'll find him
before the sun goes down.

538
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,720
We have to be discreet about this.

539
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,806
Once he hears that we're looking for him,
he might not go home.

540
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,641
Where should we start?

541
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,685
(clears throat)

542
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,020
I divided the area.

543
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,108
There is a total of 288 households
in this neighborhood.

544
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,193
Dividing the number by four,
as Ari isn't here,

545
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,237
we need to visit 72 houses per person.

546
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,282
First, you and Eunkang take this area.

547
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,533
Daeil and I will take the area

548
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,243
-on the other side of the road...
-DAEIL: Gosh.

549
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,370
DAEIL: That's stupid.

550
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,331
What am I going to do with these amateurs?

551
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,919
Follow me.

552
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,131
(upbeat music)

553
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,051
(clears throat)

554
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,887
Hel, hel, hel, hel, hel.

555
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,305
Hello, ma'am.

556
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,395
The laundromat couple
is a remarried couple.

557
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,065
Both the husband and wife
were divorced before.

558
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:41,112
But the wife didn't bring her kid.

559
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,865
I see.

560
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,661
She really knows everything
about this neighborhood.

561
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,413
-(chuckles)
-Ma'am.

562
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,957
Where does this man called...

563
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,084
Hong Yoonki live?

564
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,796
Wait. Where was it?

565
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,049
Right.

566
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:07,764
The lady at Charming Hair Salon
is the most unfortunate one.

567
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,810
She lived here for 30 years.
Then when she finally sold her house,

568
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,814
they decided to redevelop this area.

569
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,357
OLD LADY: Gosh.

570
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,235
I guess she wasn't born to be rich.

571
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,071
By the way, ma'am,

572
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,576
where do you think Hong Yoonki lives?

573
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,080
Where was it?

574
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,583
(banging on gate)

575
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,835
DAEIL: Hello?

576
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,713
Is anybody there?

577
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,174
(banging on gate)

578
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,969
Anybody home?

579
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,431
Is anybody in there?

580
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,600
Looks like the house is empty.

581
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,480
You'd better be ready.

582
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,733
We're going to stake out from now on.

583
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,404
Eunkang, to 45 degrees.

584
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,073
Seo Bumju, to 120 degrees.

585
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,910
Woo Juyoung, hide back there
to watch if Hong Yoonki runs away.

586
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,287
-What about you?
-I'll be...

587
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,873
the commander-in-chief.

588
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,124
(Daeil grunts)

589
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,086
You sit right here, like a Shepherd.

590
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,380
Guys, let's go.

591
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,008
Split up!

592
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,719
Wait here.

593
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:28,928
(dogs barking)

594
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,772
(sighs)

595
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,066
Maybe I should have joined them.

596
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,450
How did it go?

597
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,205
Was it really a one-sided attack?

598
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,498
I hoped it wasn't,

599
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,876
but they let me down.

600
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,212
Are you close with them?

601
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,674
HYUNSEOK: You'd better be careful
with your friends.

602
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,092
If you get involved in this,

603
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,677
you might get on
the school authority's bad side.

604
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,763
No.

605
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,349
If I get involved in this,
I might regret it later.

606
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,645
(playful music)

607
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,957
(crockery clanging)

608
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,875
(grumbles)

609
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,675
What are you doing alone?
Where are the other guys?

610
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,761
Well, they're all out.

611
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,765
-Where is Seunghyun?
-He doesn't want to eat.

612
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,102
(Tak munching)

613
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,776
(indistinct chatter)

614
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,740
-(indistinct chattering)
-(crockery clanging)

615
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,540
You like strawberries.
(munching)

616
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,166
(reflective music)

617
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,710
Mmm...
(sips)

618
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,921
Why would they give us only two?
It's so few.

619
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,881
My stomach can barely feel it.

620
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,011
Hey!

621
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,679
What do you think you're doing?

622
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,640
I was saving it for later.

623
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,559
ARI: You steal my food too.

624
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,145
JUYOUNG: Seriously,
I was saving it for later.

625
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,063
I'll buy you some later.

626
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,942
-Wow, I really want to kill you now.
-I'll buy you some.

627
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,738
I'm okay.
(chuckles)

628
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,073
Eat up. I don't like strawberries.

629
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,996
(munches)

630
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,168
I washed my hands. Eat up.

631
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,638
(sighs)

632
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,598
(object clatters)

633
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,074
(groans)

634
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,159
Gosh, my whole body aches.

635
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,749
(stomach croaks)

636
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:46,876
(clears throat)

637
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,711
(dogs barking)

638
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:55,927
SAMGEORI STORE

639
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,886
(chuckles)

640
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,308
One second. I'm on my...

641
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,810
I'm on my way now.

642
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,354
I'm almost there. I see it now.

643
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,689
SCHOOL BULLY 1: Hey, you ratted on us,
didn't you?

644
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,234
YOONKI'S BROTHER: No. I really didn't.

645
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,195
SCHOOL BULLY 1: Then how does
the teacher know we were smoking?

646
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,324
Now they know our hideout
and took all our smokes.

647
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,827
-It's all because of you.
-I really didn't say anything.

648
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,620
Guys. Let's beat some sense into him.

649
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,580
-SCHOOL BULLY 2: Darn it.
-Hold him.

650
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,167
DAEIL: What are you doing?!

651
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,627
(cat meows)

652
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:34,549
You little brats.

653
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,092
Hey.

654
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,762
You should be nice to your friend.

655
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,264
What the...

656
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,641
-Who are you?
-Stop looking at me like that.

657
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,520
DAEIL: I'm saying this
because you're like my little brothers.

658
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,938
You're going to regret this.

659
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,691
You never know
what will happen in the future.

660
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,527
If you become actors in the future,

661
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,448
the drama you star in
will have to be canceled because of you.

662
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,368
-Think about the future!
-Gosh! You're loud.

663
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,290
Was I loud?

664
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,377
Kids. Calm down.

665
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,006
You need to control your temper
to become great people. Understand?

666
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,507
I'll go now.

667
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,969
Wait, kids.

668
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,763
Actually, I'm a cop.

669
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,057
My friends are over...

670
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,476
My colleagues are waiting for me.

671
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,146
(chuckles)
Guys, he says he's a cop.

672
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,647
(kids laughing)

673
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,442
Cops aren't supposed to lie. So take this.

674
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,360
-(Daeil yelps)
-(police siren wailing)

675
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,278
What's that?

676
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,487
-SCHOOL BULLY 2: What do we do?
-SCHOOL BULLY 3: Darn it.

677
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,739
SCHOOL BULLY 2: What do we do?

678
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,158
-(kids clamoring)
-(police siren wailing)

679
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,496
DAEIL: Consider yourself lucky, okay?

680
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,373
The cops came right on time.

681
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,917
Where did they come from?

682
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,543
This is scary.

683
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,089
(police siren wailing on phone)

684
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,134
Jeez.

685
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,386
-(in English) Good job.
-(in Korean) "Good job", my foot.

686
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,388
Is this why you were taking so long?

687
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,850
I couldn't just
turn a blind eye to school bullies.

688
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,269
Because I'm a cop down to the bone.

689
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,355
Right.

690
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,107
Hey. Are you okay?

691
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,567
Thank you.

692
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,028
Hey, you should go see a doctor.

693
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,239
It's okay. I have medicine at home.

694
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,492
-Stand up. Let us walk you home.
-Yes.

695
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,914
(somber music)

696
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,087
-Yoonki.
-What happened? I told you not to call me.

697
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,006
-Well...
-Mr. Hong Yoonki.

698
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,892
-We're students of KNPU.
-Darn it.

699
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,310
(thrilling music)

700
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,229
DAEIL: No! Stop him!

701
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,860
Hey!

702
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,738
(dogs barking)

703
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,372
(Daeil exclaims nervously)
Hey! Eunkang!

704
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,499
Eunkang! Hey, go to the back!

705
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,211
(object clatters)

706
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,888
Hey! Eunkang!

707
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,056
Where are you going?

708
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,398
(thrilling music continues)

709
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:44,780
(grunts)

710
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,578
(grunting)

711
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,092
(thrilling music continues)

712
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:18,939
(Eunkang grunts)

713
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,818
(thrilling music continues)

714
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,701
(sighs)

715
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,624
(Eunkang grunting)

716
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,335
Darn it.

717
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,590
(struggling)

718
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,634
(panting)

719
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,512
EUNKANG: Wait... I won't catch you...

720
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,597
This...

721
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,057
(clears throat)

722
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,184
...is from Seunghyun...
(panting)

723
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,770
-...to you.
-And who's he?

724
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,815
The better-looking one...
(breathes heavily)

725
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,983
...with fairer skin.

726
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,111
(Eunkang pants)

727
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,280
(wind chimes tinkle)

728
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,496
(breathes heavily)

729
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,164
I don't need this.

730
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,208
(Eungkang panting, grunts)

731
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,087
(grunts)

732
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,508
(grumbles)

733
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:32,596
I meant, I wouldn't use my hands
to catch you.

734
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,476
What do you guys want?
Why did you come to my place?

735
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,396
Why are you avoiding us?
As if you did something bad.

736
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,815
(yelling)
What do you want me to do?

737
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,400
Go tell the truth.

738
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,027
-Or the guys will be expelled.
-And?

739
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,738
What do you think will happen
after I tell the truth?

740
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,367
You know what?
I'm also sick of everything.

741
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,369
(somber music)

742
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,663
I'm sick of getting bullied
and beaten all the time.

743
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,167
I didn't ask for their help.

744
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,751
(Yoonki shuddering)

745
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,920
They only made this harder for me!

746
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:06,922
(sniffles)

747
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,426
Unlike you,
we don't have parents to protect us.

748
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,927
We've got nothing.

749
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,847
Call us cowards if you want.
I don't have a choice.

750
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,558
Stop bothering us.

751
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,194
Do you want to know my life motto?

752
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,698
EUNKANG: "Pay back."

753
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,744
Whether it's kindness or hatred,

754
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,287
I always pay it back.

755
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,083
You can do the same.

756
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,212
Repay Seunghyun's kindness

757
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,464
and get back at those bullies.

758
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,424
We'll help you.

759
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,388
What a joke.

760
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,142
That's easy for you to say.

761
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,606
(retreating footsteps)

762
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,319
(breathes heavily)

763
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,743
(Eunkang sighs)

764
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,914
(students training in distance)

765
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,250
JUNGSIM TIMES

766
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,673
(cellphone buzzing)

767
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,675
Yes?

768
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,053
The school wants me to see some video.

769
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,806
Yes. I'll check it and get back to you.

770
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,890
Okay, bye.

771
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,726
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

772
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:50,818
Many journalists these days
hear only one side of the story.

773
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,112
But you're different, Mr. Kim.

774
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,364
You're a true journalist.

775
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,449
The right of reply is a basic right.

776
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,369
So what's the evidence you found?

777
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,204
My, you're impatient.

778
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,623
Have a cup of tea first.
It's on its way here.

779
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:07,876
By the way...

780
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,964
how did you get the video?

781
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,591
There was an informant.

782
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,509
-Who...
-(chuckles)

783
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,595
Do you want to know my source?

784
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,305
No, that's not what I meant.

785
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,516
This is about two young men's futures.

786
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:27,062
We just wonder why anyone
would send you a video

787
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,399
that was intentionally edited
to make them look bad.

788
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,817
What do you think?

789
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:32,818
(sighs)

790
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,365
I also thought something was off,
so I was looking for the witness.

791
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,575
I see.

792
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,201
That's great.

793
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,786
(laughs)

794
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,914
Yes. Come in.

795
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,592
This is the original video
taken by the victim himself.

796
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,594
It shows what happened before the assault.

797
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,304
UGON: And...

798
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,224
Yes. Come in.

799
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,894
Please come in.

800
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,812
(somber music)

801
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:11,565
(door closes)

802
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:16,236
He's the real victim
and the witness of this incident.

803
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,783
(cashier register dings)

804
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,869
No. My boss will dock my pay for the loss.

805
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:24,912
Uh...

806
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,414
JIHOON: Then call the police.

807
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,084
You know what's going to happen
to your brother, right?

808
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,461
(snickers)

809
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,511
One, two, three, four, five...

810
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:45,015
I'll inform the desk about this first
and get back to you.

811
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,935
Okay. Please call us
if you have any questions.

812
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,938
And he's more than willing to help.
You can directly call him if you want.

813
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:51,855
Okay.

814
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,065
All right.

815
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,442
-Well, then.
-Okay.

816
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,489
KIM: Bye.

817
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,034
-UGON: Take care.
-KIM: You too.

818
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,414
(chuckles)

819
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,542
We appreciate your courage.

820
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,002
I should have said the truth
in the first place.

821
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:17,214
-I'm sorry.
-But how did it occur to you...

822
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,008
...that you should film it
in such an urgent situation?

823
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:24,930
They often blackmailed me,
so I was collecting evidence just in case.

824
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,057
(cellphone buzzing)

825
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,854
(stammers)
Right. Well...

826
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,774
We're having dinner with Mr. Hong later.

827
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,776
-Is that so?
-EUNKANG: Yes.

828
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,403
All right, then. Let's go.

829
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,363
Are you joining us?

830
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,493
Ahh...

831
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,412
Right.

832
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,749
I forgot I have something
to report to the dean.

833
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:52,791
(Ugon laughs awkwardly)

834
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,418
I totally forgot. Yes.

835
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,920
-Go.
-Okay. I'll get going, sir.

836
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,213
Sure. Go.

837
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:04,970
Okay. Bye.

838
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:06,889
(door shuts)

839
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,645
-How do you think it'll go?
-I don't know.

840
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,149
(approaching footsteps)

841
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,525
Hey, Eunkang!

842
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,616
Thank you.
My punishment was canceled thanks to you.

843
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,993
No, I actually owe you an apology.
(chuckles)

844
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,788
You must have had a lot
to worry about because of me.

845
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,039
That's right.

846
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,669
(chuckles)

847
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,670
Just kidding.

848
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:39,963
(cheerful music)

849
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,173
(chuckles)

850
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,091
Hey, why are you talking like that?

851
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,762
We all agreed that we're friends now,
so just be casual. Or we're not friends.

852
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,847
She's right. Just be casual.
We're all friends.

853
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,808
Should we?

854
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,019
Let's do that, friend.

855
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,860
All right. Enough making up.
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

856
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,405
DAEIL: Have you tried KNPU cafeteria food?

857
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,825
Stir-fried pork is good here.

858
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,828
-BUMJU: That's not today's menu.
-JUYOUNG: Haven't you checked?

859
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,084
They can be friends so quickly.

860
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,293
(chuckles)

861
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,963
Youth sure is great.

862
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,341
STUDENT CENTER
STUDENT DORMITORY

863
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,511
(indistinct chattering)

864
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,223
What changed your mind all of a sudden?

865
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,641
You were so stubborn yesterday.

866
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,477
Well, I saw the note.

867
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:39,898
(chuckles)

868
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,692
(emotive music)

869
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,389
(exhales sharply)

870
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:26,361
SEUNGHYUN: Mr. Hong, you're not alone.
The friends I sent will help you.

871
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,697
(door slides open)

872
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,540
Yoonki.

873
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,376
I think those guys are trying to help us.

874
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,382
YOU'RE NOT ALONE

875
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,304
If they bother you again, just call us.

876
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,097
We're friends.

877
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,182
(chuckles)

878
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,558
Thank you.

879
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,729
But I won't avoid them from now on.

880
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,106
YOONKI: I think it only makes them
bully me more.

881
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,193
But it does feel safe to have friends.

882
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,320
(Eunkang chuckles)

883
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,157
Right. One second.

884
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,827
Guys, when are you guys free?

885
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,496
EUNKANG: Hyunseok wants to buy us dinner.

886
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,289
-DAEIL: Really?
-EUNKANG: Yes.

887
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:20,874
DAEIL: What's the menu?

888
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,460
-EUNKANG: Probably barbecue.
-I saw a barbecue restaurant over there.

889
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,504
-TAK: What kind of barbecue?
-DAEIL: If it's barbecue, I'm coming.

890
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,797
BUMJU: Beef?

891
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,843
-What's the matter?
-Are you...

892
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,221
close with him?

893
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,539
Did you really have to do that?

894
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,665
I want to ask you the same.

895
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,167
Did you really have to report it?

896
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,377
I didn't.

897
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:06,378
(scoffs)

898
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,339
If it wasn't you,

899
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,633
who was it?

900
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,676
I don't know.

901
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,803
But I don't think that's important.

902
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,556
You shouldn't have done it
in the first place.

903
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,894
Look. I've seen cheating seniors too.

904
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,772
But I turned a blind eye to it,
so they could get good grades.

905
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,899
If we don't look out for each other,
who would...

906
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:28,984
That's why...

907
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,319
this happened today.

908
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,697
Because you couldn't then.

909
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,576
If you had admitted your fault
and took responsibility for it,

910
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,828
things wouldn't have come this far.

911
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,625
I want you to take responsibility
for what you did.

912
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,437
Darn it.

913
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,147
JIHOON: Hey, coin.

914
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,024
SEUNGHYUN: I don't have your coins.
Use yours.

915
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,734
What the heck?

916
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,736
What's so surprising?

917
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,660
Are you hanging out here
after being kicked out of school?

918
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,578
(snickers)

919
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,205
Haven't you heard?

920
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,040
We're off the hook.

921
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,419
We got the original video
of the entire situation.

922
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,381
Do you want to know
what's going to happen to you now?

923
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,884
We're taking this
to the police station now.

924
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,178
Then you'll be charged
with assaulting the part-timer,

925
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,722
blackmailing, theft, and...

926
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:45,018
Plotting to harm someone, falsifying
evidence, and spreading false information.

927
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,272
You'd better be ready.

928
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:50,649
We came to tell you that.

929
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:51,942
Right.

930
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,193
(coin clinks)

931
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,240
Enjoy. You won't be
able to play for a while.

932
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,493
TAK: We're leaving.

933
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,870
SEUNGHYUN: Good luck.
And stop making trouble.

934
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,501
What are they talking about?
What's the original video?

935
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,629
-They're bluffing.
-What if they actually have it?

936
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,755
Do you think...

937
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,675
Hyunseok might have given it to them?

938
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,135
That's nonsense.

939
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,887
He's the one who wanted to kick them out.

940
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,014
Maybe he's double-crossing us.

941
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,600
Wait.

942
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,480
-(cellphone beeps)
-(phone line ringing)

943
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,566
-(sighs)
-(phone line ringing continues)

944
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,234
Hi. Are you free to talk?

945
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,235
(chuckles)

946
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:39,239
It's just that Seunghyun
just came to the arcade

947
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,700
and said things about some video
and a USB flash drive.

948
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,660
But I don't understand
what he's talking about.

949
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,245
JIHOON: Do you happen to know anything?

950
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,330
What are you talking about?

951
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,748
Hyunseok, look.

952
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,751
You can't do this to us.

953
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,546
We'll tell them it was your orders.

954
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,173
Are you threatening me now?

955
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,299
(scoffs)

956
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,260
Who do you think you are?

957
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,470
Buzz off, you little brats.

958
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,431
(yelling)
Hey. Hey!

959
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,558
You think you're our boss or something

960
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,643
because we listen to you? Don't you?

961
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,396
If something happens to us,
you're not safe either!

962
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,064
-Hey! Hey!
-(line beeps)

963
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,691
What did he say?

964
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,443
JIHOON: Hang on a second.

965
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,363
(all gasp)

966
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,368
I left my phone, so...

967
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,503
Let's go.

968
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,756
TAK: Let's go.

969
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,897
HYUK: Hyunseok, I need to check something.

970
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,649
I'll see you
at the honorary committee's office.

971
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,529
(footsteps approaching)

972
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,163
Did Wi Seunghyun...

973
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,708
-say something?
-It wasn't Wi Seunghyun.

974
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,168
It was someone else.

975
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:21,591
JIHOON (on phone): Actually, we kind of
attacked them first.

976
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:22,592
HYUNSEOK (on phone): Don't worry.

977
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,552
I only left the part
where you were being beaten.

978
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,096
Anyway, you're victims.

979
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,932
Tell them you won't settle
unless they get expelled.

980
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,059
JIHOON (on phone): What if
they do something against...

981
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,478
HYUNSEOK (on phone): Hey, don't you want
to keep working for our school?

982
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,482
-Hyuk, the thing is...
-The guys...

983
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,528
who posted the video were just here.
They begged for my mercy.

984
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,405
(dramatic music)

985
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,157
It turns out, for the past three years,

986
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,827
the Promotion Corps has been
purchasing materials and souvenirs

987
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,997
from one printing company
and one online store run by these people.

988
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,332
Other schools deal with that company too.

989
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,877
True, but I figured out
our school had been paying extra...

990
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,381
and they've been
sharing the profits with you.

991
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,218
Well... that's used for the corps' dinner.

992
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,722
It's not even much.
I can give it all back.

993
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,266
I'll give it all back. Okay?

994
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:17,063
Hyuk, you know how hard
I've been working for this school.

995
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,940
You can't do this to me.

996
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,444
Hyuk.

997
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,365
Just this once.
Please let it slide this once.

998
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,658
Please.

999
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,036
HYUK: Hyunseok.

1000
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,372
This is the kind of people
we need to arrest later.

1001
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,124
People who use their power

1002
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,793
for their own benefits
and hinder fair competition.

1003
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,422
I want you to make
the honorable choice yourself.

1004
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,676
That's the last thing
I can do for you as your colleague,

1005
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,971
who has been
spent the most time here with you.

1006
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,274
SEONGHYUIN: Hey, what's up?
Why did you call us out?

1007
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,945
ARI: Surprise! It's for you.

1008
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,073
I'm good.

1009
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,700
You have to eat it.
It'll prevent bad luck.

1010
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,285
-ARI: Eat up.
-I said I'm good.

1011
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:17,707
(munches)

1012
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:19,918
(chuckles)

1013
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,464
-(Ari gasps, cheering)
-(munches)

1014
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:27,509
Congratulations. You're starting over now.

1015
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,304
DAEIL: What are you eating alone?
Give me some.

1016
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,723
Hey, stop butting in all the time.

1017
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,433
Why are you always so mean to me?

1018
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,561
We prepared a welcome back party for you.
Come on.

1019
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:43,775
ARI: Hey!

1020
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,610
SEUNGHYUN: Let's go.

1021
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,946
(girls laughing in distance)

1022
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,490
(Eunkang exclaims)

1023
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,409
What great weather.

1024
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,619
This is the college life
I've been dreaming of.

1025
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,038
Hey, Eunkang.
Did you stop seeing that guy?

1026
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,623
You haven't spoken about him lately.

1027
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,084
-They broke up.
-JUYOUNG: When?

1028
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,797
Oh, come on.
We weren't even in a relationship.

1029
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:09,467
ARI: Right. There was no physical contact,
so we can't call it a relationship.

1030
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,720
Anyway, congratulations
on being single again!

1031
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,682
This girl. She's only happy
that you're single.

1032
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,518
DAEIL: Hey, Ari.

1033
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,437
How are things
at the Promotion Corps these days?

1034
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,481
Not good, obviously.
We all know we can't fully trust others,

1035
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,608
but who would've thought
Hyunseok would do something like that.

1036
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,734
(Daeil sighs)

1037
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,736
He left school,
so everything's good now, right?

1038
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,864
JUYOUNG: You can't make everything
good again by running away.

1039
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,116
Everyone knows he got bribes
from the company.

1040
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,327
He won't even be able
to show up at reunions.

1041
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,622
BUMJU: I heard there was more.

1042
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,624
(munching)

1043
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:48,423
Well, I heard he's been cheating
on every exam he took.

1044
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,509
He somehow managed to do it
without getting caught,

1045
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:55,221
but this time, someone caught him.
I heard there was a tip-off about it.

1046
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,598
-EUNKANG: What?
-DAEIL: Really?

1047
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,267
-JUYOUNG: Who did that?
-BUMJU: I don't know.

1048
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,102
(suspenseful music)

1049
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,939
THURSDAY

1050
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,274
EXAM: ANALYSIS OF COLD CASES

1051
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,630
(suspenseful music continues)

1052
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:55,740
(munches)

1053
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,092
When did you break up with the art guy?

1054
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,426
What?

1055
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:18,680
Ahh...

1056
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,808
Well...
(chuckles)

1057
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:24,852
BLIND DATE GUY: Eunkang.

1058
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,605
I don't think we're a good match.
I'm sorry.

1059
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,066
I wasn't dumped, though.

1060
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:34,362
I also thought we weren't a good match.

1061
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:35,488
Ah...

1062
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:40,034
That was the only time
we had a date alone.

1063
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,953
We didn't do anything else together.

1064
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,498
And I never contacted him first.

1065
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:46,791
(chuckles)

1066
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,042
(dreamy music)

1067
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,045
You talk as if you were cheating.
(chuckles)

1068
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,797
Why are you making excuses?

1069
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,382
(laughs)
Well...

1070
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:58,428
EUNKANG: I just don't want
any misunderstandings.

1071
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,972
I don't want others to think
I dated him when I wasn't.

1072
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,682
That's why.

1073
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,392
Okay.
(chuckles)

1074
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,023
Hey, when will you buy me dinner?

1075
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,610
-Dinner?
-I saved your life.

1076
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,447
-Because I was an excellent sniper.
-You call that excellent?

1077
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:21,868
(gunshot)

1078
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:24,579
(gunshot)

1079
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,126
(gunshots)

1080
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,758
(gunshots)

1081
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:39,802
(gun cocks)

1082
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,096
(gunshots)

1083
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,188
(machine whirring)

1084
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,985
KNPU INDOOR SHOOTING RANGE

1085
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,542
(chuckles)

1086
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,046
EUNKANG: It's my first time
using real bullets.

1087
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:19,634
(exclaims)

1088
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,177
Let's do it again.

1089
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,680
This time, I'll show you for real.

1090
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,391
(machine whirring)

1091
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,813
(gun clacking)

1092
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,568
(gun clacking)

1093
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,281
(emotive music)

1094
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,659
Close your left eye.

1095
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,289
Use your right eye

1096
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:53,626
to align the sights.

1097
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,223
Stop breathing.

1098
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:08,933
(heart pound)

1099
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:12,353
EUNKANG: What's going on?
I actually can't breathe.

1100
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:15,022
Then aim at the center of the target.

1101
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:28,661
(gunshot)

1102
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:30,997
(bullet whooshes)

1103
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,085
(gasps)
Yes!

1104
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,556
(heart pounding)

1105
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,076
(closing theme music)
