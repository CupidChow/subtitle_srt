1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:06,172
What's the blood type of most cops?

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,298
Blood type?

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,678
Take your time. I'm going to the restroom.

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:12,846
Okay.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,435
(sniffs)

6
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,021
I've read that somewhere...

7
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,897
Was it A?

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,358
(cellphone buzzing)

9
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,902
WI SEUNGHYUN

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,364
Blood type...

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,867
(cellphone buzzing continues)

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,121
WI SEUNGHYUN

13
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:50,925
Hello?

14
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:52,969
JUCHAN: Hey, Seunghyun.

15
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,598
Is that you, Juchan?

16
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,682
Yes.

17
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,559
Eunkang went to the restroom.

18
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,643
Where are you?

19
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,270
Are you together now?

20
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,274
Never mind.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,359
I'll call her later.

22
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:09,903
Bye.

23
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:12,906
(cellphone beeps)

24
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,491
(sighs)

25
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,923
The most common blood type of cops is...

26
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,927
(in singsong) B-woo, B-woo.
(chuckles)

27
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,012
-What's that?
-(laughs)

28
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,806
What? It's type B.

29
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,557
(in singsong)
B-woo, B-woo.

30
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,975
(both chuckle)

31
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,393
You little punk.

32
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,522
What? You're just upset
that you didn't get the answer.

33
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,899
-Hey, you got a bump.
-Really?

34
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:51,361
-Just kidding.
-Gosh, you're so immature.

35
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,113
Seriously.

36
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,447
(exhales sharply)

37
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,740
(dogs barking in distance)

38
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,699
(reflective music)

39
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,992
-Go on in.
-(clears throat)

40
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,245
Okay.

41
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,500
Juchan.

42
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,837
-Chin up. You'll get through this.
-(chuckles)

43
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,297
When things get too hard, call me.

44
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,841
I can buy you a drink.

45
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,593
-You're being cheeky.
-What? I'm a grown-up now.

46
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,887
-I'm old enough to drink now.
-Just go home.

47
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,930
Okay.

48
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,104
-Good night.
-Bye.

49
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,074
(door closes)

50
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,795
(music fades)

51
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,047
(theme music)

52
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,554
(energetic music)

53
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,056
EPISODE 8

54
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,516
(whistle blowing)

55
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,772
(whistle blowing continues)

56
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,569
Hurry up.

57
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,486
(Eunkang grunts)

58
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,827
(Eunkang panting)

59
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,205
(panting)

60
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,165
(Eunkang exclaiming)

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,668
(panting)

62
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,465
Gosh!

63
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,507
(groans)

64
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,510
(Eunkang grunts)

65
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,930
(slurping)

66
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,309
Slow down. You might upset your stomach.

67
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,776
(exclaiming)
The food tastes amazing.

68
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,946
I feel like I'm in an Olympic Village
these days.

69
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,865
I wake up so early in the morning
and all I do is to eat, sleep, and run.

70
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,659
But it made you much stronger now.

71
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,327
At first, you could barely
make half the course.

72
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,496
At this rate, I'm going to be the winner.

73
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,456
Just focus on finishing the course.
That's your goal.

74
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,166
You don't know anything about me.

75
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,170
I got the best score
on the physical fitness test at my school.

76
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,672
Really?

77
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,924
I ran 1,000 meters in
4 minutes and 50 seconds.

78
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,760
I did 35 push-ups
and my grasping power measured 35.

79
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,139
I may not look it,
but I'm actually quite strong.

80
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,477
(grunting)

81
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,395
(exclaims)

82
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,773
(chuckles)

83
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,359
Okay. Then let's get right to it.

84
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,736
Forty...
(grunting)

85
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:40,738
...nine.

86
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,992
(sighs, pants)

87
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,536
Fifty...

88
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,371
(grunting)

89
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,290
Gosh.

90
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,749
(sighs)

91
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,460
You said you did 60 sit-ups
on the test. Was it a lie?

92
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,004
That was last year.

93
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,423
I'm a year older now. It's so hard.

94
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,340
(scoffs)

95
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,552
One more sit-up. Then we call it a day.

96
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,762
-Really?
-Yes.

97
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,264
(sighs)

98
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,016
(grunts)

99
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,396
(pants)

100
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,441
EUNKANG: What was that?

101
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,861
I was almost there. You messed it up.

102
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,238
You're just making an excuse.
I just laid one finger on you.

103
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,949
EUNKANG: Haven't you heard
of the expression,

104
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,993
"The straw that broke the camel's back"?

105
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,829
Apparently, she's still got some energy
to joke around.

106
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,414
Make sure to be hard on her.

107
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,166
Don't let her fool you
if she pretends to be sick.

108
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,919
-(scoffs)
-What? Oh, okay.

109
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,922
-What are you doing this evening?
-EUNKANG: What?

110
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,341
You said you'd buy me a drink.

111
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,635
Right. I'm free after classes.
I'll call you.

112
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,929
Okay. Keep it up then.

113
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,892
EUNKANG: Gosh. My whole body aches.

114
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,935
-Keep going.
-EUNKANG: Let's take a short break.

115
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,188
-Come on. Ten more sit-ups.
-Are we done after ten more?

116
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,814
-Just do it.
-(grunts)

117
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,902
EUNKANG: When he was my tutor,

118
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,071
I once faked being sick
because I didn't want to do homework.

119
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,073
I hate math so much.

120
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,701
Don't tell the others
that Juchan was my tutor.

121
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,786
Okay.

122
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,914
(sighs)
Where should we go?

123
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,957
There are too many students
near the school.

124
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,544
Do you know any quiet place
where we can talk over a drink?

125
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,088
Not really.

126
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,423
Are you talking about something serious?

127
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,966
Well...

128
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,303
It's just that
Juchan is having a hard time these days.

129
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,766
-Then maybe I should come too.
-What?

130
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,434
I'm free this evening too.

131
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,770
The more the merrier.

132
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:36,896
Ahh...

133
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,360
No. Not today.

134
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,529
Let's hang out together
another time. Okay?

135
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,780
-Okay.
-See you.

136
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,823
SEUNGHYUN: Bye.

137
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,450
(sighs)

138
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,702
-WOOYONG: Hey, Seunghyun.
-Yes?

139
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,539
-I saw you applied for the Cheering Squad.
-What?

140
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,165
Good luck. I'm looking forward to it.

141
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,837
Cheering?

142
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,713
I signed us up.

143
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,675
The highlight of Cheongram Sports
Festival is the freshmen's talent show.

144
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,928
Who else would do it besides us,
the handsome Freshmen Four?

145
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,888
What are you saying? Who said that?

146
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,140
Well, obviously, I say...

147
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,521
And I know we all agree with me.

148
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,982
Your mind, my mind. My mind, your mind.

149
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,067
In the end, we are all of the same mind.

150
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,903
Whatever. Good luck with that.
I'm out of this.

151
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,739
You can't be out. You're the center.

152
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,660
The name of our team is...

153
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,454
Wivengers.

154
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,539
Wow. You finally lost your mind.

155
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,999
You know what?

156
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,127
I've always thought of you
as our leader ever since we first met.

157
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,880
Having you in the center
makes me feel safe.

158
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,215
-Why am I...
-Don't ask why.

159
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,675
It's just because...

160
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,969
you're my favorite.

161
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,014
TAK: You're acting weird these days.

162
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,807
Does Seunghyun have something on you?

163
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,893
-Why are you sucking up to him?
-You little...

164
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,355
Hey. Seunghyun is not that kind of guy.

165
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,275
How could you not know how great he is?
You're even his roommate.

166
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,693
Gosh. You're upsetting me.

167
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,361
You're not mad, are you?

168
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,988
Anyway, I can't do the talent show.

169
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,825
BUMJU: Let's do it.

170
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,829
I want to try it.

171
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,998
It'll be a good memory too.

172
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,546
If you really don't feel like it,
we don't have to.

173
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,176
Okay. Let's do it.

174
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,722
Come on. Bumju wants to do it.
Let's do it.

175
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,307
(in English)
Yes!

176
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,936
(chuckles)
(in Korean) Okay.

177
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,147
I actually found some videos
that might help us.

178
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,148
You did?

179
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,778
EAST GYEONGGI PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

180
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,449
Here's the information
about Seunghyun's roommate you asked for.

181
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,617
Thanks.

182
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,743
DOCUMENTS FOR APPROVAL

183
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,620
PERSONAL INFORMATION
NAME: KIM TAK

184
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,164
His parents ran a small business
before dying in a car accident,

185
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,417
and his brother died ten years ago.
He was a KNPU student.

186
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,627
(suspenseful music)

187
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,589
My name is Kim Hyunsoo
and I'm a 4th-year law student at KNPU.

188
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,550
I'm Kim Hyunsoo.

189
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,720
(no audible dialogue)

190
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,688
Should I do more research?

191
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,607
No, it's okay. You can go now.

192
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,951
HIS BROTHER KIM HYUNSOO DIED
IN A CAR ACCIDENT WHILE ATTENDING KNPU

193
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,911
Did you bring your wallet?

194
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,663
Hello.

195
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,127
-Hi, Ari.
-Goodness.

196
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,131
Hi.

197
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,051
Hey. You want the one with red bean?

198
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,141
It's sold out.

199
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,286
(munches)

200
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,582
Why would he give me the strawberries?

201
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,376
Is he playing hard to get or what?

202
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,254
-Who's playing hard to get?
-What?

203
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,466
-No one.
-Hey, it's melting.

204
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,009
(slurps)

205
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,595
Darn it.

206
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,308
Gosh!

207
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,560
Why does he even like this?

208
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,479
Then give it to me. I love it.

209
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,524
Come on. Who is it?
Who is this boy tantalizing you?

210
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,028
He's not tantalizing anyone.
I'm not interested in him at all.

211
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,114
If anyone, he'd be the one
being tantalized, not me.

212
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,991
Tsss... So there is a guy.

213
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,326
I don't know!

214
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,161
He's not my type anyway.

215
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,206
I hate corny country boys like him.

216
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,208
ARI: Like I'd care
if he has a crush on me.

217
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,834
(munching)

218
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:15,132
(birds chirping)

219
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,391
(exhales sharply)

220
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,725
JUCHAN: What are you doing this evening?

221
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,894
EUNKANG: I'm free after classes.
I'll call you.

222
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,818
-(sizzling)
-(indistinct chattering)

223
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,152
FEMALE CUSTOMER: Cheers!

224
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,197
(indistinct chattering)

225
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,138
THE CAFE IS OPEN
TAKEOUT AVAILABLE

226
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,557
RESTAURANT ENTRANCE

227
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,360
It's cut like a pizza.

228
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,071
Right. Pizzas like this are really good.

229
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,239
Right. But I haven't really tried.

230
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,574
-You haven't?
-No. Not so many times.

231
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,867
Oh.

232
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,078
-Hey.
-I didn't know you were here.

233
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,247
-Hello.
-Hey.

234
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,790
What are you doing here?

235
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,334
-I came to grab a drink.
-Alone?

236
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,546
I love drinking alone. Well...

237
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,132
I just came across this bar.
It seems nice, so I came in.

238
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,092
What a funny coincidence.
(chuckles)

239
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,470
Actually, Seunghyun,
why don't you join us?

240
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,971
Is that okay with you?

241
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,182
SEUNGHYUN: I hope I'm not bothering you.

242
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,189
Could we have another glass, please?

243
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,399
JUCHAN: Cheers.

244
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,821
(exhales)

245
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,116
Help yourself. It's my treat.

246
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,328
-No, it's on me.
-There you go, being cheeky again.

247
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,789
I said I was going to pay today.

248
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,624
You always paid for me.

249
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,335
-I'm not that shameless.
-You can be shameless.

250
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:18,297
That's an unusual color for a wallet.
It really stands out.

251
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,841
Really? Eunkang got it for me.

252
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,762
EUNKANG: I gave it to him for his birthday
when I was a high school freshman.

253
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,432
But Juchan,
I think you should get a new one.

254
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,642
It seems all worn out.

255
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,352
It looks fine to me.
I can use it for at least ten more years.

256
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,230
EUNKANG: It's not even real leather.

257
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,441
I couldn't get you a good one
because I didn't have money then.

258
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,903
But I really like this wallet.

259
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,823
To be honest, I lost it twice.

260
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,908
But it always found its way back to me.

261
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,035
-EUNKANG: Really?
-Yeah.

262
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,371
-I must be destined to keep it.
-How interesting.

263
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,207
-Right?
-You must not have had much cash in it.

264
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,170
-I guess so.
-I think that's probably why.

265
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,840
If there was,
it wouldn't have been returned.

266
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,550
(chuckles awkwardly)
Maybe you're right.

267
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,051
I'm going to use the restroom.

268
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,303
(Eunkang exclaims)

269
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,140
-Let's drink.
-Okay.

270
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,435
(sips)

271
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,787
-Eunkang is a fine girl, isn't she?
-Pardon?

272
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,789
Right.

273
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,795
She may look stubborn, fussy, and fiesty,

274
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,047
but inside, she has a soft heart.
She's also very caring.

275
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,090
I know.

276
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,926
Please take good care of her.

277
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,138
-You're her colleague, so be nice to her.
-Okay.

278
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,724
That's a weird thing to ask though.

279
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,184
It's not like she's your girlfriend.

280
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,020
(reflective music)

281
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,605
(chuckles softly)

282
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,233
(sips)

283
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:03,903
(exhales)

284
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,782
I've known her since she was little,

285
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,368
so she has always been
like a little sister to me.

286
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,829
But seeing her at school now,
it feels different.

287
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,249
These days, I even find myself
relying on her when things get tough.

288
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,834
(sucks lips)

289
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,961
It's natural that you feel comfortable

290
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,839
around the person you're familiar with
during hard times.

291
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,736
-I have to get this.
-SEUNGHYUN: Sure.

292
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,958
RESTROOM

293
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,877
Eunkang.

294
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,963
Can we talk for a moment?

295
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,054
(crockery clanging)

296
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,941
(emotive music)

297
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,819
It looks like
Seunghyun came because of you.

298
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,991
I'm sorry.
I wanted to make you feel better today.

299
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,995
I think he likes you.

300
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,121
What?

301
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,041
Oh, no.
There's nothing going on between us.

302
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,378
It's not like he confessed to me.

303
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,469
Then can I say it first?

304
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,222
You once said you liked me.

305
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,642
Do you still feel the same?

306
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,611
I...

307
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,032
like...

308
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,325
you too.

309
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,464
But I like you as a senior.

310
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,968
I like someone else now.

311
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,141
I see.

312
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,029
(door chimes open)

313
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,783
OPERATOR: The person you have reached
is unavailable...

314
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,911
Where did he go? Why won't he pick up?

315
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,333
(door chimes)

316
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,922
(thuds)

317
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,092
(groans, blows air)

318
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,512
(Hanna breathes heavily)

319
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,978
(gasps)

320
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,148
(groans)

321
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,942
47TH CHEONGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL

322
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,114
JUCHAN: Athletes' oath.

323
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,740
STUDENTS: Athletes' oath!

324
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,078
BOTH: We promise to take part
in the 47th Cheongram Sports Festival,

325
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,539
respecting and abiding by the rules
that govern them,

326
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:48,127
and in the true spirit of sportsmanship,
for the glory of sport

327
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,670
and the honor of KNPU.

328
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,338

00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,467
UNITE AS ONE CHEONGRAM FAMILY WITH PASSION

00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,803
BE A WARNING TO THE PEOPLE

331
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,722
Today is finally the day
of the Cheongram Sports Festival,

332
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,808
which you've been looking forward to.

333
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,061
SOONYOUNG: I know how hard you've worked
for the midterms.

334
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,983
Today, I hope you can make the most of
all the strength you've been building up,

335
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,068
showing us your youth and passion.

336
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,112
But what's most important is

337
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,364
that we don't have any injuries.

338
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,450
I hope we can all sweat
and compete safely,

339
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,121
and that this event
will bring us all together.

340
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:28,208
Now, let's begin
the 47th Cheongram Sports Festival.

(crowd cheering)

358
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,371
Professor Bang.
Let's drop rank during the game, okay?

359
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,748
Don't be easy on me
just because I'm the dean.

360
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,292
But how can I...

361
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,793
All right, then.

362
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,837
-(in English) Fair play!
-(staff in Korean) Ready.

363

(crowd cheering)

364
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,339

00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,259

366
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,929

(crowd cheering)

374
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,074
One! Lie down!

375
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,201
Just lie down!

376
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,580
Pull it!

377
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,041
Lie down!

378
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,959
Just lie down!

379
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,757
RELAY RACE

380
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,767
Ready.

381
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,270
(crowd cheering, shouting indistinctly)

382
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,148
UM HYUK IS WATCHING YOU!

383
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,067
STUDENT SQUAD 1 IS THE CHAMPION!

384

(tense energetic music)

387
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,916
(crowd cheering)

388
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:07,719
STUDENT SQUAD 1 IS THE CHAMPION!

(crowd cheering)

391
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,453
(Eunkang grunting, panting)

392
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,045
(thrilling music)

393
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,131
Hurry!

394
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,133
-You're almost there!
-Come on.

395
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,592
Hurry!

396
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,601
UM HYUK IS WATCHING YOU!
TODAY'S PAIN WILL BRING SWEET VICTORY

397
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,455
(crowd cheering)

398
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,584
(music stops abruptly)

399
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,420
(footsteps)

400
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,260
(victorious music)

401
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,387
(crowd cheering, applauding)

402
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,726
THUMBS UP TO US!

403
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:38,894
(smooches)

404
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,451
(music fades)

405
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,331
(playful music)

406
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,400
-(screaming)
-(crowd cheering, applauding)

407
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,078
(whimsical music)

408
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:43,250
STUDENT SQUAD 2 LOSES

409
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,760
(Daeil crying)

410
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,137
(sniffles)

411
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,515
(wailing)

412
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,602
(cries, sniffles)

413
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,563
Hey, Daeil, are you all right?

414
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,481
(coughs, wailing)

415
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,278
It can happen to anyone.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

416
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,991
(Daeil whimpering, mumbling)

417
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,455
(sniffles, crying)

418
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,457
Help yourself, Professor Bang.

419
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,293
You worked hard today.

420
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,502
(chuckles, clears throat)

421
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,754
He's right. Eat up, Professor Bang.

422
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,049
Professor Bang.
I've discovered a new side of you today.

423
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,845
If Student Squad Two wins this year,

424
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,180
you should be the MVP.

425
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,098
(clears throat)

426
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,808
UGON: Come on. You're just being humble.

427
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,311
She was really famous
even back when she was a student here.

428
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,521
Do you know what she was called?

429
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,815
-UGON: Ms. Loud Voice.
-What?

430
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,276
Because her voice was so loud,
she was called Ms. Loud Voice.

431
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,112
She was infamous.
(laughing)

432
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,739
(Soonyoung laughs)

433
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,950
It's tasty.

434
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,453
SOONYOUNG: Well, you can call it
a skill too.

435
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,456
I mean, they say
even the ancient Roman soldiers

436
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,459
shouted in the battlefield
to sap the morale of their enemies.

437
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,461
(chuckles)

438
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,423
By the way, you know what?

439
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,550
I still can't believe...

440
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,511
that you two were in the same class here.

441
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:22,098
I studied law for two years before
coming here, making me two years older.

442
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,768
Still, it's hard to believe.

443
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:28,229
Hearing that you were colleagues
surprises me every time.

444
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,607
Is it that hard to believe?
(laughing)

445
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,026
Professor Cha.
(clears throat)

446
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,695
She's saying you look old. Okay?

447
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,531
Ahh...

448
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,826
(swallows, chuckles)

449
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,329
(both laughing)

450
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,331
KNPU

451
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,084
-We've got to really get it together.
-Just you, man.

452
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,671
FEMALE STUDENT 1: That's why
you should be good at running.

453
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,005
MALE STUDENT 2: But still...

454
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,008
FEMALE STUDENT 2: Women's triathlon
will decide everything.

455
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,134
(overlapping conversation)

456
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,970
ARI: As expected,
it's a battle between Squads One and Two.

457
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,973
JUYOUNG: We're winning for now,
but we've got to be careful.

458
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,142
There's only a five-point difference.

459
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,895
The games in the afternoon
will decide the victor.

460
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:09,896
(indistinct chattering)

461
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,065
TOTAL SCORE, CURRENT RANKINGS

462
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,780
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

463
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,365
Got it?

464
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,076
STUDENT SQUAD 1'S INTELLIGENCE AND PASSION
WILL LEAD TO VICTORY!

465
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,663
What's wrong with your foot?

466
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,833
Oh, hey. I just hurt it a bit.

467
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,544
-Are you okay?
-EUNKANG: I can still run. Don't worry.

468
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,713
SEUNGHYUN: Why didn't you tell me?

469
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,756
You should have told me
even if it's a small injury.

470
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,842
I didn't have the chance.

471
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,386
You even told me
to practice alone yesterday.

472
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,849
Sorry. Our team had a meeting that day.

473
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,185
What kind of meeting takes the whole day?

474
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,817
Tell me. Are you mad at me?

475
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,404
You left the bar without telling me,
and you didn't answer my calls.

476
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,992
No. I went home that night
because I wasn't feeling well.

477
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,456
STAFF 1: All triathlon participants,
please prepare for the game now.

478
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,208
All trench fight participants
may also wait in the arena.

479
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,752
Let's get going.

480
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:17,213
SEUNHYUK: You've been training hard,
so I'm sure you'll do a good job.

481
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,840
Take it easy though.

482
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,800
-Your goal is to finish the course.
-Okay.

483
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,303
Good luck to you too. Don't hurt yourself.

484
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,596
Thanks.

485
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,601
(crowd clamoring, cheering)

486
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,481
Seunghyun.

487
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,946
There's something I want to tell you
after the game.

488
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,157
What is it?

489
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,577
I'll tell you after I win. See you later.

490
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,206
(bike chain clattering)

491
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,794
Don't hurt yourself.

492
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,129
Good luck.

493
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,257
(exhales sharply)

494
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,887
If you get injured or don't feel well,

495
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,680
wave the handkerchief immediately.

496
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,935
(crowd cheering, applauding)

497
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,528
On your marks!

498
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,034
(upbeat music)

499
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,870
(gunshot)

500
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,622
TRIATHLON

501
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,300
Trench fight is all about strength.

502
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,554
We're going to make use
of our physical advantage to the utmost.

503
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,430
Let me pair you up
with each of their players.

504
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,474
Make sure to mark them thoroughly.

505
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,143
Who's marking Kim Tak? It won't be easy.

506
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,395
Right, he's strong.

507
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,522
-Hey, Juchan is...
-It'll be tough even for Juchan.

508
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,232
-Kim Tak?
-We'll have him marked...

509
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,276
by you.

510
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,277
Pardon?

511
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,163
You need to push the entire
opposing team out of the trench to win.

512
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,791
Take one step out of the trench,

513
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,127
and you're out. Understood?

514
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,670
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

515
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:21,880
Captains.

516
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,381
STAFF 2: Shake hands.

517
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,760
(crowd cheering, shouting indistinctly)

518
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,057
(whistle blowing)

519
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,142
Let's go.

520
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,524
JUCHAN: All right.

521
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,692
INSIK: Let's do this!

522
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,777
-Okay!
-Let's do this!

523
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,949
-(crowd cheering)
-Go for it!

524
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,786
Let's go!

525
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,581
(crowd cheering, applauding)

526
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,086
(rock music)

527
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,254
LET'S GET 1ST PLACE

528
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,967
-(whistle blows)
-(crowd cheering)

529
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,473
(water splashes)

530
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,520
(grunts)

531
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,567
(crowd cheering, shouting indistinctly)

532
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,821
You're out!

533
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,621
(grunts)

534
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,499
(screams)

535
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,708
(in English)
Out!

536
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:45,922
(grunts)

537
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,884
(in English)
Out!

538
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,264
(grunts)

539
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,102
(screaming)

540
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,691

544
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,257
(crowd chanting indistinctly)

545
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,070
This is the final lap.

546
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,655
(bell ringing)

547
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,868
(crowd cheering)

548
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:57,952
(thrilling music)

549
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,212
If Tak is our last man standing,
we'll win hands down.

550
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,382
Our goal is to cover him
and make it a one-on-one match.

551
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,343
Squad One will try
to make Tak their last man standing.

552
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,637
We will sacrifice a player
to remove him before that.

553
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,893
(upbeat music)

554
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,853
-(whistle blows)
-(crowd clamoring)

555
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,731

556
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,745
(screams)

557
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,208
(in English)
Out!

558
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,795
(yelps)

559
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,255
(crowd cheering)

560
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,677
But what if Tak gets pushed out first?

561
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,263
When that happens...

562
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,685
I'll stall for time then.

563
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,271
(grunts)

564
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,612
Lift him up.

565
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,825
Come on.
(struggling)

566
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,577
(grunts)

567
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,208
Juchan! Look at Seunghyun! Look at him!

568
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,845
(grunting)

569
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,599
SEUNGHYUN: Come on! Juchan!

570
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,687
(grunting)

571
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,822
(grunting)

572
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,574
Squad Two, out!

573
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,661
If you'd come a little later,
the whole plan would have failed.

574
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,164
But I didn't. Gosh. This is killing me.

575
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,832
(both panting)

576
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,592
(whistle blows)

577
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,427
Student Squad One wins!

578
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,637
(crowd clamoring)

579
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:33,983
STUDENT SQUAD 1 WINS

580
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,699
(thrilling upbeat music)

581
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:53,878
(grunts)

582
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,380
FEMALE STUDENT 3: Come on. Stand up.

583
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,133
-We've got to win.
-I'm so sorry. Go ahead.

584
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,052
-FEMALE STUDENT 4: Sorry.
-FEMALE STUDENT 3: See you soon.

585
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,265
Kim Semi of Student Squad Two forfeits.

586
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,934
(squad two clamors)

587
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,160
This is the halfway point!

588
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,828
-STAFF 3: Okay!
-STAFF4: Okay!

589
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,164
-STAFF 4: You can do it!
-STAFF 5: You're doing great!

590
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,500
(squad 1 cheering)

591
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:40,299
SQUAD 1: Ko Eunkang! Ko Eunkang!
Ko Eunkang! Ko Eunkang!

592
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:44,595
(squad 1 chanting continues)

593
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,014
-DAEIL (in English): Yes! Yes!
-(crowd cheering)

594
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,099
(in Korean)
She might make a comeback.

595
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:52,061
SQUAD 2: Baek Sunyu!
Baek Sunyu! Baek Sunyu!

596
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,443
Pace yourself. Take it slow.
(breathing heavily)

597
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,403
(grunts)

598
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,488

Go! Go! Go!

604
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:23,968
It's raining!

605
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,554
(crowd clamoring)

606
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,473

(drone whirring)

610
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,534
JUYOUNG: I think it fell
because of the rain.

611
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,869
I don't think I can fix it.

612
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,038
(sighs)
That's a shame.

613
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,373
I guess we should use the radio
to see how it's going.

614
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,626
How strange though. The forecast
didn't say it was going to rain.

615
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,046
I know. I think it'll stop soon though.

616
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,048
Why does it have to rain now?

617
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,010

619
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,305
It hurts.

00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,593
Thank goodness.

632
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,887
I knew I wasn't supposed to die here.

633
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,931
Please help me. I can't walk.

634
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,891
Just forfeit.

635
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,227
The staff is coming soon, so tell them.

636
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,186
What?

637
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,148
Hey, you can't just leave. Help me.

638
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,067
Why should I help you?

639
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,736
Because we're on the same team.

640
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,323
You never shoot friendly fire during a war
no matter how much you hate them.

641
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,163
If this is a war, it's a great chance
to shoot your teammate quietly.

COURSE DIRECTION

643
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,792
Hey.

644
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,171
EUNKANG: Hey! Why do you hate me?

645
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,423
What is it that I did so wrong?

646
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,967
Telling the Training Corps
that the spy cam belonged to you?

647
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,719
I did that because you framed me for it.

648
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,387
Don't you remember
what you did to me first?

649
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,889
Do you even have a conscience?

650
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,099
I told you I didn't mean to
frame you for it.

651
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,477
And I said it was an accident.

652
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,022
Anyway, if you hadn't brought
the charger to the Training Corps,

653
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,357
things wouldn't have become
so complicated.

654
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,651
HANNA: Then you acted
like you worried about me.

655
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,612
(scoffs)
Seriously.

656
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,031
So stop being such a hypocrite.

657
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,115
Hypo...

658
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,201
I'm not being a hypocrite

659
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,369
and I wasn't necessarily
worrying about you either.

660
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,830
EUNKANG: Why would I care about you?
I've got my own problems to deal with.

661
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,709
I brought it into question
because I thought it was unfair.

662
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,962
But fine. I get you're mad.

663
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,381
But thanks to what you filmed
with the spy cam,

664
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,343
Cheongram Education got abolished.
That's all that matters, isn't it?

665
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:56,013
You filmed it to let others know
how absurd the punishment system was.

666
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,681
And you achieved your goal.

667
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,894
Technically, we abolished
Cheongram Education together.

668
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,479
So you should be happy about it.

669
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,776
(scoffs)

670
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,613
Now I get why I hate you.

671
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,658
Being with you
makes me look like a horrible person.

672
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,244
That's why I hate you. Happy now?

673
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,871
(emotive music)

674
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,256
(sighs)

675
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,720
STAFF 7: The leading group
is passing the main gate.

676
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,223
They're coming.

677
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,603
She's here!

678
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,773
(squad 2 clamoring)

679
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,066
(uplifting music)

680
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,985
SQUAD 2: Baek Sunyu!

681
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,904
(squad 2 cheering)

682
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,491
(squad 2 chanting, cheering continues)

683
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,082
(music fades)

684
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,295
(breathes deeply)

685
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,547
(birds chirping)

686
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,806
Get up.

687
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,356
With this, everything's settled
between you and me.

688
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,483
This is for saving me from being expelled.

689
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,779
Wait.

690
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,157
(Eunkang clears throat)

691
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,326
COURSE DIRECTION

692
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,870
(squad 2 clamoring)

693
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,501
STUDENT SQUAD 2 WINS

694
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,007
(cheering)

695
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,222
What happened to them?

696
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,225
I don't know about Hanna,

697
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,311
but Eunkang was in the lead
until the halfway point.

698
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,854
(clicks tongue)

699
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,439
Maybe she tripped somewhere.

700
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,488
-SEUNGHYUN: What's wrong with your foot?
-I just hurt it a bit.

701
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,949
(squad 2 cheering)

702
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,702
Hey! Where are you going?

703
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,582
(clears throat)

704
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,169
It's great you decided
to take responsibility for your actions.

705
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,504
I'll gladly accept your offer.

706
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:37,132
So we're all good now.
Do you know what that means?

707
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,718
We start all over again.
Back to square one.

708
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:40,886
Gosh!
(pants)

709
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,680
Be quiet, will you?

710
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,264
I'm tired.

711
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,685
Could you slow down a little?
It really hurts.

712
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,395
(wind whooshing)

713
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,148
We can't win anyway.
No one's waiting for us.

714
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:56,860
(Eunkang groans)

715
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,990
(both panting)

716
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,369
Hey, Misook.

717
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:07,955
Well done.

718
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,169
Everyone came back
except Eunkang and Hanna.

719
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,130
DAEIL: Maybe something bad
happened to them.

720
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,464
Okay.

721
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,176
It seems the radio isn't working
in the mountains right now.

722
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,970
The staff don't know
what's going on either.

723
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,724
I'll go check out the mountain.

724
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,560
Hey.

725
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,520
There they are.

726
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,691
(uplifting music)

727
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,155
I'll walk myself. Just hold me.

728
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,658
It's okay. That'll take forever.

729
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,912
Guys!

730
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,664
(Eunkang groans)

731
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,708
ARI: Eunkang.

732
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,920
-What happened? Did you get hurt?
-Yes.

733
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:00,632
You should have taken your phone
with you in case of emergency.

734
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,135
-We need to call the ambulance.
-It's okay.

735
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,179
I want to finish the race.

736
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,932
I know I can't win,

737
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,934
but I want to finish it.

738
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,189
Hanna, let's go.

739
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,239
JUYOUNG: Hey. Give it.

740
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,699
BUMJU: Shouldn't we be stopping them?

741
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,326
-ARI: Are you sure?
-JUYOUNG: My gosh.

742
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,786
-BUMJU: That must hurt.
-ARI: Really.

743
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,038
ARI: I think she's bleeding.

744
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,751
-You're almost there! Keep going!
-You can do it!

745
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:39,379
(crowd cheering, applauding)

746
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,352
(crowd cheering, applauding continues)

747
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,236
(uplifting music continues)

748
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,458
(crowd cheering, applauding continues)

749
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,170
JUCHAN: Are you okay?

750
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:24,091
-Yes. Water...
-JUYOUNG: Ari, get her some water.

751
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,885
(breathing heavily)

752
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,101
(groans)

753
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,104
I'm sorry. I wanted to win.

754
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,063
(chuckles)

755
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,356
You're being cheeky again.

756
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,608
(laughs)

757
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,986
(breathes heavily)

758
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,497
(gasps)

759
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,208
Well done.

760
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,713
You finished the race
and didn't abandon your friend.

761
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,220
(shuddering)

762
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,180
(sobs)

763
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,393
STUDENT SQUAD 1 IS THE CHAMPION!

764
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,105
(emotive music)

765
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,648
Hanna.

766
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,360
Thank you.

767
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,196
I wouldn't have made it to the end
without you.

768
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,579
Let's start from square one again.

769
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,220
(emotive music continues)

770
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,317
(cheering, applauding)

771
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,571
Well done.

772
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,989
Well done.

773
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,325
You were pretty cool back there.

774
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:14,910
You did a good job.

775
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,415
SEUNGHYUN: If someone asks me
why I like Eunkang,

776
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,709
my answer would be

777
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,380
because she never gives up on people.

778
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,091
All right.

779
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,886
DAEIL: Come on, Tak. Get closer.

780
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,305
-Come on. Come closer.
-EUNKANG: Hurry.

781
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,225
All right. Here we go.
This is our first group photo.

782
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,309
Okay? Let's get this done at once.

783
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,728
Do we have to take a photo
when we're all sweaty though?

784
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,355
I look a bit messy now.

785
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,649
You're the prettiest here. Actually,
I've never seen you this pretty...

786
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:46,817
-Really?
-No.

787
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,653
-One, two, three.
-Three.

788
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:50,696
(phone camera clicks)

789
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,948
-Should we take another one?
-Let's take another one.

790
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,366
Okay. Smile.

791
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,034
One, two, three.

792
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,786
(phone camera clicks)

793
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,460
FEMALE HOST: All right. That was
just the beginning of the show.

794
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,171
The next team has
such an extraordinary name.

795
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,549
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a big round of applause

796
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:14,344
to Gentlemen Always Pay for Dinner!

797
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:17,681
(crowd cheering, applauding)

798
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,024
(upbeat music playing)

799
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,651
(crowd cheering, applauding)

800
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,830
FEMALE HOST: The senior students'
dance party!

801
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,836
(crowd cheering continues)

802
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,553
FEMALE HOST: My gosh.
Our seniors are so hot.

803
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,071
(crowd cheering continues)

804
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,081
Are you nervous?

805
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,665
I'm sure you haven't performed
on a big stage like this,

806
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,001
but don't you worry. I got your back.

807
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,004
Worry about yourself
and focus on getting the beat.

808
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,757
He's right. You started
too early at the final rehearsal.

809
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,510
-I'm worried.
-Don't you worry, boys.

810
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,637
I'll be good
once we start the actual performance.

811
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,472
Hey, where's that thing from earlier?
Hang on.

812
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:41,431
(breathing nervously)
Calming pills.

813
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,517
-Can I have one too?
-Sorry. I've only got one.

814
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,768
Then can I have the half...

815
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,897
All right.

816
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,943
GROUP: Let's do this.

817
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,277
DAEIL: One, two...

818
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,987
-I need to use the bathroom.
-Wait, me too.

819
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,281
I want to pee too.

820
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:12,170
FEMALE HOST: My gosh. Look at
our hot seniors! Make some noise!

821
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,174
(upbeat music continues)

822
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,265
(crowd cheering, applauding)

823
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:34,067
We watched the seniors' dance moves,
now we have to watch the freshmen too.

824
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,696
-For sure.
-The freshmen will take the stage next.

825
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:41,575
WOOYONG: Let me introduce
KNPU's four prettiest boys,

826
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:45,036
BOTH: Wivengers!

827
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,124
(upbeat music)

828
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,753
(crowd cheering)

829
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,858
(lipsyncing)

830
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,820
(crowd cheering, applauding)

831
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,163

(crowd cheering, applauding)

838
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,801
SEUNGHYUN: That's stupid.

839
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,136
You don't know
if you're uncomfortable or excited?

840
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,765
EUNKANG: It's confusing.
That's why I'm asking.

841
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,934
SEUNGHYUN: Then meet someone
who doesn't confuse you.

842
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,228
If you really like someone,
you won't be confused.

843
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,526
Don't quit.

844
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,028
Let's see through it to the end.

845
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,531
(uplifting music continues)

846
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,534
(crowd cheering)

847
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,096
(lipsyncing)

848
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,856
(crowd cheering)

849
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,740
(crowd cheering, applauding)

850
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,832
WOOYONG: How could they be sexier than me
when I'm dressed like this?

851
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:36,958
-WOOYONG: This is not fair.
-FEMALE HOST: My gosh.

852
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,335
FEMALE STUDENT: That's not true!

853
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,796
FEMALE HOST: The freshmen
really made my heart flutter.

854
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:46,634
WOOYONG: Sadly, now we only have
the final highlight of the festival left.

855
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,928
However, this is the moment

856
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,057
you can be as passionate
and crazy as you want.

857
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,267
It's time for the dance battle!

858
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,644
(crowd cheering)

859
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,564
Are you ready?

860
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:00,774
STUDENTS: Yes!

861
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,695
It looks like you're not ready.
I'll come back next year then.

862
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,781
(crowd cheering)

863
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:12,160
WOOYONG: All right. That's better.
Let me ask you again. Are you ready?

864
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,411

865
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:17,082

866
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,085
Student Squad One, come on out first.

867
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,129
(upbeat music)

868
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,925
(crowd cheering)

869
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,724
Can we talk for a second?

870
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,480
FEMALE HOST: What an outstanding move!

871
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:50,073
WOOYONG: Do it before the professors
see you. No. They're going to freak out.

872
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,492
FEMALE HOST: Student Squad One,
you can come back in.

873
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,911
WOOYONG: Student Squad Two.
You don't want to lose, do you?

874
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,788

Student Squad Two!

875

00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,833
(crowd cheering)

877
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,469
SEUNGHYUN: You said you had something
you wanted to tell me after the race.

878
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,265
-Yes.
-What is it?

879
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,602
Hmm...

880
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,563
Well...

881
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,778
I...

882
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:33,116
I think I like...

883
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,710
(romantic music)

884
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,505
SEUNGHYUN: Let me say it first.

885
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,843
I know you like someone else,

886
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,845
but I still like you.

887
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:55,930
EUNKANG: What?

888
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,933
But you're the one I like.

889
00:57:59,142 --> 00:57:59,976
(fireworks whistle)

890
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,271
(fireworks crack)

891
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,081
(romantic music continues)

892
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,481
(fireworks crack)
