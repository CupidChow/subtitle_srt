EPISODE 15

3
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,173
Hey, Hanna…

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,557
HANNA: I sent you all the money I made
from tutoring, so don't call me.

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,102
I can't do the tutoring job
during the semester.

6
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,187
I gave you all of my savings.

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,689
How much debt are you in?

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,649
What?

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,942
(footsteps approaching)

10
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,404
You're crazy.

11
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:38,997
-(Hanna sighs)
-(phone buzzing)

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,623
(suspenseful music)

13
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,624
Hello?

14
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,545
EUISEOK: It won't be that difficult.

15
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,299
We just want you to let us know

16
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,718
how these three are doing at school.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,137
Are you asking me to spy on my classmates?

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,139
Well, let's say
you'll just be watching them.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,142
It's not your first time doing this.

20
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,729
I know you used a spy cam
during Cheongram Education.

21
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,981
Did you do a background check on me?

22
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,067
This is supposed to be confidential,

23
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,611
so we can't let anyone do the job.

24
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,824
It seems like you thought
I'd gladly accept your offer,

25
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,826
but too bad.

26
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,245
I'm not interested.

27
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,498
I've got to go.

28
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,960
What about 150 million won?

29
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,088
(suspenseful music)

30
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,049
SAVINGS ACCOUNT
SHIN EUISEOK

31
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,967
EUISEOK: That should be enough
for compensation.

32
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,099
(suspenseful music continues)

33
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,105
EUISEOK: If your mother
doesn't settle her debt this month,

34
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,689
won't she be arrested?

35
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,067
-Roar!
-(gasps)

36
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,819
What was that?

37
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,737
Sorry.
(chuckles)

38
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,696
Did I startle you?

39
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,158
DAEIL: Where have you been?
Did you have dinner?

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,662
Do I have to tell you everything I do?

41
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,497
No.

42
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,500
If you hadn't eaten yet,
I thought we could...

43
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,668
I'm not hungry.

44
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,962
I have something to tell you.

45
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,839
(crickets creaking)

46
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,636
Here.

47
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,187
-What's this?
-You can't tutor during the semester.

48
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,439
It's not much,

49
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,733
but I hope it helps.

50
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,237
What?

51
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,406
Are you touched?

52
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,908
DAEIL: No pressure.

53
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,494
I just took a part-time job
on the weekends. No biggie.

54
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,789
(inhales)
When I make more money later...

55
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,751
(emotive music)

56
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,628
What are you trying to pull here?

57
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,758
-Hanna.
-Why are you doing this to me?

58
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,804
Do you expect me
to just take it and say thanks?

59
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,975
-No, that's not...
-HANNA: You…

60
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,269
Why do you have to make me feel so small?

61
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:10,106
(sobs)
Why? Who do you think you are?

62
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,941
Hanna, that's not what I mean.

63
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,194
(emotive music continues)

64
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,906
Get lost. Don't talk to me again.

65
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,963
(crickets creaking)

66
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:39,219
DAEIL: One star for memories,
one star for love,

67
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,180
and one star for Daeil.

68
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:43,973
(sighs)

69
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,309
Looking at these beautiful things,
it reminds me of you.

70
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,020
(message tone)

71
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,231
(emotive music continues)

72
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,194
It was thoughtless of me to do
something like that without asking you.

73
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,116
Also…

74
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,703
it hurts me when you say mean things,

75
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,124
but I still want to be with you.

76
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,336
(breathes deeply)

77
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,713
(exhales sharply)

78
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,884
(emotive music)

79
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,974
(sighs)

80
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,894
HANNA: I crossed the line the other day.
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,230
I wanted to say this face to face…

82
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,573
YOO DAEIL

DAEIL'S MOTHER: Daeil…

94
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,860
Daeil.

95
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,073
Daeil, let's go home with Mom.

96
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,533
Let's go home.

97
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,624
-DAEIL'S MOTHER: Daeil!

How can you leave us like this?

99
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,880
(women wailing)

100
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,049
I'm sorry, Daeil…

101
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,306
No, my baby… My son…

102
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,018
Mommy is here. Let's go home with me…

103
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,979

DECEASED, YOO DAEIL

No! No, you can't!

00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,918
No…

109
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,545

110
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,217

(reflective music)

112
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,637
DAEIL: Your name was Kim Tak, right?

113
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,013
I hope we get along.

114
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,724
From now on, you're on Team Yoo.

115
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,893
Detective Lee Jaehan.

116
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,062
Do you guys do this too?

117
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,231
(exclaiming)

118
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,150
-We're more than just friends. Okay?
-(students clamoring)

119
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,568
Let's always be good friends.

-DAEIL: They're friendship rings.
-What?

121
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,488
Let's be friends forever.

122
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,199
-Let's go, then!
-(group cheering)

123
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,619
All right. Here we go.
This is our first group photo. Okay?

124
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,247
Let's get this done at once. In one, two,

125
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,206
-three!
-Three.

126
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,207

00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,795
(reflective music continues)

128
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:53,097
I was reminded of my roommate while
looking at the stars, so I called you.

129
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,439
(women crying)

130
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,488
DAEIL'S MOTHER: Daeil.

131
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,406
-How could you?
-(sniffles)

132
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,328
Hey, get back inside. Come on. Go.

133
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,829
-Hurry…
-Hey!

134
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,914
You take this.

135
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,249
Come on. Let's take one together.

136
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,251
They say photos are the best souvenirs.

137
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,628
-Three!
-(camera shutter clicks)

139

Attention!

140
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,727
Present arms.

141
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,779
SEUNGHYUN: Order arms.

DECEASED, YOO DAEIL

HERE LIES A YOUNG MAN WHO DREAMED
TO BE A PASSIONATE DETECTIVE

144
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,679
BUMJU: How can a person

145
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,723
disappear overnight like this?

146
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,851
I still feel like

147
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,688
he will just show up and say, "Gotcha".

148
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,859
If I had known this would happen,
I wouldn't have been so mean to him.

149
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,153
JUYOUNG: I should have let him play
all my games.

150
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,155
If he needed money,
he should have told us.

151
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,116
Why did he have to do
the stupid chauffeur job?

152
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,742
BUMJU: Seunghyun.

153
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,869
You said you talked to Daeil
on the phone that day.

154
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,913
Did he say anything in particular?

155
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,873
(somber music)

156
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:43,874
No.

157
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,712
SEUNGHYUN: He said he went to a villa
in Gapyeong to chauffeur someone.

158
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,256
Then he said his client wouldn't come out,

159
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,550
so he might as well
just go practice driving.

160
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,552
I should have stopped him then.

161
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,346
I should have.

162
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,434
You didn't know he would
get into a car accident like that.

163
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,688
JUYOUNG: Have they found the dashcam yet?

164
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,900
Daeil's family even hired a diver
to search the bottom of the reservoir,

165
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,321
but they couldn't find anything.

166
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,991
They also hung a banner
looking for witnesses,

167
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,075
but no one has called yet.

168
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,452
What about the security cameras?

169
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,579
There must have been a security camera
near the road.

170
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,581
There was a security camera,

171
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,167
but they said there were
no other cars there except Daeil's car.

172
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,877
They must have checked
the footage already.

173
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,546
The cause of death was obvious, drowning.

174
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,506
There was no sign of violence on his body

175
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,842
nor sign of murder.

176
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,260
JUYOUNG: You're right.

177
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,513
If they found something,
Daeil's family would have done something.

178
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,434
By the way,
did Tak head back home right away?

179
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,937
Yes. He left right after the funeral.

180
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,401
Did you… talk to Tak all right?

181
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,236
ARI: What?

182
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,531
Yeah, sure.

183
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,867
ARI: Why didn't you answer my call?

184
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,537
(sighs)

185
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,123
-Were you in Gimhae?
-Yeah.

186
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,251
There are so many things I wanted to ask,

187
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,505
but if you explain yourself now,
I'll forgive you.

188
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,424
-You should be thankful I'm so...
-TAK: Ari.

189
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,469
I know there's nothing I can say
to justify what I did,

190
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,097
but right now,

191
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,348
(emotive music)

192
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,891
I can't afford to date anyone.

193
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,394
I know I'll regret

194
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,814
-losing you, but...
-ARI: Do you think you're some bad boy?

195
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,401
Confessing to me was so hard, but
why is breaking up with me so easy to you?

196
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,777
You're so full of yourself.

197
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,322
And all our friends know we're together.
This is just humiliating!

198
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,490
(sighs)

199
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,866
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,494
I'll tell the kids later what happened.

201
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,870
This isn't about them!

202
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,916
I'm saying I want you to stay.
(sobbing)

203
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,129
Everyone knows about us, so don't do this.

204
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,468
(Ari crying)

205
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,930
Now that Daeil is gone

206
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,974
and Tak is gone,

207
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,853
the whole school feels so empty.

208
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,526
I wonder what Daeil's final thoughts were.

209
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:22,575
They say your happiest memories…
flash before your eyes when you die.

210
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,119
I'm not sure.

211
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,997
He must have been pretty upset.

212
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,083
He had so many plans,

213
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,711
and that wasn't part of his plans.

214
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,088
(scoffs)

215
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,093
Who's going to do
all the planning for us now?

216
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,223
If I knew this would happen,
I should have told him

217
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,602
how much I appreciated him.

218
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,061
(vehicle approaching)

219
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,146
(vehicle honks)

220
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,565
-(tire screeches)
-(engine revving)

221
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,819
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

222
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,781
(engine revving)

223
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,617
(truck honks)

224
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,411
-(honking)
-(tire screeches)

225
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,663
Eunkang.

226
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,335
Do people honk when no one's around?

227
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,462
I don't think so.

228
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,381
Usually, you honk the horn
when someone is in the way.

229
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,591
I think…

230
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,094
I heard a car horn on the phone that day.

231
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,765
-During my last phone call with Daeil.
-Did Daeil honk the horn?

232
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,308
Maybe.

233
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,143
Seunghyun.
(breathing heavily)

234
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,229
-(car honking)
-I'm in trouble.

235
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,522
What?

236
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,357
(car honking on cellphone)

237
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,279
No. The sound came from a distance.
Somewhere outside of the car.

238
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,157
Maybe someone wanted Daeil to move.

239
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,700
Some car…

240
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,786
Wait.

241
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,623
Didn't they say Daeil's car was the only
car filmed on the security camera?

242
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,208
Now that I think about it,

243
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,293
that might have been
right before the accident.

244
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,630
He said, "I'm in trouble",
and then hung up the phone.

245
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,883
Did he get into the accident
trying to avoid that car?

246
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,886
First, we should look for the car.

247
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,472
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS

248
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,890
TRAFFIC INVESTIGATION OFFICER:
The investigation report?

249
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,893
Yes. It's a car crash
that happened a week ago

250
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,855
-on Route 82 in Gapyeong.
-Are you the driver?

251
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,648
Uh, I'm a friend…

252
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,443
Only the driver, his family,
or his lawyer have access to the report.

253
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,155
(suspenseful music)

254
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,785
EUISEOK: All the evidence
has been removed.

255
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,287
-Are you sure?
-EUISEOK: Yes.

256
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,872
The skid marks have been removed...

257
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,957
-(hisses)
-(scraping)

258
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,209
(foreboding music)

259
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,421
...and we collected
the dashcam and his phone

260
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,424
through undercover cops
when the car was pulled out.

261
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:47,845
(clicking)

262
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,222
All footage from cameras
in the area were deleted.

263
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,852
The case report has been deleted
from the investigation records.

264
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,688
They won't be able to find
any of the documents.

265
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,525
Legal advisor Mr. Kim took care of it
using Sinyu Club connections.

266
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,987
Who the hell called a chauffeur?
What a moron!

267
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,363
EUISEOK: It was Attorney Oh.

268
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,408
He secretly called one
to sneak out of the place.

269
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,951
Attorney Oh? Who's that?

270
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,413
-I've never heard of him.
-Mr. Kim brought him.

271
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,415
He used to be
in the Drug Investigations Unit.

272
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:20,336
Mr. Kim thought he'd be useful regarding
investigations on your drug trafficking…

273
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,378
Fine.

274
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,632
And the dead chauffeur

275
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,885
-was a friend of Wi Seunghyun?
-Yes.

276
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,803
(breathes deeply)

277
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,347
Wi Seunghyun…

278
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,016
Wi Seunghyun…

279
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,852
SEUNGHYUN: I can't be
on the same team as a criminal.

280
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,021
If you have committed a crime,

281
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,398
I will make you pay for it.

282
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,194
Keep a close eye on him.

283
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,447
Didn't you say you were planting someone?

284
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,741
She turned down our first offer.

285
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,161
But she'll call us back soon.

286
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,376
(music fades)

287
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,254
(sighs deeply)

288
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,137
(reflective music)

289
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,640
DAEIL: It's because you're too nice.

290
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,393
You're too nice
to cut her out of your life.

291
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,688
And you try to deal with it all alone.

292
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,232
That's why it's hard.

293
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,194
I'm not nice.

294
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,784
(reflective music continues)

295
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,000
YOO DAEIL

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,927
If you want to see my face, click here.

297
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,637
I shared access with you.

(indistinct shouting on TV)

304
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,943
(women screaming)

305
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:54,740
Isn't that the kind of sex bribes
that people talk about on the news?

306
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,534
-JUYOUNG: It looks exactly like that.
-I think so too.

307
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,953
DAEIL (on TV): Legally, this is foul play.

308
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,455
-It's Daeil's voice.
-DAEIL: And foul play...

309
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,956
...can be sentenced
up to ten years of imprisonment,

310
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,084
up to ten years of suspension,

311
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,794
and a fine of up to ten million won.

312
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,296
Up to a ten million won fine.

313
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,799
They must have seen him!

314
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:13,926
(Daeil groans on video)

315
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,888
(tense, suspenseful music)

316
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,313
So Daeil ran away after taking this video.

317
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,148
Yes.

318
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,443
I think he got into the accident
while running away.

319
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,903
DAEIL: Seunghyun.

320
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:33,987
I'm in trouble.

321
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,197

00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,954
(Daeil breathing heavily, screaming)

324
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,254
ARI: Are you saying it happened
because of the person

325
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,964
who tried to take his phone?

326
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,507
We can't say for sure yet,

327
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,050
but it's likely.

328
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,593
Who is that person?

329
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,053
I know who it is.

330
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,558
Changui Investment
CEO Jo Hansol's chief secretary,

331
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,268
Shin Euiseok.

332
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,437
(tense music)

333
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,859
We just want you to let us know
how these three are doing at school.

334
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,447
Is CEO Jo Hansol
involved in this too then?

335
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,533
I suppose so.

336
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,451
(gasping)

337
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,954
We should ask the police
to investigate this case.

338
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,039
-Yes. Let's go now.
-No.

339
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,916
We can't go to the police.

340
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,085
That man, Jo Hansol,

341
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,088
has connections with the police.

342
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,215
Connections? Who?

343
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,885
Our seniors.

344
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,723
Have you guys heard of the Sinyu Club?

345
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,727
It's a group of KNPU graduates
who are high-ranking police officials.

346
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,355
Jo Hansol has a firm grip
on that Sinyu Club.

347
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,982
-What?
-Huh?

348
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,859
SEUNGHYUN: For a long time,
he's been dealing

349
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,570
with the Sinyu Club members,
avoiding investigations

350
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,614
and destroying evidence.

351
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,157
(Ari gasps)

352
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,117
That's such shocking news.

353
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,660
Hey. Hold on.

354
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,955
Seunghyun, how do you know all this?

355
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,541
JUYOUNG: Who told you
about the relationship

356
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,585
between Jo Hansol and Sinyu Club?

357
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,088
I…

358
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,466
actually…
(sighs)

359
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,929
...have something to tell you.

360
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,184
(dramatic music)

361
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,488
So the reason why Tak quit school…

362
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,325
-Hey!
-(chair scrapes)

363
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,118
Why are you telling us this now?

364
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,536
If I had known,

365
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,206
I wouldn't have blamed Tak so much.

366
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,668
Hey. You know Seunghyun.

367
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,337
It must have been hard for him too.

368
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,506
She's right. It was hard for him too.

369
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,846
I'm okay. It's nothing
compared to what Tak went through.

370
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,976
I don't know where to even start…

371
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,062
to fix this.

372
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,068
But we know one thing for sure.

373
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,070
(suspenseful music)

374
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,196
Tak's brother,

375
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,950
Seunghyun's father, and Daeil's death.

376
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,830
They're all connected to Jo Hansol.

377
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,291
EUNKANG: Right.

378
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,335
Everything is connected to him.

379
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,378
(inhales)

380
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,633
We can't do anything
about what happened ten years ago,

381
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,094
but we can investigate what just happened.

382
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,142
Maybe we can catch Jo Hansol
with this video Daeil filmed.

383
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,893
ARI: Easier said than done.

384
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,146
How? When we can't
even take the video to the police?

385
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,651
(knocks on door)

386
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,111
CHA UGON

387
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,279
Who is it?

388
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:03,989
(lock clicks)

389
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,538
(pensive music)

390
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,425
(Ugon sighs)

391
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,722
(breathes deeply)

392
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,976
So you're saying Daeil ran away
after taking this video

393
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,520
and then got into the accident.

394
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,690
And you're afraid Jo Hansol would stop you

395
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,027
if you try to disclose this.
Is that right?

396
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,070
Yes, sir.

397
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,865
Even though he's super-rich,

398
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,619
I don't think he has the power
to conceal this kind of video.

399
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,703
SEUNGHYUN: Yes, he can.

400
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,331
It's possible
with help from the Sinyu Club.

401
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,751
We heard everything.

402
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,921
About Seunghyun's father
and Tak's brother too.

403
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,424
If we hand this video to the police,

404
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,552
it'll disappear before we reveal
the truth of Daeil's death.

405
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,640
And Jo Hansol will get away
through the Sinyu Club again.

406
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,184
Right. He would.

407
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,480
Everyone in this video…

408
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,359
is a Sinyu Club member.

409
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,529
(suspenseful music)

410
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,867
UGON: CEO of the Seju Daily, Kook Hanju.

411
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,120
He's a Sinyu Club member
who was Commissioner of

412
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,622
South Daejeon Provincial Police Agency
eight years ago.

413
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,042
Kim Inmyeon, former Deputy Chief
Investigator in Seoul,

414
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,587
now a legal adviser at a law firm,
and also the power broker in the club.

415
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,257
Jang Moonki,
a congressman of the ruling party.

416
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,050
He used to be a cop too.

417
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,679
Lieutenant Oh Hyunjong
from the Drug Investigations Unit.

418
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,098
After graduating law school,
he's now a lawyer

419
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:57,561
and probably the one defending
Jo Hansol's drug case.

420
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,938
They're all KNPU graduates.

421
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,982
Right?

422
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,318
(Ari, Juyoung sighs)

423
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,904
-What do we do?
-Then…

424
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,283
Can't we take it to the cops
who aren't KNPU graduates?

425
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,576
We should be careful.

426
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,745
The Sinyu Club is more influential
than you think.

427
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,251
I'll take a look into it,
so go back and wait for now.

428
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,795
-And don't tell anyone about this.
-GROUP: Yes, sir.

429
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,384
(crickets creaking)

430
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,179
-You know what?
-Guys.

431
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,226
You go first.

432
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,146
Huh? Uh, okay. I was going to say

433
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,731
we should do

434
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,733
what Daeil couldn't.

435
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,735
(uplifting music)

436
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,696
We may not be able to find
the cause of Daeil's death right away,

437
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,408
but if the video is the reason
why Daeil had to die,

438
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,745
let's do it for his sake.

439
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,124
Sinyu Club, Jo Hansol, whatever it is,
let's fight against them.

440
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,212
So that Daeil didn't die in vain.

441
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,134
Dude, that's exactly what I was
going to say. You stole my thunder.

442
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:12,802
(Bumju clears throat)

443
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,262
I was going to say the same.

444
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:15,931
Me too.

445
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,557
(chuckles)

446
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,059
Guys, we have to be careful.

447
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,269
We're going against
Jo Hansol and the Sinyu Club.

448
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,688
Are you scared?
If you're scared, stay out of it.

449
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,690
Put your hand here if you're with me.

450
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,651
Me.

451
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,531
I'm not scared. My blood is boiling now.

452
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:36,618
I've been a huge fan of Detective Horatio
from CSI since I was little.

453
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,120
Actions speak louder than words.

454
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,622
(group clamoring)

455
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,252
Well,

456
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,546
I owe Daeil too.

457
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,881
Let's not chicken out.

458
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,216
We're taking this to the end.

459
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,594
-EUNKANG: Let's do this.
-All right.

460
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,096
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

461
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,475
TOWER OF JUSTICE

462
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,479
YOU WHO PASS THROUGH THIS PLACE
ARE TRUSTED BY THE COUNTRY

463
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,565
(dog barking)

464
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,734
I'm sorry to hear about your friend.
You must be pretty upset.

465
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,988
Yes.
(sighs)

466
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,323
You said you were close.

467
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,201
It must be tough.

468
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,583
I'm more worried about the other guys.

469
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,794
It's not easy to suddenly lose someone

470
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,214
whom you used to
hang out with all the time.

471
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,884
(breathes deeply)
I've experienced it once,

472
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,095
but they probably haven't.

473
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,558
When Hyunsoo suddenly left me
without saying anything,

474
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,184
it was really hard.

475
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,563
Right. You had a pretty hard time.

476
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,902
But you know what?

477
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,656
Hyunsoo didn't leave
without saying anything.

478
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,411
(somber music)

479
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,834
TAK'S GRANDMOTHER: This is what he left
before going off to training.

480
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,836
(paper rustling)

481
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,715
TO MY LOVING GRANDMA!

482
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,800
It almost feels like he knew he'd die.

483
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,928
It was the first and last time

484
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,723
he gave us Christmas presents.

485
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,933
Do you remember?

486
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,435
(shuddering)

487
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,273
(chuckling)

488
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,696
Oh, boy.

489
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,864
(groaning)

490
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,329
Grandma!

491
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,246
(both laughing)

492
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,291
-What are you doing here at this time?
-I came to see you, of course.

493
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,209
Tak!

494
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,669
Hyunsoo!

495
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,921
-What were you doing?
-I was studying.

496
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,214
Studying, were you?

497
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,382
Yup!

498
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,677
-Have you eaten yet?
-No.

499
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,680
-You haven't? Do you want to eat?
-Yeah!

500
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,723
Grandma, you should keep warmer.

501
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,183
-It's cold in here.
-It's fine.

502
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,478
What are you doing here?
You didn't say you'd come.

503
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,730
I said I came to see you.

504
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,483
-And Tak too.
-Is that so?

505
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,776
(chuckles)

506
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,571
Are you sure everything is all right?

507
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,781
Of course.

508
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,410
Right. I'm going to do training soon.

509
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,161
(gasps)
Training?

510
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,873
What training?
It's freezing cold these days.

511
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,170
Training is supposed to be done
in cold weather.

512
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,133
So if I stay out of touch, don't worry.

513
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,259
Gosh.

514
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:42,846
(sighs)

515
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,973
HYUNSOO: To my loving Grandma.

516
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,770
Grandma, I'm leaving early
so I didn't wake you up.

517
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:56,067
It's cold these days. Stay healthy
and stop worrying about me.

518
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,738
I'm a natural cop.

519
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,698
I enjoy harsh training.

520
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,951
(emotive music)

521
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,830
When I was torn between being a cop
and being a soldier,

522
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,500
you told me to go to KNPU,
and I'm glad I listened to you.

523
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,506
I'll come back in one piece,
so don't worry.

524
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,886
(grunts)

525
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,637
(door clicks open)

526
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,558
(door creaks close)

527
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,145
HYUNSOO: One more thing.

528
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:38,193
Thank you so much for raising me and Tak.

529
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,697
Here's some money for you.
It's a Christmas gift from me,

530
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,365
so get yourself a massager with it.

531
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,827
Merry Christmas, Grandma.

532
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,749
TAK'S GRANDMOTHER:
I'm sure Hyunsoo died happy.

533
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,377
He got into the accident
while doing what he wanted,

534
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,506
so he wouldn't have blamed anyone.

535
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,800
So…

536
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,009
(breathes shakily)

537
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,511
...don't blame anyone

538
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,055
and do what you want to do.

539
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:07,972
(sobbing)

540
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,059
That's what Hyunsoo would have wanted too.

541
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,771
(sobbing)

542
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,439
-Why?
-(thuds on table)

543
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:21,945
(breathing shakily, sobbing)

544
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,367
TAK'S GRANDMOTHER: You should go back now.

545
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,997
I could get through the hard time
because I had you.

546
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:33,915
(clicks tongue)

547
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,085
(sighs)

548
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,587
TAK'S GRANDMOTHER: And I'm sure
your friends need you right now.

549
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,132
You should go and be with them.

550

KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

UGON: It's not there?

552
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,390
MAN: No. The Gapyeong car crash case

553
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,017
was deleted
from the investigation records.

554
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,937
I can't find
the investigation report at all.

555
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,524
-What is this case about anyway?
-Oh, it's nothing.

556
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,443
Sorry. I owe you a lot.

557
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,445
Okay.

558
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,281
(chuckles)
Bye.

559
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,700
(foreboding music)

560
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,617
(cellphone beeps)

561
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,081
It's been deleted from the list?

562
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,585
They're not letting anyone
investigate the case.

563
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,800
(foreboding music continues)

SEX BRIBES AT GAPYEONG VILLA

KOOK HANJU, JANG MOONKI, OH HYUNJONG

566
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,820
Jo Hansol is missing.

567
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,241
CHANGUI / DAMOS
SHIN EUISEOK

568
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:55,079
We need something better
to catch Jo Hansol.

569
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,832
EUNKANG: Why isn't Professor Cha
saying anything?

570
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,334
It's been a week already.

571
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,044
I know.

572
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,546
He said all investigations
are about the right timing.

573
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,382
What if they fake an alibi
and tamper with the evidence?

574
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,426
ARI: Do you think…

575
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:15,558
Professor Cha might be close friends
with the people in the video?

576
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,478
(suspenseful music)

577
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,980
No way.

578
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,231
He might be.

579
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,526
They're all KNPU graduates.
He should know most of them.

580
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,946
BUMJU: This might be
a tricky situation for him.

581
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,364
Maybe that's why he's hesitant.

582
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,491
(suspenseful music continues)

583
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,452
We have to do something.

584
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,412
We can't wait forever.

585
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,581
-What are you going to do?
-We should take action.

586
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,834
(foreboding music)

587
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,546
What the…

588
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,425
(girls exclaiming)

589
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,388
-My eyes! That's sick.
-Do people still do this? Goodness.

590
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,722
Man, I'm speechless.

591
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,474
This is unbelievable.

592
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,809
We already got 20,000 views.

593
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,354
Korea is indeed the best
when it comes to IT. Aren't we?

594
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,356
SHOCKING DISCLOSURE:
SEX BRIBES AT VILLA

595
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,233
MOM CAFE
THEY ARE FORMER POLICE EXECUTIVES

596
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,366
ANCHORWOMAN: The police have launched
an investigation to figure out

597
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,452
the authenticity of the video
of sexual bribery at a villa in Gapyeong.

598
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,413
A video of sexual bribery
at a villa in Gapyeong

599
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,707
was posted
to an online community yesterday.

600
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,876
REPORTER: Those involved turned out to be
former high-ranking police officials,

601
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,253
and is shocking everyone.

602
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,381
The police said they would
organize a special investigation unit

603
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:32,093
to summon and investigate the individuals
in the video within the week.

604
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,180
(tense music)

605
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,353
INMYEON: We could have just talked
on the phone.

606
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,606
Why did you want to meet in person
during such a hectic time?

607
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,276
The dead KNPU student

608
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,403
was a friend of my son.

609
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,988
Did you know that?

610
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,366
He's the one who caused all this!

611
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,951
If it weren't for that little bastard…

612
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,495
Will you go on about the honor
of the police this time too?

613
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,790
What is this honor we need to uphold

614
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,752
by sacrificing our children's lives?

615
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,920
The honor we need to uphold?

616
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,173
Your position.

617
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,717
Commissioner of the East Gyeonggi Police.

618
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,012
Who do you think gave you that position?

619
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,973
Without missing out on a single promotion,

620
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,018
you've only ever sat in crucial positions.

621
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,604
That's what honor is!

622
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:30,610
INMYEON: Giyong, you and I have been
in the same boat for ten years now.

623
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,446
You're too old
to be saying something so naive.

624
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,531
GIYONG: But they're just kids!

625
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,991
(Giyong breathing shakily)

626
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,203
We should have
kept the children out of this!

627
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,204
Kids?

628
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,206
What about them kids?

629
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,584
Why should we sit back
and watch them ruin everything

630
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,504
we've been keeping so hard for decades?

631
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,257
INMYEON: It's because
you keep thinking like that

632
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,552
your reckless son
foolishly spread that video.

633
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,680
When this gets out,
I won't be the only one going down.

634
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,432
It's the same for you.

635
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,229
So think carefully.

636
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,189
And keep your son's mouth shut.

637
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,609
Stop everything you can stop!

638
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,986
This is not a warning.

639
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,780
It's an order!

640
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,949
(dramatic music)

641
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,827
You who pass through this place…

642
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,040
are trusted

643
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,167

648
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,460
You should have told me first

649
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,838
when you learned
our students had such a video.

650
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,215
The headquarters called me.

651
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,219
They traced the IP address and figured out
it was posted from our school.

652
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,138
I should've told you earlier. I'm sorry.

653
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,347
I didn't know

654
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,641
they would post it online either.

655
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,393
(sighs)

656
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,147
COUNTRY, JUSTICE, HONOR

657
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,858
How did they get the video?

658
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,151
(inhales)

659
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,737
(inhales)

660
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:43,492
It was inside the phone of Yoo Daeil,
the student who recently died

661
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,994
in a car accident.

662
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,079
Why was it in his…

663
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,751
Did he get into the accident
while taking that video?

664
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,377
There's no evidence yet.

665
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,380
There's no sign of murder,
and it's obvious he died from the fall.

666
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,381
However…

667
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,218
I do have some suspicions.

668
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,469
(sighs)

669
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,513
(clicks tongue)
Request for an official investigation.

670
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,891
How could they post such a video…

671
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,851
This is just ridiculous.

672
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,771
How could KNPU students
not have any trust in the police,

673
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,814
and post a video anonymously?

674
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,108
What would people think of the police?

675
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,487
I told you

676
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,574
this year's freshmen seemed wild,
so you should keep a close eye on them.

677
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,952
I told you so many times.

678
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,579
What have you been doing as their advisor?

679
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,165
I'm sure that was the best they could do.

680
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,001
UGON: They had doubts
about their friend's death,

681
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,586
but couldn't find any proof of murder.

682
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,548
All they could do was to let the world
know the last thing their friend left.

683
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,134
So that their friend's death
was not in vain.

684
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,554
I also don't agree with their methods,

685
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,683
but I can understand why they did it.
However, Dean…

686
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,894
can't you understand?

687
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,230
(somber music)

688
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,564
(breathes heavily)

689
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,985
If we keep making trouble like this,

690
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,446
we'll fall out of favor
within the police organization

691
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,824
and as some people wish,

692
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,368
this school will be abolished.

693
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,496
If you want to protect this school,

694
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,707
please keep your students

695
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,625
out of trouble.

696
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:19,588
I'm not being dramatic here.
Even the alumni association contacted us.

697
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,346
(dramatic music)

698
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,639
(sighs)

699
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,186
(music stops)

700
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,234
Your job is done now.

701
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,698
Leave the rest to the police
and watch them take care of it.

702
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,326
Professor.

703
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,786
Did we do something wrong?

704
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,831
They started the investigation
because of the video we uploaded.

705
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,000
It also made it easier for them
to get away with it.

706
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,794
(suspenseful upbeat music)

707
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,342
(door opens)

708
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,303
(door closes)

709
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,890
The prosecution said the chief secretary
of Changui Investment,

710
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,225
Shin Euiseok admitted to all the charges

711
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,562
regarding the sexual bribery scandal
of the Sinyu Club, a society

712
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,564
-of former and current police executives.
-REPORTER: Could you please say a word?

713
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,815
It was a one-time event

714
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,318
that I organized alone
without the CEO aware of it.

715
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,195
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

716
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,322
(reporters clamoring)

717
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,866
MALE HOST: So the chief secretary
offered them bribes

718
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,327
without the CEO knowing about it.

719
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,954
It is quite hard to understand.

720
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,874
He said he did it without the CEO knowing.

721
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,418
What do you think, Mr. Han?

722
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,629
It is somewhat plausible.

723
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,841
Secretary Shin is one of the founding
members of Changui Investment.

724
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,804
He's in charge of
the company's practical affairs.

725
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,264
It's possible he lobbied
for the police's support.

726
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:57,061
Plus, CEO Jo Hansol
is a very young and smart man.

727
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,688
It is possible that they had disagreements

728
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,858
and Secretary Shin
planned it unilaterally.

729
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,069
FEMALE PANELIST: That's nonsense.

730
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,238
-Bullcrap.
-They're using him as a scapegoat…

731
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,948
That's just nonsense.

732
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:12,118
What kind of secretary does things
without his boss' orders?

733
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,494
I know.

734
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,871
Jo Hansol is definitely behind this.

735
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,832
There must have been
a tacit agreement at least.

736
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,418
But what can we do?
There is no solid evidence.

737
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,462
We overlooked the fact there was no proof
of Jo Hansol's involvement.

738
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,299
I think this is what
Professor Cha was worried about.

739
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,927
In Korea, a criminal investigation
is all about evidence.

740
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:34,682
Unless there's evidence,
it's innocent until proven guilty.

741
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,183
-What do we do now?
-JUIL: Also.

742
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,936
-We were so close to catching him.
-JUIL: He said it was "a one-time event".

743
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,480
-MALE HOST: Do you think of that?
-TAK: What else?

744
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,107
We'll cut off the head of that snake.

745
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,692
Hey! Tak!

746
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,693
Tak!

747
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,445
Tak, you're back.

748
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,406
Yes, I'm back.

749
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,035
MALE HOST: Well,
the police will soon announce

750
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,079
the result of the investigation,

751
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,873
so let's see how it goes.

752
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,374
Let's move on to the next issue…

753
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,292
(emotive music)

754
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,877
BUMJU: Seunghyun told us everything.

755
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,129
We didn't know
what you were going through.

756
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,632
It must have been really hard for you.
We're so sorry.

757
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:14,472
But you seemed so determined.
What changed your mind?

758
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,723
Someone told me

759
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,144
we should try banging our heads
against the wall.

760
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:28,486
WI SEUNGHYUN
HAS SENT A PHOTO

761
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,033
(emotive music)

762
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,579
SEUNGHYUN: This is the last video
Daeil took before he died.

763
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,832
I think those who killed Daeil

764
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,836
and those who killed your brother
are the same people.

765
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:50,299
We can't tell anything for sure yet,
but let's catch the bad guys together.

766
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,260
Let's try banging our heads
against the wall.

767
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,181
I think, together, we can do this.

768
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,231
Thanks

769
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,942
-for coming.
-Don't sweat it.

770
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,403
This is about my brother

771
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,821
and my friend.

772
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,740
And now, it's about me too.

773
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,077
(Juyoung clears throat)

774
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,831
All right. Now that everyone's here,
how about a strategic meeting?

775
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,584
(smack lips)
One more thing. I quit school,

776
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,962
but no one stopped me
when I walked in here.

777
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,213
Does anyone know why?

778
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,006
Oh. I forgot.

779
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,509
Professor Cha asked me
to relay this to you.

780
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,511
(cellphone buzzing)

781
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,182
(uplifting music)

782
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,726
That trivet under the pot
is your withdrawal form.

783
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,145
EUNKANG: Apparently,
he hasn't submitted it yet.

784
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,313
(all laughing)

785
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,943
Dude. Leaving here is just as hard
as getting in here.

786
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:54,071
You can't just quit like that.
We're family. Okay?

787
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:55,656
(chuckles)

788
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,242
Family? That's cheesy…

789
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,662
What about it?
It makes us feel like a team.

790
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,791
EUNKANG: Anyway, congratulations
on your comeback, Tak.

791
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,042
TAK: Thanks.

792
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,340
I've been such a jerk.

793
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,509
(light music)

794
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,470
You can hit me if you want.

795
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:20,931
And...

796
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,350
please be my girlfriend again.

797
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,230
(sniffles)

798
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,325
(light music continues)

799
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:50,753
(music fades)

800
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,968
HOSEOK: I talked
to Prosecutor Hwang today.

801
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,679
He wants something
in return for preventing your summons.

802
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,306
Give him a large one.

803
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,974
-(thuds)
-(bottle clinks)

804
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,227
HOSEOK: You've had enough.

805
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,147
Now Mr. Shin is gone,
you're doing the nagging. Leave me alone.

806
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,523
Be careful with the drugs too.

807

it embarrassed you that she ran a bar.

the bar and open a cafe.

862
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,080
So she borrowed money

-Locard's Principle?
-Yes.

867
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:29,346
If Jo Hansol had committed a crime,
it must have left a trace somewhere.

868
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,848
SEUNGHYUN: We need to find that.

869
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,851
The proof that shows Jo Hansol knew
about the sexual bribery and ordered it.

870
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,602
Something like
a list of people he's bribed?

871
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,022
He had that list stolen before,
so it won't be easy to find.

872
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,442
And even if we know where it is,
how can we steal it?

873
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,486
It's not like we have
a seizure and search warrant.

Maybe we should meet them.

879
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,550
It probably wasn't their first time
for some of them.

880
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,511
They wouldn't have changed
the women often for security reasons.

881
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:13,974
Right. And if the women
had been blackmailed into doing this,

882
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,768
there might still be a record
of their transactions,

883
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,814
and they might've heard that it was
Jo Hansol's orders at least once.

00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,775
But… how are we supposed to find them?

968
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,265
I suppose so.
And it seems like they're both after you.

969
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,102
(ominous music)

970
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,607
Hang on a second.

971
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,365
Yes. I'm in front of Lee Eunha's house.

972
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:23,825
(vehicle approaching)

973
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,076
(motorbike whooshes)

974
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,038
(foreboding music)

975
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,664
(coughs)

976
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:32,000
LATE NIGHT SNACK

977
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,420
(thuds)

978
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,839
(whimpering)

979
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:38,798
(Namgi groans)

980
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,008
SEUNGHYUN: Detective Kang.

981
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:45,805
Detective Kang?

982
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,474
Detective Kang?

983
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,025
(suspenseful music)

984
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,912

985
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:19,130
ICU VISITING GUIDELINES
SANGJEONG HOSPITAL

986
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,341
(intense suspenseful music)

987
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,769
(tense music)

988
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,867
SEUNGHYUN: Ms. Lee Eunha!

989
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,455
(suspenseful music)

990
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,627
I said everything I know to the police.
There's nothing more to say.

991
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,839
Detective Kang… is in a coma now.

992
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,758
EUNKANG: The detective
who visited you the other day.

993
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,468
He was stabbed

994
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,512
in front of your house.

995
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,807
It was probably one of Jo Hansol's men.

996
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,643
EUNKANG: He gets rid of anything
that gets in his way.

997
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,770
EUNHA: What do you want from me?

998
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:22,027
It wasn't your first time, was it?

999
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,113
Jo Hansol made you do it, right?

1000
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,532
EUNHA: I don't know that person.

1001
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,201
You know Ms. Min Haeji.

1002
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,081
You're the one who introduced Min Haeji

1003
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,000
to Jo Hansol.

1004
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,627
SEUNGHYUN: We know everything.

1005
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,256
We know the relationship
between you and Min Haeji.

1006
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,301
(suspenseful music)

1007
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,557
(suspenseful music continues)

1008
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:02,817
(object clatters)

1009
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,657
(page rifles)

1010
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,457
NAMGI: They were trainees at the same
talent agency seven years ago.

1011
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,834
Min Haeji was from Gangneung
and Lee Eunha was from Daegu.

1012
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,712
As they were both from out of Seoul,
they lived together.

1013
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,673
Then Lee Eunha turned to prostitution
to survive

1014
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,510
and dragged Min Haeji into it too.

1015
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,846
Min Haeji refused at first,

1016
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,057
but in the end, she was convinced.

1017
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,225
Hang on a second.

1018
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,400
EUNKANG: This was in Min Haeji's wallet

1019
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,402
when she died.

1020
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:50,281
She was always thinking about you.

1021
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,701
Please help us.

1022
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,291
EUNHA: Follow me.

1023
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,130
(foreboding music)

1024
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,929
HOSEOK: This is Lawyer Park Hoseok
of Damos' Strategic Planning Department.

1025
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:16,182
Secretary Shin's offer from the other day

1026
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,101
still stands.

1027
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,186
We'll also increase the amount.

1028
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,858
(suspenseful music)

1029
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,861
HANNA: Lee Eunha is going to the police
station tomorrow morning at seven.

1030
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,195
(message tone)

1031
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,788

(bouncer 1 groans)

1041
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,544
(suspenseful music)

1042
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,424

(woman yelps)

1045
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,850
You can go now.

1046
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,355
(door opens)

1047
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,150

-(whisper) Are you awake?
-(woman gasps, pants)

1050
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,330

00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,043
(Hansol chuckling)

1053
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,255
(Hansol grunts)

1054
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,716
Where were you going this morning?

1055
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,635
To the police station?

1056
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,803
-(slurps)
-(woman whimpers)

(woman whimpering)

1059
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,563
I told you to leave the country quietly.

(Hansol moaning mockingly)

1062
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,027
What are you saying?

1063
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,279
Release her.

1064
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,449
(suspenseful music intensifies)
