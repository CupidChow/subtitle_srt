1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,256
EUNKANG: So this is how a day starts.
It's pretty.

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:07,841
SEUNGHYUN: It's good to be out, right?

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,050
EUNKANG: Yes.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,470
This is my first time seeing a sunrise.
How about you?

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,681
It's not my first time seeing a sunset.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,850
But...

7
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,602
this is my first time seeing one with you.

8
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,645
(chuckles)

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,525
Let's make a wish.

10
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,818
-SEUNGHYUN: A wish?
-EUNKANG: Yes.

11
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:27,861
SEUNGHYUN: It's not New Year's.

12
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:32,073
What's to it? It's the New Year
since we're seeing the sunrise.

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,288
(romantic music)

14
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,758
What did you wish for?

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,259
What about you?

16
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,470
-It's a secret.
-Then mine is a secret too.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,013
Oh, come on.

18
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,264
Fine.
(clears throat)

19
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,223
I wished...

20
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,144
I could spend
the rest of the year safe and sound.

21
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,270
What about you?

22
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:03,772
(clears throat)

23
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,648
I don't know. I'm not telling you.

24
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,567
What? Tell me!

25
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,570
EUNKANG: Hey! Tell me!
(laughing)

26
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,281
What is it? I want to know yours too!

27
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,199
(Eunkang yelps)

28
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,622
(object tinkles)

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,677
I wished that

30
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,055
I could see the sunrise with you

31
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,517
again next year,
and the year after that too.

32
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,524
(romantic music continues)

33
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,962
(theme music)

34
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,595
EPISODE 12

35
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,100
EUNKANG: Let's go back now.
The guys will get up soon.

36
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,309
Already?

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,979
EUNKANG: No matter
how sleepy-headed you are,

38
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,231
when you're on a trip, you get up early.

39
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,233
-Too bad.
-(chuckles)

40
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,902
Next time,
let's come with just the two of us.

41
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,864
-Just us?
-Yes.

42
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,408
Hey!
(exclaiming)

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,118
Not yet.

44
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,411
No.

45
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,747
That's not what I meant.
(chuckles)

46
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,917
I...

47
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,919
I didn't mean that either.

48
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,046
I didn't say anything.

49
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,057
(foreboding music)

50
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,657
(foreboding music continues)

51
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,209
Excuse me.

52
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,766
DO NOT CROSS, POLICE LINE,
UNDER INVESTIGATION

53
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,477
(indistinct chatter on radio)

54
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,734
-(radio beeps)
-(indistinct chatter)

55
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,528
IDENTIFICATION CARD
MIN HAEJI

56
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,036
Isn't he the detective who came
to our school during Cheongram Education?

57
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,956
You're right.
I think his name was Kang Namgi.

58
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,208
Excuse me.

59
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,961
You're the ones who found the body, right?

60
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:13,878
BOTH: Yes.

61
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,255
I want to ask you a few questions.

62
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,216
Did you notice anything strange?

63
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,219
Some kind of body movement, for example?

64
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,639
We both had a look,
but there were no signs of life.

65
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,598
(somber music)

66
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,726
When we found the body, there were
already signs of livor mortis on the legs.

67
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,313
SEUNGHYUN: The pupils were constricted
and the lips were blue.

68
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:37,277
Seeing there were syringes next to her,
it might have been a drug overdose.

69
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:42,282
This is the photo we took
when we found the body.

70
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,951
Good. Could you send me this photo?

71
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,121
By the way, are you cops?

72
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,957
-No, we're...
-We're students of KNPU.

73
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,208
DETECTIVE 1: Ah...

74
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,711
KNPU students. Your names?

75
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,546
Wi Seunghyun, sir.

76
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,505
DETECTIVE 1: Wi Seunghyun.

77
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,758
NAMGI: There's a freshman
named Wi Seunghyun, right?

78
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,884
DETECTIVE 1: And yours?

79
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,386
EUNKANG: I'm Ko Eunkang.

80
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,596
DETECTIVE 1: I see.

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,974
Detective Kang. Detective Kang.

82
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,228
Judging by the state of livor mortis,
she didn't die too long ago.

83
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,272
Also, rigor mortis has barely set in,

84
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,107
so I think she died here, but...

85
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,109
Are there security cameras around here?

86
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,527
EUISEOK: There shouldn't be any.

87
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,528
(suspenseful music)

88
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,655
I picked a spot with no cameras.

89
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,199
The place is far from the beach,

90
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,994
so it won't be easy to figure out
how she got there or find witnesses.

91
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,039
Estimating time of death
based on the stage of livor mortis,

92
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,416
they'll conclude
that she died on the scene at night.

93
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,752
And on the autopsy report,

94
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,255
it will be written
that it was an overdose death

95
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,965
caused by asphyxiation.

96
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,509
Well done.

97
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,348
But why did you have to travel so far?

98
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,642
Min Haeji's grandmother
lives in that area.

99
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,479
She used to visit her
around this time every month.

100
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,814
It'll look like she went there
to hide from creditors,

101
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,109
took drugs out of frustration,
and then died.

102
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,070
Okay. You can go now.

103
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,455
I didn't save the video just here.

104
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,707
I have insurance, of course.

105
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,250
(sighs in annoyance)

106
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,795
Where on earth did she save it?

107
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,174
(breathes heavily)

108
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,560
(foreboding music)

109
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,779
Damn it!

110
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,739
(pants)

111
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,949
(gasps)

112
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,076
Are you sure it was Haeji?

113
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,369
I was surprised too

114
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,414
when I heard the dead woman
was the friend you were looking for.

115
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,582
Were you two close?

116
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,002
We went to an art academy together
back in middle school.

117
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,506
We were pretty close
until she moved to Gangneung.

118
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,967
MIKANG: We lost contact but ran
into each other

119
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,927
on the street early this year.

120
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,305
She said she needed a friend to eat with,
so we met up from time to time.

121
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,184
-But why did she die?
-I don't know.

122
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,688
But the cops said

123
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,025
-she might have taken drugs.
-What? Drugs?!

124
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,113
I'm not 100% sure. I just overheard it.

125
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,241
That's really shocking.

126
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,161
-MIKANG: That doesn't sound like her.
-(door opens)

127
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,456
-YANGCHUL: Huh? Eunkang, you're home.
-EUNKANG: Yes.

128
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,293
-Did you have fun on your trip?
-It was one eventful trip.

129
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,628
-Right. I have some souvenirs for you.
-YANGCHUL: What?

130
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,546
HEESOOK: What?

131
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,674
Let's see.

132
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:50,511
It's Korean squid caught in the East Sea.

133
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,388
Oh, wow.

134
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,683
-How much was it?
-I think it was around 35,000 won.

135
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,768
HEESOOK: You were ripped off.

136
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,520
It's much cheaper
in the supermarkets here.

137
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,898
With the discount coupons,
they are even cheaper.

138
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,692
No, I was not ripped off.
I even got 2,000 won off.

139
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,402
-Gosh.
-Come on. Don't be like that.

140
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,155
In touristic places,
it's normal to get ripped off.

141
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,324
Right, Eunkang.
Are you interested in tutoring?

142
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,076
There's this guy from my soccer club,
and his son wants to go to KNPU.

143
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,037
He said he'd love
to have you as his tutor,

144
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,914
and he's willing to pay a lot.

145
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,415
I wish I could do it.

146
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,959
-Then do it.
-We're not allowed to.

147
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,046
According to school rules,
we're not allowed to have part-time jobs.

148
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,172
Well, that's unfair.

149
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,258
They don't even let you make
some pocket money?

150
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,678
They don't need a job.
They get paid every month.

151
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,014
-Mikang.
-What does that mean?

152
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,016
You get paid?

153
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,227
(stammers)
No. It's just...

154
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,355
It's called a dignity fee,
but it's not that much.

155
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,731
No. It's quite a lot.

156
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,152
Eunkang. Go bring your bankbook.

157
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,779
-Why?
-Now.

158
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,699
How dare you hide money from your parents.

159
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,785
I didn't hide it.

160
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,830
Strictly speaking, it's my money...

161
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,082
What did you say?

162
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:05,002
I kept you fed and clothed,
and this is how you repay me?

163
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,672
YANGCHUL: Hang on a second.

164
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,091
(gasps)
Where did I put my phone?

165
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,134
Man, I'm so forgetful.

166
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,511
Yangchul, where are you going?

167
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,347
Are you hiding anything from me too?

168
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,391
(swallows)
Hmm...

169
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,226
(stammering)
Me?

170
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,478
Actually, our cash drawer
at the end of the day

171
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,647
is short these days.

172
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,440
Is it?

173
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,651
YANGCHUL: That's strange.

174
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,655
It's short over 200,000 won this month.
You thought I wouldn't know?

175
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,535
Anyway, don't you dare steal money,

176
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,997
make secret funds,
and get into credit card debt.

177
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,665
Let's see what happens then.

178
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,793
I'll sell this house
and run away with the money! Okay?

179
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,795
(clears throat)

180
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,297
Okay.

181
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,715
-(Heesook groaning)
-(object rustles)

182
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,550
Seriously, 35,000 won?

183
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,636
HEESOOK: You think 35,000 won
grows on trees?

184
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,308
Come in.

185
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,230
(Seunghyun exhales sharply)

186
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,816
SEUNGHYUN: Mom.

187
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,235
Mother.

188
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,201
Man.

189
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,870
This is one nice room.

190
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,705
(chuckles)

191
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,956
You sleep on the bed.

192
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,291
I'll sleep on the floor.

193
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,628
Hosts are supposed to sleep on the bed.

194
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,296
And I always sleep on the floor anyway.

195
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,589
(chuckles softly)

196
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,091
Huh?

197
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,184
Seunghyun.

198
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,310
TAK: Is he...

199
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,481
Am I right?

200
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,607
Ah...

201
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,735
Yes. You saw him at the special lecture.

202
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,488
I actually wanted to introduce him
to you today.

203
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,948
You should say hi to him
when we have dinner later.

204
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,617
(sighs)

205
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,951
He seemed really strict.

206
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,496
No. He looks cold on the outside,

207
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,665
but he's actually caring.

208
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,502
Right. He used to play judo too
when he was young.

209
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,212
He'd be really happy to see you.

210
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,963
-Really?
-Yes.

211
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,509
-TAK: It's a nice photo.
-(knocks on door)

212
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,763
Hey. I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
You must be hungry.

213
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,098
It's okay.

214
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,141
Oh, my.

215
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,560
I knew my boy was handsome,

216
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,729
but you roomies are both dashing.

217
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,399
You're so handsome.
You should be the school's model.

218
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,650
You're flattering me, ma'am.

219
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,735
Do you have a girlfriend?

220
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,863
-Pardon?
-Mom, what are you asking that for?

221
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,782
-No, he doesn't.
-I do.

222
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,618
See? I knew it.

223
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,121
Who is she? One of your classmates?

224
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,163
Yes.
(chuckles)

225
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,165
Hey, you didn't tell me about this.

226
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,209
You didn't tell me either.

227
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,879
Seunghyun. You have one too?

228
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,840
I... I'll tell you later.

229
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,758
Tell me now. Who is it?

230
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,427
-No, I'll tell you later.
-(door opens)

231
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,970
Come on. Tell me now.

232
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,513
Mom, I think Dad's home.

233
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,556
-SOOKJA: What?
-You should go.

234
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,557
-Wait, you...
-Come on.

235
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,892
-SOOKJA: But I'm so curious. Gosh.
-SEUNGHYUN: You should say hi to him.

236
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,269
-SOOKJA: You...
-SEUNGHYUN: Go say hi to him.

237
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,690
Why would you say that?

238
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,317
-(crockery clanking)
-(Tak sips)

239
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,787
(Tak munching)

240
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,331
(clearing throat)

241
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,377
Honey.
(chuckles awkwardly)

242
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,923
The boys are doing a triathlon next month.

243
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,925
-Right, Seunghyun?
-Yes.

244
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,511
I wanted to give it a try.

245
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,513
It's my first time,
so I'm doing a half course.

246
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,849
Even a half course is no easy task.

247
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,684
How are you going to practice?

248
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,811
The school gym is open
during the vacation,

249
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,022
so I'll practice swimming
and cycling there.

250
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,691
And I'm going to do the running near here.

251
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,611
The best athlete in our school
is going to help me.

252
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,529
-SEUNGHYUN: So don't worry.
-SOOKJA: Mm-mm...

253
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,323
-SEUNGHYUN: You don't need to worry.
-(Sookja chuckles softly)

254
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,117
GIYONG'S SECRETARY: His parents ran
a small business

255
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,035
before dying in a car accident,

256
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,953
and his brother died ten years ago.

257
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,246
-He was a KNPU student.
-I'm Kim Hyunsoo.

258
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,832
-(crockery clanging)
-(Tak munching)

259
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,627
So your name is Kim Tak?

260
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,088
-Yes, sir.
-How are your parents?

261
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,508
Are they still living in your hometown?

262
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,968
Uhm, both of my parents

263
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,095
have passed away.

264
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,680
And my brother died in an accident.

265
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,308
I was raised by my grandmother.

266
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,018
Oh, I see.

267
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,313
(sighs)
It must have been tough.

268
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,316
So that explains your crass behavior.

269
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,026
(dramatic music)

270
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,779
I knew it when I heard you beat people.

271
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,073
Dad. If you're talking
about the billiard hall incident...

272
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,034
Sometimes, violence feels

273
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,120
more satisfying and just.

274
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,749
But there are reasons
why cops don't use violence.

275
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,875
Justice...

276
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,672
must be made by social consensus.

277
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,924
GIYONG: That's why you should avoid
using violence.

278
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,427
It was stupid of you
if you didn't know that

279
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,137
and if you knew it...

280
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,556
(swallows)

281
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,684
-...you don't deserve to become a cop.
-Dad.

282
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,979
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,941
It will never happen again.

284
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,652
People...

285
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,947
don't change
just because they set their mind to it.

286
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,824
(slurps)

287
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,783
(clears throat)

288
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,838
Hey.

289
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,842
It's late.
Why don't you stay the night here?

290
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,220
I'm good.

291
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,348
If I leave now,
I should be able to catch the last train.

292
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,601
(sighs)

293
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,355
I'm sorry.

294
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,358
What my father said was really mean.

295
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,193
I apologize for it.

296
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,281
Dude, it's okay.
(chuckles awkwardly)

297
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,284
He wasn't entirely wrong.

298
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,870
I think he was trying to say
I should be careful.

299
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,580
I'll explain to him again

300
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,874
what happened that day.

301
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,500
SEUNGHYUN: I'm really sorry.

302
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,793
(sighs)

303
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,712
(somber music)

304
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:22,963
Seunghyun.

305
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,675
I don't regret using violence then.

306
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,970
There's only one person
I want to ask for permission

307
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,639
in situations like that.

308
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,058
And that person said...

309
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,142
(breathes deeply)

310
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,478
...when you need to protect someone,

311
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,563
it's okay to use violence.

312
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,985
JUNIOR STUDENT: All right. Here we go.

313
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,404
One, two, three.

314
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,822
(camera shutter clicks)

315
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,785
Thanks.

316
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,913
Is he your brother?

317
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,123
-He's my son.
-What?

318
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,918
-Just kidding.
-(both chuckle)

319
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,586
(junior student clears throat)

320
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,922
JUNIOR STUDENT: What's your name?

321
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:05,965
Kim Tak.

322
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,467
JUNIOR STUDENT: My. You look so smart
and handsome.

323
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,969
I hope you have a good time here.

324
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,097
HYUNSOO: All right.

325
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,895
Why did he mess with my head?

326
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,941
What?

327
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,860
(laughing)

328
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,030
(crockery clanging)

329
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,618
(munches)

330
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,291
When someone messes with me,
I kick their butt.

331
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,712
You can't be a great person then.
You need to keep cool sometimes.

332
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,882
Even when someone looks down on me
because I don't have a mom and dad?

333
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,676
(munches)

334
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,344
Did someone look down on you?

335
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,764
(Young Tak munching)

336
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,268
Tak.

337
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,731
When someone plays dirty,
ignoring them is how you beat them.

338
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,567
"Whatever. I don't care."

339
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,068
Like that.

340
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,572
And a real man uses violence

341
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,701
only when he has to protect someone.

342
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,995
-Okay?
-Okay.

343
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,081
-Hey, look at me when you answer.
-(munches)

344
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,958
I said okay.

345
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,335
All right.

346
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,343
(laughing)

347
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,765
(munching)

348
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,397
I didn't know
your brother was a KNPU student too.

349
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,816
If he was still alive,

350
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,527
I feel like he would've been a great cop.

351
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,073
I think so too.

352
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,785
When I was little,
I was such a troublemaker.

353
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,329
But he's always been a top student.

354
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,581
He was a better fighter too.

355
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,544
Sometimes, I think
I might have ended up here

356
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,213
because of him.

357
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,509
Thanks to him,
I met you and the other guys.

358
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,471
And now you're my brothers.
So be nice to me.

359
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,098
(chuckles)
Well...

360
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,809
I am being nice to you.

361
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,894
-What are you doing? Give it back.
-(laughs)

362
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,146
No. I'll carry it
just to the subway station.

363
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,272
(chuckles, clicks tongue)

364
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,191
(cellphone buzzing)

365
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,735
Hey, Ari.

366
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,071
Man, you.
(chuckles)

367
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,907
Bye.

368
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,328
(knocks on door)

369
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,539
(door opens)

370
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,341
Tak went back to the dorm.

371
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,801
Okay.

372
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:57,928
(sighs)

373
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,974
You really disappointed me today.

374
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,685
How could you humiliate him like that?

375
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,896
You're the one
who should stop disappointing me.

376
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,817
Did you think I wouldn't know
why you brought him?

377
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,612
I thought you might change your mind
once you met him in person.

378
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,657
It's not fair to judge him
when you don't really know him.

379
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,951
That's not the person I thought you were.

380
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,245
Then you were mistaken.

381
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,416
GIYONG: As a father, I won't let my child
make bad decisions in life.

382
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,877
I get friendship is important
to you young boys,

383
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,922
but in the end, your parents
are the ones who care about you the most.

384
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,134
This time,

385
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,720
I want you to listen to me.

386
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,891
If you don't want to hurt him anymore,

387
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,311
stay away from him.

388
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,320
(door closes)

389
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,280
(birds chirping)

390
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:02,910
(quirky music)

391
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,411
Okay.

392
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,542
(clears throat)

393
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,336
I'm Yoo Daeil.

394
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,337
(chuckles)

395
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,341
(blows air, clears throat)

396
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,804
Huh...

397
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,813
Okay. Okay. Okay.

398
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:32,856
(clears throat)

399
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,524
(keypad clacking)

400
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,862
-(phone line ringing)
-(clears throat, vocalizing)

401
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,322
GI HANNA
CALLING

402
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,032
Hi, Hanna. Hi.

403
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,575
Hi, Hanna. I'm Yoo...

404
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,703
(message tone)

405
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,873
GI HANNA

406
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,458
-HANNA: I'm busy.
-DAEIL: Mm...

407
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,006
(sighs)

408
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,473
Why the long face?

409
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,308
Is everything all right?

410
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:12,145
You know how Mom waited three years
while Dad was serving in the army?

411
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,233
That's a random question.

412
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,278
How did she do that?
She must have missed him so much.

413
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,114
Do you have a girlfriend now?

414
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,492
No, she's not my girlfriend.

415
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,202
DAEIL'S GRANDFATHER: Are you
just flirting?

416
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,745
Yes.

417
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,542
She must be a very picky girl.

418
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,420
She really is.

419
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,798
But don't give up.

420
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,093
You're one of those late bloomers.

421
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,679
It took you three years to get into KNPU.

422
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,186
(Daeil groans)

423
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,481
(Daeil sighs)

424
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,233
(Daeil's grandfather clears throat)

425
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,362
DAEIL: Gosh, it's heavy.

426
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:03,947
(dreamy music)

427
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,328
(exclaiming)
Go away! Get lost!

428
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,082
Hey! Rub it gently.

429
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,502
Each of those rocks is worth
at least ten million won.

430
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,837
What?

431
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,965
It's a family heirloom that has been
passed down for generations.

432
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,467
Be careful with it.

433
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,843
Ah... Okay.

434
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,349
I'm heading out for a while.

435
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,353
When you're done, put the big ones outside

436
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,189
and put the small ones
on the shelves. Okay?

437
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,565
-Okay.
-(clears throat)

438
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,858
I'll see you later.

439
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,236
(door opens)

440
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,197
(door closes)

441
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,826
(cellphone buzzing)

442
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,744
Oh...

443
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,913
(cellphone buzzing continues)

444
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,331
INCOMING CALL
GI HANNA

445
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,168
(clears throat)

446
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,545
(vocalizing, clears throat)

447
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,256
(vocalizing continues)

448
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,759
Hey. Hello. What's up?

449
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,678
You called. But why the video call?

450
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,014
Just, you know...

451
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,308
Why not?

452
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,853
Just text me. I can't talk on the phone
because I'm tutoring all day.

453
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,856
HANNA: I only called you now because
the kid went to the bathroom.

454
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,360
How many sessions are you tutoring?

455
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,112
HANNA: Five.

456
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,323
DAEIL: Five?

457
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,576
That's so many. You might get ill.

458
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,995
I need to make money.
You know my situation.

459
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,457
HANNA: I might end up
telling all my secrets to you.

460
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,334
(chuckles)

461
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,293
(door opens)

462
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,336
I'll call you later.

463
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,004
-(cellphone beeps)
-Hey, Hanna...

464
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,382
(sighs)

465
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,092
That sounds tough.

466
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,718
(grunts)

467
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,393
DAEIL: How much money does she need?

468
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,271
(whimsical music)

469
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,111
DAEIL'S GRANDFATHER: Each of those rocks
is worth at least ten million won.

470
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,782
No, Daeil. You're going to be
a police officer.

471
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,286
But there are so many of them.
Just taking one should be okay.

472
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:23,670
(sighs)

473
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,465
You're being sacrificed for a future cop

474
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,843
who will be in charge
of public order in this country.

475
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,225
What are you doing there?

476
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,643
-Huh?
-(loud thud)

477
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,023
(stammering)
Grandpa...

478
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,484
(screaming)

479
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,737
SOUTH GANGNEUNG POLICE STATION

480
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,322
DETECTIVE LEE:
Here's Min Haeji's autopsy report.

481
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,826
AUTOPSY REPORT

482
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,163
It was a drug overdose
caused by asphyxiation.

483
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,000
The substance found in the syringe
matches the drugs found in her blood.

484
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,046
My goodness.
(clicking tongue)

485
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,925
I heard she told her grandmother
that she was going to be rich soon.

486
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,927
But it seems like she took the wrong path.

487
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,971
Wait. I think I know what this is.

488
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,183
Isn't it the drug that is popular
in Gangnam clubs these days?

489
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,684
(suspenseful music)

490
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,853
-Clubs?
-Yes.

491
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,522
Right?

492
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,482
NAMGI: "Alto"?

493
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:29,277
Yes. I bumped into her there that day
and our phones were switched.

494
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,447
And I heard
she'd been out of contact since.

495
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,533
EUNKANG: She's a friend of my sister.

496
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,909
My sister was looking for her.

497
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,495
Did you notice anything strange
when you saw her?

498
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,747
To be honest,

499
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,208
It was like she was being chased.

500
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,460
SEUNGHYUN: Her eyes were filled
with fright.

501
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,379
NAMGI: Like she was being chased?

502
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,923
What for?

503
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,425
I'm not sure.

504
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,470
She was with other people there.

505
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,348
-Other people?
-Maybe you should talk to one of them.

506
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,517
(suspenseful music continues)

507
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,479
(phone ringing)

508
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,904
SHIN EUISEOK

509
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,948
-Detective Lee.
-DETECTIVE LEE: Yes, sir?

510
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,366
Check this guy's background?

511
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,577
Yes, sir.

512
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,045
(cellphone vibrates)

513
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,470
YOO DAEIL

514
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,973
HANNA: Did you get hurt?

515
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,766
Yes.

516
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,228
My fourth toe got fractured.

517
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,564
I'm wearing a half cast now,

518
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,025
but the doctor said
I might have to wear a full cast.

519
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,234
What happened?

520
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,404
(uplifting music)

521
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,782
I was just messing around.
(chuckles)

522
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,659
(sighs)
You should have been careful.

523
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,661
DAEIL: Where are you?

524
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,122
HANNA: I'm on my way to the next student.

525
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,124
Are you eating your meals?

526
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,042
Yes.

527
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,587
Hey, worry about yourself.
It's going to be really inconvenient.

528
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,381
HANNA: I also wore a cast
at the beginning of the semester.

529
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,759
I got so many blisters on my hands,
because of the crutches.

530
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,802
DAEIL: Right. You were wearing a cast too.

531
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,429
I remember now.

532
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,057
Funny we have so many things in common.

533
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,643
We must be really meant to be.

534
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,228
What are you talking about?

535
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,022
I'm just kidding.

536
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,442
Did your heart skip a beat?

537
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,112
Anyway, get well soon.

538
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,115
HANNA: Don't drink too much water.

539
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,742
Going to the restroom is such a hassle.

540
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,911
Okay. I won't.

541
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,538
By the way,

542
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,541
can I call you when I'm bored?

543
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,174
-Okay.
-Really? Can we video chat too--

544
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,759
Hello?

545
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,636
Hanna... Hello?

546
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,641
(chuckles)

547
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,894
Why does he like video chatting so much?
(scoffs)

548
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,562
(phone buzzing)

549
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,025
DAEIL: Because I want to see your face.

550
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,571
(scoffs)

551
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,328
(bus honking)

552
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,291
DAEIL: Next time, I'll video call you.

553
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,960
If you answer it,

554
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,878
we'll start dating.

555
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,805
(dings)

556
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,394
ARI: It's hot.

557
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,104
(sniffs)

558
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,355
(exclaims)

559
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:54,774
Gosh.

560
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,195
He's so lucky to have a girlfriend
who is pretty, smart,

561
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,572
and even a good cook.

562
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,950
He might even end up crying.

563
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,535
(exclaiming softly)

564
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,037
You're so lucky.

565
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:12,041
(cellphone buzzing)

566
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,210
Hey, Tak.

567
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,379
I was just going to call you actually.

568
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,757
Guess what I just did.

569
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,219
The hospital?

570
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,683
MINI JOKBAL

571
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,144
This is not what I talked about.

572
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,647
I sent you the link so you could buy
Jangchung-dong Granny's Jokbal.

573
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,734
Sorry. It's too far away, so we just
got one from a convenience store.

574
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,737
(sighs)
I've been waiting for it the entire day.

575
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,113
(sighs)
Gosh. Just eat it.

576
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,532
Bumju came all the way from Daejeon
to see you.

577
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,533
(sucks teeth)

578
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,911
-What about the fruit?
-Here.

579
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,123
When you're sick,
you need a lot of vitamin C.

580
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,838
DAEIL: What's this?

581
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,507
What? I thought it'd be easier to eat.

582
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,592
Hey, when you visit someone
in the hospital,

583
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,386
you usually bring a big basket
full of fruit.

584
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,808
You know... fruits like apple mangoes,
avocados, or fancy oranges.

585
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,976
EUNKANG: You're not here to eat.

586
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,979
Stop complaining and just eat them.

587
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,397
If you were stuck here all day,

588
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,692
-you'd be obsessed with food too.
-Hey. Whatever.

589
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,613
Take this and shut up.

590
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,781
What's this?

591
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,534
ARI: I did some baking.

592
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,954
Those are homemade cookies I made.

593
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,705
(all exclaiming)

594
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,833
Wow, Ari.

595
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,543
DAEIL: Hey, try it.

596
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,672
(munching)
Mmm...

597
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,465
-It tastes good.
-Yes.

598
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,384
Ari. You got a pass.

599
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,301
Shut up.

600
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,427
(chuckles, munches)

601
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,935
Hey. Where's Juyoung, by the way?

602
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,855
She's always going on about being
true friends, how come she isn't here?

603
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,440
-Does she even know I'm hospitalized?
-Don't look for Juyoung.

604
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,984
She doesn't seem well lately.

605
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:01,943
Why?

606
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,403
(sighs)

607
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,447
I'm not physically hurt,
but a bit emotionally.

608
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,366
Why? What happened?

609
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,492
(Juyoung sighs)

610
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,079
You know some say your soulmate
is right next to you sometimes.

611
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,372
(emotive music)

612
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,376
JUYOUNG: There's this guy I always see
on the bus on my way to the gym.

613
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,387
And he seemed a bit interested in me.

614
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,514
Awesome. So?

615
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,770
He seemed hesitant,
so I gave a classic line.

616
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,148
(beeps)

617
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,029
I'm getting off at the next stop.

618
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,448
-(group exclaiming)
-(Ari laughing)

619
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,533
"I'm getting off at the next stop"?

620
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,869
Oh. Okay.

621
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,796
MAN 1: See? I told you
she's going to get off soon.

622
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,381
MAN 2: That was amazing. How did you know?

623
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,008
I had a hunch.

624
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,427
AUTOMATIC DOOR

625
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,814
I've got to leave this city.

626
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,358
I'm too embarrassed to stay here.

627
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,986
Maybe I should put on a disguise
when I'm outside.

628
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,990
(all laughing)

629
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,241
(Ari laughing on phone)

630
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,534
Stop laughing.

631
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,828
-I'm so sorry. My gosh.
-(laughing on phone)

632
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,205
I said, stop laughing!

633
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,084
(all laughing)

634
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,129
Hey, kids. Be quiet!

635
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,673
You're so loud...

636
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,757
(grunting)

637
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,342
My neck.

638
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,427
GROUP: Sorry.

639
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,558
-I didn't know there was a person here.
-I had no idea.

640
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,730
ARI: Sorry.

641
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,148
Please have some.

642
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,776
-Let's be quiet, okay?
-ARI: Okay.

643
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,197
Hey, what's that?

644
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,951
There's one more.

645
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,869
Let me see.

646
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:21,749
(gasps)

647
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,292
(Ari whispers)
Hey. No! Not that.

648
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,044
DAEIL: Ari.

649
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,756
Did you bring two boxes so I can share
with the patients here?

650
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,299
(whimsical music)

651
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,889
(exclaiming)
Hey. Have some. Eat up.

652
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,392
DAEIL: Come on. Have some.

653
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,602
Eat up. They're pretty.

654
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,687
EUNKANG: They really are.

655
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,938
DAEIL: Mmm!

656
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,233
(munching)

657
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,610
DAEIL: Ari.

658
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,238
-This one tastes even better.
-SEUNGHYUN: It's so good.

659
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,322
(group exclaiming)

660
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,159
It's really good.

661
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,000
Hey, look.

662
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,837
Oh... We meet again.

663
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,547
-Hello.
-Hello.

664
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,798
What brings you here?

665
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,801
EUNKANG: Uh, we were visiting
a friend here.

666
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,137
-What about you?
-I'm also visiting someone.

667
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,347
Right. I met your father recently.

668
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,807
Oh. I see.

669
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,811
We went fishing. He even cooked us ramyeon
and gave me a lot of great advice.

670
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,522
Please tell him
I'd like to invite him to a nice dinner.

671
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,523
Okay.

672
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,608
All right, then.

673
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,239
Wait. Secretary Shin.

674
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,743
Has the police contacted you
by any chance?

675
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,661
(foreboding music)

676
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,165
Well, we had a brief conversation
over the phone.

677
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,833
I gave them your contact.

678
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,627
I should have told you. I'm sorry.

679
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,587
EUISEOK: It's okay.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

680
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,426
Isn't he Jo Hansol? How do you know him?

681
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,969
I'll tell you on the way. Let's go.

682
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,724
What was he talking about?

683
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,479
The police called me a few days ago,
as a witness to the Min Haeji case.

684
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,940
I thought you took care of it.

685
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,108
I did.

686
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,319
But it happened to be Seunghyun
who found the body...

687
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:17,156
-What?
-Apparently, he was in Gangneung that day.

688
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,367
When he reported it to the police,

689
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,953
he told the detective
that I was with Min Haeji

690
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,414
-in the club.
-God damn it!

691
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,462
You said

692
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,673
he took that girl's phone, right?

693
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:34,715
Yes.

694
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,426
Why does he keep getting involved in this?

695
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,011
Did you find

696
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,639
-that insurance or whatever?
-I'm still on it.

697
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,395
Look. Look at me.

698
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,647
You think this is a treasure hunt?

699
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,609
What we're looking for here
is not some stupid treasure.

700
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,069
It's a bomb.

701
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,321
A time bomb. Tick-tock, tick-tock.

702
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,823
Don't you get it?

703
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,742
(foreboding music continues)

KO MIKANG

708
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,366
SEUNGHYUN: If you happen to hear from her,

709
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,369
please tell her
Ms. Ko Mikang is looking for her.

710
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,123
MIKANG: Haeji, pick up the phone.

711
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,626
You said you'd give
the money back by today.

712
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,128
Are you ever going to answer your phone?

713
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,923
Hey, enough is enough. Answer me!

714
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,301
My mom will kill me if she finds out.

715
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,595
Hey, seriously?

716
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,180
Min Haeji!

717
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,684
If you keep ignoring me, I'll sell
the laptop you asked me to hold on to.

718
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,688
(cellphone buzzing)

719
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:17,151
(cellphone buzzing continues)

720
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,570
Who is this?

721
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,575
Hello?

722
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,626
Where are you going?

723
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,503
I need to give this to someone.

724
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,464
-A laptop? Is it yours?
-No, it's Haeji's.

725
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,049
She asked me to keep it for her.

726
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:43,302
Some man called me
and said she borrowed it from him.

727
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,929
MIKANG: He's coming here to pick it up.

728
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,890
Actually, it kind of made me feel bad
that I was keeping this.

729
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,225
(clicks tongue)
I'm glad he wants it back.

730
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,060
I didn't know you were keeping her laptop.

731
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,105
Yes. She said
I should keep it as security.

732
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,524
MIKANG: She wanted me to keep it,
so I did.

733
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,609
All right then.

734
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,236
-MIKANG: I'll see you around.
-Okay.

735
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,698
Mikang.

736
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,701
-Yes?
-Do men...

737
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,037
usually use pink laptops?

738
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,748
(suspenseful music)

739
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,758
Hello?

740
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,468
Hi.

741
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,514
I'm Haeji's friend.
We talked on the phone earlier.

742
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,600
I just realized
I forgot to check something.

743
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,688
You know the password, right?

744
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,858
MIKANG: I just want to check
if it's really your laptop.

745
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,194
Right. It's 2020.

746
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,613
Okay. 2020.

747
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,492
It says it's wrong.

748
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,411
Then, try 4567.

749
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,204
Okay. 4567?

750
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,622
INCORRECT, TRY AGAIN

751
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,749
It's wrong again.

752
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,958
Try 2580.

753
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,710
(laptop chimes)

754
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,340
It isn't this either.

755
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,928
Are you sure this is your laptop?

756
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:12,266
I have many laptops,
so I might have been confused.

757
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,810
What's the model of the laptop?

758
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,649
MIKANG: D14I1410.

759
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,444
Ahh... I was mistaken.

760
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,822
Yes. Sorry about the inconvenience.

761
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,542
See? I told you something was off.

762
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,504
Wow. I almost gave it to him.

763
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,883
But how did he know Haeji gave it to me?

764
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,927
Do you think he knows her?

765
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,472
I guess so. Did he say what his name was?

766
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,517
No. I didn't think to ask.

767
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,938
I mean, he just called me
and said he knew I had Haeji's laptop

768
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,941
so he'd come pick it up.
He sounded so confident.

769
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,153
But what does he want to take this for?

770
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,825
Does he want to sell it? Is it expensive?

771
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,036
Well, it's an old model.

772
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,414
I don't think it'll be that expensive.

773
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,334
(dogs barking in distance)

774
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,673
(keypad clacking)

775
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:32,972
WHEN YOU FORGOT YOUR LOGIN PASSWORD

776
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,640
(doorbell chimes)

777
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,561
Who could it be?

778
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,438
(groans)

779
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:45,901
(door opens)

780
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,488
(door closes)

781
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,158
It's here.

782
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,077
But we didn't apply for one.

783
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,247
We're changing our long-term clients'
routers for free these days.

784
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,707
I see.

785
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,216
(suspenseful music)

786
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,762
Excuse me. Can I have a glass of water?

787
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,014
Oh, sure.

788
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,396
-You know how these are sweet potatoes?
-Right.

789
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,648
YANGCHUL: In my hometown,
we just called them potatoes.

790
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,617
They're here.

791
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,160
EUISEOK: Just take it and leave.

792
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,765
Here.

793
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,266
Oh, thank you.
(breathing heavily)

794
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:07,858
EUNKANG: Hmm?

795
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,197
Wait. Is this...

796
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:15,658
(cup shatters)

797
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,243
EUNKANG: Hey, wait.

798
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,286
(both grunt)

799
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,829
(thrilling music)

800
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,459
(stammers)
Who are you?

801
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,752
I said, who are you?

802
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,712
EUNKANG: Thief!

803
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,713
(grunts)

804
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,591
HEESOOK: Honey! Bastard! Hey!

805
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,593
-(grunts)
-HEESOOK: Who are you?

806
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,763
(loud thud)

807
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,266
(groans)

808
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,478
-Let go.
-Get him.

809
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,522
-Let it go!
-Get him!

810
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,691
-Get him!
-Hey!

811
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,901
-Damn it.
-Hey! Look!

812
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,236
(dogs barking)

813
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,033
-EUNKANG: Hey!
-HEESOOK: Hey! Stop!

814
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,828
(Eunkang panting)

815
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,204
What?

816
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,504
EUNKANG: Darn it.

817
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,384
What the...

818
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,304
Where did he go?

819
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,016
Darn it.

820
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,397
(engine revving)

821
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,944
YANGCHUL: That kid looked like a wuss.

822
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,447
If I was ten years younger, I would've...
(grunting)

823
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,657
Ten years younger,
you would've broken an arm.

824
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:39,575
-HEESOOK: Don't move.
-YANGCHUL: Be gentle.

825
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,161
YANGCHUL: By the way,
you really impressed me.

826
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,162
HEESOOK: I've still got it.

827
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,582
He left the router and all his tools here.

828
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,793
What? There's no such event?

829
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,212
EUNKANG: Then why did he say...

830
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,091
(ominous music)

831
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,803
COUNTRY, JUSTICE, HONOR
GYMNASIUM

832
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,972
(water trickling)

833
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:21,700
(grunts)

834
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,078
(Tak sighs)

835
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,621
I'm already tired.

836
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,082
And this is just a warm-up.
Can we even finish?

837
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,208
Tell me about it.

838
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,336
And in the ocean, it'll be much harder.

839
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,546
We'll be exhausted
before we even get halfway.

840
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,590
(both panting)

841
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,967
(water splashes)

842
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,472
(whimsical music)

843
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,143
He's a monster.

844
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:57,152
By the way,
doesn't his back look familiar?

845
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,489
Yes. I've been thinking the same.
(breathes heavily)

846
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,991
(both breathing heavily)

847
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,341
(exhales sharply)

848
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,551
(gasps)

849
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,635
BOTH: Professor Cha?!

850
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:23,804
UGON: Oh...

851
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,097
Hey.

852
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:26,557
(pants)

853
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,933
What are you doing here?

854
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,353
-SEUNGHYUN: You're participating too?
-UGON: Of course.

855
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:36,316
I've been doing triathlons for
ten years now. I finished three Ironmans.

856
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,860
(both exclaim)

857
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,611
Have you always liked to exercise?

858
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,529
No.

859
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,031
I didn't exercise when I was a cop.

860
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,160
I started after I quit
and went to Germany to study.

861
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,537
Because of the man next door.

862
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:54,209
He was a soldier who lost an arm
from an accident.

863
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,671
And he did a triathlon every year.

864
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:02,509
I thought, "My. Why does he even do that?
He's disabled."

865
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,720
But he finished it every year.

866
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,015
Seeing that, I realized

867
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,602
humans really can do anything.

868
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,646
That was a light-bulb moment to me.

869
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,065
UGON: In fact,

870
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,068
I left Korea because I felt like
I couldn't do anything here.

871
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,529
It was like I was running away.

872
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,825
But, Professor...

873
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,578
why did you quit being a police officer?

874
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,330
TAK: I'd like to know that too.

875
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,416
Because I heard you graduated with honors.

876
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,170
I told you. I ran away
because there's nothing I could do.

877
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,464
What does that mean?

878
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,049
Did something happen?

879
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,009
What happened was...

880
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,182
(dramatic music)

881
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,022
I forgot.

882
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,608
(both laughing)

883
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:00,984
UGON: Let's go eat.

884
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,487
-SEUNGHYUN: All right.
-TAK: Okay.

885
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,449
COMMENDATION

886
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,164
UGON: Is this your first time
in a staff apartment?

887
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,374
Yes.

888
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,169
Is your family still in Germany then?

889
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,839
UGON: Yeah.
(laughs)

890
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:25,634
People think it's because
of my daughter's studies,

891
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:29,054
but in fact, it's because
my wife is doing a Ph.D. there.

892
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,138
(exclaiming)

893
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,975
UGON: And my daughter
is there supporting her.

894
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,227
She's in middle school.

895
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,230
She says she isn't smart,
so she might just as well support her mom.

896
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,356
(both laughing)

897
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,526
Professor. Your bathroom is so clean.

898
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,821
-You're not really how you look.
-UGON: Really?

899
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,907
-The food is ready. Let's eat.
-TAK: Okay.

900
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,951
-Come and take it to the table.
-SEUNGHYUN: Okay.

901
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,370
SEUNGHYUN: Whoa!

902
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,539
-My goodness. All this...
-What's all this?

903
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,541
It's not much.

904
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,710
Living alone for five years now.
This is nothing.

905
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:00,919
Eat up.

906
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,005
BOTH: Thank you.

907
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,049
(crockery clanging)

908
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,056
-Mmm...
-(munching)

909
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,518
-Hey. Have some meat too.
-Thanks.

910
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,396
My gosh. You should try this too.
It tastes amazing.

911
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,356
TAK: Mmm...

912
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,402
(somber music)

913
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,865
HYUNSOO: My parents passed away.

914
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:31,992
Are you alone then?

915
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,787
No, sir. I have a grandmother
and a little brother in Gimhae.

916
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,626
TAK: Professor.

917
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,172
-Professor.
-Yes?

918
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,549
Which class were you in?

919
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,593
By the way, sir.

920
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,929
Which class were you in?

921
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,518
Why?

922
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,897
Because today I realized
you were such a cool senior.

923
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:02,940
(chuckles)

924
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,191
Thanks.

925
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,111
-Eat up.
-Thanks for the food.

926
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,656
Do you really not know that?

927
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,201
-Yes.
-He was in the 22nd class.

928
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,079
(sips)
Really? I didn't know.

929
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,580
(crockery clanging)

930
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,749
How could you not know
what class he was in?

931
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,461
Are you bragging that you know him well?

932
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,462
-No.
-Are you sure?

933
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,589
No way.
(chuckling)

934
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,049
-I think you are.
-No way. Not at all.

935
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,300
No, no.

936
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,302
That's not true. That's a dangerous idea.

937
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,722
Hey. Eunkang.

938
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,558
(engine rumbling)

939
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,353
(sighs)

940
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,896
(whimsical music)

941
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,532
I think they're after this laptop.

942
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:57,494
They tried to trick my sister but failed.
That's why they came to our house.

943
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,207
Maybe...

944
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,502
-there's something important in it.
-Exactly.

945
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,838
So I thought about it.

946
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,970
I think it might be a video.

947
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,346
A video?

948
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,723
You know, something like...

949
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,976
a sex video or spy cam footage
from women's restrooms.

950
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,521
Then the dead woman was being blackmailed
with the spy cam footage?

951
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,856
It's possible.

952
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,443
Gosh! We need to know the password.

953
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,236
(clicks tongue)
We can format the computer,

954
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,073
but then all the data will be deleted.

955
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,411
What on earth do you think is in here?

956
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,290
I know a way.

957
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,585
We know an expert.

958
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,380
Try all the combinations.
It's the quickest way.

959
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,008
Come on. It's going to take forever.

960
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,011
TAK: You went to a science high school.
There must be a shortcut.

961
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,555
No. And even if there is, you can't do it.

962
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,142
JUYOUNG: They say,
"More haste, less speed."

963
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,727
In other words, "Blood, sweat, tears".

964
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:08,857
From 0000 to 9999, there are
10,000 possible combinations in total.

965
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,318
You're three,
so 10,000 divided by three equals...

966
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,446
You'll have 3,333 options each.

967
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,576
Trying 1,000 passwords
will take about an hour and a half,

968
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:23,914
so trying 3,333 options
will take about five hours.

969
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,874
If you take turns

970
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:30,712
and try 3,333 passwords
for five hours each,

971
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,799
you'll find something
within 15 hours tops.

972
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,343
After all, this will be the fastest way.

973
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:37,969
What, 15 hours?

974
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,472
Zero, zero, one, two.

975
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,142
INCORRECT PIN. TRY AGAIN.

976
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,310
Zero, zero, two, zero.

977
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,729
Zero, five, zero, eight.

978
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,816
EUNKANG: Zero, six, zero, three.

979
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,529
One, zero, zero, two. Take it easy.

980
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,039
Two, zero, one, zero.

981
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,085
Three, three, zero, three.

982
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,047
-What was that?
-Three, three, zero, five.

983
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,841
TAK: Three, seven, zero, five.

984
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,468
(yawning)

985
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,846
Three, seven, zero, six.

986
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,518
Three, seven, zero, seven.

987
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,353
EUNKANG: Four, four, eight, three.

988
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,772
Four, four, eight, four.

989
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,316
Four, four, eight, five.

990
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:34,818
-(snoring)
-(keyboard clacking)

991
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,153
EUNKANG: Four, four, eight, six.

992
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,406
Four, four, eight, seven.

993
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,658
Four, four, eight, eight.

994
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,995
WELCOME

995
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,288
We found it.

996
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,456
We found it.

997
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,001
WELCOME

998
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,016
Huh?

999
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,734
(foreboding music)

1000
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:19,654
Where is this?

1001
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,073
Isn't it a bar?

1002
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,408
(breathes deeply)

1003
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:27,662
TRUTH ALWAYS HAS ITS FOLLOWERS
AND JUSTICE IS ALWAYS ACHIEVED ONE DAY

1004
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,747
DOSAN, AHN CHANGHO

1005
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,415
(suspenseful music)

1006
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,167
This is horrible.

1007
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,836
How could a human being
do something like that?

1008
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,880
He's trash. Who is he?

1009
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,507
We don't know. We can't see the face.

1010
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,802
SEUNGHYUN: There's no sound either.

1011
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,097
How does Min Haeji have this video?

1012
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,475
She might have filmed it herself.

1013
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,569
This woman is Min Haeji.

1014
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,074
SEUNGHYUN: Judging by the angle,

1015
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,910
it seems like she was wearing the camera.

1016
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,000
TAK: Does that mean Min Haeji

1017
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,544
wasn't being blackmailed

1018
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,255
but the one blackmailing?

1019
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,465
And the person she was blackmailing...

1020
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,093
Might have killed her.

1021
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,183
Although, it's all speculation,

1022
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,020
this might be an important clue
to her death.

1023
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,815
Shouldn't we be calling the police?

1024
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,406
DETECTIVE LEE:
I checked Shin Euiseok's background.

1025
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,284
He's chief secretary
to Changui Investment's CEO Jo Hansol.

1026
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,619
He's 38 and his English name is Daniel.

1027
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,121
He's a Korean American.

1028
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,707
He started working for Jo Hansol
when he took over Changui.

1029
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:58,670
He owns eight apartments in Korea,
and one of them

1030
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,172
is where Min Haeji was registered.

1031
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,347
Jo Hansol's secretary?

1032
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:15,186
(cellphone buzzing)

1033
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:20,066
WI SEUNGHYUN

1034
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,612
I wish I could send it to you,
but I can't. It's blocked.

1035
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,989
I can't copy it either.

1036
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,283
I can go there. Could you wait for me?

1037
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,826
Don't show it to anyone else.

1038
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,995
What? What do you mean...

1039
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,621
NAMGI: Let's talk about
the details in person.

1040
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,334
Again, don't show the video to anyone
until I get there.

1041
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,252
Not even the police.

1042
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,922
If you tell anyone about it,
we'll lose the video.

1043
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,594
But if the person

1044
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,722
who tried to steal the laptop

1045
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,766
has something to do
with Min Haeji's death,

1046
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,770
that probably means
he's one of the people in the video.

1047
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,855
Very likely, yes.

1048
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,483
(sighs)
Do you think we can find him?

1049
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,068
We don't know his face.

1050
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,780
When is Detective Kang coming?

1051
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:10,158
We're meeting around midnight.
He said he'd call when he's nearby.

1052
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,829
Good luck.

1053
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,540
And keep the evidence safe.

1054
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,334
Okay. You can head in now.

1055
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,213
(smooches)

1056
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,297
-Bye.
-(Seunghyun chuckles)

1057
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,351
(ominous music)

1058
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,662
(sips)

1059
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,758
Gosh. Dad.

1060
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,220
And he looks for his watch every morning.

1061
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,138
(clicks tongue)

1062
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,558
(foreboding music)

1063
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:22,313
See? I'm a huge fan.
I even took a photo with him.

1064
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,442
Isn't that watch gorgeous?
Apparently, it's one of a kind.

1065
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,193
ARI: It's custom-made by a Swiss artisan.

1066
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,904
Rich people live
in a completely different world.

1067
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,323
(tense suspenseful music)

1068
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,247
(door shuts)

1069
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,297
-SEUNGHYUN: Hey, Eunkang.
-Seunghyun, I know who he is.

1070
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:49,716
Hang on.

1071
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,593
(clicking)

1072
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,185
Found it.

1073
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,938
(tense suspenseful music continues)

1074
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,952
EUNKANG: It's Jo Hansol.

1075
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:22,165
He was looking for the laptop because
of the watch that can identify him.

1076
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,168
You're right. It's the same.

1077
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,129
-(crowd clamoring)
-(glass clinks)

1078
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:33,051
The future and the company you dream of.
We will make that together.

1079
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,011
HANSOL: Right. I met your father recently.

1080
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,430
We went fishing. He even cooked us ramyeon

1081
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,307
and gave me a lot of great advice.

1082
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,308
Hello?

1083
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,226
Yes?

1084
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:42,685
What?

1085
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,854
(tense music)

1086
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,986
(upbeat music)
