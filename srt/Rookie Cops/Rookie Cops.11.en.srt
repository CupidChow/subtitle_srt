00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,661
(woman screaming)

00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,582
(thuds)

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,004
(grunting)

00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,423
(ominous music continues)

13
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,510

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,389

00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,273
(live music playing faintly)

18
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,316
(Hansol sighs)

19
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,487
HANSOL: You managed to film it somehow.

20
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,450
But you're not allowed to bring
phones in here. How did you film it?

21
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,535
I don't need a phone to make videos.

22
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,914
In this world of technology,
there are various kinds of spy cams.

23
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,457
I appreciate your hard work.

24
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,002
(munches)

25
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,879
But what a shame.

26
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,340
You can't see my face in it.
Nobody would know it's me.

27
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,633
Why not?

28
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,263
This obviously shows that it's you.

29
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,311
(breathes heavily)

30
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,396
What do you want?

31
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,731
Um...

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,359
-One billion won.
-One billion won?

33
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,070
HAEJI: It's not much money to you.

34
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,242
You own this club and hotel.

35
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,246
And you invest billions of won every day.

36
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,164
-(slurps)
-You'd better think it through.

37
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,000
If you don't want me to disclose
what happened in this room.

38
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,210
(chuckles, blows liquid)

39
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,963
(Hansol snickers)

40
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,510
(in Korean, English)
Sorry about that. Sorry.

41
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,262
(sighs)

42
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,472
(faint upbeat music playing)

43
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,892
(in Korean) Are you okay?
Do you want to wipe it off yourself?

44
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,104
Sorry.

45
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,444
(sighs)

46
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,656
But you know what?

47
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,916
(whispers) I think
you're the one who should think

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,668
about how you can get out of here.

49
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,087
(foreboding music)

50
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,554
If you don't let me go,
you're going to be in serious trouble.

51
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,182
I didn't save the video just here.

52
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,058
I have insurance, of course.

53
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,059
(gasps, grunts)

54
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,937
No. Hey, look at me.

55
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,816
That's not how you blackmail someone.

56
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,777
It's something people like me
do to people like you.

57
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,113
It's not for a lowly girl like you. Okay?

58
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,032
-Okay? Answer me.
-(gasping)

59
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,242
-Answer me.
-(whimpering)

60
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,455

62

DANNY

(thrilling music)

64
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,505
HANSOL: Hey. What's up?

65
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,800
What?

66
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,010
No.

67
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,306
(Haeji breathes heavily)

68
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,768
(footsteps receding)

69
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,189
Hey, a crazy woman just ran out.
Bring her back, okay?

70
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,235
(breathing heavily)

71
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,403
(tense music)

72
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,076
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
-(Haeji grunting)

73
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,661
(breathes heavily)

(crowd cheering)

84
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,345
Can I use your phone?

85
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,265
-Why?
-It got switched with someone else's.

86
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,892
I see.

87
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,771
(lively music playing)

88
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,566

(live music playing)

93
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,170
Hello?

94
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,425
(snickers)

95
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,220
(laughing)

(lively music playing)

97
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:53,311
(speaking weakly) Help me...

98
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,064
(ominous music)

99
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,944
-Yes?
-Hello?

100
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,782
What?

101
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,369
Okay.

102
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,330
(phone beeps)

103
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,916
(ominous music continues)

104
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,547
She's fine.

105
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,341
Ask her where she put it
when she wakes up.

106
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,300
SHIN: Yes, sir.

107
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,259
(phone clacks)

108
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,432
(ominous music)

109
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,562
SEUNGHYUN: Yes. I just came out.

110
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,774
Huh?

111
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,277
Are you Secretary Shin?

112
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,071
5 DAYS AGO

113
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,614

(metal clacks)

116
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,621
SEUNGHYUN: Hey, you just hit that car.

117
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,625
Are you okay, sir?

118
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,296
(breathes deeply)

119

-(exhales)
-(glass thuds)

122
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,441
Are cops allowed to hit-and-run?

123
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,068
BOTH: I'm sorry.

124
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,572
We wanted to come yesterday,
but we had a situation.

125
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,157
I'm really sorry.

126
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,784
I was just joking.

127
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,910
(Hansol laughs)

128
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,787
HANSOL: Don't be so nervous.

129
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,456
Don't worry.

130
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,541
The Chief of the patrol division
told me everything.

131
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:40,918
Ah...

132
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,714
-And the repair cost should be insured...
-Don't worry about it.

133
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,134
Our company will take care of it all,
so don't worry.

134
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,761
You're going to be great cops
in the future.

135
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,599
Please think of this
as my expression of support.

136
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,517
BOTH: Thank you.

137
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,019
Please, don't mention it.

138
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,479
-(knocks on door)

139

CHANGUI INVESTMENT

140
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,070
You have an appointment at seven with
the Minister of Science and Technology.

141
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,198
Oh, no. I'd love to talk more,

142
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,991
but I have an appointment.

143
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,451
Don't worry. We're okay.

144
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,703
Secretary Shin
will drive you back to school.

145
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,830
It's okay. We can just take the bus.

146
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,873
Don't worry about us.

147
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,250
You look a lot like your father.

148
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,211
-(suspenseful music)
-Pardon?

149
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,588
Please give my regards to Commissioner Wi.

150
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,881
Tell him I'll call him soon.

151
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,591
Ahh...

152
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,092
Okay.

153
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,427
Goodbye then.

154
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,554
(suspenseful music)

155
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:35,932
(door opens)

156
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,476
-Hello.
-Hello.

157
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,978
-Can I have my phone back?
-Right. Here.

158
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,901
By the way,
where's the owner of the phone?

159
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,070
She's with us.

160
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,364
She's a little drunk, so I came instead.

161
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,491
(suspenseful music continues)

162
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:55,952
Good night, then.

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,706
(footsteps receding)

164
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,752
EUNKANG: Isn't he CEO Jo's secretary
from the other day?

165
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:05,711
SEUNGHYUN: Yes.

166
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,713
I didn't know he'd come
to a place like this.

167
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,090
He looks so serious.

168
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,424
(chuckles)

169
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,592
Let's get back inside.

170
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,344
(live music plays)

171
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,929
(crowd cheering)

172
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,729
(lively music playing)

173
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,068
(crowd cheering)

174
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,074
I came with my friends.

175
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,325
MAN: Oh, come on.

176
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,078
I've been watching you,
and you look like you're alone.

177
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,997
Come join us.

178
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,331
I'm here with my friends.

179
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,375
I said I've been watching you.
(chuckles)

180
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,379
(lively music playing)

181
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,215
Got business with my girlfriend?

182
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,135
I was just asking something.

183
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,262
(crowd cheering)

184
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,640
What took you so long?

185
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,395
(lively music playing)

186
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,523
(faint upbeat music playing)

187
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,071
(warm music)

188
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,510
(warm music continues)

189
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,696
(music fades)

00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,740

-(crowd cheering)
-(whistle blowing)

192
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,161
Hey, look. Over there.

193
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,789
DAEIL: What? I was just in the zone.

194
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,833
-(whistle blowing continues)
-Seriously! Look over there!

195
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,632
(live music continues)

196
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,477

EPISODE 11

201
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,145
(birds chirping)

202
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,940
HUISUK: Ko Mikang!

203
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,900
Ko Mikang!

204
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,947
Explain this.
Did you get into credit card debt again?

205
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,366
MIKANG (stammers): Mom, wait. Calm down.

206
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,535
It's not me. I didn't do it.

207
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,704
It was a friend.
She said she'd pay me back today.

208
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,913
Oh, really?

209
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,541
I told you I'm going to kill you
if you ever get into debt again!

210
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,085
HUISUK: You're just like your dad.
You barely make any money,

211
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,837
and yet you always lend money to others.

212
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,464
You are so dead today.

213
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,090
Wait, Mom. Help me.

214
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,508
Dad, help me.

215
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,552
-HEESOOK: Come here, you good-for-nothing!
-(yelps)

216
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,512
Get over here! Honey, move.

217
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,889
I'm telling you to move!

218
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,640
-Wait.
-Come here! You little...

219
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,310
-MIKANG: Dad.
-HEESOOK: Gosh. Move, honey.

220
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,354
Move. I'm going to
beat some sense into you today.

221
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,814
(Mikang shrieks)

222
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,358
-(thuds)
-(yelps)

223
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,110
(gasps)

224
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,489
-(grunting, screaming)
-(gasps)

225
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:03,949
(groans)

226
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,701
(grunting)

227
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,369
(gasps)
Sorry, Dad.

228
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,954
Honey, are you alive?

229
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,706
Ko Mikang!

230
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,166
My gosh! Her hand!

231
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,002
I'm leaving.

232
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,421
Mom! I'm sorry!

233
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,883
HEESOOK: Ko Mikang!

234
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,802
(object clatters)

235
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,887
(quirky music)

236
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,681
Gosh. What am I going to do with her?

237
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,559
EUNKANG: It was a bloodbath.

238
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,853
My mom used to be a volleyball player.

239
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,647
Her spikes are like...

240
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,107
-(thuds)
-Whoa!

241
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,443
So that's where you got
such a strong grip.

242
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,028
Even though you have such thin wrists.

243
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,863
They may seem weak,
but when I clench it...

244
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,281
-(creaking)
-(grunts)

245
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,491
Does it hurt?

246
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,201
-No.
-Hey!

247
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,661
(laughing)

248
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,746
(light music)

249
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,748
-Are you done?
-Not yet.

250
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,709
-How long is it going to take?
-Just wait.

251
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,712
When I read, I read thoroughly.

252
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,173
Oh...

253
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,842
He looks like me.

254
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,679
-What's that?
-(chuckles)

255
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,138
It's more like this.

256
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,141
-That's exactly what I did just now.
-(giggles)

257
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,643
I don't see the difference.

258
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,061
-I can be like him.
-Try.

259
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,397
(chuckles)
Do it again.

260
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,941
EUNKANG: It's a smirk.

261
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,985
(clears throat)

262
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,653
(clears throat)

263
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,948
(whispering) Your mouth should be
more like this. It's a smirk.

264
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,202
(both snickering)

265
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,288
(quirky music)

266
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,633
(page riffles)

267
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,595
(quirky music continues)

268
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,852
(engine revving)

269
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,938
Wow. I read a lot of comic books today.

270
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,524
What? You were just sleeping a lot.

271
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,071
I understand
that textbooks can make me sleepy,

272
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,073
but why do comic books make me sleepy too?

273
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,742
Maybe they weren't your type.

274
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,579
Then is there any comic book
that didn't make you sleepy?

275
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,872
Anne of Green Gables.

276
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,791
In the book, there's a line that goes,

277
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,669
"Your life doesn't always go your way,
but not always having it

278
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,214
go your way is amazing

279
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,010
because it means
your life is full of surprises."

280
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,888
-She sounds much more optimistic than you.
-(laughing)

281
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,098
She said she'd pay
the money back by today.

282
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,267
MIKANG: Then she ghosted me!

283
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,312
If I ever see her again,
I'm going to kill her.

284
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,691
Anyway, if she contacts you,
tell her to call me.

285
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,859
No matter what.

286
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,111
(sighs)
Gosh.

287
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,489
SEUNGHYUN: Hello.

288
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,533
Hello.

289
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:52,993
(chuckles)

290
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,454
(whimsical music)

291
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,455
Hey.

292
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,458
How much does it cost to hire
a private detective to find a person?

293
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,085
Why do you ask?

294
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,921
-This wench ran away with my money.
-EUNKANG: Who?

295
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,090
-Your friend from middle school?
-Yes.

296
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,341
-How much?
-Two million.

297
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,259
EUNKANG: Have you lost your mind?

298
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,844
How did you even have that much money?

299
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,014
I didn't. She said it was urgent,
so I got a cash advance.

300
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,265
-(sighs)
-(grumbles)

301
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,726
That wench. And she always has
the money for clubbing.

302
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,897
She can't run away from me.
I'm going to find her.

303
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,233
Right.

304
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,654
You said you went to Alto last weekend.

305
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,655
Yes.

306
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,033
Then by any chance,
have you seen this girl?

307
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,536
Her name is Min Haeji.
She practically lives at the club.

308
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,453
Not sure.

309
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,789
(suspenseful music)

310
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,707
Huh?

311
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,083
This woman is...

312
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,211
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

313
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,297
I think she's the woman
who took my phone then.

314
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,341
What do you think?

315
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,884
Ahh...

316
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,637
You've seen Haeji? When? What time?

317
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,764
I'm not exactly sure what time...

318
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,307
You used my phone then.

319
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,021
-It was 11:09 p.m.
-It was 11:09 p.m.?

320
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,983
Wasn't she with Secretary Shin then?

321
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,152
I don't know.

322
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,029
I only met her that day.

323
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,572
CHANGUI INVESTMENT
SECRETARY SHIN EUISEOK

324
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,033
Then could you maybe tell me
what time she left?

325
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,995
Well, she's a friend of someone I know,

326
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,456
and she told me she couldn't reach her.

327
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,166
I see.

328
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,626
It's okay.

329
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,587
If you happen to hear from her,

330
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,715
please tell her Ms. Ko Mikang
is looking for her.

331
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,091
Yes, thank you.

332
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,634
Bye.

333
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:35,929
(phone beeps)

334
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,974
(suspenseful music)

335
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,863
HANGUK SEOUL HOSPITAL

336
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,616
Father.

337
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,410
The weather is so nice today.

338
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,703
(machine beeping)

339
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,164
(breathing heavily)

340
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,376
It's perfect weather to die.

341
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,337
(breathing heavily)

342
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:12,966
(scoffs)

343
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,844
(knocks on door)

344
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,805
-Yes.
-(door opens)

345
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,230
It wasn't there?

346
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,940
Then where is it?

347
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,067
I'll keep looking.

348
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,654
Do you think she actually
saved the video somewhere else?

349
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,614
Maybe she got scared and lied to us.

350
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,407
I think you don't need to worry...

351
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,618
Do l look worried to you?

352
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,496
I'm not worried! I'm annoyed!

353
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,040
Watch your mouth, or I'll rip it off.

354
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,543
(tense music)

355
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,753
I'm annoyed because those losers

356
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,507
keep saying there are videos
and voice recordings.

357
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,551
Those damn bastards.

358
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,055
Whether I do drugs or dance buck naked,

359
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,390
it's none of their business.

360
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,643
Do they think they can put me
in prison or what?

361
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,939
I mean, Damos' revenue is
a whopping 15% of the country's GDP.

362
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,069
They want to support young startups.
Who is going to do that if not me?

363
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,114
(sighs)

364
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,117
Get it together, okay?

365
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,245
Don't make me angry.

366
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,956
You know how I get psycho when I'm angry.

367
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,002
(music fades)

368
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,343
(keypad clacking)

369
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,220
HANNA
DID YOU GET TO GANGNEUNG SAFELY?

370
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,388
Why isn't she replying?

371
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,183
If you read the message, answer it.
Where are your manners?

372
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,226
(sighs)

373
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,397
Did she block me?

374
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,569
(breathes heavily)

375
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,529
(grumbles)
Gosh!

376
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,698
It's not like I miss you.

377
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,868
I was just being nice to you.
Because I have manners.

378
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,161
Unbelievable.

379
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,370
(sighs)

380
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,458
(dreamy music)

381
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,169
(chuckles)

382
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,927
(dreamy music continues)

383
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,517
Whoa!

384
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:31,897
(scoffs)

385
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,899
How absurd.

386
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,528
(dreamy music continues)

387
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,742
(gasps)

388
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,828
(sighs)

389
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,206
(quirky music)

390
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,625
Get a grip, Yoo Daeil.

391
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,671
It's not like I miss her or anything.
Why do I keep seeing her?

392
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,423
DAEIL: I don't miss her at all.

393
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,051
(Daeil exhales sharply)

394
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,136
(dreamy music continues)

395
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,393
Whoa!

396
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,561
(quirky music)

397
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,524
I miss her.

398
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,903
But why isn't she replying?

399
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,655
(sighs)

400
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,241
EUNKANG: A trip?

401
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,119
That sounds great.
I wanted to go to the beach too.

402
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:31,540
Right? Wait. East Sea is known
for having beautiful beaches.

403
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:36,086
Let's see. Do we know anyone
who knows that area well?

404
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,546
EUNKANG: Hmm...

405
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,464
Hanna.

406
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,925
Hanna? Who was Hanna?

407
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,218
Hanna lives in Gangneung.

408
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,970
DAEIL: Oh, you mean,
Gi Hanna. You're right.

409
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:48,056
That's great. She can be our tour guide.

410
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,391
So what do you say?

411
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,394
Should we go to Gangneung?

412
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,353
Okay.

413
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,147
EUNKANG: I'll ask Hanna.

414
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,732
You call the others.

415
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,066
Okay.

416
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,403
(quirky music)

417
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,364
GANGNEUNG LODGING RESERVATIONS

418
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,907
Sorry.

419
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,576
I won't be in Gangneung at that time.

420
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,620
Then when are you free?
We haven't fixed the date yet.

421
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,832
Just plan the trip without me.
I don't think I can make it anyway.

422
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:14,875
Mm...

423
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,546
It's a family situation.

424
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,008
HANNA: Have fun then.
See you back at school.

425
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,718
All right.

426
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,844
Bye.

427
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,263
(phone beeps)

428
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,353
SEVEN STAR, KARAOKE BAR SHASHA

429
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,646
(sighs)

430
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,570
EUNKANG: Too bad she can't make it.
But let's have a good time anyway.

431
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,905
Oh, I see.

432
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,951
No. There's nothing we can do about it.
All right, then.

433
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,120
Are you going to Seoul Station
to take the train?

434
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,247
-Maybe we can go together.
-I already bought tickets.

435
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,333
DAEIL: I'm going earlier
so I can plan the trip.

436
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,250
EUNKANG: I see.

437
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,960
Thanks for all the work.

438
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,004
Next time we go on a trip,
I'll be the planner.

439
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,964
Then I'll see you at Gangneung Station.

440
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,216
Sure.

441
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,844
(phone beeps, thuds)

442
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,971
MIKANG: Are you going on a trip?

443
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,181
Yes.

444
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,642
(sighs)

445
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,143
I'm so jealous.

446
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,397
I have to work in this hot summer
while you have fun at the beach.

447
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,190
You're the one
who put yourself in trouble.

448
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,026
-How's the part-time job?
-I'm only making 30,000 won a day.

449
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,487
I'll never be able to
pay off all the debt.

450
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,032
If you want to make more money, work more.

451
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,742
I even got you this job.

452
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,786
If you don't want this job,
get another one.

453
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,079
(clears throat)

454
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,081
So where are you going?

455
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,459
Gangneung. To the East Sea.
Have you been there?

456
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,752
YANGCHUL: I have.

457
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,380
After I was discharged from the army.
I was in my 20s then.

458
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,008
I was traveling there without any money
for two months.

459
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,345
-Really?
-Yes. I walked along the shore.

460
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,097
I just kept walking.

461
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,181
(Yangchul laughing)

462
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,393
When it became dark,
I just walked into any house I saw.

463
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,645
Then they'd give me
a bed and food for free.

464
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,939
Snow crab was in season then.

465
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,401
With a bit of exaggeration,
they cooked this many snow crabs for me.

466
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,318
And I...

467
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,697
Dad. That's because
it was a long time ago.

468
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,824
If you do that now,
you can be in big trouble.

469
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,535
In the worst case, you'd be kidnapped
and taken to a fishing boat.

470
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,121
Or have your organs sold.

471
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,874
You don't know how delicious crabs are.

472
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,878
INMYEON: Finally!

473
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,046
Man, this one is strong.

474
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,340
-INMYEON: Oh, no! Get me a net!
-HANSOL: I have one here.

475
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,843
-Oh, my.
-Wow.

476
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,345
My.
(laughing)

477
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,347
My gosh.

478
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,057
HANSOL: That's a big one.

479
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,726
-(Inmyeon laughing)
-DUKJIN: Oh, come on.

480
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:42,481
DUKJIN: How many is that already?
He gets so lucky whenever he fishes here.

481
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:46,568
I pray to the deity of the pond
day and night.

482
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,111
(laughing)

483
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,990
-How's it going?
-I haven't had any luck,

484
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,911
but I'm enjoying the view here.
I haven't been out like this in a while.

485
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,370
(Inmyeon laughing)

486
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,040
Only the pros know this spot.

487
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,958
(laughing)

488
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,962
Your father, Mr. Jo, is the person
who brought me here.

489
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,089
He really loved fishing.

490
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,132
Right.

491
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,051
Your father...

492
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,720
He's not getting any better, is he?

493
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,516
No. The doctors say I should get ready
for the worst-case scenario,

494
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,270
but I'm not ready to let him go yet.

495
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,398
Of course. You're his only son.

496
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,777
And you were the apple of his eye.

497
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,445
He really adored you.

498
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,614
Please, excuse me.
(sighs)

499
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,116
(tense music)

500
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,409
(clicks tongue)
Gosh.

501
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,873
I know I'll never be as good as my father,

502
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,460
but I'll always treat you
like my own father.

503
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,922
Oh, come on.
You're already like a son to me.

504
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,132
INMYEON: Oh my, thank you.
(laughing)

505
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,551
Right.

506
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,929
I heard our dear Congressman Jang is
having an election soon.

507
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,806
Oh, stop it.

508
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,392
We're in public now.

509
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,977
Come on. It's just us here.

510
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,770
Isn't that right?

511
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,230
Sure.

512
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:10,235
Right. Chief Oh said thank you.

513
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,529
-DUKJIN: He wants to get dinner sometime.
-INMYEON: What do you mean?

514
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,905
His eldest daughter

515
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,700
got a position at one of
Mr. Jo's affiliates, in Public Relations.

516
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,493
Oh, really?

517
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,538
You did him a big favor.
(laughing)

518
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,332
You know, getting a job
is almost impossible these days.

519
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,584
My gosh.

520
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,752
(suspenseful music)

521
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,922
Your daughter
is studying in France, right?

522
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,301
If you need any help,
you can tell me anytime.

523
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,303
Then I'll...

524
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,722
I can take care of my own child,

525
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,015
so don't worry about it.

526
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,144
I'm sorry if I offended you, Commissioner.

527
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,480
(cough, chuckling)

528
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,983
Hey, how about some ramyeon?

529
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,694
INMYEON: I left home early in the morning,
and I'm getting hungry.

530
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,279
DUKJIN: Ramyeon sounds great.

531
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,447
(Inmyeon laughing)

532
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,699
-DUKJIN: Excuse me.
-INMYEON: All right. Let's go.

533
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,367
(Inmyeon laughing)

534
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,082
(music fades)

535
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,960
INMYEON: Hey, Giyong.

536
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,671
Don't be so harsh on Mr. Jo.
He's doing his best.

537
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,299
We arranged this for you today.

538
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,179
From now on, please don't bother.

539
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,390
Just leave him be.

540
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,227
Mr. Jo does owe him big time.

541
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,021
If it weren't for Giyong,

542
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,939
he wouldn't even be in Korea right now.

543
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,776
The shareholders
would've kicked him out of the company.

544
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,611
He wouldn't be where he is now.

545
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,781
By the way, is he still taking drugs?

546
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,782
(laughing)

547
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,408
Of course not.

548
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,203
And that's ten years ago.

549
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,580
Live for the future.

550
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,248
Leave the past in the past.

551
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,125
I'm keeping an eye on him.

552
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,003
You can quit life,

553
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,130
but you can never quit drugs.

554
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,299
(tense music)

555
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:01,012
Well, I guess it doesn't hurt...
(chuckles)

556
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,056
...to have something on him.
(chuckles)

557
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,230
Gosh, I'm so sick of all this babysitting.

558
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,399
(tense music continues)

559
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,234
HANSOL: This is...

560
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,361
all Father's fault.

561
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,530
He spoiled them from the start.

562
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,991
When he was the CEO, all he had was money,

563
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,203
so he had to suck up to them. I get it.
But things have changed now.

564
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,374
Money, fame, power, future. I have it all.

565
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,792
Yes, sir.

566
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,294
So why do I have to...

567
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,090
spoonfeed those geezers?

568
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,345
What are they? Bums?

569
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,180
(ominous music)

570
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,807
They'll see.

571
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:51,020
I'm going to show them who's in charge.

572
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,445
(upbeat music)

573
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,824
(waves crashing)

574
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,204
(upbeat music continues)

575
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,123
BACKPACKING WITH DAEIL TOUR
OFF TO GANGNEUNG!

576
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:14,502
GROUP: ♪ Fly into the blue sky ♪

577
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,256
♪ On the airplane I've always dreamed of ♪

00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:22,051

580
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,932
-Guys!
-ALL: Yes!

581
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,309
What do you think of my playlist?

582
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,393
ALL: We love it!

583
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,478
DAEIL: Are you excited?

584
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,896
ALL: Yes!

585
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,148
Let's go, then!

586
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,317
(group clamoring)

587
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,527
(exclaiming)
It's the sea!

588
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,697
-Awesome!
-ARI: I can't wait to go to the beach.

589
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,324
-Me too.
-Daeil, we're going

590
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,826
-to the beach first, right?
-Guys.

591
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,536
Calm down.

592
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,039
There's a well-planned two-day tour
waiting for you.

593
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,665
So don't worry.

594
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,501
Where are we going now? Let's eat first.

595
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,919
Yes. I'm hungry.

596
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,047
We came all the way to the beach,
so we've got to have some sashimi.

597
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,965
I want to eat snow crabs.
Let's eat snow crabs.

598
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,052
Come on, Gangneung is famous for
soft tofu. Let's go eat soft tofu first.

599
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,054
I heard they had great jjamppong.

600
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,389
I'm okay with anything.
Let's have some coffee after lunch.

601
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,600
There's a famous coffee street here.

602
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,227
I'm so in. I'll have two cups.

603
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,104
Sashimi, snow crabs, soft tofu,
jjamppong, coffee. Let's go!

604
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,856
Let's go!

605
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,150
(upbeat music)

606
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,739
(thudding)

607
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,616
At ease.

608
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,078
(whimsical music)

609
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,246
(inhales)

610
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,624
The place we are at now
is Munseong Shrine at Ojukheon.

611
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:39,170
DAEIL: Munseong Shrine is where
the portrait of Yulgok Yi I is kept.

612
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:43,424
"Munseong" is his posthumous name
given by King Injo in 1624.

613
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,345
So what on earth
does this name "Munseong" mean?

614
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:52,183
It means that Yi I's achievements
were great both morally and academically

615
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:56,646
and that he formed the basis of politics
for the betterment of people's lives.

616
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,190
-That's what it means.
-It's like we're on a school field trip.

617
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,277
I know. But he prepared this for us.
Let's just hear him out.

618
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,237
Ladies and gentlemen.

619
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:09,784
DAEIL: We came all the way here
not just to do some swimming in the ocean.

620
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,120
As intellectuals,

621
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,290
we cannot miss out on the important sites.
Don't you agree?

622
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,083
GROUP: Yes.

623
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:21,296
You must know the past to know the future.

624
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,966
-Well done.
-You prepared a lot for this trip.

625
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,801
-Can we go now?
-Next.

626
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,719
-Next?
-Next?

627
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,596
You see, Ojukheon

628
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,475
is where Shin Saimdang and Yi I were born.

629
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,104
DAEIL: It's also designated
as Treasure Number 165.

630
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,939
Now, one quick question.

631
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,192
Do you know why it's called Ojukheon?

632
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,695
Do you?

633
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,614
Doesn't "juk" mean bamboo?

634
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,198
Wow. You're almost there!

635
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,742
You're very close.

636
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,995
I'll give this prize to the person
who knows the exact answer.

637
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,291
Hey, this is common sense.

638
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,209
Come on. Just say it already.

639
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,711
My legs hurt.

640
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,338
All right. I'll keep this for now.

641
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,006
Here's the answer.

642
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:08,968
There are many dark bamboos in this area.

643
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:12,096
"O" means crows, and "juk" means bamboo.

644
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,891
That's why it's called Ojukheon.

645
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:15,975
DAEIL: Okay?

646
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,393
GROUP: Okay.

647
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,394
DAEIL: Next...

648
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,146
SEUNGHYUN: Next?

649
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,360
We're going to the place
where you can take photos

650
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,779
that look exactly like this.

651
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,238
(in English) Go, go, go!

652
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,407
(whimsical music)

653
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,326
FIVE THOUSAND WON BILL (OLD)

654
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,953
(in Korean) Okay.
We'll start with Wi Seunghyun.

655
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,997
DAEIL: Wi Seunghyun,
not They Seunghyun. Here we go.

656
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,416
-One, two, three.
-(camera shutter clicks)

657
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,293
Good. Next.

658
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,587
All right. Seo Bumju.

659
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,090
All right. One... Smile.

660
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,716
One, two, three.

661
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,759
(phone camera clicks)

662
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,594
Now, the judo hero, Kim Tak.

663
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,888
You always talk back to me
even though I'm older than you.

664
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,474
Now, Woo Juyoung,
would you like to take a nice photo?

665
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,267
One... Wait. You're so small.

666
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,562
Shin Ari. Arirang. Shin Ari.

667
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,814
Next. Ko Eunkang. All right.

668
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,774
Eunkang, not street gang.

669
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,026
One, two, three.

670
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,113
THE BANK OF KOREA
5,000 WON

671
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,741
All right. It's Daeil Tour's lunchtime.

672
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,910
Here. Bumju. Distribute these.

673
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,039
One for Bumju. One for Juyoung.

674
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,542
One for Eunkang. One for Seunghyun.

675
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,835
Ari.

676
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,795
Kim Tak.

677
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,048
All right. Guys.
(sighs)

678
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,302
DAEIL: This isn't ordinary bread.

679
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:37,807
It's jjamppong bread
that you can only have in Gangneung.

680
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,685
Enjoy, and let me know
if you want some more.

681
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,938
(whimpers)
It's gotten lukewarm.

682
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,650
TAK: Since we traveled all the way here,

683
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,736
instead of this bread,

684
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:53,489
how about we go somewhere else
and have something cold, like mulhoe?

685
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:58,161
We're having that for supper later,
so please wait a bit.

686
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,120
Excuse me.

687
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,206
You're not allowed
to have outside food here.

688
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,083
STAFF: Didn't you see
the notice at the entrance?

689
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,501
We won't be here for long.

690
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,128
(chuckles)
No.

691
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,796
Please put the food in your bags.

692
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,382
-DAEIL: We will. Sorry.
-STAFF: Thank you.

693
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,264
All right. Then let's get back in the car

694
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,391
and eat the bread
on our way to the next place.

695
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,019
Hey! When are we going
to our accommodations?

696
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,065
Well, we can visit the historic sites
only during the opening hours,

697
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,358
-so our schedule...
-I didn't come here for that.

698
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,861
Is this the trip you planned?

699
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,614
Walking around in the hot sun
and eating some bread?

700
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,157
Let's just split into two groups.

701
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,826
One for those who want to go
to our accommodations and the other

702
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,286
for those who want to join you.

703
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,412
Hey, Ari.

704
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,624
I bought the prize
and went all the way to the market

705
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,250
to buy this bread.

706
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,752
Sure. Good work.

707
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,379
Happy now? But I'm sorry.

708
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,174
I can't do this stupid tour anymore.

709
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,135
-Wait. Ari.
-Hey.

710
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,012
Hey.

711
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,015
(whimsical music)

712
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,975
(Seunghyun clears throat)

713
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:06,854
(clears throat)

714
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,482
Wait. Do you think so too?

715
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,652
Well, it was kind of hardcore
for a hot day like today.

716
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,446
He's right. It's been four hours
since we got here,

717
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,615
and we haven't even set foot
on the beach yet.

718
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,742
TAK: She's right, Daeil.

719
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,743
(sighs)

720
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,204
Let's wrap it up here.

721
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,914
Let's go to our rooms and get some rest.

722
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,000
-Leave me alone.
-Hey.

723
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,337
-SEUNGHYUN: Where are you going?
-Hey, Daeil.

724
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,840
If you want to go, just go!
No one is stopping you!

725
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,592
Have fun with your historical tour!

726
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,181
(wind howling)

727
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,726
(quirky music)

728
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,481
-(wind howling)
-(scoffs)

729
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,816
You punks.

730
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,569
Fine. Good luck with the tour without me.

731
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,987
(birds chirping)

732
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,904
(sighs)

733
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,573
(vehicle approaching)

734
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,955
(door hisses open)

735
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,591
(quirky music continues)

736
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,558
ARI: Daeil, we're at the beach.
Come join us!

737
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,852
(light music)

738
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,314
-BUMJU: Wait. Slow down.
-(Juyoung exclaiming)

739
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,107
ARI: It's the sea!

740
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,443
EUNKANG: Awesome! This is great.

741
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,029
ARI: Hey, be careful.

742
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,406
(cheering, laughing)

743
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,992
Oh, my gosh! I love this!

744
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,410
Take it easy.

745
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,620
-Gosh.
-Seriously.

746
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,496
Why are you so scared?

747
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,248
Don't talk to me. I might crash.

748
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,750
ARI: This feels great!

749
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,668
Look here!

750
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,338
(both screaming, laughing)

751
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,131
JUYOUNG: Be careful!

752
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,175
ARI: Awesome!

753
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,345
(uplifting music)

754
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,556
Ready or not.

755
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,058
GROUP: Rock paper scissors, shoot!

756
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,184
-ARI: Yes!
-JUYOUNG: Yes!

757
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,143
JUYOUNG: Let's go.

758
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,686
BUMJU: Was it scissors?

759
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,855
(Ari exclaiming)
We're off!

760
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,860
EUNKANG: Green light. Red light.

761
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,782
Green light. Red light.

762
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:24,951
You're out!

763
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,205
Green light. Red light.

764
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,539
Hey!

765
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,460
Green light. Red light.

766
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,378
(Ari yelps)

767
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,463
Green light. Red light.

768
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,006
(group clamoring)

769
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,591
(laughing)

770
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:42,969
(water splashes)

771
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,221
(water splashes)

772
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,976
(indistinct chattering)

773
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,229
-Gosh. That was refreshing.
-ARI: It's great!

774
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,233
(music fades)

775
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:02,905
(sighs)

776
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,116
DAEIL: It's serene here. I like it.

777
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,245
(sighs)

778
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,332
My inbox must be full by now.

779
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,007
DAEIL: You should've been nice to me
when you had the chance.

780
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,719
CHAT

781
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,845
What the...

782
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,638
(quirky music)

783
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,267
Huh? Maybe there's no signal here.

784
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,436
-VISITOR 1: Did you send the photos?
-VISITOR 2: Yes.

785
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,603
(cellphone buzzing)

786
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,230
VISITOR 1: Yes, I can hear you.

787
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,732
Did you see the photos I sent?

788
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,277
Those punks...

789
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,446
(sighs)

790
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,031
Don't you dare call me.

791
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,949
POWER OFF

792
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,411
All right. The next game is
Don't Knock Over the Flag!

793
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,579
-TAK: All right.
-JUYOUNG: Okay.

794
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,165
The first person to make the flag fall
makes dinner today. Okay?

795
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,292
-And the loser washes the dishes too.
-Let's make the loser wash the dishes.

796
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,293
No.

797
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,210
(clears throat)

798
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,504
Let's begin. Ready or not,
rock paper scissors...

799
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,006
SEUNGHYUN: Wait, wait.

800
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,300
You know real men choose rock.

801
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,512
(clears throat)
All right. Here we go.

802
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,724
-Ready or not, rock paper scissors, shoot.
-Rock paper scissors, shoot.

803
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,933
(exclaiming)

804
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,060
JUYOUNG: Oh, well.

805
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,686
-BUMJU (high-pitched voice): Hello.
-TAK: What was that?

806
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,021
-Gosh.
-Let's move on.

807
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,940
-Ready or not, rock paper scissors, shoot.
-Rock paper scissors, shoot.

808
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,650
(in high-pitched voice) Hello.
(chuckling)

809
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,361
(Seunghyun, Bumju
in high-pitched voice) Hello.

810
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,695
-(chuckles)
-JUYOUNG: Let me start.

811
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,654
(Juyoung clears throat)

812
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,575
BUMJU: Wait, wait.

813
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,369
Gosh. That's heavy.

814
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,828
-JUYOUNG: My.
-Hey, what's that?

815
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,955
ARI: Oh, come on!

816
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,123
Hey!

817
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,792
-Nice.
-This feels great.

818
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,169
-JUYOUNG: What...
-(Tak chuckles)

819
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,421
With all the muscles,
you're taking only that?

820
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,631
What about the muscles?

821
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,176
Listen, Tak. When you play this game,
use your little finger like this.

822
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,803
JUYOUNG: What was that? Did you even go?

823
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,807
-JUYOUNG: That's how you play the game.
-BUMJU: This is how you play the game.

824
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,144
-(Ari gasps, exclaiming)
-(Tak exclaiming)

825
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,397
SEUNGHYUN: Oh, no.

826
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,275
Did I make it fall?

827
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,698
Yes, it was you. You made it fall.

828
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,992
-I think you're right. You made it fall.
-Then...

829
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,121
you go buy groceries.
We'll be playing here.

830
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,247
(chuckles)

831
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,874
Okay. We'll go. Man.

832
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,126
How meddlesome.

833
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,837
BUMJU: Don't buy anything weird.

834
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,213
Do you have money?

835
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,424
-Yes. Text me if you need anything.
-Okay.

836
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,468
-Don't forget the chips and ice cream.
-Okay.

837
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,973
Why did you make it so obvious
in front of them all?

838
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,600
Because we didn't have
any chance to be alone.

839
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,353
Gosh. We're here
for just a couple of days.

840
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,106
So you don't like this? Should I go?

841
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,275
No.
(chuckles)

842
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:48,487
You should be careful, though.
I think Tak knows what's going on.

843
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,613
Okay.

844
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,031
(phone buzzing)

845
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,409
-(cart wheels creaking)
-(phone buzzing)

846
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,368
Hold on.

847
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,872
Hey. I was just wondering
if you arrived safely.

848
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,416
What?

849
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,210
-What did you do?
-SEUNGHYUN: We rode motorbikes.

850
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,546
My. I didn't know
my baby could ride something like that.

851
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,089
I just followed the others.

852
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,425
Mom, I'm at the supermarket.

853
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,593
SEUNGHYUN: Let's talk later.

854
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,262
Gosh. You don't even know how to cook.

855
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,222
You can barely cook ramyeon.

856
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,017
SEUNGHYUN: Mom, I'm with a friend now.

857
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,101
A friend?

858
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,769
Which friend?

859
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,190
Is it your female classmate
you talked about earlier?

860
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,941
SOOKJA: Is she pretty?

861
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,444
Yes.

862
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,155
No, you're not talking to her. Later.

863
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,284
-Mom, I've got to go. Sorry.
-SOOKJA: Hey, wait. Seunghyun...

864
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,744
(phone beeps)

865
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,456
Geez, this kid...

866
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,168
Am I nothing
now that you have a girlfriend?

867
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,922
This is why they say
boys are such ingrates.

868
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,049
How dare you, after all,
I've done for you?

869
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,885
That's so mean of him.

870
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,137
SEUNGHYUN:
Maybe she's bored alone at home.

871
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,473
My dad is working late these days.

872
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,350
(clears throat)

873
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,520
By the way,
There's something I wanted to ask.

874
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,440
When we went to CEO Jo's office,

875
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:11,195
he said he would like you
to give his regards to Commissioner Wi.

876
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,822
Is Commissioner Wi...

877
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,908
(indistinct chattering)

878
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,368
(gasping, exclaiming)

879
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,245
He is!

880
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,998
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Well, I just...

881
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,041
(sucks teeth)

882
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,417
...couldn't find the right time.

883
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,045
I didn't know you were from a rich family.

884
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,549
We're not buying pork.

885
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,801
How about Korean beef?
Should we get some rib eye?

886
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,302
-Stop teasing me.
-(laughing)

887
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,639
What? I'm actually jealous of you.

888
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:43,435
-You should never challenge your father.
-(sighs)

889
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,814
And you should tell him to keep his post.

890
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,150
Even if he doesn't do anything
to help you, you must feel so safe

891
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,860
to have a father like him.

892
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,612
I'm so jealous.

893
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,910
Honey, have you eaten yet?
I just got done.

894
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,370
When are you done, honey?

895
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,581
GIRL: Okay.

896
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:07,084
Kids these days are all
"honey" this and "honey" that.

897
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,045
Gosh, aren't they so funny?

898
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,590
What's wrong with that?
I think it's all right.

899
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,258
Honey.

900
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,970
Gosh. What are you doing?

901
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,973
-What's wrong, Honey?
-Oh, stop it!

902
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,142
-Wait up, Honey.
-Gosh, I hate it.

903
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,185
-Honey, wait for me.
-Gross.

904
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,938
(waves splashing)

905
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,402
(waves crashing)

906
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,779
ARI: Where did you get that scar?

907
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,240
(clicks tongue)
Ahh...

908
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,200
I got it from exercising.

909
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,202
That can't be right.

910
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,997
While exercising,

911
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,792
I got into a fight with my seniors.

912
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,795
(wave splashes)

913
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,464
It wasn't really a fight, though.

914
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,091
(breathes deeply)
I just got a beating.

915
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,261
-Why?
-Because I didn't listen to them.

916
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,141
KIM TAK

917
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:07,019
Woojin will use a throw on you.
So hold out for a while, then let him.

918
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,736
-(crowd clamoring)
-TAK: The high school seniors

919
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,073
who want to study physical education
in college

920
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,367
often ask other students to let them win.

921
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,660
2014 NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL
JUDO CHAMPIONSHIP

922
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,788
-Directors and coaches let them do it too.
-Begin!

923
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:26,747
LEE WOOJIN

924
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,831
TAK: But...

925
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,083
You heard from Coach, right?

926
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,834
TAK: I just couldn't do it.

927
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,546
Do you know why I played judo?

928
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,799
-You little bastard.
-TAK: Because on the judo mat,

929
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,676
everyone is equal.

930
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,887
-TAK: Whether you're young or old,
-Dude, relax.

931
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,681
-have parents or not,
-You bastard.

932
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,391
-or have money or not,
-I said, relax.

933
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,017
Here I go.

934
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:51,355
TAK: your skills are solely what counts.

935
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,816
(people cheering)

936
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,610
So...

937
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,320
I beat him.

938
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,031
(grunts)

939
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,032
Ippon!

940
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,617
(groans)

941
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,994
(crowd clamoring)

942
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,665
(somber music)

943
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,254
WOOJIN: What the heck was that?

944
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,843
Hey. Is that how you treat your seniors?

945
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,261
On the mat,

946
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,638
it should be fair.

947
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,182
What's the point of going to college

948
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,019
-by a fixed match?
-This jerk must have lost his mind.

949
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,022
(grunts, groans)

950
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,274
WOOJIN: God damn it.

951
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,234
Do you want to die?

952
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,361
-Do you have a death wish?
-You jerk.

953
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,405
(grunting)

954
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:45,409
You bastard.
How dare you speak to me like that? Die.

955
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,537
(Tak groans)

956
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,457
WOOJIN (laughs): Look at this idiot.

957
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,292
Let go.

958
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,377
(somber music)

959
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,796
(groans)

960
00:45:58,881 --> 00:45:59,715
Let go.

961
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:00,883
Let go, you bastard!

962
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,009
Geez. Damn it.

963
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,927
-(screams)
-(grunts, coughs)

964
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,930
WOOJIN: Out of the way!

965
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,767
(breathes heavily)

966
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,394
-(thuds)
-(Tak grunts)

967
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,566
-(Woojin grunts)
-(Tak screams)

968
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:20,819
(clanks)

969
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,823
-WOOJIN: What's with him?
-(groaning)

970
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,575
What's going on?

971
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,162
TAK: So, that's what happened.

972
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,664
Is that why you stopped playing judo?

973
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,501
I couldn't play even if I wanted to.

974
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,753
(somber music continues)

975
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,507
ARI: It must have been really painful.

976
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,301
TAK (scoffs):
It's okay. It doesn't hurt anymore.

977
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,683
(emotive music)

978
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,019
Are you crying? Why are you crying?

979
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,813
(sobbing)

980
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:59,149
Because it's so upsetting.

981
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,486
I cry when I'm upset.

982
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,404
ARI: Those bastards.

983
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,407
I won't let them get away with it.
(sobs)

984
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,409
(emotive music continues)

985
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,413
Other than my grandma,
you're the only person who takes my side.

986
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,249
I feel safe now.

987
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,501
You have to be a cop.

988
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,671
Let's both be cops and put an end

989
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,881
to all the corruption
in the sports industry.

990
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,883
Okay. Let's do that.

991
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,928
JUYOUNG: Hey.
What are you doing over there?

992
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,347
Hey. Did you have fun?

993
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,516
I feel sick. The waves are too much.

994
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,017
JUYOUNG: Oh, boy. I'm tired.
(grunts)

995
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:34,935
(groans)

996
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:36,770
(sighs)

997
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,565
Hey. Did you guys hear from Daeil yet?

998
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,108
No. Did you text him?

999
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,277
Yes. He must be really upset.

1000
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,488
Leave him be so he can visit
all the places he wanted to go.

1001
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,073
He knows where we stay.

1002
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,409
What on earth is he doing?

1003
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,496
(engine humming)

1004
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,626
(clattering)

1005
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,424
(whimsical music)

1006
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,302
Where am I?

1007
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,140
(whimsical music continues)

1008
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,352
(sighs)
Damn. I missed the bus stop.

1009
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,608
(door hisses open)

1010
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,403
(yawning)

1011
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,572
(door hisses close)

1012
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,161
(engine revving)

1013
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,123
(exhales sharply)

1014
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,169
Hey! I'm not taking it.

1015
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,795
I just want to borrow it!

1016
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:47,299
I've been saving that money
since middle school to go to college,

1017
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,177
not to finance
your stupid boyfriend's business.

1018
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,638
You don't pay any tuition anyway. Give it.

1019
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,514
No, I'm going to get my own place with it.

1020
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,434
I have to live in this bar
because you lost the apartment.

1021
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,771
I can't even meet my friends in
my hometown because it's so embarrassing!

1022
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,397
This is so annoying.

1023
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,524
It's not even that much.
It's only 20 million.

1024
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,610
SASHA: You know what?
If you think it's so unfair,

1025
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,987
think of it as parenting costs
for raising you.

1026
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,238
Are you even my own mother?

1027
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,950
What kind of trashy mother are you?

1028
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,869
How insolent.

1029
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,174
(vehicle honking)

1030
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,641
Hanna!

1031
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,227
(wave splashes)

1032
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,565
-(sipping)
-(Hanna sighs)

1033
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,192
(Hanna clicks tongue)

1034
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,569
Why do you always have to show up
when I'm like that?

1035
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,071
(light music playing)

1036
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,197
Beats me.

1037
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:53,824
(breathes deeply)

1038
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,158
I wonder why.

1039
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,327
-Maybe it was fate.
-Don't joke with me.

1040
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,914
I'm not joking.
I'm being completely serious.

1041
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,416
I was really surprised.

1042
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,292
DAEIL: Think about it.

1043
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:08,005
What are the chances
that I run into you there like that?

1044
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,968
I mean, I split up with the others
to go off on my own,

1045
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,928
got lost after getting off
at the wrong bus stop,

1046
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,724
and then suddenly found you

1047
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,350
across the street.

1048
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,771
And you happened to be
having a big fight with your mom.

1049
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,357
What are the chances
of all that happening today?

1050
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,068
Maybe...

1051
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,239
everything that happened today

1052
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,324
was some sort of fate.

1053
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,410
(light music playing)

1054
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,830
Okay. Let's say you're right.

1055
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,458
Anyway, you saw all that
and know my shortfalls now.

1056
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,335
-What now?
-"Shortfall"?

1057
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,299
It's a shortfall
only when you want to hide it.

1058
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,010
DAEIL: When you're open about it,
it's not a shortfall anymore.

1059
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,262
Have you always
been thinking that until now?

1060
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,889
-No, I haven't.
-Really?

1061
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:05,187
Anyway, everyone has a secret
that they don't like to share.

1062
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,440
DAEIL: But even if someone finds it out,
it's not the end of the world.

1063
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,983
Actually,

1064
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,820
people are not that interested in you.

1065
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,489
(Daeil snickers)

1066
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,701
Although some might be,
because you're pretty.

1067
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,955
(chuckled)

1068
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,000
To be honest,

1069
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,961
when I first entered this school,

1070
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,756
I checked out all the girls,
and I thought you were the prettiest.

1071
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,175
(reflective music)

1072
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,885
(whistle blowing)

1073
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,519
(reflective music continues)

1074
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,192
DAEIL: You probably don't remember it,

1075
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,529
but there were so many times
I tried to talk to you.

1076
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,115
-Hey.
-DAEIL: But... Man,

1077
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,825
I couldn't because you looked so cold.

1078
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,451
-Mija is prettier than Misook.
-No, it's Misook.

1079
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:05,497
DAEIL: I wondered why you would never
smile and were on edge all the time.

1080
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,458
But I think I know why now...

1081
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,629
after seeing your mother.

1082
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,717
You're supposed to feel warm
when you think about your mom.

1083
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,303
SASHA: Oh, no. Be careful.
I'll see you the day after tomorrow!

1084
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,888
-Good night.
-It's a promise!

1085
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,058
-FEMALE STUDENT: Don't you smell alcohol?
-That's gross.

1086
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,561
-CREDITOR 1: Where's your mom?
-CREDITOR 2: Where is she?

1087
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,812
-What are you all doing?
-Hey!

1088
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,438
DAEIL: It must have been hard for you.

1089
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,442
-That's why you were on edge all the time.
-Stop it.

1090
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,321
(reflective music)

1091
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,826
(waves crashing)

1092
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,168
It's because you're too nice.

1093
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,879
DAEIL: You're too nice
to cut her out of your life.

1094
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,422
(sniffles)

1095
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,507
And you try to deal with it all alone.

1096
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,218
That's why it's hard.

1097
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,222
(sighs)

1098
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,059
(somber music)

1099
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,770
(sizzling)

1100
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,905
(crockery clanging)

1101
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,661
OPERATOR: The person you have reached
is unavailable. Leave a message...

1102
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:27,954
(cellphone beeps)

1103
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,248
Is he not answering?

1104
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,752
I guess he didn't check his texts.
I told him to come before dinner.

1105
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,420
Maybe he went home.

1106
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,963
No way.

1107
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,715
EUNKANG: Hey, move.

1108
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,551
-Oh, put it here.
-I put my heart and soul into this.

1109
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,719
(mutters)

1110
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,805
-EUNKANG: Try it.
-ARI: It looks amazing.

1111
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,974
BUMJU: Do you need any help?

1112
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,809
(waves crashing)

1113
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,271
(exhales)

1114
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,565
-How is it?
-It tastes like MSG.

1115
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,650
Right?

1116
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,443
DAEIL: Are you eating without me?

1117
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,279
-What...
-Hey, Daeil!

1118
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,822
JUYOUNG: Yoo Daeil, you...

1119
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:04,950
Daeil.

1120
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,911
-JUYOUNG: Where were you?
-What happened? Where did you go?

1121
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,746
Come on. It's heavy.

1122
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,707
Why didn't you answer your phone?

1123
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,834
Hey, you came.

1124
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,337
EUNKANG: Gosh.

1125
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,426
-Hanna?
-JUYOUNG: Huh?

1126
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,679
-What?
-You said you couldn't make it.

1127
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,974
-JUYOUNG: When did you come to Gangneung?
-BUMJU: Did you run into each other here?

1128
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,558
ARI: Come on. Let's eat.

1129
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,310
-Okay. Let's eat.
-Let's go eat first.

1130
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,270
Yes. Let's go.

1131
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,147
-GROUP: Cheers!
-(glass clinks)

1132
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,026
(exhales)

1133
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,070
Tell me, guys.

1134
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,864
-What did you do without me?
-Lots of things.

1135
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,866
-Did you have fun?
-Do you want my honest answer?

1136
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,076
No, don't answer it.

1137
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,537
-I can tell from your face.
-Sorry, man.

1138
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,540
All right. Tell me all the complaints
you had about me today,

1139
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,500
so you don't have to hold grudges.

1140
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,087
EUNKANG: We don't have any. We know
how hard you worked to plan all this.

1141
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,547
Are you sure?

1142
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,340
-Ari?
-Well...

1143
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:06,136
I might have been a little harsh
on you earlier.

1144
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,429
ARI: I'm sorry.

1145
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,724
But don't plan our trips from now on.

1146
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,642
You're really boring.

1147
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,436
Okay. Got it.

1148
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,522
-Anything else?
-Hey. Don't turn off your phone.

1149
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:20,650
-You're not a kid.
-Did you even worry about me?

1150
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,527
You didn't even call me once.

1151
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:27,115
Seunghyun and Bumju
called me three times, though.

1152
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,872
Okay. My loyal friend,
Seunghyun, go ahead.

1153
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,542
Dude, I know you were upset,
but you took all the money with you.

1154
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,712
-What?
-You should have left the money.

1155
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,715
I bought the groceries.

1156
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,592
Send me the money later.

1157
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,011
(laughs)

1158
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,347
Why did you buy so much?

1159
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,265
DAEIL: Gosh. I hate you guys.

1160
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,100
All right. Let's drink.

1161
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,065
But I'd like to say thank you.

1162
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,445
Thank you... for everything.

1163
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,866
(uplifting music)

1164
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,082
Did something happen between you two?

1165
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,291
JUYOUNG: Right?

1166
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,085
Are you two dating?

1167
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,588
You got us.

1168
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,090
-JUYOUNG: What?
-What?

1169
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,134
-Really?
-Hanna, but why?

1170
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,928
-ARI: No.
-JUYOUNG: You're kidding, right?

1171
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,888
-ARI: Hanna, why?
-Is he for real?

1172
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,142
Just kidding!

1173
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,977
-Hey!
-Gosh.

1174
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,521
-Man!
-Okay. We are dating.

1175
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:40,939
-Gosh.
-Hanna.

1176
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:43,358
-ARI: Hanna, let's drink.
-EUNKANG: Let's clink our glasses.

1177
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,818
-BUMJU: Cheers.
-Okay.

1178
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,945
-SEUNGHYUN: You have some too.
-BUMJU: Okay.

1179
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,740
EUNKANG: I don't know
what happened between the two,

1180
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:55,453
but I have never seen her
looking so comfortable.

1181
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,455
JUYOUNG: I know
you're going to eat it all.

1182
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,249
BUMJU: I don't think we have enough food.

You know what? after you guys left,
I went to Seongyojang House.

DAEIL: Seongyojang House was...
