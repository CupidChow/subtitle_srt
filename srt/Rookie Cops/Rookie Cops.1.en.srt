you want to be when you were a kid?

58
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:46,608
I've always wanted to become
a police officer

59
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:49,568
who serves the country
and the people since I was little.

60
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:51,738
I was always told
to become a police officer

61
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:52,898
since I always fought against injustice.

62

my only dream.

Have you wanted to become
a police officer since you were little?

66
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:09,668
No.

67
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:13,378
There were so many things I wanted to be.

Eunkang, guess who's here.

You know, the top student of Yangmun High
who got into KNPU this year.

Jang Juchan.

106
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,868
He said he had two months
before the semester starts,

107
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:03,988
so I asked him for private lessons.

108
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,868

As of today, my dream is...

124
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:15,898
I decided to become a police officer.
(chuckles)

125

(blows air)

FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Ms. Ko.

129
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:35,668
-Yes?
-So who is that person?

130
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:38,088
You said you applied for this school
because of a certain person.

131
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,588
That person is...

132
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,758
Professor Cha Yugon.

133
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:45,338
(quirky music)

134
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:48,468
That's right. After seeing him on

135
00:07:48,558 --> 00:07:50,638
the high-quality crime documentary,
Unsolved Mysteries,

136
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:52,138
I thought to myself,

137
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:56,148
"I want to be a warm-hearted
and cool-headed cop like him."

138
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:57,568
So...

139
00:07:58,148 --> 00:07:59,608
I read his book too.

140
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,528
(chuckles, exhales)

141
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,448
After reading this book,

142
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:05,818
I wanted to become his student
more desperately.

143
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:09,618
Please give me a chance to learn
from my role model, Professor Cha.

144
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,368
I'll be a great police officer!

145
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:14,498
(chuckles)

146
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,168
You're flattering me.

147
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,128
(Yugon breathes deeply)

148
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,458

(chuckles)
EUNKANG: What's the problem?

151
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,888
The interview accounts
for five percent of the entire score.

152
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:28,678
Of course, I had to suck up to him.

153
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,928
Anyway, he loved it.

154
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:34,348
You should have complimented
all the professors evenly.

155
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:36,188
There were other professors too.

156
00:08:36,268 --> 00:08:38,108
The rest must have taken away
all the points you earned from him.

157
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:40,978
No. As they say, "If you run
after two hares, you will catch neither."

158
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:42,898
It's better to focus on one hare.

159
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,908
You don't understand.
It was all strategically planned.

160
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:50,328
All right. Well done.
Are you coming straight home?

161
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:52,408
Why? Are you going
to make me something good?

162
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,248
-Yes.
-All right.

163
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:55,288
Bye.

00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,018
-FRIEND 1: How was the interview?
-It was all right.

169
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,988
-Why do you ask? Where are you?
-(phone camera clicks)

170
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:27,408
Okay.

171
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,448
ALL: Cheers.

172
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,078
(indistinct chatter)

173
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:35,038
FRIEND 1: Gosh,
this place reminds me of last year.

174
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:36,078
It was around this time.

175
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,788
-FRIEND 1: I was so distressed then.
-FRIEND 2: Why?

176
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,418
My mom's fortune teller said
I wouldn't get into college.

177
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:43,208
Is that why you had the talisman
in your underwear on CSAT day?

178
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,798
You're so superstitious.

179
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:47,468
Dude. It was very expensive.
And it actually got me into the school.

180
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:50,548
-You want to see it? I still have it.
-SEUNGHYUN: Gross, man.

181
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:51,468
(friend 1 laughs)

182
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:54,138
Come on, guys.
He's definitely going to get in.

183
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:57,808
Drink this all at once.
Then you'll get in.

184
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,848
(scoffs)
That's nonsense.

185
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:01,268
(both laugh)

186
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:03,438
-FRIEND 4: What? Are you crazy?
-FRIEND 2: What's wrong?

187
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:04,858
He canceled the savings account.

188
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,188
He took out the money
from the savings for our backpacking trip.

189
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:08,148
ALL: What?

190
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:10,868
I just took mine out.
I'll join the next one.

191
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:12,318
-Why?
-What is it?

192
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,198
He needed the money
to get his girlfriend a designer bag.

193
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:17,198
-FRIEND 1: Designer bag? You're crazy.
-FRIEND 3: What...

194
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:19,118
-FRIEND 2: You're blinded by love.
-FRIEND 3: Damn it.

195
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,538
-I'm sorry. The drinks are on me.
-No. Call your girlfriend.

196
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:24,958
-Why?
-FRIEND 1: You got her an expensive bag,

197
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:28,008
so she's got to at least
pay for the drinks.

198
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,178
He's right. Call her.
And Seunghyun hasn't met her.

199
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:32,928
She should come over
and say hi to him too.

200
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:33,928
MINYONG: But...

201
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,098
(munching)
I'm not interested in others' girlfriends.

202
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,808
-FRIEND 4: Gosh, bit still...
-FRIEND 1: There he goes again.

203
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,638
-FRIEND 2: Unbelievable.
-SEUNGHYUN: However,

204
00:10:39,768 --> 00:10:42,058
I'd love to see
who ruined our brotherhood.

205
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:43,858
Well, she's really busy lately.

206
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:45,518
-FRIEND 4: Come on. Call her.
-FRIEND 1: Geez.

207
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:46,978
-FRIEND 1: We know she's pretty. Call her.
-FRIEND 2: Come on.

208
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:49,608
-Is she pretty?
-FRIEND 2: Is she pretty? Let me see.

209
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:51,568
SEUNGHYUN: How old is she?

210
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:53,068
(suspenseful music)

211
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:55,028
-FRIEND 1: Don't hide it. Let me see.
-SEUNGHYUN: How old is she?

212
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:56,658
-(laughing)
-FRIEND 4: Is it her? Let me see.

213
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:58,368
FRIEND 4: You're right.

214
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:02,708
My. She does look really busy.

215
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,748
(emotional music)

216
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:12,798
There?

217
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,548
SEUNGHYUN: That...

218
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:18,348
(stammering)
Isn't that...

219
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:25,978
(emotive music continues)

220
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:38,578
EUNKANG: Gosh. I knew it.
This is why you hurried me.

221
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:39,948
Yes, coming!

222
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:42,788
What am I supposed to do?
The part-timer didn't show up.

223
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,078
Still, you would make me,
a high school senior, go on a delivery?

224
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:48,668
Mom, I'm taking the CSAT soon.
Every second is precious to me.

225
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:51,338
You should be more nervous.
What if I don't get accepted?

226
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:54,258
I am nervous. I really am.
Come on. You'll get accepted. Don't worry.

227
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,468
-But...
-Come on. Go. Hurry.

228
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:57,388
-Gosh!
-Hurry up!

229
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:00,138
-Excuse me. One beer, please.
-All right!

230
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:04,768
Why do you always make me work
when Mikang is just idling?

231
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:06,358
(grumbles)

232
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,688
HEESOOK: Gosh.
You think being a high school senior

233
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,488
is such a big deal, don't you?

234
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:12,778
(elevator chimes open)

235
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:15,158
It was fun, wasn't it?

236
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,988
-I'm hungry. Let's grab something to eat.
-MIKANG: Okay.

237
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,448
(thrilling music)

238
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:35,338
(doorbell chimes)

239
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:37,468
(thrilling music continues)

240
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:43,178
(door lock clicks open)

241
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:45,638
(chuckles)
How much is it?

242
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:47,018
Hello.

243
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:50,858
(chuckles)
I thought it was pizza delivery.

244
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,898
We're looking for a person.

245
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,318
(chuckles)
I see.

246
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:58,068
-Weird.
-Wait.

247
00:12:58,158 --> 00:12:59,238
Wait. One second!

248
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:00,698
MIKANG: Honey, what's up?

249
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:02,868
MAN: There are some crazy guys outside.
One second.

250
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:06,168
What the...

251
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:10,418
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

252
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,338
Get off me!

253
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,298
Mikang!

254
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,008
(scoffs)

255
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:21,098
(emotive music)

256
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:23,638
(sighs)

257
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,348
(thuds)

258
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,598
What is it?

259
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:36,278
Let go!

260
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,988
-We broke up last week.
-I thought you were just kidding.

261
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:42,278
MINYONG: How could you...
It's only been a week.

262
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:45,908
Mikang. Don't tell me
you were two-timing me.

263
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:47,328
(Mikang stammers)
What?

264
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:50,208
(exhales)
Let's talk later.

265
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:53,748
No. You should apologize now
if you were actually two-timing him.

266
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:56,088
Move. It's none of your business.

267
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,218
I can't until you apologize.

268
00:13:58,298 --> 00:14:00,758
-Then I'll call the police.
-What?

269
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:04,178
Because I'm feeling threatened right now.

270
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:05,098
(scoffs)

271
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,688
You seem to be
relying on the public authority.

272
00:14:07,768 --> 00:14:10,478
But that's for good moral people
who have a conscience.

273
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,228
Not for a shameless person like you.
That would be wasting taxes.

274
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:14,608
So don't abuse it.

275
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,148
MINYONG: Hey, stop it.

276
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:17,898
Stop what? You idiot.

277
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:20,608
She was just taking advantage of you.

278
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:22,908
That gold digger
was just playing with you.

279
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,578
-(crowd murmurs)
-SEUNGHYUN: Get a hold of yourself!

280
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:25,868
-WOMAN: What's going on?
-Hey!

281
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,658
MIKANG: Eunkang.

282
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:29,828
What did you just say?

283
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:33,338
-What did you just call my sister?
-A gold digger.

284
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:35,668
(snickers)
How rude of you!

285
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:37,508
What else should I call her?

286
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:41,088
She broke up with my friend three days
after receiving a five million won bag.

287
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:44,098
And she was two-timing him too.
My friend isn't a sucker.

288
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:46,058
You're free to move on
but have some manners.

289
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:49,688
If you were going to break up with him,
why did you accept the present? So cheap.

290
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,688
It was a birthday present...

291
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,978
EUNKANG: Gosh. So you did accept it.

292
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,068
(crowd murmuring)

293
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:58,068
Well, she accepted it
because he gave it to her.

294
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:01,908
It was for his sake.
It would have been rude to refuse it.

295
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:04,068
(gasps, clears throat)

296
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,158
Tell me.
Did she ever ask you to buy her this?

297
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:09,458
No.

298
00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:11,168
Not at all.

299
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:14,208
I swear. I bought it
because I wanted to. I mean it.

300
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,128
You heard him. Looks like he was
just trying too hard to impress her,

301
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,708
which she never asked for.

302
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:22,838
If you don't know what happened,
don't go accusing an innocent person.

303
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:24,508
My sister isn't a pushover.

304
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:28,468
Mikang, give him back
everything you got from him.

305
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:30,268
This is so lame.

306
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:31,558
No, no.

307
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,308
That would make me feel bad.
You don't need to do that.

308
00:15:34,398 --> 00:15:35,228
Hey.

309
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:38,068
She'll send every single thing
you gave her,

310
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:39,608
so don't ever contact her again.

311
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,318
Don't even be around our house.
If we ever see you around,

312
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:43,908
we'll report you to the police.

313
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:45,068
As if he wants to.

314
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:47,368
My friend will never want to see
your sister again either.

315
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,408
EUNKANG: Great. I guess we won't have
to see each other again then.

316
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:52,538
Well, bye then. Let's go.

317
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,618
Hurry up.

318
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,208
(crowd murmuring)

319
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:58,248
MAN: Where are you going?

320
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:02,928
(scoffs)
Were you two-timing me?

321
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:06,428
No.

322
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,428
-I told you already--
-Yes, you were!

323
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:11,228
Gosh. Why do you have to yell at me?

324
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:12,228
Follow me.

325
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:13,308
(crowd murmuring)

326
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:14,938
-EUNKANG: Wait.
-MIKANG: Let go of me.

327
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:16,058
EUNKANG: Excuse me.

328
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:18,768
Geez. What's your problem?

329
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:19,858
-Who are you?
-(groans)

330
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,438
MAN: Answer me. What do you want?

331
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:23,898
(Eunkang shrieks)

332
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:25,948
-(man grunts)
-(crowd exclaiming)

333
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:28,578
There's no need to use violence.

334
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:31,828
-You don't like this either, do you?
-Hey! Let go of me.

335
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:33,788
Let her go first. Then I'll let you go.

336
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,168
(tense music)

337
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,918
MAN: You know this woman is a two-timer.

338
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,208
I do, but that doesn't mean
I'm okay with your violence.

339
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:43,468
Because this is wrong.

340
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:45,128
Pulling one's hand is violence too.

341
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:48,298
What? Violence? You little...

342
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,308
MAN: Violence? Why you...
Do you have more to say?

343
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:52,978
This is just unbelievable. Hey.

344
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:54,938
-MINYONG: Let go and we'll talk it out.
-EUNKANG: Come on!

345
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:56,188
MINYONG: Please let go of him.

346
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:57,898
Let go already, will you?

347
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:00,768
-Hey. You...
-"Hey"? Did you say "Hey"?

348
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:07,028
(comical music)

349
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:14,958
(door closes)

350
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,578
You're such a disgrace to our family.

351
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,838
I wasn't two-timing him.

352
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:24,588
I'm not that kind of person.

353
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:28,588
You could have waited a bit
before seeing another guy.

354
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,638
How could you start a new relationship
only after one week?

355
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:31,758
You're such a sleaze.

356
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:36,188
-Sit.
-Just say it.

357
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:37,268
Sit down.

358
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,188
(sighs)

359
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:43,358
When two people click,

360
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,818
they can be best friends
and even lovers in a single day.

361
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:50,278
Love is about depth, not length.

362
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:52,828
So love while you can.

363
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:54,828
You only live once.
You don't want regrets later.

364
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,828
You drive me nuts.

365
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:57,918
EUNKANG: Geez.

366
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,878
Anyway, give him back
everything you got from him. Okay?

367
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:06,418
Answer me.

368
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:09,088
I'm not the only one who got presents.

369
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:11,598
I gave him a designer wallet
on his birthday too.

370
00:18:11,678 --> 00:18:15,268
-We gave presents to each other.
-The prices are different.

371
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:17,228
Have a conscience, will you?

372
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:21,898
Where's my answer?

373
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:25,818
-Fine.
-You have to send them back. Okay?

374
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:26,938
I'm going to check later.

375
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,818
Where did you even get the money
to buy a wallet...

376
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,408
(thrilling music)

377
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:33,578
(inhales)

378
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:40,828
You... No, you didn't.
(chuckles)

379
00:18:41,748 --> 00:18:43,958
(dramatic music)

380
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:47,168
(Eunkang screaming)
Hey!

381
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:49,468
-Hey!
-What?

382
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:50,548
Hey!

383
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:53,098
Come here!

384
00:18:53,178 --> 00:18:54,508
Calm down, Eunkang.

385
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:57,468
Please, Eunkang. Calm down.

386
00:18:57,558 --> 00:18:59,348
"Calm down", my foot!

387
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:00,688
Calm down!

388
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:02,558
How could you! You're just...

389
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:04,058
-Hey!
-It's me, your sister.

390
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:06,188
-You're so dead!
-Come on. Calm down.

391
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,398
-Calm down!
-Give me my money back!

392
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:10,528
-Damn it!
-Just calm down!

393
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,738
(slow quirky music)

394
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,618
(inaudible)

395
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,878
(slow quirky music continues)

396
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:33,298
(sighs)

397
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:36,468
Come on. Say sorry to Mikang.

398
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:39,768
It's her fault.

399
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:41,438
She took my money.

400
00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:43,978
I get it! But still,

401
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:47,358
how could you
beat up your own sister like this?

402
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:49,898
Does money matter more than your family?

403
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:53,068
We have really got to do
something about her temper.

404
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,368
We've been nice to you
so you can focus on your study.

405
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:57,328
(chomping)
And this is how you repay us?

406
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:59,538
Come on. Say sorry to Mikang.

407
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:02,458
-Why am I the only one being scolded?
-Who else should I scold then?

408
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:05,168
Why do I have to say sorry
when she's the one at fault?

409
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:06,998
You always take her side
because she's sick.

410
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,758
I'm not that strong either.
(sobbing)

411
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:13,468
And you always make me go on deliveries.
(whimpers)

412
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:15,048
-(sniffles)
-YANGCHUL: Ko Eunkang!

413
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:16,388
(utensils clang)

414
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:18,388
(chomping)
Stop yapping.

415
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:22,518
How dare you talk back like that?
Have some respect for your mom!

416
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,478
-(sighs)
-Gosh. What is wrong with her?

417
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,108
What do you think you are, a fighter?

418
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:31,488
Geez.

419
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:33,738
(chomping)

420
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:36,948
YANGCHUL: Oh, my. How scary. Geez.

421
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,078
HEESOOK: Ko Eunkang!

422
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,368
There's nothing wrong with me.

423
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,498
I'm the sweetest
if no one gets under my skin.

424
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:46,208
It's amazing that
I grew to be such a positive person

425
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,578
in such a horrible environment.

426
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:50,798
As soon as I get into college,
I'm going to move out of that house.

427
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:53,508
And I won't even look back.

428
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:56,128
-Goodness.
-What are you mumbling about?

429
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:58,468
Hey.

430
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:00,388
(chuckles)

431
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,348
EUNKANG: Have you been staying
in the dorm?

432
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,888
I haven't seen you in a while.

433
00:21:04,978 --> 00:21:07,518
JUCHAN: I was training
in a patrol division after the mid-terms.

434
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:10,818
Right. How did the interview go?

435
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:14,068
They asked me the exact questions
you shared with me.

436
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:17,778
And the book helped a lot too.
Professor Cha's book.

437
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,828
He was one of my interviewers.

438
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,328
JUCHAN: Really? You were so lucky.

439
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,748
EUNKANG: I'll treat you to dinner
if I get accepted.

440
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:27,118
JUCHAN: No way. The dinner is on me.
Your job is to get in.

441
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,038
(Eunkang chuckles)

442
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,958
You're really odd.

443
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:34,008
I thought it was a joke when you said
you wanted to come to my school.

444
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:37,178
It was so bold of you
because your grades weren't good enough.

445
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:41,218
It was only my math grades that were bad.
The rest were fine.

446
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:42,308
Even my math...

447
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:45,638
Anyway, I'm sure I'm the one
who made the biggest improvement last year

448
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:46,888
in the entire school.

449
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:49,148
EUNKANG: My teacher said it was a miracle.

450
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:51,438
You have no idea how hard I tried.

451
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,188
JUCHAN: All right. I'm really proud
of you. You're so dedicated.

452
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:57,858
I guess I'm a bit book smart after all.

453
00:21:57,948 --> 00:21:58,858
No, you're not.

454
00:21:58,948 --> 00:21:59,778
(gasps)

455
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:01,528
(chuckles)

456
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:03,618
(dogs barking in distance)

457
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:07,288
JUCHAN: You know the CSAT score takes up
50% of the entire score.

458
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,958
-Keep your guard up until the end.
-I will.

459
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:14,088
Here.

460
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:16,378
(gasps)

461
00:22:16,838 --> 00:22:17,968
What's...

462
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,548
(chuckles)

463
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:21,298
(breathes heavily)

464
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:29,768
PASS

465
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,608
(upbeat music)

466
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:32,938
They're "pass" candies.

467
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,728
I hope you pass the exam.
So we can study together.

468
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,988
Study...

469
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:40,818
together?
(chuckles)

470
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:43,488
-Head on in. I'm off.
-Bye.

471
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:54,378
(upbeat music continues)

472
00:22:58,338 --> 00:23:00,298
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 17

473
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:03,428
CSAT EXAM

474
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,808

475
00:23:10,058 --> 00:23:12,348
KO EUNKANG, EXAMINEE
WI SEUNGHYUN, EXAMINEE

476
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:18,608
EMPTY, HEIGHT, PLAY, BOIL, COME

477

479
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:32,958
(plastic rustles)

480
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:41,758
-What is it?
-Minyong told me not to send it back.

481
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,088
-See.
-Mikang.

482
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,388
I'm going to be a police officer
once I get into KNPU.

483
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,678
And police represent integrity.

484
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:53,348
So how can I keep
such an unrighteous item at home?

485
00:23:54,598 --> 00:23:55,438
(grumbles)

486
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,108
You better pass everything
before saying that.

487
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:59,688
Just wait a while.
The results will be announced in two days.

488
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:02,108
Seriously? Gold digger?

489
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:06,868
I'm going to send it back
and make his friend apologize.

490
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:10,038
Damn it. That idiot.

491
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,208
(keyboard clacks)

492
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,288
KNPU REGULAR ADMISSIONS 2017
APPLICATION STATUS

493
00:24:16,378 --> 00:24:17,878
SEARCH

494
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,548
Gosh, I can't watch.
What if she didn't get in?

495
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,758
(screaming)
Hey! Watch your mouth.

496
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,928
What? I'm just scared.

497
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,718
Quiet. It's almost time.

498
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,178
Five.

499
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:32,678
-Four.
-Four.

500
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,848
-Three.
-Three.

501
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:34,938
-Two.
-Two.

502
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:36,018
One!

503
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,438
Today, we're going to talk
about the juvenile drug crime

504
00:24:39,518 --> 00:24:41,228
that happened in an arcade recently

505
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:44,278
together with Mr. Wi Giyong,
Chief of East Gyeonggi Police Office.

506
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,488
INSIDE NEWS LINE

507
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,528
Hello, sir.

508
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:48,118
Hello.

509
00:24:48,198 --> 00:24:50,658
You're the most
experienced expert in Korea

510
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:53,038
when it comes to drug investigations.

511
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:53,958
(laughs)

512
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:55,578
ANCHORWOMAN: It's already been ten years

513
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:59,878
since you revealed the connections between
a drug cartel and Damos Hotel in Gangnam

514
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,628
as Captain of the drug squad,

515
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,838
which created quite a stir back then.

516
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:07,588
What do you think of this drug crime?

517
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:10,138
-Well, that case--
-Excuse me.

518
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:11,718
Sorry.

519
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:14,098
-We need to take a small break here.
-Sure.

520
00:25:18,098 --> 00:25:20,018
-(clears throat)
-ANCHORWOMAN: We apologize, sir.

521
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:22,318
-We know how busy you are.
-It's okay.

522
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:23,608
(laughs, breathes deeply)

523
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:27,278
WIFE

524
00:25:28,988 --> 00:25:32,038
SOOKJA: He got... the highest score!

525
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:33,538
(chuckles)

526
00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:36,328
Didn't you see it yet?

527
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:38,038
Someone already
posted an article about it.

528
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,958
(sighs in awe)

529
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,748
I'm so proud of my boy.

530
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:45,048
Gosh, he's one handsome boy.

531
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,418
Don't be so fussy.

532
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,218
The score is meaningless.

533
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,138
GIYONG: What matters
is his performance there.

534
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,598
Come on.
A little compliment wouldn't hurt.

535
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:58,688
He even dropped out of med school
to be a great cop like you.

536
00:25:58,768 --> 00:26:01,188
SOOKJA: I still think it's a shame.

537
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:03,688
He's the one to make
his own decisions in life.

538
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:06,438
You didn't say anything strange
to reporters, did you?

539
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:09,198
Don't you worry.
I didn't say a word about you.

540
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:10,198
Good.

541
00:26:10,698 --> 00:26:13,118
Once people find out
that his father is a high-ranking officer,

542
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,998
-it's going to make things harder for him.
-SOOKJA: Okay.

543
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:19,958
Honey, I was thinking
we could go out today,

544
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,628
get him some new clothes
and have dinner together.

545
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:24,958
When will you be finished?

546
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:27,918
Do it without me.
We're having an emergency right now.

547
00:26:28,008 --> 00:26:29,008
-Honey--
-(cellphone beeps)

548
00:26:30,838 --> 00:26:32,178
(sighs)
Geez.

549
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:36,388
He thinks he's the only one
protecting this country.

550
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:38,438
(chuckles)

551
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:41,268
(gasps)

552
00:26:41,858 --> 00:26:44,438
Are you already ready?

553
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:47,358
Yes. Is he busy?

554
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:52,908
Yes. But we can have
an intimate party of our own,

555
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,618
just the two of us. Okay?

556
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:58,658
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

557
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:00,458
(Yangchul yelps)

558
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,328
YOUR APPLICATION HAS BEEN REJECTED

559
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:08,418
-(somber music)
-I told you to watch your mouth.

560
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:09,338
(clicks tongue)

561
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:10,928
(sighs)

562
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:12,678
HEESOOK: Why is it my fault?

563
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:19,678
It's okay.

564
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:27,438
YOUR APPLICATION HAS BEEN REJECTED

565
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:29,608
(somber music)

566
00:27:36,118 --> 00:27:37,078
(sniffles)

567
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:44,038
(somber music continues)

568
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:02,888
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

569
00:28:02,978 --> 00:28:04,098
TOWER OF JUSTICE

570
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:05,688
HYUK: Attention!

571
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,938
Parade rest!

572
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:09,898
Attention!

573
00:28:10,358 --> 00:28:14,908
We will now begin Cheongram Education
for the trainees of Class 47.

574
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,618
Cheongram Education
is an orientation program

575
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,328
for the KNPU freshmen
before the semester begins.

576
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:20,948
For the next two weeks,

577
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:22,908
you will get basic physical training
and learn general knowledge.

578
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:25,708
I hope you all can finish the course

579
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,588
and proudly enter the school.

580
00:28:28,088 --> 00:28:28,918
Understood?

581
00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:30,338
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

582
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:32,168
(Hyuk screaming)
Louder. Understood?

583
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,468
(students screaming)
Yes, sir!

584
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,298
All freshmen are required
to hand in their personal items

585
00:28:37,388 --> 00:28:38,888
and use the issued supplies.

586
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:43,138
Using prohibited items like mobile phones
may lead to expulsion.

587
00:28:43,228 --> 00:28:45,898
So I want you all to be careful.

588
00:28:45,978 --> 00:28:47,148
Gi Hanna.

589
00:28:47,688 --> 00:28:49,768
(tense music)

590
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:52,148
-INSIK: Next.
-Wi Seunghyun.

591
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,408
(objects clattering)

592
00:28:55,488 --> 00:28:56,778
WI SEUNGHYUN
KNPU

593
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:09,958
All right. I'm done.

594
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:13,758
-Hand it in.
-I heard I could bring sneakers.

595
00:29:13,838 --> 00:29:16,088
-You think this is a fashion show?
-Oh...

596
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:18,968
Then...

597
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,098
-I'll take this and this.
-Choose one.

598
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:25,638
SUNYU: Next.

599
00:29:25,728 --> 00:29:26,638
(bag thuds)

600
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:28,348
(zipper zips)

601
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:31,188
That's it?

602
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:33,438
One second.

603
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:35,648
SUNYU: Next.

604
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:36,778
Yoo Daeil.

605
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:41,278
INSIK: Freshman.

606
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,698
What is that?

607
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:46,658
(yelping)

608
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:49,498
DAEIL: It's a cervical pillow.

609
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,498
I have a forward head posture.

610
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:56,088
You know how important it is
to keep the C curve on your neck.

611
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,798
-Hand it in.
-Okay, sir.

612
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:04,718
DAEIL: Guys, don't let them scare you.

613
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:08,058
They're just overacting
to intimidate the naive freshmen.

614
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:10,268
Just pretend to be scared.

615
00:30:11,608 --> 00:30:13,978
I heard many kids quit midway.

616
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:16,608
Apparently over 20 freshmen
dropped out last year.

617
00:30:16,688 --> 00:30:18,358
(Daeil sighs)
Don't worry.

618
00:30:18,908 --> 00:30:21,118
Humans can adapt to any environment.

619
00:30:21,368 --> 00:30:23,028
It's all the same where people live.

620
00:30:23,118 --> 00:30:25,408
You seem relaxed.
Probably because you're older than us.

621
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:26,908
Oh, come on.

622
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,868
Just talk casually with me.
We're colleagues.

623
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:30,578
BUMJU: But you're three years
older than me.

624
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:31,538
(Daeil sucks air)

625
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:32,628
Hey, Bumju.

626
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:35,628
-If you keep doing that, I'll get angry.
-We're colleagues, so let's talk casually.

627
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,298
-Or things will get complicated here.
-Maybe you're right.

628
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:39,428
He's right. Say, "Hey."

629
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:41,048
Hey. Hey.

630
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:42,178
(Tak screaming)
Hey!

631
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:45,178
Whose is this?

632
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:46,888
That's mine.

633
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:48,518
Why is it there?

634
00:30:50,728 --> 00:30:52,808
(tense music)

635
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:04,698
You said it's yours.

636
00:31:05,158 --> 00:31:06,198
Sure, thanks.

637
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,538
(zipper zips)

638
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,788
Your name was Kim Tak, right?

639
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,998
-I hope we get along.
-TAK: I'm going on ahead.

640
00:31:14,878 --> 00:31:15,708
(door opens)

641
00:31:18,968 --> 00:31:21,968
(Daeil sighs in annoyance)
Gosh. That little rat.

642
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:24,258
So lastly, I'd like to say...

643
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:31,138
since we met here as colleagues,
I hope we get along

644
00:31:31,228 --> 00:31:33,018
and make it to the end.

645
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:36,768
Thanks. I'm Woo Juyoung.
Now, I'm done introducing myself.

646
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,188
(applauding)

647
00:31:39,318 --> 00:31:41,898
But why did you come here
if you went to a science high school?

648
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:45,028
I thought they would go
to schools like KAIST.

649
00:31:45,618 --> 00:31:48,578
Gosh, you know nothing, do you?

650
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:51,908
What's the essence of
police investigations in this day and age?

651
00:31:51,998 --> 00:31:53,418
Forensic science.

652
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:57,248
So I'm trying to make use
of my strong suit.

653
00:31:57,338 --> 00:31:59,008
Is that so?

654
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:00,758
Good luck with that.

655
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,338
(cheerful music)

656
00:32:03,428 --> 00:32:04,508
JUYOUNG : What about you?

657
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:06,298
You're obviously from Seoul.

658
00:32:07,098 --> 00:32:08,098
I'm from Ilsan.

659
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,848
My name is Jang Soyeon.

660
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,978
SOYEON: My hobbies
are walking and reading.

661
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:13,978
And I'm good at...

662
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,148
Well, I guess I can say
I'm a good pianist.

663
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:17,818
It's your turn now.

664
00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:19,858
I'm Gi Hanna.

665
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:21,818
I'm from Gangneung.

666
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,778
I love Gangneung.
I've been to Gyeongpodae there.

667
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:27,908
Is that it?

668
00:32:29,158 --> 00:32:31,828
-Am I supposed to say more?
-Well...

669
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,708
You don't have to.

670
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,498
ARI: Is she trying to be mysterious?

671
00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:38,498
How annoying.

672
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:39,878
Never mind.

673
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:44,428
Is it my turn now? I'm...

674
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,848
ARI: Actually, you probably know...

675
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:50,968
JUYOUNG : Wait. Are you...

676
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,558
You are! Right?

677
00:32:54,728 --> 00:32:57,898
That's right. I'm Shin Ari,
the Golden Bell star.

678
00:32:57,978 --> 00:32:59,228
Were you on TV?

679
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:00,898
I thought you knew.

680
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:03,988
No, I was going to ask
if you had double eyelid surgery.

681
00:33:05,238 --> 00:33:06,198
(scoffs)

682
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,738
What are you talking about?

683
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:10,278
Hey. Wait. You got a nose job too.

684
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:11,618
No, I didn't!

685
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,538
-Well, I can't believe that.
-I really didn't. Touch it.

686
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:16,788
-ARI: Feel it.
-JUYOUNG : Where did you have eye surgery?

687
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:18,918
The nose. Touch the nose.

688
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:19,918
But your eyes...

689
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,918
(chimes on speaker)

690
00:33:22,378 --> 00:33:25,838
SUNYU (on speaker):
All freshmen, assemble now.

691
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:27,218
(footsteps approaching)

692
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:34,018
(Hyuk screaming)
It took 20 minutes to get assembled!

693
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:36,888
I'll let it slide
because this is your first day.

694
00:33:36,978 --> 00:33:38,648
STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

695
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,688
I'm the chief trainer,

696
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,318
Um Hyuk, and I'll be training you
for the next two weeks.

697
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:44,358
(weak applauding)

698
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:50,738
From now on,
you're allowed to say only three things.

699
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,618
"Yes, sir", "Sorry, sir",

700
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,998
and "I'll get it right, sir."

701
00:33:55,538 --> 00:33:56,828
-Understood?
-STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

702
00:33:56,908 --> 00:33:58,368
(screaming)
Is that all you got?

703
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:00,038
(Students screaming)
Yes, sir!

704
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:02,338
During this training period,
the student with top marks,

705
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:05,168
Wi Seunghyun, will be
the representative of all you trainees.

706
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:06,378
Yes, sir!

707
00:34:06,468 --> 00:34:08,128
-Wi Seunghyun, you're the mark.
-Mark!

708
00:34:08,218 --> 00:34:10,848
-Fall into eight lines!
-Yes, sir!

709
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,638
(Hyuk shouting)
Get moving!

710
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,388
COUNTRY, JUSTICE, HONOR

711
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:21,518
HYUK: Now, we'll start
the basic physical training, the PT set.

712
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:25,648
Until Cheongram Education is over,
your goal is a thousand PT sets a day.

713
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:27,398
Understood?

714
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:28,608
(screaming)
Do you understand?

715
00:34:28,698 --> 00:34:30,238
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

716
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:32,068
(whistling)

717
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,868
(upbeat rock music)

718
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,668
Synchronize!

719
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:46,338
HYUK: Another 100!

720
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,378
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

721
00:34:49,928 --> 00:34:51,218
(whistling continues)

722
00:34:54,598 --> 00:34:55,768
HYUK: Move to the rhythm!

723
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:58,058
Stay in line!

724
00:34:58,808 --> 00:35:00,438
Keep it in line!

725
00:35:00,518 --> 00:35:02,938
(upbeat music continues)

726
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,728
(whistling continues)

727
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,608
Get your act together!

728
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,158
Stay alert!

729
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:13,908
INSIK: Do it right!

730
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,328
SUNYU: Keep moving!

731
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:17,158
MALE TRAINER 1: Keep moving!

732
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,748
-SUNYU: Eyes on the person in front.
-MALE TRAINER 1: Keep counting!

733
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,168
HYUK: Don't stop!

734
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:22,078
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

735
00:35:25,798 --> 00:35:27,958
(Hyuk screaming)
I told you to get your act together!

736
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:32,218
That goalpost behind you.

737
00:35:32,678 --> 00:35:35,178
First ten to wrap around
and come back will pass. Move.

738
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,428
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

739
00:35:36,808 --> 00:35:38,058
MALE TRAINER 2: Run now!

740
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:41,768
INSIK: Run faster!

741
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:46,068
(upbeat rock music continues)

742
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:49,068
(all panting)

743
00:35:49,488 --> 00:35:50,488
(students grunting)

744
00:35:53,738 --> 00:35:54,568
(music stops)

745
00:35:54,658 --> 00:35:56,118
(students panting)

746
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:57,368
COUNTRY, JUSTICE, HONOR

747
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:01,618
-HYUK: Back to your positions.
-STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

748
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,668
-HYUK: Back to your positions.
-STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

749
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:06,088
HYUK: Same course excluding the first ten.

750
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,798
The top 20 will pass this time. Move.

751
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:10,008
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

752
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:20,348
STUDENT DORMITORY

753
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,388
(gargling)

754
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:23,888
(speaker chimes)

755
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:25,808
SUNYU: This is an announcement
for freshmen.

756
00:36:25,898 --> 00:36:28,228
Soon, there will be a roll call
at 10:00 p.m.

757
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:31,738
Please get ready for the roll call.

758
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:33,238
I repeat.

759
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:36,778
Soon, there will be a roll call
at 10:00 p.m.

760
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,198
Please get ready for the roll call.

761
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,288
I repeat.

762
00:36:42,788 --> 00:36:45,668
Soon, there will be a roll call
at 10:00 p.m.

763
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:49,088
-Please get ready for the roll call.
-Darn it.

764
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:56,388
That wastebasket.
Is it supposed to be there?

765
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,178
Uh...

766
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:02,348
What is it doing here?

767
00:37:02,978 --> 00:37:05,098
Don't move the school's property.

768
00:37:05,438 --> 00:37:06,728
Yes, ma'am.

769
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,768
(suspenseful music)

770
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,648
Who's in charge of this area?

771
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:17,988
I am.

772
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:20,278
Did you wipe it down or not?

773
00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:22,948
I didn't wipe the outside...

774
00:37:23,038 --> 00:37:24,578
What are you mumbling about?

775
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:26,618
I didn't know
I had to wipe the outside, so...

776
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,208
SUNYU: Answer properly!

777
00:37:28,668 --> 00:37:29,998
I only wiped the inside!

778
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:36,838
If you did it, say you did it.
If you didn't do it, say you didn't.

779
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:40,758
-Don't you know how to answer?
-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll answer properly.

780
00:37:42,138 --> 00:37:44,268
-Clean it again.
-Yes, ma'am!

781
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:48,188
(suspenseful music)

782
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,648
(music stops)

783
00:37:55,948 --> 00:37:58,028
(footsteps thumping)

784
00:38:04,328 --> 00:38:06,658
(somber music)

785
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:08,208
(groans)

786
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,708
A close-order drill
trains you to carry out

787
00:38:11,788 --> 00:38:13,668
the commander's orders
quickly and correctly.

788
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:16,628
HYUK: It plays an important role
in developing the basic police mentality.

789
00:38:16,718 --> 00:38:19,468
First, you'll learn about formations.

790
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,348
Fall into five lines!

791
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:23,638
Fall into five lines! Mark, one!

792
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,138
-Two!
-Three!

793
00:38:25,218 --> 00:38:28,188
-Four!
-Five! End of order! Fall in!

794
00:38:28,268 --> 00:38:29,308
STUDENTS: Fall in!

795
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:31,558
Fall into eight rows!

796
00:38:31,648 --> 00:38:33,978
Fall into eight rows! Mark, one!

797
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:34,938
BOTH: Two!

798
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:36,108
Get it together!

799
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:38,608
HYUK: Forward, march!

800
00:38:38,698 --> 00:38:39,738
Left.

801
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:41,198
Left.

802
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:44,658
Change step, march!

803
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:47,198
Come out!

804
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,788
Get with it!

805
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,378
STUDENTS: One, two.

806
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,958
Stop frowning!

807
00:38:55,048 --> 00:38:56,418
STUDENTS: One, two.

808
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:57,548
-STUDENTS: One, two.
-Do it right!

809
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:58,758
-One, two.
-Faster!

810
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:00,298
STUDENTS: One, two.

811
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:01,718
INSIK: Get your act together!

812
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:03,968
HYUK: Fall into four lines!

813
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,138
TAK: Fall into four lines!

814
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:07,728
-Mark!
-Two!

815
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:09,308
-Three!
-Four!

816
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:15,688
You're supposed to say,
"Four. End of order. Fall in"!

817
00:39:15,768 --> 00:39:16,728
Four! End of order!

818
00:39:16,818 --> 00:39:18,648
-"Fall in."
-Four! Fall in!

819
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,248
"Four. End of order. Fall in."
Get it together!

820
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:35,338
End of order. Fall in.

821
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:37,918
-Louder.
-Four! Order! Fall in!

822
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:38,838
Are you kidding me?

823
00:39:39,298 --> 00:39:40,668
-Again.
-Sorry, sir!

824
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:42,928
-Again!
-Four! Order! Fall...

825
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:45,178
-Four! Fall in! End!
-Again.

826
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:48,808
-Are you crying?
-No, sir!

827
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:50,058
-HYUK: Are you crying?
-SOYEON: No, sir!

828
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,058
-HYUK: Are you crying?
-SOYEON: No, sir!

829
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,518
-Again!
-Four! End of order!

830
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:54,978
HYUK: Louder.

831
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:57,188
SOYEON: End of order! Fall in!

832
00:40:00,068 --> 00:40:02,358
HYUK: The close-order drill
is the most basic training here.

833
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:06,618
How can you be an executive officer
if you don't know the basics? You morons!

834
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,578
STUDENTS: Sorry, sir!

835
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:11,408
HYUK: Say "Let's" at one
and "concentrate" at two.

836
00:40:11,498 --> 00:40:12,958
Start doing 100 push-ups.

837
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,168
-Go.
-STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

838
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:17,208
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

839
00:40:17,288 --> 00:40:18,998
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

840
00:40:19,088 --> 00:40:20,588
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

841
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,218
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

842
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:23,798
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

843
00:40:23,878 --> 00:40:25,468
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

844
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,508
HYUK: One.

845
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,178
-STUDENTS: Let's...
-Let's.

846
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:30,058
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

847
00:40:30,468 --> 00:40:32,638
-HYUK: One.

848
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:34,518
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

849
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,478
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

850
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:38,318
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

851
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:40,318
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

852
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:41,858
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

853
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:44,108
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

854
00:40:44,198 --> 00:40:46,158
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

855
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:47,698
INSIK: Three more left!

856
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,038
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

857
00:40:50,118 --> 00:40:52,328
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

858
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:54,788
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

859
00:40:54,868 --> 00:40:56,578
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

860
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:58,538
HYUK: Get up.

861
00:40:59,378 --> 00:41:00,668
(Students groaning, panting)

862
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:04,628
Do you want the rest to do it
all over again just because of you?

863
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:06,468
HYUK: Being a woman is not an excuse.

864
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,848
If you want to act weak,
cut it out and go home.

865
00:41:08,928 --> 00:41:10,598
No, sir. I'll do it again.

866
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:12,768
(Soyeon panting)

867
00:41:14,728 --> 00:41:17,188
Let's concentrate.

868
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,768
SOYEON: Let's...

869
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:20,858
(whimpers)
...concentrate.

870
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:22,568
Let's

871
00:41:23,188 --> 00:41:24,318
...concentrate.

872
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:25,488
(pants)

873
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:26,408
Let's...

874
00:41:27,108 --> 00:41:28,158
(whimpers)
...concentrate.

875
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,618
Let's concentrate.

876
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:34,498
Let...

877
00:41:35,498 --> 00:41:36,958
(groans, panting)

878
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,168
HYUK: Get up.

879
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,798
(tense music)

880
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:47,678
-Sorry, sir!
-Get up!

881
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,258
KNPU freshman Wi Seunghyun.

882
00:41:53,098 --> 00:41:54,268
May I say something, sir?

883
00:41:55,728 --> 00:41:56,688
Go on.

884
00:41:56,768 --> 00:41:59,558
She doesn't seem to be feeling well.

885
00:42:00,558 --> 00:42:02,108
You. Get up.

886
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:04,188
(groans)

887
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,108
(breathes heavily)

888
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:13,578
Are you not feeling well?
If you are, you'll be excused.

889
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:15,288
Well...

890
00:42:16,248 --> 00:42:17,328
I'm not...

891
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,708
-feeling...
-Answer properly.

892
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:26,378
No, I'm feeling fine, sir. I can do it.

893
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:31,508
(suspenseful music)

894
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:33,218
Good.

895
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,018
HYUK: Then do the rest.

896
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:37,268
Yes, sir.

897
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:39,058
(emotive music)

898
00:42:39,138 --> 00:42:40,268
SEUNGHYUN: Please stop, sir.

899
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:45,228
How can she say yes...

900
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:47,398
under this pressure?

901
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:51,158
No one would be able to say
that they are unwell.

902
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:53,238
(emotive music continues)

903
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:00,578
What about this pressure?

904
00:43:01,878 --> 00:43:04,998
In case you didn't know,
you didn't come here to have fun.

905
00:43:05,088 --> 00:43:07,048
You came here to get training,
so you get training.

906
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:08,758
Training is not an option.
It's an obligation.

907
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:11,588
You have to do it even if you're tired,
sick, or you don't want to do it.

908
00:43:12,468 --> 00:43:16,388
Will you not help people in trouble
if you're feeling sick?

909
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,148
Listen, all of you.

910
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:26,688
After graduation,
you will all be executive police officers

911
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:29,818
who will be responsible for
and serving the people's lives and safety.

912
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,658
As executive officers,
you need to set an example.

913
00:43:31,738 --> 00:43:33,868
If you use your condition as an excuse,

914
00:43:34,658 --> 00:43:37,038
no one will follow your orders.

915
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:40,408
If you're not confident,
I want you to come out right now.

916
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:43,328
To weaklings, this place will be hell.

917
00:43:44,378 --> 00:43:46,248
They won't survive four years here anyway.

918
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,378
Then who protects us when we're sick?

919
00:43:53,468 --> 00:43:55,758
(thrilling music)

920
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,608
STUDENT DORMITORY

921
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,188
DAEIL: There are two possibilities.

922
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:13,198
Either his brain froze from
getting the punishment in the cold

923
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:15,198
or his eyes froze
so he couldn't see anything.

924
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:16,988
Can a brain freeze?

925
00:44:19,078 --> 00:44:21,958
I didn't mean that literally. Gosh.

926
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:24,668
It means he didn't read the room
and crossed the line.

927
00:44:26,078 --> 00:44:28,418
I thought he was smart
because he got the highest score.

928
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:31,088
His EQ must be low.
He can't seem to read the room.

929
00:44:31,718 --> 00:44:33,008
He wasn't wrong though.

930
00:44:34,378 --> 00:44:35,758
I thought it was satisfying.

931
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,308
Hey, he should have known
who he was talking to.

932
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:42,138
I mean, look at the trainer's face.

933
00:44:42,228 --> 00:44:43,768
That kind of villain

934
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,398
crushes you even harder
when you try to fight back.

935
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:48,358
You should never mess with them.

936
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,738
Then Seunghyun is in trouble.
I think he got on the wrong side of him.

937
00:44:53,278 --> 00:44:56,238
That's not who you should worry about.

938
00:44:56,618 --> 00:44:58,778
-We aren't safe either.
-Why not?

939
00:44:59,368 --> 00:45:02,038
He won't only pick on Seunghyun.

940
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:05,498
If he does, people might say
he's bullying him. Then what will he do?

941
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:09,458
He'll punish Seunghyun
and the people around him.

942
00:45:09,548 --> 00:45:10,798
Do you know what that's called?

943
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:15,678
Gosh. It's called joint responsibility.

944
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:18,178
-(scrapes)
-(sighs)

945
00:45:19,048 --> 00:45:20,758
The moment he finds a speck of dust here,

946
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:23,768
he'll crush us all. I'm sure of it.

947
00:45:25,728 --> 00:45:26,768
Darn it!

948
00:45:27,148 --> 00:45:30,148
Why do I have to be his roommate?
I don't want to be involved.

949
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:32,818
Guys, keep your distance from Seunghyun.

950
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,738
Something's ominous about him.

951
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:38,618
(sighs)
Gosh, stop overreacting, okay?

952
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:41,618
TAK: I find you more ominous.

953
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:44,368
Me?

954
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:52,248
Why do you think so?

955
00:45:53,048 --> 00:45:53,878
(sighs)

956
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,668
Knock it off.

957
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:18,238
HYUK: You asked who protected us.

958
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:19,278
(dramatic music)

959
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:20,778
We protect ourselves.

960
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,868
That's why we train ourselves
to become stronger.

961
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:27,658
But the training that disregards
individual differences can be harsh on--

962
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:29,708
This is not a place
for individual education.

963
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:31,288
Either you bear it or quit.

964
00:46:32,288 --> 00:46:33,628
Those are your only options.

965
00:46:35,048 --> 00:46:38,088
Isn't that common sense
for a police officer's son?

966
00:46:40,218 --> 00:46:42,848
Don't think you'll be protected
by your father.

967
00:46:46,058 --> 00:46:50,228
Whoever your father is,
no one can disrupt the training here.

968
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:54,778
(dramatic music)

969
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:02,028
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

970
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:13,418
-Are you really leaving?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

971
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:15,298
I didn't want to
make a big deal out of it.

972
00:47:15,378 --> 00:47:17,088
Couldn't you hang in there
a little longer?

973
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,378
I mean, it's almost over.

974
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:21,298
The trainers won't
keep acting like that after orientation.

975
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:24,008
I only caused trouble to others.

976
00:47:25,428 --> 00:47:26,638
I'm sorry.

977
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:27,888
(sighs)

978
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:29,178
(chuckles)

979
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:34,818
(Ari sighs)

980
00:47:35,608 --> 00:47:36,438
(Juyoung smack lips)

981
00:47:36,528 --> 00:47:37,528
ARI: Let's get back.

982
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:38,528
JUYOUNG : Okay.

983
00:47:39,528 --> 00:47:40,358
(Juyoung sighs)

984
00:47:40,448 --> 00:47:41,278
(door opens)

985
00:47:42,608 --> 00:47:44,528
It must have been really tough.

986
00:47:45,158 --> 00:47:46,868
Hey, you were here.

987
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:50,208
Soyeon just left.
You might be able to catch up if you run.

988
00:47:50,288 --> 00:47:52,248
-Yes.
-I'm good.

989
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,288
We didn't talk that much anyway.

990
00:47:54,378 --> 00:47:55,458
(scoffs)

991
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:59,298
She was still our roommate.
You should at least say goodbye.

992
00:48:00,298 --> 00:48:02,468
I don't want to be swayed by a quitter.

993
00:48:03,138 --> 00:48:06,138
Well, we're here,
and that's all that matters.

994
00:48:07,258 --> 00:48:08,218
(clears throat)

995
00:48:09,058 --> 00:48:10,018
(sighs)

996
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:12,388
Who's going to use this bed then?

997
00:48:13,848 --> 00:48:16,518
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR GRADUATION

998
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:20,358
They could have just sent it by post.

999
00:48:21,238 --> 00:48:23,408
What am I doing here?

1000
00:48:23,988 --> 00:48:26,868
PUNGJIN GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
30TH GRADUATION CEREMONY

1001
00:48:26,948 --> 00:48:29,158
(indistinct chattering)

1002
00:48:33,248 --> 00:48:35,288
-Let's go!
-Let's have something nice today.

1003
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:36,748
-Really? Yay!
-Yes!

1004
00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:38,668
Mom! I'm here.

1005
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:40,338
I told you to hurry.

1006
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,218
You could have told me
if you finished early.

1007
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:45,258
-Eunkang!
-There you go again, talking back to me.

1008
00:48:46,428 --> 00:48:48,638
There she is. Eunkang!

1009
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:50,178
HEESOOK: Sweetie.

1010
00:48:50,268 --> 00:48:52,348
See? This is why I said we should hurry.

1011
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:54,978
I'm sorry we're late.
Congratulations on graduating.

1012
00:48:57,728 --> 00:48:59,778
Eunkang, let's take a photo together.

1013
00:48:59,858 --> 00:49:02,778
A photo? We don't have to.

1014
00:49:03,278 --> 00:49:05,488
Come on. To celebrate your graduation.

1015
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,658
Why the long face?
Is it because you didn't get accepted?

1016
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:11,908
-Try again next year.
-YANGCHUL: She's right. College?

1017
00:49:11,998 --> 00:49:14,118
It can wait a year. What's the big deal?

1018
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:16,668
You weren't just lucky enough this time.
Your time will come.

1019
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:18,538
-Chin up!
-Yes.

1020
00:49:18,628 --> 00:49:21,418
-All right. Let's take a photo.
-Yes. Chin up.

1021
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:22,918
-Come on.
-A photo?

1022
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:25,428
Look here. Here we go.

1023
00:49:26,298 --> 00:49:28,848
In three, two...

1024
00:49:28,928 --> 00:49:29,758
(cellphone vibrates)

1025
00:49:29,848 --> 00:49:31,598
-Hang on.
-What is it?

1026
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:32,768
I got a call.

1027
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:34,228
-A call?
-Yes.

1028
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:39,268
-Hello?
-STAFF: Is this Ms. Ko Eunkang's phone?

1029
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:40,648
Yes. That's me.

1030
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:42,108
This is KNPU.

1031
00:49:42,528 --> 00:49:44,278
-What?
-We have an extra spot and you got in.

1032
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:45,818
Can you enroll by tomorrow?

1033
00:49:46,658 --> 00:49:49,488
(stammers)
Okay. I will.

1034
00:49:51,908 --> 00:49:52,738
(cellphone beeps)

1035
00:49:52,828 --> 00:49:54,868
(thrilling music)

1036
00:49:55,658 --> 00:49:56,748
What is it?

1037
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:00,788
(screams)

1038
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:05,468
(laughing)

1039
00:50:05,548 --> 00:50:06,838
Why? What is it?

1040
00:50:06,928 --> 00:50:08,048
What is it?

1041
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,258
I got accepted!

1042
00:50:10,718 --> 00:50:12,678
(all laughing)

1043
00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:17,098
I got in!

1044
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:22,978

(door thuds)

1048
00:50:45,378 --> 00:50:47,168
Use the empty bed.

1049
00:50:47,468 --> 00:50:49,588
The other students are training now,

1050
00:50:49,718 --> 00:50:52,428
so if you have any questions,
ask your roommates when they come back.

1051
00:50:56,558 --> 00:51:00,148
After lunch, you should join
the afternoon training.

1052
00:51:01,098 --> 00:51:02,108
Yes, ma'am.

1053
00:51:08,738 --> 00:51:10,818
(delightful music)

1054
00:51:22,878 --> 00:51:24,538

(sniffing)

1058
00:51:41,308 --> 00:51:42,898
What is this? It smells so good.

1059
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:44,058

Is it lunchtime?

1062
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:55,488
(delightful music continues)

1063
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:01,208

-(thuds)
-(Eunkang grunts)

1066
00:52:18,058 --> 00:52:19,558
BOTH: I'm sorry.

1067
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:23,978
Thank you.

1068
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:30,938
EUNKANG: Life is unpredictable.

1069
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:39,698
I thought I wasn't accepted into college,

1070
00:52:39,788 --> 00:52:41,408
but the next day, I got in like a miracle.

1071
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:43,538
What did you just say?

1072
00:52:44,118 --> 00:52:46,248
What did you just call my sister?

1073
00:52:46,918 --> 00:52:48,298
A gold digger.

1074
00:52:50,088 --> 00:52:51,628
EUNKANG: Sometimes you get reunited

1075
00:52:51,718 --> 00:52:53,798
with someone you thought
you'd never see again.

1076
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:57,098
As if...

1077
00:52:58,098 --> 00:52:59,258
it was destiny.

1078
00:53:01,018 --> 00:53:02,678
But I didn't know then

1079
00:53:03,478 --> 00:53:07,058
that it was just the beginning of my 20s,
which turned out to be...

1080
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:09,518
like a roller coaster ride.

1081
00:53:17,158 --> 00:53:19,198
