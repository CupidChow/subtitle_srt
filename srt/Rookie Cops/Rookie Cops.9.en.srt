1
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,420
(emotive music)

2
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,685
(emotive music continues)

3
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:26,901
EUNKANG: All relationships change
when you cross the line.

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,291
(emotive music continues)

5
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,387
Today, I...

6
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,850
...kissed a boy.

7
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,396
(slurping)

8
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,858
(chuckles, clears throat)

9
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,569
Hey.
(clears throat)

10
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,155
Do you want to have breakfast
with me tomorrow?

11
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,282
I always skip breakfast.

12
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,327
-Sorry.
-I see.

13
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,626
EUNKANG: And some relationships
don't change as much as you expect.

14
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,295
But one thing for sure is that

15
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:31,508
if you want change in a relationship,
you need the courage to cross the line.

16
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,176
MR. KANG

17
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,387
HANNA: I don't think I can do you
favors anymore. I'm sorry.

18
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:39,933
(sent message tone)

19
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,184
(whimsical music)

20
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,978
EUNKANG: The courage to put an end
to the current relationship.

21
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,855
ARI: Okay.

22
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,067
You don't seem to get it,
so let me ask again.

23
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,654
Why did you give me the strawberries?

24
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,365
-Because you like them.
-ARI: Exactly!

25
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,408
Why would you care what I like?

26
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,036
And you did it only for me,
acting like you didn't care.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,496
Why did you do that?

28
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,666
(heart pounding)

29
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,127
EUNKANG: The courage to risk rejections.

30
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,337
(heart pounding)

31
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,630
I like you.

32
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,427
Tsss...
(gasps)

33
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,721
See? I knew it.

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,557
I had the feeling you did.

35
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,892
I don't want to give you
any pressure, though.

36
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,604
I know it's one-sided,
so don't worry about it.

37
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,649
How can I not worry about it
when it's so obvious?

38
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,111
(sniffs)
Was it obvious?

39
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,487
Of course.

40
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,198
I know you helped Hanna with the training
to make me jealous.

41
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,741
That's not true.
(chuckles)

42
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,785
At the time, my circumstances...

43
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,039
Well, anyway,
it had nothing to do with you.

44
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,835
Whatever. You failed
to make me jealous anyway.

45
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,337
I'm sorry if I offended you.

46
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,841
-You didn't hear anything from me today...
-(in English) Stop.

47
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,094
(sighs)

48
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,888
(quirky music)

49
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,847
Give me some time.

50
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,975
I mean, I need some time to think.

51
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,270
I'm shocked because I didn't know
you'd suddenly confess your feelings.

52
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,564
I understand. So don't worry about it...

53
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,024
(screaming)
I said, give me some time!

54
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,775
(meows)

55
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,571
(clears throat)

56
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,075
I'll let you know
when I'm ready to give you my answer.

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,453
(swallows)

58
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,373
(quirky music continues)

59
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,676
(theme music)

60
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,807
(thrilling music)

61
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,103
(rasps)

62
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,983
(thrilling music continues)

63
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,444
(clears throat)

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,822
(sighs)
It wasn't easy, but I got it.

65
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:04,744
Released eight months ago,
it's been out of stock since.

66
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,120
PC Four Pro.

67
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,998
At last, it has come into my hands.

68
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,167
-(applauding)
-(Juyoung exhales sharply)

69
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,129
It's a used one,
but it's just as good as new.

70
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,423
Now, let me tell you
about this video game console...

71
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,675
(yawning)

72
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:19,968
(mouthing)
Hurry up.

73
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:24,138
(clears throat)
All right. Now, let me open

74
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,058
this gorgeous PC Four Pro.

75
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,937
-(drum roll)
-JUYOUNG: Come closer.

76
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,063
Here we go.

77
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,234
-Hey, film it.
-Okay.

78
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,194
-JUYOUNG: It's packed really nicely.
-(Daeil chuckling)

79
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,737
-JUYOUNG: My gosh. It's here.
-Wow.

80
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,739
-Film it.
-Do you see it?

81
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,367
Make sure to film everything.
What do you think?

82
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,162
(paper rustling)

83
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,625
I got it. I got it.
(gasps)

84
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,210
(exclaiming)

85
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,337
-JUYOUNG: I got it.
-Ta-da...

86
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,881
JUYOUNG: What's this?

87
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,841
Huh?

88
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,346
SEUNGHYUN: And?

89
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,931
That's the end of the story.

90
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,891
She spent her 450,000 won for nothing.

91
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,144
Did she not check
the fraud database beforehand?

92
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,313
She did, but the number
wasn't on the list then.

93
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,773
She wired the money
to someone named Lee Sehyun,

94
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,067
but she couldn't reach the seller since.
They just vanished.

95
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,903
-Did she call the police?
-She did, but I doubt they'll be caught.

96
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,240
The police said it's a burner phone.
Even if they find out whose phone it is,

97
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,659
-it'll be hard to get the money back.
-A burner phone?

98
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,579
My. They sound like professional crooks.

99
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,831
It was just a stroke of bad luck.

100
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,042
You can never catch
those meticulous frauds.

101
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,877
(sighs)

102
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,172
Hey.

103
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,424
Do you know
you're the talk of the town now?

104
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,051
So you're the princes of KNPU?

105
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,510
(Jieun scoffs)

106
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,803
(whimsical music)

107
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,182
47TH CHEONGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL
TALENT SHOW #1

108
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,143
Wooyong, did you see this?

109
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,897
So many people are watching
the video I posted.

110
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,525
"The princes of KNPU rocked the stage."

111
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,029
"You guys are thieves.
You stole my heart in broad daylight."

112
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,740
"These guys should be national treasures."

113
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,742
(quirky music)

114
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,706
Hey, I told you to write
about the festival, not the talent show.

115
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,584
The talent show
is also a part of the sports festival.

116
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,713
Still. The winning team's games
are supposed to be the main video.

117
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,759
-And the dean's speech is too short.
-Now, let's begin the 47th...

118
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,012
-WOOYONG: Anyway, change the main video.
-Okay.

119
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,017
Oh, right. Good luck with the field trip
on the weekend.

120
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,936
ARI: Thank you.

121
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,731
(door shuts)

122
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,358
But people love it.

123
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,568
(whimsical music)

124
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,279
(keyboard clacking)

125
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,742
(keyboard clacks)

126
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,285
(scoffs)

127
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,539
Why is he so cute?

128
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,542
ARI: You handsome country boy.

129
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,710
This is why
you're getting so many comments.

130
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,878
(giggles)

131
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,843
Anyway, I told him to wait.
When should I call him?

132
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,264
It's been three days, so...

133
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,600
(sighs)
I should wait at least a week.

134
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,395
(gasps)
Oh, my class.

135
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,482
RESEARCH & LECTURE BUILDING

136
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,820
(suspenseful music)

137
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,285
(paper rustling)

138
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,581
(suspenseful music continues)

139
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,132
Since there is only one beer glass,

140
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,927
we can assume that the victim
was sitting here, drinking alone.

141
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,265
ICE CAPSULE

142
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,517
I think there were
more than two people here.

143
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,020
There are two cigarette butts
in the ashtray.

144
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,605
And they're from different brands.

145
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,107
HANNA: Smokers usually
stick to one brand they like.

146
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,859
There's a chance
one belongs to the culprit.

147
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,444
Good. What else?

148
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,070
There's no sign of forced entry.

149
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,406
It's likely it was done
by an acquaintance.

150
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,241
Did the victim have company?

151
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,370
She was with her boyfriend
when she checked in.

152
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,166
Then her boyfriend is the prime suspect.

153
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,920
The case report says the boyfriend's semen
was found in her body.

154
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,838
EUNKANG: Seeing the victim's belongings
are on the floor,

155
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,258
the man seems to have run away after
raping her and killing her on impulse.

156
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,885
At the beginning of the investigation,

157
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,763
the detectives also considered
her boyfriend the key suspect.

158
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,767
Because the DNA samples
from the semen and the cigarette butt

159
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,769
matched the boyfriend's.

160
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,895
But there's a twist...

161
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,022
in this case.

162
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,691
Has anyone found anything else
in this crime scene?

163
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,862
There's a possibility that the victim
wasn't murdered in this room.

164
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,615
There's a bloodstain here.

165
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,618
SEUNGHYUN: I think
the victim was already bleeding

166
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,203
when she entered the room.

167
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,748
Maybe the victim had a scuffle
with the culprit in here.

168
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,832
That can't be the case

169
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,211
because there are no other bloodstains
on the walls or furniture,

170
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,838
and the room is fairly clean.

171
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,967
It's hard to imagine
there was a scuffle here.

172
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,387
I think it's more reasonable
to assume that she was hurt outside,

173
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,848
and died in this room
after being moved here.

174
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,766
(chuckles)

175
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,647
Sometimes, a small clue
on the crime scene can change

176
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,233
the whole flow of the investigation.

177
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,569
And that's what happened in this case.

178
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,908
(foreboding music)

179
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,708
UGON: The lead detective of the case

180
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,877
also found the bloodstain
in front of the door suspicious.

181
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,008
So he went out of the room
and searched the entire corridor.

182
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,764
(foreboding music continues)

183
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,857
And there he found
another bloodstain of the victim,

184
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,109
which was made
while the victim was being moved.

185
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,738
He kept following the clues
and eventually,

186
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:17,617
he caught the culprit who murdered
two more women in the same way.

187
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,035
What about her boyfriend then?

188
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,494
Did he have nothing to do with it?

189
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,747
Six hours before the incident...

190
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,212
6 HOURS BEFORE THE INCIDENT

191
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,213
JUYOUNG: Don't go.

192
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,427
UGON: The two had a little squabble
after having sex.

193
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,263
The woman's boyfriend got angry
and went home.

194
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,557
(suspenseful music)

195
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,563
Left alone, the woman drank some beer
ordered through room service.

196
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,067
Then she went to the bar
on the basement floor to cheer herself up.

197
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,693
(both laughing)

198
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,991
There, she met the man,
who had almost raped her...

199
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,952
(bottle shatters)

200
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,287
...but then murdered her.

201
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,290
(suspenseful music continues)

202
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,211
(heavy footsteps)

203
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,090
(splats)

204
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,220
(foreboding music)

205
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,103
The culprit went into her room
using her keycard, laid her on the bed,

206
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,360
made the room look
as if there'd been a sexual assault,

207
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,653
and ran away.

208
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,326
(foreboding music continues)

209
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,667
(music fades)

210
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,168
(class exclaims)

211
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,296
But unfortunately,
they failed to reveal the truth then.

212
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,841
So her innocent boyfriend

213
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,468
had to live in prison for three years.

214
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,011
How did they catch the culprit then?

215
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,596
(inhales)
Let me ask you a question first.

216
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,099
What are the three principles
of criminal investigation?

217
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,809
May I?

218
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,145
Quick start, preservation of evidence,

219
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,313
-and cooperation.
-(in English) Good.

220
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,859
Correct. However,
that's not the answer I wanted.

221
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,694
The three principles
of criminal investigation

222
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,030
are blood, sweat, and tears.

223
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:20,990
(uplifting music)

224
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,742
Never overlook
even a single drop of blood.

225
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,952
Keep running
until your feet get all sweaty.

226
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,496
And eventually,
wipe the victim and their family's tears.

227
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,665
These are the three principles
of criminal investigation.

228
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,586
Now, let me tell you
how they caught the real culprit.

229
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,339
The wrongly imprisoned man
filed a petition,

230
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,468
and the detective who got the petition
reopened the case.

231
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,511
If the detective
had given up in the middle...

232
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,223
(uplifting music continues)

233
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,519
...this case would have
remained a mystery,

234
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,938
and they wouldn't have been
able to catch the real culprit.

235
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,608
In reality,

236
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,611
crime scenes are nothing like those
from novels and TV shows.

237
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,573
Track down the criminal at all costs.

238
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,742
If you don't give up,

239
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,412
eventually you're bound to find
the real culprit. Understood?

240
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,789
STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

241
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,333
(uplifting music)

242
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,715
(sighs)

243
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,133
Was it fun?

244
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,636
-JUYOUNG: Hey, wait.
-Blood, sweat, and tears.

245
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,888
Guys. Are you free tomorrow?

246
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,015
Why?

247
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,976
I'm going to catch that punk myself.

248
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,395
What?

249
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,730
JUYOUNG: Look.

250
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,400
This is the invoice of the package
that fraud, Lee Sehyun sent me.

251
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,987
I tracked the shipment, and look.

252
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,323
The package was first picked up

253
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,617
at West Warehouse in Cheongu,
Gyeonggi Province.

254
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,997
This means that punk sent
the package to Cheongu.

255
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:56,126
If we go there
and search the tracking number,

256
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,046
we'll find out which convenience store
that punk sent it from.

257
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,714
-I see.
-Right.

258
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,884
Then I'll go to
the convenience store and...

259
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,262
When was it sent?
What does the invoice say?

260
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,471
JUYOUNG: It's 3:34 p.m.

261
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,849
If I check the footage
of the security camera in the store,

262
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,476
I can see this fraudster's face.

263
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,477
(gasps)

264
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,980
Oh, my gosh. That's so logical.

265
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,358
Cheongu isn't that far from here.
It's like an hour away.

266
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,443
(stammering)
Are you going there?

267
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,614
-Of course!
-Wow. You're even going to the scene.

268
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,241
(clears throat)

269
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:31,579
You see, he even used a burner phone.
It means he does this all the time.

270
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,913
(mouthing)
Let's go.

271
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,332
If I don't do anything about this,
there will be another victim.

272
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,167
I need to go there and crush him.

273
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,963
Good luck, my friend.

274
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,425
What? You want me to go there alone?

275
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,220
What a shame.
I have so many things to do tomorrow.

276
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,431
Oh, no. I also have
so much homework to do.

277
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,351
-JUYOUNG: Oh, come on.
-(feet squeak)

278
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,313
As squadmates, you can't do this to me.

279
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,106
If you keep acting like this,

280
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,775
I won't let you play my consoles again.

281
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,278
I need your cooperation.

282
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,405
(quirky music)

283
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,741
Sit.

284
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,701
-Did you say it was Cheongu?
-Yes.

285
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,661
-It's only an hour away from here.
-Cheongu...

286
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,041
(keyboard clacking)

287
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,834
(clears throat)

288
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,961
Aren't you going home?

289
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:21,962
What?

290
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,339
Uh...

291
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,008
I'm staying at school this weekend.

292
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:26,967
I see.

293
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,137
I'm going to stop by the cleaner's
on my way out.

294
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,432
We can wear casual outside this week,
so I'm getting my uniforms cleaned.

295
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,684
I can drop off yours too if you want.

296
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,603
No, I'm good.

297
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,355
-Okay.
-HANNA: Leave it here.

298
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,232
I'll drop yours off later
on my way to lunch.

299
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,570
Really? That's so nice of you.

300
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,325
-(bag rustles)
-Thank you.

301
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,285
Have a good weekend.

302
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,454
-Okay. Have fun.
-Thanks.

303
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,751
(engine revving)

304
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,549
(awkward music sting)

305
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,053
(sucks lips)

306
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,352
(quirky music)

307
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,954
(quirky music continues)

308
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:37,997
(rasps)

309
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,925
(quirky music)

310
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,929
What? Really?

311
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,973
Yes. Sunyu is going abroad

312
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,559
because Juchan dumped her.

313
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,352
They were going out?

314
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,521
You didn't know?
They were together for two years.

315
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,189
(gasps)
That's a long time.

316
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,569
They've probably gotten
to home base already then.

317
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,154
FEMALE STUDENT 1: Of course.

318
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,989
FEMALE STUDENT 2: Unbelievable.

319
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,323
FEMALE STUDENT 1: I know, right?

320
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:25,377
YANGJAE STATION (SEOCHO-GU OFFICE) EXIT 8

YANGJAE STATION

322
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,050
(hissing)

323
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,887
(sighs)

324
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,263
How about tteokbokki for dinner?

325
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,639
That sounds awesome.

326
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,599
(chuckles)

327
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,189
-Hey, Seunghyun.
-Yes?

328
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,317
Are... you free today?

329
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,027
What, today?

330
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,570
Well, it's Myunghoon's birthday today.

331
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,740
We're going to grab a drink around here.
Do you want to join us?

332
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,408
But I...

333
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,243
-Do you have plans?
-Yes.

334
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,829
Actually, Myunghoon said

335
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,500
he'd like to make up with you.
That's why I asked.

336
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,751
WOOYONG: Oh, well.

337
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,336
All right, then.

338
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,093
-I think Myunghoon wants to talk to you.
-We can talk later.

339
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,054
-I think you should just join them.
-But what about tteokbokki?

340
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,097
We can have it tomorrow.

341
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,433
-But I don't want to go.
-You know how Myunghoon can be petty.

342
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,852
Just go. Otherwise he'll talk
behind your back today.

343
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,854
Then could you wait for me
in a café nearby?

344
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,855
I'll be right back.

345
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,982
-See you later.
-Okay.

346
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,859
SEUNGHYUN: Wooyong!

347
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,486
Wooyoung.

348
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,160
(vehicles honking)

349
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,162
(trilling)

350
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,681
Do what you want to do.

351
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,101
Then I will buy

352
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,602
your dream.

353
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,689
The future and the company you dream of.

354
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,816
We will make that together.

355
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,110
(audience cheering)

356
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,738
(uplifting music)

357
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,534
INVESTING IN YOUNG ADULTS' DREAMS

358
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:24,163
I was like you once.

359
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,831
When I was studying in the US,

360
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,544
I stayed up all night,
writing a business plan with my colleagues

361
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,338
and I worked my butt off
to find investors.

362
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,675
I had scholarships
in an Ivy League school,

363
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,427
so I was pretty confident.

364
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,805
But my hopes were brutally crushed.

365
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,308
(audience laughing)

366
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:50,022
I knocked on numerous doors
and got rejected countless times.

367
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,983
Do you know what I learned from that?

368
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:58,989
I learned how to get used to rejection
and adjusting to change.

369
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,741
As Charles Darwin once said,

370
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,369
"It is not the strongest
of the species that survives,

371
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,788
nor the most intelligent.

372
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,625
It is the one most adaptable to change."

373
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,252
So I want you to keep

374
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,255
these two things in mind

375
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,343
if you want to sell your dreams.

376
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,178
Thank you.

377
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,140
(audience cheering, applauding)

378
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,059
(uplifting music)

379
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,482
(phone camera clicks)

380
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,317
ARI: Jo Hansol's Talk Concert.

381
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,694
Fifty seats only, and I got one of them.

382
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,906
CEO Jo Hansol is so cool!

383
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,159
(music fades)

384
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,536
(crickets creaking)

385
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,583
-(girls giggling)
-(approaching footsteps)

386
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,711
It's okay.

387
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,464
-How can I help you?
-Can I please take a photo with you?

388
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,882
Oh, sure.
(chuckles)

389
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,842
BOTH: Thank you.

390
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,386
I'm not a celebrity, though.
(chuckles)

391
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,720
In three, two, one.

392
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,097
(phone camera clicks)

393
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,348
Thank you.

394
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,227
-Please.
-Three, two, one.

395
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,144
(phone camera clicks)

396
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,521
ARI: Thank you.

397
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,356
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

398
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,649
Can I...

399
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,858
Thank you.

400
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,319
(giggling)

401
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,196
(footsteps receding)

402
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,828
What's next?

403
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,079
You have an appointment in Migeun-dong.

404
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,415
(crickets creaking)

405
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,710
MIGEUN FORTUNE RESTAURANT

406
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,378
This really hits the spot.

407
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,796
SINYU CLUB'S REGULAR GATHERING

408
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,172
Hey, Mr. Commissioner.

409
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,176
About Senior Superintendent Park
from Class 20...

410
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,637
Why did Superintendent General
turn down his promotion?

411
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,556
He's a smart kid.

412
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,808
Apparently, he had a hand
in stock manipulation

413
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,602
when working at
the Financial Supervisory Service.

414
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,397
You should have stood up for him
as his senior.

415
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,608
CHANGHO: I can't really defend him
because the article is already published.

416
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,485
It seemed like he had to
fix the whole thing

417
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,903
and was about to be investigated.

418
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,406
-Gosh, that punk...
-(cellphone buzzes)

419
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,116
Anyway,

420
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,369
this is the first time
that all our KNPU graduates

421
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,204
failed to get promoted.

422
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,623
INMYEON: It's so embarrassing.
I can't even look at my seniors!

423
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,917
Get it together, okay?

424
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,882
Hey. You.

425
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:22,883
JANG DUKJIN
(CURRENT CONGRESSMAN, KNPU CLASS 16)

426
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,800
Yes?

427
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,845
You're close to Secretary Hong
at the Office of Civil Affairs, right?

428
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:31,183
You once worked with him
in the Blue House.

429
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,517
Right. I did.

430
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,853
-Arrange a dinner together.
-Well...

431
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,774
(chuckles awkwardly)
Well, it may seem suspicious, so...

432
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:43,070
-Goodness. Hey, take his badge away.
-Yes, sir.

433
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,529
(exclaiming)

434
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:48,075
Come on. Don't be like that.
(chuckles)

435
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,243
Let me fill your glass.

436
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,205
Don't forget,

437
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:57,125
you got that badge
all thanks to our alumni's hard work.

438
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,586
-Okay. I won't.
-(cup clinks)

439
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,254
Salute!

440
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,006
(cups clinking)

441
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,092
Why aren't you drinking?

442
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,302
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

443
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,471
I'm meeting the Commissioner.

444
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,306
Staying dry
since you're still on the force?

445
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,308
-That's not it.
-Hey, Giyong.

446
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:18,772
Soon, you'll be the one leading this club.

447
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,151
You should be the leader,
so don't act like a guest.

448
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,486
Sorry, sir.

449
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,908
He's my junior,
but he's so unfriendly to me.

450
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,744
Well, that's just how he is.
He's always cold.

451
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,498
He's very loyal to the agency, though.

452
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,877
Being loyal to this group
is being loyal to the agency.

453
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,630
All right. Now, raise your glasses.

454
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,091
(chairs scrape)

455
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:51,471
Those, who pass through here,
are trusted...

456
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,557
ALL: By the country!

457
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,516
(glass clinks)

458
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,687
(all exclaiming)

459
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,691
(beeps)

460
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,402
-MALE RESTAURANT OWNER: Here you go.
-Thank you.

461
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,778
MALE RESTAURANT OWNER: Thank you.

462
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,363
(indistinct chattering)

463
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,115
(Inmyeon laughing)

464
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,242
It's like you're the president
of this club.

465
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,454
You show up
every time I try to pay the bill.

466
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,999
Well, I didn't want to ruin
the long-awaited KNPU reunion.

467
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,042
Come on. Don't be like that.

468
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,919
-We're family.
-(chuckles)

469
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,004
Right?

470
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,338
You disappointed me, Mr. Jo.

471
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,466
I promise to join you next time.

472
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,633
(all laughing)

473
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,051
It's a promise.

474
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,428
(laughing)

475
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,346
Hello, Commissioner Wi.

476
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,267
(exclaims)
Now that Mr. Jo is here,

477
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,811
why don't we go to somewhere nice
for another round?

478
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,813
I'll get going now, sir.

479
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,024
Oh, will you?

480
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:48,111
All right. We will meet another time then.

481
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,490
I'll see you guys
at the next get-together then.

482
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,450
(Inmyeon laughing)

483
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,702
-Good night, sir.
-(coughs)

484
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,039
Oh, well. Who's gone is gone.

485
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,082
Let's go have another round.

486
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,627
-(laughing)
-I know a good place. Follow me.

487
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,794
That sounds great.

488
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,755
(club members laughing)

489
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,508
(indistinct chattering)

490
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,718
-MYUNGHOON: Seunghyun.
-Yes?

491
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,054
MYUNGHOON: You know
we went to the same high school, right?

492
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:14,971
Yes, I do.

493
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,475
Now, I want your honest answer. Okay?

494
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,353
Who do you like better? Insik?

495
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,231
Or me, who you spent
such a long time with?

496
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,899
-(Myunghoon clears throat)
-(glass thuds)

497
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,235
(upbeat music playing)

498
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,986
This is like

499
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:35,283
asking which of my parents I like better.
I don't know what to say.

500
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,661
Why can't you just say it's Mom?

501
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,206
You see, seniors are supposed
to love and care

502
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,457
about their juniors. I know that.

503
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,960
Are you saying I wasn't like that to you?
Then I'm sorry!

504
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,004
If I have to choose one, I guess it's Mom.

505
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,258
(Myunghoon giggling)

506
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,384
(shushes)

507
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,928
I was a little upset today.

508
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,388
And I'm sure you were upset too.

509
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,975
Today, we will drink
all those grudges away. Okay?

510
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,685
-The drinks are on you then.
-Okay!

511
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,019
-Sounds good.
-Drink up!

512
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,312
-All right.
-Okay!

513
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,231
MYUNGHOON: Drink it in one go. Keep going.

514
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,983
(chuckles)
Bottoms up.

515
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,193
(sips)

516
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,445
(light music playing)

517
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,156
(glass clinks)

518
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,496
SEUNGHYUN: You're still there, right?

519
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,499
I'm leaving soon.
So please wait a little longer.

520
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,458
I'm sorry.

521
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,460
MYUNGHOON: Hey!

522
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,588
-Yes?
-To be honest,

523
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,756
when I was a freshman,

524
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,841
I couldn't even

525
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,636
look at Hyuk's eyes. Right? Agreed?

526
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,346
-WOOYONG: Agreed.
-Of course.

527
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,098
You freshmen...

528
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:44,102
(stammering)
...should know how lucky you are. Okay?

529
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,565
You see, now that we don't
really discipline the freshmen,

530
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,193
I feel like the bond between us is gone.

531
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,237
-Tell me about it.
-Right?

532
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,823
This is why we need to
discipline our juniors.

533
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,491
MYUNGHOON: Tell me about it.

534
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:02,454
It really upsets me, Seunghyun.
(yelps)

535
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,581
I'm sorry, sir.

536
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,625
Let me fill your glass.

537
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,668
(quirky music)

538
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,796
(exclaiming)

539
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,797
That's a lot.

540
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,466
Drink up.

541
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:21,348
Honestly, we couldn't even
look at Hyuk's eyes. Okay?

542
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,641
MYUNGHOON: Right? Agreed?

543
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,558
Of course.

544
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,268
You know, you freshmen...

545
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,771
INSIK: You should know how lucky you are.

546
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,982
But really, now that we don't really
discipline the freshmen,

547
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,943
(munching)
I feel like the bond

548
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,945
between us is gone.

549
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,822
-MYUNGHOON: Tell me about it.
-INSIK: We need discipline.

550
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,408
I'm so upset. Seunghyun!

551
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,161
-Yes?
-You're so cool. Let me fill your glass.

552
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,165
Myunghoon, you seem pretty drunk.

553
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,750
Me? Not at all.

554
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,920
(in English, Korean) Water. This is water.
(chuckles)

555
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,756
INSIK: Hey, you're drunk. How about this?

556
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,550
Let's go when we finish this.

557
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,848
Honestly, when I was a freshman,

558
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,102
I couldn't even look at Hyuk's eyes.

559
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,021
Gosh! You freshmen
should know how lucky you are.

560
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,232
-You were born at a great time.
-INSIK: Tell me about it.

561
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,859
Honestly, now we don't
discipline the freshmen...

562
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,612
-We need discipline! We do!
-MYUNGHOON: How many times did I tell you?

563
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,322
-WOOYONG: Discipline!
-MYUNGHOON: What do you say?

564
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,865
-We need it!
-MYUNGHOON: Don't you agree?

565
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,076
-Hey, Seunghyun. Thanks.
-I'll get going then.

566
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,578
-Okay. Good night then.
-Hey. That's not important.

567
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,123
-You're drunk.
-This is the heaviest.

568
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,082
(groans)

569
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,583
-Heaviest...
-Let's go.

570
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,879
-MYUNGHOON: Seunghyun!
-Have a good night!

571
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,757
Salute.

572
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,719
(blows raspberry)

573
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,804
(groans)

574
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,894
(light music playing)

575
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,655
EUNKANG: It's getting late,
so I'll go home.

576
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,700
We're practicing driving tomorrow,
so don't drink too much.

577
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,744
Right. Here's my address.

578
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,163
(sighs)

579
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,334
(thuds)

580
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,961
-(clatters)
-(flame whooshes)

581
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,714
Hey. You said you'd have dinner outside.

582
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,424
I wasn't able to.

583
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,925
-(clatters)
-Hmm.

584
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,427
We don't have any noodles?

585
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,971
We don't?
If it isn't in there, we don't have any.

586
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,139
-Mm.
-(clatters)

587
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,850
-I can make you some noodle soup.
-What? No, I'm good.

588
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,686
I can just go to the convenience store.

589
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,271
Go to bed. I'll go grab something there.

590
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,355
Okay, then.

591
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,025
(dogs barking in distance)

592
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,820
-(beeps)
-(crickets creaking)

593
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,573
-(sighs)
-SEUNGHYUN: I'm here...

594
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,954
Jeez, what's this guy doing here?

595
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,253
-Gosh...
-(Seunghyun mumbles)

596
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,215
(Seunghyun mumbling)

597
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,259
(emotive music)

598
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:04,886
Huh?

599
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,978
Hey! Seunghyun!

600
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,441
-Hey! It's Eunkang.
-What are you doing here?

601
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,820
(in sing-song) Tteokbokki.

602
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,613
(rustling)

603
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,406
(chuckles)

604
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,659
You came all the way here to give me this?

605
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,244
You said you wanted some.

606
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,957
Hey. Can you stand up? Wake up.

607
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,667
Stand up, Seunghyun.

608
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,962
(emotive music continues)

609
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,299
(crickets creaking)

610
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,096

(emotive music)

(plastic rustles)

614
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,331
Seunghyun. I'm done eating. Wake up.

615
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,375
(mumbling)

616
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,418
You should go home.

617
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,961
(groans)

618
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,341

(exhales sharply)

630
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,782
I don't know. I'm sleepy too.

631
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,951
I'm so sleepy.

632
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,703
(sighs)

633
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,625

(sighs)

635
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,552
You know what? You took the blanket,

636
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,763
so it's only fair that I take the pillow.

637
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,227

(birds chirping)

641
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,547
Hey! Seunghyun!

642
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,548
It's Eunkang.

643
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,466
-(in sing-song) Tteokbokki.
-(chuckles)

644
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,552
EUNKANG: Hey.

(exhales sharply)

646
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,186
(birds chirping)

647
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,715
Where is it?

648
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,344
(groans)

649
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,764
You're awake.

650
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,265
What?

651
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,767
SEUNGHYUN: Yes.

652
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,643
(Eunkang groans)

653
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,563
I was curled up the whole night,
my body aches.

654
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,482
Sorry.

655
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,525
So you remember what happened?

656
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,530
Well, let's talk about it later.

657
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,033
You should go before my family wakes up.

658
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,327
If they see you,
things will get complicated.

659
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,248
HIUSUK: Eunkang! Are you awake?

660
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,751
(tense music)

661
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,169
What do we do?

662
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,337
(sizzling)

663
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:52,882
(doorknob clicks)

664
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,926
(door creaks open)

665
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,513
(crockery clanging)

666
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,021
(door creaks open)

667
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,649
-MIKANG: Mom, we're out of conditioner.
-HIUSUK: What? Okay.

668
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,900
-Mikang.
-Yes?

669
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,027
-One second.
-MIKANG: What are you doing?

670
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,571
-EUNKANG: There's something here.
-MIKANG: What is it?

671
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,491
-EUNKANG: Here.
-MIKANG: What?

672
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,659
What is it?

673
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,744
EUNKANG: There's something.
Really. There's something here.

674
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,746
-MIKANG: What are you doing?
-EUNKANG: Here...

675
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,998
MIKANG: What? What is it?

676
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,459
I must have seen it wrong.

677
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,211
Sorry.

678
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,384
(whimsical music)

679
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,307
Who are you?

680
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:44,892
Hello.

681
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,521
(crockery clanging)

682
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,533
Come on. Eat up.

683
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,577
Yes, ma'am.

684
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,830
(slurps)

685
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,582
(munches)

686
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,625
So you're

687
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,420
-Eunkang's classmate?
-Yes.

688
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,046
He's one year older than her.

689
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,548
We've met before, right?

690
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,758
-Yes.
-How?

691
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,427
He's my ex's friend.

692
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:23,931
He's going to
help me practice driving today.

693
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,392
You know, I need to get
a driver's license to graduate.

694
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,353
EUNKANG: And apparently,
he already got one in high school.

695
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,646
So I asked him to help me.

696
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,399
-I can save money this way.
-So...

697
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,444
-he came this morning?
-Yes.

698
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,113
But he smells like alcohol.
Is he going to drive drunk?

699
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,990
(grunts)

700
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,533
-What are you talking about?
-(groaning)

701
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,244
(whimsical music)

702
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,537
Seunghyun.

703
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,624
Where's your other sock?

704
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,751
(whimsical music continues)

705
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,795
(chuckles)

706
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:02,511
Is it in Eunkang's room?
Do you want me to go look for it?

707
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,805
Gosh! Please!

708
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,102
(whimsical music)

709
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,896
(sighs)

710
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,816
Fine! He did sleep here.
He slept in my room last night. Happy?

711
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,152
Not together though. I slept on the bed
and Eunkang slept on the floor.

712
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,737
Why did my daughter sleep on the floor?

713
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,074
Well, I couldn't move him.
He was so drunk.

714
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,453
He came here so late,
and I didn't know where he lived,

715
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,289
so I just brought him in
and let him sleep here.

716
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,958
(sighs)
My gosh.

717
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,542
(chuckles awkwardly)

718
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,629
Call me old-fashioned,

719
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,214
but even if you're just classmates,

720
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,216
a man and woman
shouldn't sleep in the same room.

721
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,677
What you did was not right.

722
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,178
But nothing happened...

723
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,388
Then why was he sneaking out?

724
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,848
If he didn't do anything wrong,
he should have greeted us.

725
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,725
-He's right.
-I'm sorry.

726
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,396
Dad, you don't need to worry.
They almost hate each other.

727
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,024
Eunkang once even called him a bastard.

728
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,944
And Seunghyun also said to her
that if he ever sees her again

729
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,320
he'd kill her.

730
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,405
Well, that's...

731
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,699
That was all because of you.

732
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,535
Was it?

733
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,955
Anyway, they'll never ever
date each other.

734
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,332
MIKANG: Right?
(chuckles)

735
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,876
HUISUK: You never know.
Anything can happen.

736
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,381
You see, your dad and I
used to be sworn enemies.

737
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,674
(clears throat)

738
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:26,053
He was the volleyball coach
when I was in high school.

739
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,640
He was such a nagger,
and he had such a bad temper too.

740
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,058
He would cuss all the time.

741
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,020
HUISUK: Gosh, he was so horrible.

742
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,480
In the end, I quit volleyball
because I hated him so much.

743
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,234
Gosh, your mom is just being shy.
(chuckling)

744
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,613
If you hated me so much,
why did you do that on graduation day?

745
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,782
-(chuckling)
-What did I do?

746
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,743
Don't you remember what you did to my car?

747
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,038
(quirky music)

748
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,372
-You knew it was me?
-Of course.

749
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,666
You're the only one
who would do something like that.

750
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,502
Your mom put a rose...
(laughing)

751
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:03,257
...on the hood of my car with a card.

752
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,508
YANGCHUL: So I read the card.

753
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:09,013
"Coach Ko, I will never forget you.
I love you."

754
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,599
(chuckling)
"From H."

755
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,309
And there was a heart next to it.

756
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,977
She was practically proposing to me!

757
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,229
And it made me weak.

758
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,564
Gosh. Seriously.

759
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,150
If she hadn't done that,
you wouldn't even exist right now.

760
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,194
-Okay? Geez.
-HUISUK: Wait.

761
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,613
-(Yangchul clears throat, chuckles)
-HUISUK: What do you mean?

762
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,531
What do you mean, a rose and a card?

763
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,159
(whimsical music)

764
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,827
(gasps)

765
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,208
I thought you put them.

766
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,584
HUISUK: Why would I do that?

767
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:42,630
I hated you so much
I even scratched your car!

768
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,215
(gasps)

769
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,845
It was you.
You're the one who scratched my car.

770
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:55,726
That was... my first car!

771
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:00,398
HUISUK: I know! I scratched it
because it was your precious first car!

772
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,649
Gosh!

773
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,984
(exhales sharply)

774
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,444
(blows air)

775
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,196
-Hey, you.
-Yes?

776
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,864
-You better leave.
-Pardon?

777
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:12,993
We're about to find out
what happened 25 years ago.

778
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,413
So anyone who is not our family
must leave now.

779
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,749
Yes, that sounds fair.

780
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,377
We'll go now. Good luck with the fight.

781
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,461
Thanks.

782
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:24,797
EUNKANG: Good luck.

783
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,675
-Goodbye.
-You can do it.

784
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,634
Keep it up.

785
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,013
So what about the rose and card?
Explain that first.

786
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,390
That's not the problem.

787
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,269
I hope you understand.
Still, we managed to escape.

788
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,229
I bet they don't like me.

789
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,313
(laughs)

790
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,358
No way. This is actually
the best thing about my family.

791
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,486
-They're so forgiving.
-It didn't seem so. At least Mikang isn't.

792
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,113
Ahh...

793
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,115
Right.

794
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,119
The bus is here.

795
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,164
Get home safely.

796
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,207
-Rest up. See you tomorrow.
-SEUNGHYUN: Okay.

797
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:02,835
Seunghyun.

798
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,463
Thanks for the tteokbokki.
(chuckles)

799
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,132
(uplifting music)

800
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,972
(bus hissing)

801
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,311
(engine revs)

802
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,067
CHEONGU STATION

803
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,572
JUYOUNG: Hey. Hurry up, will you?

804
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,283
I am coming.

805
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,701
Could you smile a bit?

806
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,620
Don't be so cranky.

807
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:39,872
ALL: What?

808
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,582
We don't work today.

809
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,417
Don't you know
about the five-day workweek?

810
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,045
All staff went home this afternoon.

811
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,964
I mean, look. It's all closed.

812
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,299
(sighs)

813
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,218
NO ENTRY

814
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,261
JUYOUNG: What do we do now?

815
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,597
What else do we do?

816
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,599
We should come back on a weekday.

817
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,477
JUYOUNG: But we came all the way here.
No way.

818
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,603
Gosh.

819
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,606
-The code.
-What?

820
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,565
(tense music)

821
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,235
I heard every convenience store
has a store code.

822
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,655
If the invoice has the code on it,
we can find out which store it is.

823
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,866
(tense music continues)

824
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,787
-DAEIL: But the invoice doesn't...
-JUYOUNG: Hey!

825
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,080
Isn't this it?

826
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,623
STORE CODE: 12902300453

827
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,584
Let's call the head office
of this convenience chain.

828
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,671
They'll tell us
which store's code this is.

829
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,507
-Gosh. I got goosebumps.
-Wait.

830
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,594
-(phone beeps)
-(phone line ringing)

831
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,556
Hello?

832
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,474
FEMALE OPERATOR (on phone):
We're sorry to inform you

833
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,101
that our offices are currently closed.

834
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,895
Our regular business hours
are weekdays from 10 a.m. to...

835
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,063
(phone beeps)

836
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,818
I guess we have only one option now.

837
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,153
Let's go.

838
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,366
-Go where?
-All the Hi Convenience Stores in Cheongu.

839
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,744
We barely just started.
And we can't give up here.

840
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,954
What has gotten into him?

841
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,666
You know, you sometimes get
all excited about totally random things.

842
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,043
I mean, this store has so many branches.

843
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,879
What's the three principles
of criminal investigation?

844
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,591
Blood, sweat, and tears?

845
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,175
That's right.

846
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,636
Let's run around
until our feet get all sweaty.

847
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,599
I'm with you. If I get a new console,
you'll be the first to play.

848
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,809
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

849
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,562
Wait up.

850
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,775
NAMGI: You've been wondering

851
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,737
why I was sent to the countryside

852
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,948
when I was
a successful detective in Seoul.

853
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,284
It's because the police are corrupt.

854
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,496
And KNPU is the main cause.

855
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,751
Frontline officers like me
do all the hard work

856
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:52,212
just so that the higher-ups
can get promotions.

857
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,381
Then when they're caught,
they turn a blind eye to it.

858
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,717
Do you know what happened

859
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,178
-ten years ago?
-No.

860
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,220
(dramatic music)

861
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,597
And I don't want to hear it.

862
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,475
You can tell me how unfair everything is,

863
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,477
but I can't help you anymore.

864
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,774
After all, I'm also a student
of the school you hate so much.

865
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,612
You've changed a lot.

866
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,115
I had no idea
you had this ambition to succeed

867
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:24,203
-using the fancy KNPU connection you have.
-Mr. Kang. Don't judge me.

868
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,163
I don't even know myself
what I will become.

869
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,669
The reason I helped you
was because I owed you.

870
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,839
You were the only grown-up
who cared about me.

871
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,258
(sighs)

872
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,802
But I can't help you anymore.

873
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,429
Thank you for everything.

874
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,809
(dramatic music continues)

875
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,320
(wind chimes tinkle)

876
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,406
(foreboding music)

877
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,122
UGON: I thought I could do some reading
here on the weekend.

878
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,166
Then I heard a familiar voice. May I sit?

879
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,461
(chair thuds, scrapes)

880
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,589
This café is so quiet,

881
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,883
I couldn't help but overhear you.

882
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,554
I thought you said
you didn't know Ms. Gi Hanna.

883
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,474
Well, I'm not obligated to tell you
all about my relationship with others.

884
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,726
Right.

885
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,019
But as a teacher,
it is my duty to protect my students

886
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,981
from anyone who harasses them.

887
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,609
I won't let you do this.

888
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,694
Interesting.

889
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,407
You said before
that you'd protect your students.

890
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:47,202
But the question is,
can you really protect others?

891
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,123
You ran away when Hyunsoo died in vain.

892
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,542
NAMGI: How do you intend
on protecting them now?

893
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,919
(dramatic music)

894
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,297
You're right.

895
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,965
I was a coward then.

896
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,091
(breathes deeply)

897
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,926
And I'm regretting it.

898
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,597
So I don't want to make that same mistake.

899
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,098
Whatever.

900
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,937
You're not so different
from Commissioner Wi.

901
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,941
You were going to use her
for your own motives and abandon her.

902
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:19,902
What?

903
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,447
You don't know even one-tenth
of what Commissioner Wi did.

904
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,366
-What do you mean?
-Why don't you go ask him yourself?

905
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,744
Ask him what he sold off
to join Sinyu Club.

906
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,912
Sinyu Club?

907
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,371
(inhales)

908
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,707
Is that the reason...

909
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:38,212
you used a student to try to abolish KNPU?

910
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,512
Even if KNPU gets abolished,
Sinyu Club won't be disbanded.

911
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,973
The club will always exist in the police

912
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,935
in different forms, under different names.

913
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,187
Looks like being in the school
made you a dogmatist.

914
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,647
(sucks lips)

915
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,483
(dramatic music)

916
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,402
You'll see.

917
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,531
The ones who'll disband Sinyu Club

918
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,908
won't be you or me,

919
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,702
but those kids.

920
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,418
(dramatic music rises)

921
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,423
(music fades)

922
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,052
Hey, if you have a criminal history
on your school record,

923
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,595
you won't be able to go to a good college.

924
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,515
It was reckless of you. Go home now.

925
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,143
NAMGI: Stop cutting class
and focus on your studies.

926
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,272

927
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,440

930
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,574
Hello, sir.

931
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,243
-Are you going to school now?
-Yes.

932
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,037
-I was just taking some fresh air.
-I'm on my way to school too.

933
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,624
-I can give you a ride.
-No, sir. It's okay. I'd like to walk.

934
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,918
-Okay, then.
-Thank you.

935
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:01,795
UGON: Hanna.

936
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,338
Remember?

937
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,508
You can't fix what's already happened,

938
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,886
but what you do in the future
is up to you.

939
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:12,222
-Yes, sir.
-Good. Don't get lost

940
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,515
and see you at school.

941
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,475
Thank you, sir.

942
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,814

STORE CLERK: Store code?

945
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,157
All convenience stores have store codes.

946
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,410
Could you tell me what yours is?
I need that code... Whoa!

947
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,579

That was a hell of a lot of work.

Hey. We checked
like 50 stores today, right?

Mm-mm.

00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,345
Just 47.

968
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,642
We only have 73 to check tomorrow.

969
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,145
(laughing)

970
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,022
Hey.

971
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,233
Am I the only one feeling like...

972
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,821
we're working more
than we should because we're stupid?

973
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,407
But there's no other way.

974
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,617
It might not be the smartest way,
but it's the best way.

975
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,535
(dramatic music)

976
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,703
(sighs)

977
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,997
That damn blood, sweat, and tears...

978
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,999
It's making me tear up.

979
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,751
(sighs)
Let's go.

980
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,381
We've got to go to bed early
so we can wake up early.

981
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,299
(chuckling)

982
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,968
(sighs)

983
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,303
SOOKJA: Seunghyun.

984
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,016
I'm going to the temple today.
Could you drive me...

985
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,310
Are you going somewhere?

986
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,979
Yes. I'm meeting a friend.

987
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:25,731
Is that so?

988
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,694
-Who's the friend?
-A friend from school.

989
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,946
We're going to practice driving.

990
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,947
Is it a girl?

991
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,574
Yes, she's a classmate.

992
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,409
Mm...

993
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:42,164
(gasps)
Hey. Were you with that friend yesterday

994
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,790
-and not at school?
-What?

995
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,917
-Were you?
-No.

996
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,627
I've got to go. I'm late.

997
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,588
Wait. I want to talk to you.

998
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,006
Hey. Let's talk...

999
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,716
(gasps)

1000
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,968
There's something fishy going on.

1001
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,179
(Eunkang sighs)

1002
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,640
-Did you tell her?
-If I did, I wouldn't be here right now.

1003
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,226
Because my mom would have asked me
so many questions.

1004
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,062
Good.

1005
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,897
We should be really careful now.

1006
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,982
Don't even tell Tak about this.

1007
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,818
He is good at keeping secrets.

1008
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,905
He might be able to keep a secret,
but it shows on his face.

1009
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,908
-He can't hide his feelings.
-Okay. I'll be careful.

1010
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,076
(smack lips)

1011
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,746
By the way, you're qualified
to teach me driving, right?

1012
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,207
I got my driver's license
when I was a high school senior,

1013
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,666
which was two years ago.

1014
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,836
All right. Now, shall we?

1015
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,296
(engine rumbles)

1016
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,924
Wait, what's wrong with this?

1017
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,467
(engine rumbles)

1018
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,844
Relax and try again slowly.

1019
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:38,845
(chuckles)

1020
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,264
I've never driven
on the actual road, so... Hold on.

1021
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,724
-It's okay. Take your time.
-Okay.

1022
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,893
-Oh, it worked.
-Good.

1023
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:46,603
Excellent.

1024
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,813
(engine rumbling)

1025
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,439
That's right.

1026
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,274
-Slowly.
-Here we go.

1027
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,318
-(Eunkang yelps)
-Very good, Ms. Ko.

SENGHYUN: Slowly.

1030
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:00,826
HI CONVENIENCE STORE

1031
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,417
Can you believe how unlucky we are?
(munching)

1032
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,462
Maybe we'll end up
checking all 120 branches.

1033
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,588
I know.

1034
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,342
We should be really close though.
We have to find it today.

1035
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,760
Oh, well.

1036
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,930
-Let's ask for backup.
-What?

1037
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,143
We can ask the guys
who are at school this weekend.

1038
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,229
What's Ari doing?

1039
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,566
This is the Tower of Justice,
the symbol of our school.

1040
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,694
It was donated by the first graduates.

1041
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,947
As you can see, it's a scale
with a pillar that looks like a pen.

1042
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,617
It means we will make justice by learning.

1043
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,536
Now, I'll give you some time
to take photos here.

1044
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,829
(students clamoring)

1045
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:46,788
Let's take photos.

1046
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,709
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1047
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,669
Where are the KNPU princes?

1048
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,838
-Pardon?
-Are they not in school today?

1049
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,009
Ahh... it's the weekend, so I'm not sure.

1050
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,054
Does this guy have a girlfriend?

1051
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,266
-Does he?
-Or doesn't he?

1052
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,601
I think he does.

1053
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:08,518

1055
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,440
I told you!

1056
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:17,903
This is devastating. This is so annoying!

1057
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,613
ARI: Are you done taking photos?

1058
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,698
Now, let's move on
to the indoor shooting range.

1059
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,408
Follow me.

1060
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,160
(indistinct chattering)

1061
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:28,205
In the indoor shooting range,

1062
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:32,083
you'll get to try
the virtual shooting program yourself.

1063
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,461
(students clamoring)

1064
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,839
Hey! It's him!

1065
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,799
-Hey!
-It's him!

1066
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,260
(female students screaming)

1067
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,970
-Hi!
-Hello!

1068
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:45,639
-Hi!
-Hey!

1069
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,890
Hey!

1070
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,808
I saw you online.
You're such a great dancer.

1071
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,893
Hey!

1072
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,729
-Can we take a photo together?
-Girls, let's take a photo with him.

1073
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,064

1074
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,065

1075
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,358
Hey!

1076
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:57,984
Girls!

1077
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,362
Come back! That's not where we're going.

1078
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,197
Gosh!

1079
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,406
-Quick, the photo!

(engine rumbling)

1081
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,329
No. You have to make a wider turn.

1082
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,123
If you turn it so close,
you'll step on the line and lose a point.

1083
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,501
I'm doing it.

1084
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:19,923

(sighs)

1087
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,721
Why did it turn off again?

1088
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,265
(whimsical music)

1089
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,224

She's not picking up.

1093
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,612
Let's just get it over with ourselves.

1094
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,241

00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,051

Ah...

He comes often these days
to send packages.

Nice.

before we catch him.

00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,544
(engine revving)

1130
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:24,631
(vehicles honking)

1131
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,467
Seunghyun.

1132
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,886
(vehicles honking)

1133
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,805
Hey. Wake up.

1134
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,139
(car honking)

1135
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,602
(honking)

1136
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,021
Hey! You think you own this road or what?

1137
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:41,606
DRIVER: Hey!

1138
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,942
Learn how to drive, you idiot!

1139
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,152
How did you even get a license?

1140
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,366
-Where are we?
-I don't know.

1141
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,578
-Are we on the highway?
-I don't know. I just drove straight.

1142
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,872
(sighs)
You've really got no fear.

1143
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,542
Hey. Take that road.

1144
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,044
What if the power goes off again?

1145
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,963
It's okay. I'll help you.

1146
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,965
Slowly. Put your turn signal on.

1147
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,385
STUDENT DRIVER

1148
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:14,264
CHEONGU TERMINAL, CHEONGU

1149
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,766
(slurping)

1150
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,394
-BUMJU: Maybe he's not coming today.
-(slurps)

1151
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,980
Be patient. Crime scene rule number one,

1152
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,190
criminals always return
to the crime scene.

1153
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,986
Why isn't he coming, though?

1154
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,948
(engine revs)

1155
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:34,742
DAEIL: Hmm?

1156
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,579
(engine rumbling)

1157
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,122
(engine stops)

1158
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,082
(sighs)

1159
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,086
I get that you're frustrated,

1160
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:48,673
but I wouldn't be learning from you
if I was a good driver.

1161
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,800
I'm practicing because I'm not good.

1162
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,012
But you keep yelling at me like that...

1163
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,725
I can't do anything then.

1164
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,977
I can't do it anymore.

1165
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:04,939
I'm sorry.

1166
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,901
I thought I'd teach you properly
since it's your first time.

1167
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,153
(Eunkang sniffles)

1168
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,573
(somber music)

1169
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,782
Don't cry.

1170
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,119
Eunkang, I'm sorry.

1171
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,831
(somber music continues)

1172
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:24,918
I'm sorry.

1173
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,507
-Please don't be mad.
-Whatever.

1174
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,175
(sobs)

1175
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,302
I'm sorry.

1176
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,555
(somber music)

1177
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:41,809
(slurps)

1178
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,479
Gosh. Kids these days...

1179
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,232
I'm so jealous.

1180
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,360
(upbeat music)

1181
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,737
JUYOUNG: Hey, what are you doing?

1182
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,448
(sucks teeth)
That's practically criminal now.

1183
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:56,950
-(chuckles)
-Hold on.

1184
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:57,992
(exclaiming)

1185
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,245
JUYOUNG: Whoa. Hey.

1186
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,083
(slurps)

1187
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,751
Huh?

1188
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,129
(door closes)

1189
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:11,714
Hmm?

1190
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,842
She won't pick up the phone.
Did something happen to her?

1191
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,303
-I wonder if she found the fraudster.
-What?

1192
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,764
SEUNGHYUN: I talked to Daeil
on the phone yesterday,

1193
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:23,226
and he said he's going to Cheongu
to find the guy who scammed Juyoung.

1194
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,937
She asked Daeil and Bumju to go with her.

1195
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,438
He sounded so exhausted.
(chuckles)

1196
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:31,067
Ahh... I see. I should call her
after having lunch.

1197
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,530
Wait. We're in Cheongu now.

1198
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,574
Do you think we might run into them here?

1199
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,534
Come on. It's not like we're on a sitcom.

1200
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,286
Right?
(chuckles)

1201
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,787
-JUYOUNG: Eunkang.
-(gasps)

1202
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,711
(romantic music)
