00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,169
ROOKIE COPS

00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,090

00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,927
(suspenseful music)

7
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,768
(sighs)

8
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,561
If the camera was rolling,

9
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,730
there's got to be a charger somewhere.

10
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,191
Where did she put it?

11
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,283
-(cellphone beeps)
-(phone line ringing)

12
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,370
(breathes heavily)

13
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,331
It's got to be here somewhere.

14
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,462
(object clatters)

15
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,642
(suspenseful music continues)

00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,605
(door clanks)

17
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,819
(doorknob slowly creaking)

18
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,664
(door opens)

19
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,879
SAVE ENERGY

20
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,845
Hey. I forgot something.

21
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,806
Gosh, where is it?

22
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,280
(foreboding music)

23
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,077
(thrilling music)

24
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,057
(suspenseful music)

25
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,566
EUNKANG: Looking for this?

26
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,948
Could you explain what this is?

27
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,702
To me, it looks like a spy cam charger.
Why do you have this?

28
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,372
-Give it.
-You're the one who did it, right?

29
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,375
-Give it to me.
-Answer me. Did you film it?

30
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,628
Answer me! You filmed it, didn't you?

31
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,171
(screaming)
Get off me!

32
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,507
(yelps)
Let go!

33
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,967
(Eunkang screaming)

34
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,135
What are they doing?

35
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,098
(both panting)

36
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,850
-Give it!
-Let go!

37
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,560
I said let go of me!

38
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,729
(students clamoring)

39
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,110
We, Training Corps,
all agreed that she should be expelled.

40
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,695
What's the Student Council's opinion?

41
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,697
We're collecting opinions from each year.

42
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,616
It's going to take a while
because we're on break now.

43
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,827
Make sure to be careful
this doesn't get out.

44
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,788
(Insik sighing)

45
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,623
INSIK: Why do we have to have
a freshman like her?

46
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,458
I knew she'd be trouble

47
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,544
when she said,
"I wasn't dozing" to Sunyu.

48
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,755
I almost hit her when she said that.

49
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,007
-What does that mean?
-Never mind.

50
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,384
-(approaching rapid footsteps)
-(door opens)

51
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,094
(both panting)

52
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,930
-What's going on?
-The spy cam. I mean...

53
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,017
I found out whose spy cam it was.
(panting)

54
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,980
HANNA: No.

55
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,314
It wasn't me.

56
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,692
(dramatic music)

57
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,444
YUGON: Then why do you have this charger?

58
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,862
That's...

59
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,616
a phone charger.

60
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,119
You're not allowed to keep your phone
during the training period.

61
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,371
I apologize.

62
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,331
My mom is ill.

63
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,667
I'm her only family,

64
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,087
so I was keeping a phone
and a charger in case of an emergency.

65
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,382
(dramatic music)

66
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,098
NAME: GI HANNA
NOTE: SINGLE-PARENT FAMILY

67
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,644
(breathes heavily)

68
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,480
Would you excuse us?

69
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,065
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,321
(door opens)

71
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,448
(door closes)

72
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,033
Have a seat.

73
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,373
JUCHAN: Your mom called.

74
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,501
I called you back, but your phone was off,
so I thought you must be in training.

75
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,628
I know it's late, but congratulations.

76
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,755
Thanks.
(chuckles)

77
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,676
(sips)

78
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,472
It must have been tough.

79
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:54,062
It was. You have no idea how tough it was.

80
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,065
(grumbles)
Don't even get me started.

81
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,276
It's only been a few days,
but I feel like I got years older.

82
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,944
(slurps)

83
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,030
It's not a joke.

84
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,158
Why didn't you tell me
this place was like this?

85
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,078
They give us punishments all the time.

86
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,121
I feel like I'm in the army.

87
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,874
They even check
if we doze off or not during class.

88
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,461
-And they caught you dozing.
-No, I wasn't dozing.

89
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,254
She saw it wrong.

90
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,132
She always has her cap
pulled all the way down to her eyes,

91
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,968
squinting her eyes like this.
I'm sure she can't see anything right.

92
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,303
(gasps)

93
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,222
How did you know?

94
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,432
Did you hear it from that girl?

95
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,267
She's not "that girl". She's your senior.

96
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,268
(clears throat)

97
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,312
Anyway, you heard from her.

98
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:41,359
Man, that's so mean of her.
I had no idea she was like that.

99
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,653
She's a little strange.

100
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,821
Eunkang.

101
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,324
-She's not the person you think she is.
-What?

102
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,785
-I mean...
-Not anyone can be in the Training Corps.

103
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,038
They get special training for over
six months before Cheongram Education.

104
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,499
This is a final test to see if
the freshmen will survive four years here.

105
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,042
So take it seriously.

106
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,462
Okay.

107
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,173
And you should call me sir at school.

108
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,259
Okay.

109
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,345
(emotive music)

110
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,724
You don't need to be intimidated, though.

111
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,310
(both chuckle)

112
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,272
By the way, Juchan...

113
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,859
I mean, sir.

114
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:28,823
When you heard about the spy cam,
did you think I did it too?

115
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,200
Of course not.

116
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,077
I know you.

117
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,829
(uplifting music)

118
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,038
(laughs)

119
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,249
Let's go.

120
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,251
-You did great.
-Thanks.

121
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,175
JUCHAN: Be careful.

122
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,015
(Janitress laughing)

123
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,602
JANITRESS: Anyway, don't worry about it.

124
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,062
Just send me everything
you have left there.

125
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,192
My grandchildren are helping me,
so it won't take long.

126
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,861
Okay, bye.

127
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,112
(laughs)

128
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,739
(Janitress humming)

129
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,032
Hey! My goodness.

130
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,618
Fold it nicely.

131
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,412
The price of the defective ones
gets deducted from the wage.

132
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,956
-Okay.
-There you go, good.

133
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,960
But ma'am, we really were
going to pay for them...

134
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,004
later.

135
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,173
You saw the memo, right?

136
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,509
Oh, no. I didn't.

137
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,221
But how can I trust you?

138
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,640
JANITRESS: Anyway,

139
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,269
make sure to have them all pasted

140
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,480
by the time I come back. Okay?

141
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:46,692
Or I'll tell
the Training Corps everything.

142
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,110
Okay?

143
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,529
ALL: Yes, ma'am.

144
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,116
♪ I like ♪

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,786
♪ You ♪

146
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,828
(both sigh)

147
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,330
-JANITRESS: One, two.
-(door closes)

148
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,499
This is going to take forever.

149
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,752
(sighs)
We're not getting any sleep tonight.

150
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:05,920
Damn it!

151
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,381
Where did that bastard Seunghyun go?

152
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,799
(sighs)

153
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,554
What's taking her so long?

154
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,142
(footsteps approaching)

155
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,815
You're doing great. See you around.

156
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,983
EUNKANG: Bye.

157
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,195
(footsteps receding)

158
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,448
-SEUNGHYUN: Hey.
-(gasps)

159
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,367
-You scared me.
-What's with you?

160
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,161
-I heard you found who did it.
-How did you know?

161
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,414
You guys were brawling.
Everyone knows about it.

162
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,083
But how did you know
the charger was there?

163
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,712
Well, obviously,
it was right under my nose.

164
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,757
There was only one place to hide it.
So I searched our room first.

165
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,675
(laughs)

166
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,012
Anyway, you did
make a contribution to this.

167
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,305
I have to admit it.

168
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,350
But why would she do that?

169
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,561
I don't know.
They should figure it out soon.

170
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,146
HANNA: Pardon?

171
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,189
I said try charging it.

172
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,442
(suspenseful music)

173
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,693
Okay.

174
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,288
YUGON: It doesn't fit, right?

175
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,459
Because it's not a phone charger.

176
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,128
(suspenseful music continues)

177
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,388
(camera beeps)

178
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,019
Who gave it to you?

179
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,443
This is not something
students can easily get.

180
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,992
MAN: It's a Russian model. It was used
about seven to eight years ago.

181
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,079
We used to use it too, but not anymore.
Its battery life is too short.

182
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,206
Can anyone just buy this?

183
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,292
MAN: Not sure. It won't be impossible
to find one, but it won't be worth it.

184
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,627
Why? You need a spy cam?

185
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,670
No.

186
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,090
I just got curious
while preparing for a class.

187
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,299
(breathes deeply)

188
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,677
I know it was random.
KNPU colleagues are the best.

189
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,763
-Thanks, man.
-Yes. Why don't you thank me in person?

190
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,432
You've been cooped up in school
since you came back to Korea.

191
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,228
Sounds good. I'll call you.

192
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,271
(cellphone beeps)

193
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,319
Tell me. Who gave it to you?

194
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,239
(sighs)

195
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,699

00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,162
(tense suspenseful music)

198
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,081
YUGON: Unlock it.

199
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,375
-Pardon?
-Come on.

200
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,758
(keypad clacking, beeps)

201
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,222
It's an emergency phone,
so that must be your mother's number.

HANNA: My mom goes to bed early

211
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,717
because of the medication.

CHA YUGON

215
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,232
YUGON: At the disciplinary
committee tomorrow,

216
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,570
you'll have to explain it clearly
why you did this.

217
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,201
A spy cam?

218
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,704
NAMGI: It needs to be charged
every eight hours.

219
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,872
Here's the charger.

220

ADMINISTRATION OFFICE

221
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,004
And use this if you need to call me.

222
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,429
What if I get caught?
There are security cameras in the dorm.

223
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,223
There will be ceiling repairs tomorrow.

224
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,309
All the security cameras there
will be taken away. Don't worry.

225
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,811
I checked everything.

HANNA: But why do you...

230
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,476
I'll tell you why later.

231
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,479
Please do me this favor.

THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

234
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,333
BUMJU: So she was just playing innocent?

235
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,918
I had no idea she was like that.

236
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,880
I knew there was
something fishy about her.

237
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,425
She's got those slanted eyes,
and her eyebrows are always tense.

238
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,302
Which means she's an anxious person.

239
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,346
You see, physiognomy is science.

240
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,933
-Do you know physiognomy?
-Do you want me to read your face too?

241
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,103
Let me see.

242
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,900
-"Is this the face of a future king?"
-Stop it!

243
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,736
Stop chattering and focus on work.
We've got to finish this by today.

244
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,031
I'm sorry. We should keep it up.

245
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,908
Hurry up!

246
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,160
(smacks lips, sighs)

247
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,372
Hey, Seunghyun, put some saliva on it
so it's pasted nicely.

248
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,583
You're so sloppy, man.

249
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,877
Hey, Bumju. What is this?

250
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,171
-Do it again.
-What are you doing?

251
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,255
Me? Supervising.

252
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,841
Who told you to supervise?
Can't you see we need extra hands here?

253
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,176
Gosh, you...

254
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,261
You don't know anything.

255
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,432
Listen. When you do something as a group,

256
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,937
you need a conductor
to make the system work.

257
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,690
I'm checking what's slowing us down
and controlling the speed.

258
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,860
I'm also checking for quality.

259
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,946
Shut up.

260
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,658
-Then who should supervise...
-Just sit down.

261
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:56,914
(sighs)

262
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,210
Fine. Supervisors
work in the field too sometimes.

263
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,629
DAEIL: Let me help you out.

264
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:07,883
(Daeil sighs)

265
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,927
SEUNGHYUN: This is taking ages.

266
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,346
They're going to turn off the lights soon.

267
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,264
BUMJU: Right.

268
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,104
STUDENT DORMITORY

269
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,356
(door creaking)

270
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,694
INSIK: Check this one and...

271
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,904
(quirky music)

272
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,204
I'LL GO FIRST

273
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,790
DO YOU THINK IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT?

274
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,917
THEY JUST SWITCHED SO HE WON'T KNOW

275
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,420
OKAY. I'LL CATCH UP SOON

276
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,052
(quirky music continues)

277
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,604
I... I need to use the bathroom.

278
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,463
(door closes)

279
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,972
(whispers)
Eagle has arrived. Come in, Kite.

280
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:38,974
(lock clicks)

281
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,519
(sighs)

282
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,730
-What took you so long?
-They switched just now.

283
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,190
Didn't he find it suspicious?

284
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,692
My method acting is top-notch,
you know.

285
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:49,818
(chuckles)

286
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,989
Hurry. We did a lot.

287
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,741
Where's Tak?

288
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,285
Okay.

289
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,041
(quirky music)

290
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,759
(Daeil sighs)

291
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,678
Look at what we're doing
because of some noodles.

292
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,347
I'm going to be traumatized by noodles.

293
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,100
TAK: It's because you brought
too many at once.

294
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,060
You should have made it subtle.

295
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,604
What? Are you saying it's my fault?

296
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:26,897
(scoffs)

297
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,649
You are the one who ate the most.

298
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,150
Do you have amnesia or what?

299
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,111
We all ate it evenly.

300
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,612
(scoffs)
"Evenly"?

301
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,323
I saw you pick up a lot of noodles
at once. Have some manners.

302
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,450
TAK: Hey. Come on out. Come on!

303
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,077
Come on out!

304
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,038
SEUNGHYUN: Can we just get this done
and go to bed? I'm so sleepy.

305
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,706
(Seunghyun yawning)

306
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,335
Sorry. I shouldn't have told you guys
about the noodles.

307
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,463
Forget it. We all agreed to eat it.

308
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,173
(sighs)

309
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,592
This is not what I expected to do here.

310
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,846
(imitates radio noise)

311
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,472
(imitates radio noise)

312
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,394
Detective Lee Jaehan.

313
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,689
Do you guys do this too?

314
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,233
(dramatic music)

315
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,569
-(thunder rumbles)
-(rain pattering)

316
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,071
(thunder rumbling)

317
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,824
(dramatic music continues)

318
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,661
Is it the same over there?

319
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,790
(Daeil whimpering)
Is it... the same over there?

320
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,791
If you have money...

321
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,876
If you have money...

322
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,295
-...and connections...
-...and connections...

323
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:35,132
...can you have a good life
no matter how trashy you are?

324
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,842
(Daeil crying)

325
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,850
(shuddering)

326
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,275
But 20 years have passed.

327
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,944
Something's got to have changed.

328
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,779
Right?

329
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,240
(Daeil sobs)

330
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,659
No. No, it hasn't.

331
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,872
Detective

332
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,291
Lee Jaehan.

333
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,921
Can you...

334
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,506
hear me?

335
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,759
(thunder cracks, rumbles)

336
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,053
Did you just answer?

337
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,763
You really answered...

338
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,140
(whimpering)

339
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,392
(thunder cracks)

340
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,770
DAEIL: Detective Lee!

341
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,606
-TAK: Who on earth is Lee Jaehan?
-DAEIL: Obviously,

342
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,108
he's the reason why I'm here.

343
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,486
You know what?

344
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,072
If I become a cop
and get to work on old cold cases,

345
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,492
I believe I can work with him one day...

346
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,077
But that's a TV show.

347
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,536
-How can you meet him?
-(laughs)

348
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,622
Dude, you need an imagination.

349
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,500
Gosh, you weirdo. Stop it.

350
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,712
-It was just lightning.
-You guys aren't sentimental at all.

351
00:20:55,796 --> 00:21:00,133
How are you going to
communicate with the people?

352
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,427
Huh?

353
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,347
(groans)

354
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,266
DAEIL: What do I smell?

355
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,850
I smell something bad.

356
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,227
(Tak sighs)

357
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,521
(flashes)

358
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,232
Kim Tak!

359
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,359
-BUMJU: Darn it,
-DAEIL: It's you, right? Kim Tak!

360
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,362
DAEIL: Darn it, Kim Tak! Detective!

361
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,864
Kim Tak, you're so dead. Hey!

362
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,449
(groaning)

363
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,826
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

364
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,912
So you're saying
you wanted to let people know

365
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,580
that your roommate quitting was unfair.

366
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,958
-Am I right?
-Yes, ma'am.

367
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,086
One of my roommates dropped out
only three days after being punished.

368
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,006
HANNA: I thought it must not be repeated,

369
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,383
so I decided to disclose
what happened during Cheongram...

370
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,802
You should have talked to the school first

371
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,221
if you had problems
with the Training Corps.

372
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,098
HEESUN: Don't you think?

373
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,891
(dramatic music)

374
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,729
I couldn't voice my complaint
under the pressure.

375
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,732
If I had done that,
I would have been punished.

376
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,985
So you were going to
let it out to the public?

377
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,404
I just thought
I could use some external pressure.

378
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,116
I realize I was thoughtless,
but I hope you believe I meant well.

379
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,662
HEESUN: Police work
is done based on the law.

380
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:15,000
That means illegal actions
can't be excused by good intentions.

381
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,044
Aside from everything else,

382
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,422
how would you arrest spy cam criminals
when you become a cop

383
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,924
when you have done it yourself?

384
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,679
There's no need to discuss this further.
According to school regulations,

385
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,014
you are expelled.

386
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,726
You can raise an objection,
but it'll be a waste of time.

387
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,519
Because it won't change the outcome.

388
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,606
The disciplinary committee is now closed.

389
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,943
Can I raise my objections somewhere else?

390
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,196
(thrilling music)

391
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,324
Can I post on social media
or file a petition about the violence...

392
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,160
committed here?

393
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,790
(thrilling music continues)

394
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,126
If I'm not a student here,

395
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,879
there's no reason for me

396
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,757
to cover it up.

397
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,226
SOONYOUNG: This is not
about the spy cam anymore.

398
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,228
It's now about school violence.

399
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:22,484
I'll talk to the student again.

400
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,361
YUGON: She didn't seem easy to deal with.

401
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,155
Even a mouse can bite a cat
when it's cornered.

402
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,909
And that girl was about to bite you.

403
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,328
-Professor Cha.
-YUGON: I'm sorry if it offends you.

404
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,164
I was just trying to say
we cannot solve this problem

405
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,041
by coaxing the girl.

406
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,627
SOONYOUNG: What's your opinion,
Professor Cha?

407
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,462
Do you think
we should cancel the expulsion?

408
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,423
If that's necessary, yes.

409
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,551
(breathes deeply)
This was going to happen eventually.

410
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,679
We're training these kids
the same way that I was trained.

411
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,305
Of course they'd oppose it.

412
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,598
In these circumstances,

413
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,893
we may as well reform
Cheongram Education radically.

414
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,103
Professor Cha!

415
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,689
Besides, the Training Corps'
verbal abuse and punishments

416
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,941
will be a bigger problem in the future.

417
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,609
Punishment is a part of education.

418
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,403
Those things are done for a reason.

419
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,655
These kids that you're talking about
don't know anything

420
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,158
about patience,
the spirit of self-sacrifice, and unity.

421
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:15,871
Those spoiled kids won't listen
if we're soft-spoken and nice to them.

422
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,999
They will. They're not kids.
They're over 20. They're adults.

423
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,917
This school has its traditions.

424
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,628
Everything here is done our way.

425
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,754
Tradition?

426
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,089
Tell me. What exactly is that?

427
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,845
Why on earth do you always...

428
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,139
fight in my office?

429
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,350
Does this place get your chatterbox going?
Does it make you feel more combatant?

430
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,393
I apologize.

431
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,561
I apologize.

432
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,022
I understand
what you're saying, Professor Cha,

433
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,441
and I understand what you're saying too,
Professor Bang.

434
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,068
This time, let's do
what Professor Cha says.

435
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,612
Ma'am.

436
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,323
CONTROVERSY OVER
THE ABOLITION OF KNPU ARISES

437
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,866
Apparently, the majority of

438
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,993
last year's law school freshmen
were KNPU graduates.

439
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,664
People are upset that their tax dollars
are spent making lawyers instead of cops.

440
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,000
They say it's technically stealing.

441
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,836
The public is not on our side.

442
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,381
So let's not make a big deal out of it.

443
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,716
(door opens)

444
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,137
I'm sorry.

445
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,681
I wish I could say anything
to make you feel better.

446
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:19,768
(clears throat)

447
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,022
Are you going to keep ignoring me?

448
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,315
(clicks tongue)

449
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:29,569
Well, I know you were just scared.
And since you're apologizing,

450
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,280
I'll be a bigger person
and accept your apology.

451
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,158
Although, this doesn't mean
I'm not upset anymore.

452
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,118
(whimpers)

453
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,537
Okay!

454
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,122
I promise I'll be better.

455
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,543
Ew. Say that to your boyfriend.

456
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,963
-Come on. Don't be like that.
-Gosh, what are you doing?

457
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,215
-Let go.
-Hey, they announced the punishment.

458
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,133
(students clamoring)

459
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,135
ANNOUNCEMENT

460
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,429
SUBJECT: FRESHMAN GI HANNA
DISCIPLINARY MEASURE: 3 MONTHS' PROBATION

461
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,430
ARI: Probation?

462
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,140
That's nonsense.

463
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,268
Probation isn't a light punishment either.

464
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,478
She can't leave the school
for three months.

465
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,731
But this is just not right. It's not fair.

466
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,275
Eunkang was almost expelled.

467
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,944
That leaves a bad taste in my mouth too.

468
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,654
ARI: Does she have connections here?

469
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,907
(clears throat)

470
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,121
JUYOUNG: Hey. What's up?

471
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,540
-Water.
-Oh, water. Sure.

472
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,626
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, nothing.

473
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,753
What did you do?

474
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,132
(sighs)

475
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,049
Fine.

476
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,512
I don't know what you did,
but you owe me an apology.

477
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,306
You haven't apologized to me yet.

478
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,683
Apologize for what?

479
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,935
Oh, you mean
for the spy cam from your jacket?

480
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,187
I didn't do it.

481
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,648
You must have taken my jacket by mistake.

482
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,321
So you don't have to apologize to me?

483
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,617
Don't you know your spy cam
almost got me expelled?

484
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,953
Is it so upsetting?

485
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,497
-What?
-You didn't even get accepted at first.

486
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,042
You got in by luck.
There's nothing to be upset about.

487
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,836
If you have a problem with
my punishment, talk to the school,

488
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,463
not to me.

489
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:13,882
(paper riffles)

490
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,799
(gasps)

491
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:15,925
(scoffs)

492
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,766
Do you wish your colleague to be expelled?

493
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,726
That's not what I'm saying, sir.
I just wonder...

494
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,935
HYUK: If not,

495
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,480
stop making trouble.

496
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,440
This is an orientation period.

497
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,317
So stop distracting other students.

498
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,277
Has it ever occurred to you
that your attitude

499
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,613
is distracting other students
from learning?

500
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,659
-But...
-If you have nothing else, leave.

501
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,539
That's cowardly.

502
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,253
It's unfair you're implying
that I want my colleague to be expelled.

503
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,380
I just wanted to know

504
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,883
why she only got probation
when I was almost expelled.

505
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,803
I wanted to know
what changed the principle.

506
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,640
(dramatic music)

507
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,434
(door closes)

508
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,777
I think we need to explain to her
about the punishment on Ms. Gi.

509
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,279
She's just a freshman.
We don't need to explain everything.

510
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,157
All we need to do is
follow the school's instructions.

511
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,327
(paper riffles)

512
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,163
No way.

513
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,374
-I heard they weren't even close.
-Really?

514
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,376
That's so scary.

515
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,295
(students whispering indistinctly)

516
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,844
(indistinct chattering)

517
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,596
(dramatic music continues)

518
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,899
(indistinct chatter)

519
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,871
There's been so much going on lately.
The training's tough, right?

520
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,748
I apologize for the disorder.

521
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,416
It's all my fault.

522
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,667
No, it's okay.

523
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,503
I didn't call you in to blame you.

524
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,757
About the punishment on Ms. Gi.

525
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,759
That was the best decision
our school could make.

526
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,261
What she did was wrong, of course,

527
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,306
but the Training Corps
was also partially at fault.

528
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,559
If the kids who quit file complaints
regarding the punishments,

529
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,144
the school will get in bigger trouble.

530
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,522
We needed to consider
all those circumstances.

531
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,899
So I hope you understand.

532
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:41,070
But there's a chance that the students
won't accept Ms. Gi as their junior.

533
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,866
Well, that'll be up to Ms. Gi.

534
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,536
Try to stay unbiased
and keep an eye on her.

535
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,838
(ominous music)

536
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:11,226
KNPU, THE CRADLE OF GLOBAL TALENTS

537
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:17,607
...seventy-two, seventy-three,
seventy-four.

538
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,650
Hey.

539
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:23,988
Throw it already.

540
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,284
You were lucky. You know that?

541
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:33,248
Thanks to the spy cam issue,
Ms. Gi got all the attention.

542
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,710
If that hadn't happened,
we would all have died.

543
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,713
From now on,
you've got to behave yourself.

544
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,927
Many of our colleagues
turned away from you,

545
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,263
but I didn't abandon you.

546
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,306
Because we're friends.

547
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,018
What a shame. I could have ended
being friends with you.

548
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,020
(chuckles)
Do you know what I think?

549
00:30:56,396 --> 00:31:00,066
We should live together and die together
since we're in this room.

550
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,403
Once a roomie always a roomie.

551
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,489
Bumju! Seunghyun!

552
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,201
(munching)

553
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,496
-What?
-You're creepy.

554
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,624
I see.

555
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,085
I think your poop smells creepier.

556
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,504
How could you do it so quietly?

557
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,756
You poopy pants.

558
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,133
-Stop it.
-Stop what?

559
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,426
-Come here.
-You come here.

560
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:30,013
-I'm going to go down now.
-Come! Come down!

561
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,681
TAK: Come here!

562
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,225
Hey.

563
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,687
(playful music)

564
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,522
(both grunting)

565
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,404
(laughing)

566
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,866
I, Yoo Daeil, am the greatest.

567
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:54,913
(Insik sighs)

568
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,373
What's wrong with this year's freshmen?

569
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,417
(sighs)

570
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,210
They've got no respect.

571
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,671
(scoffs)
We would have never been like that.

572
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,341
I think we should beat
some sense into them.

573
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,385
I don't think that's a good idea.
What if someone reports it?

574
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,513
Besides, one of the freshmen is
an executive officer's son.

575
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,766
MYUNGHOON: We shouldn't mess with him.

576
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,897
(indistinct chattering)

577
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,776
Guys! We need to be assembled
at the gym after cleaning.

578
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,570
-What?
-Not now.

579
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,864
We calling us to the gym
after we clean up.

580
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,533
Hurry. Focus on cleaning for now.

581
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,498
(quirky music)

582
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:53,304
TO GI HANNA
EVERYONE ASSEMBLE AT THE GYM BY 9 P.M.

583
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,806
(wind whooshes)

584
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,814
(yelps)

585
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,942
-You little...
-(laughing)

586
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,446
(quirky music continues)

587
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,098
Damn. But I didn't do
anything wrong today.

588
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:41,269
Joint responsibility, you know.
"You're 100, but you're one."

589
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,772
Guys, you've got to hurry. Hurry up.

590
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,786
(dramatic music)

591
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,215
TO GI HANNA
EVERYONE ASSEMBLE AT THE GYM BY 9 P.M.

592
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,175
GYMNASIUM

593
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,385
STUDENTS: I affirm
that I will be an honest

594
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,637
and honorable KNPU student

595
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,432
who will not give in to injustice.

596
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,352
Honest and honorable student?

597
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,980
Possessing prohibited items,
dressing untidily,

598
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,024
losing school supplies, bad behavior.

599
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,776
Is that being honorable?

600
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,778
STUDENTS: No, sir.

601
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,030
(screaming)
Answer loudly, you idiots!

602
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,782
STUDENTS: No, sir.

603
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:41,496
Those who failed to follow such easy rules
saying you're tired and you forgot.

604
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,748
HYUK: Stand up now.

605
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,958
Hurry and stand up!

606
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,590
I lost the gloves during the training.

607
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,594
I dozed off during a special lecture.

608
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:01,057
I was late to the common area cleaning.

609
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,812
(dramatic music)

610
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,193
(grunting)

611
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,739
Is that it?

612
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,586
(foreboding music)

613
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,922
Why are there only 11 girls?

614
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,349
Who's not here?

615
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,395
(screaming)
Answer me! Who's not here?

616
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,356
I think it's Gi Hanna.

617
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,026
(knocks on door)

618
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,820
(knocks on door)

619
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,200
What are you doing here?

620
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,870
-Pardon?
-Didn't you know about the assembly?

621
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,205
I didn't hear anything about it.

622
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,712
HANNA: I didn't see it.

623
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:16,674
The note was right on the door.

624
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,885
And you didn't see it?

625
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,972
I really didn't see it.

626
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,601
HYUK: Has anyone filmed it secretly?

627
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,604
Let's see what happened.

628
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,733
You didn't film it this time?

629
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,904
Make 30 laps around the gym.

630
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,197
Now.

631
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,948
Yes, sir.

632
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,411
(thrilling music)

633
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,300

(Hanna panting)

641
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,593
Do it faster!

642
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,308
(grunting)

643
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,110
HYUK: Keep your heads down.

644
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,362
Keep your heads down!

645
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,993

(breathes heavily)

650
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,243
Back to your position.

651

-(Eunkang screams)
-(students clamoring)

652

00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,071
(students murmuring)

655
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,495
EMERGENCY SERVICE
AMBULANCE

656
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,456
-MYUNGHOON: Get back in!
-INSIK: Get back inside!

657
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,833
-SUNYU: Hurry and get back inside!
-MYUNGHOON: Get back inside!

658
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,171
(music fades)

659
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,596
(emotive music)

660
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,647
She could have really missed it.

661
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,071
(students clamoring)

662
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,076
(breathes heavily)

663
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,625
Looks like she might pass out.

664
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,709
INSIK: Leave it.

665
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,837
She needed that.

666
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,839
We've got to teach her a lesson.

667
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,299
(sighs)

668
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,468
Gosh, a lesson?

669
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,137
What lesson?

670
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,186
-Are you really going?
-Yeah.

671
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,730
There's a procedure to filing complaints.

672
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,649
You can't just walk
into the dean's office.

673
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,734
File a complaint
with the Training Corps first...

674
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,446
I can't talk to the Training Corps.
They're the problem.

675
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,866
I need to talk
to the highest authority, the dean.

676
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,409
If you're not coming with me, move.

677
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,493
(sighs)

678
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:02,460
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

679
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,677
SOONYOUNG: So you wanted to talk to me.

680
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,596
I'd like to hear what it is.

681
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:18,684
Ms. Kim. Do you know
what happened last night?

682
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,983
It was reported this morning
that there was a small accident.

683
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,234
A small accident?

684
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,321
A student was taken to the hospital
while receiving punishment.

685
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:34,200
-How is that a small accident?
-It happens during training.

686
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,535
But it wasn't normal training.

687
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,288
-(Heesun sighs)
-What does that mean?

688
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,875
She was punished out of spite
because of the spy cam.

689
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,002
Everyone knows it.

690
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:45,920
Ms. Ko.

691
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,727
I also think what she did was wrong.

692
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,855
But she's already being punished
for what she did.

693
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,108
I think it's wrong to give her
extra punishment

694
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,528
out of personal grudge.

695
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,822
SOONYOUNG: Hmm...

696
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,700
Okay.

697
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,577
I see.

698
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,996
Is there anything else you want to say?

699
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,541
-Then you may...
-EUNKANG: Yes, there is.

700
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,170
Isn't using a spy cam
supposed to result in an expulsion?

701
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,465
When I was being framed,
I was told I'd be expelled.

702
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,552
But she just got a light punishment.

703
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,136
To be honest, it seems unfair.

704
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,097
But now that I think about it,

705
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,975
it's kind of unfair for her too.

706
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,852
Taking secret videos is bad,

707
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,106
but kicking and beating people is worse.

708
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,858
But none of those people
are getting punished.

709
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,527
She must be pretty upset.

710
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,154
Beatings don't make us
into great police officers.

711
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,908
It only makes us rebellious.
I can assure you that.

712
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:04,582
-Do you find the Training Corps unjust?
-Yes, I do.

713
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,792
But society is even more unjust.

714
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:07,960
(emotive music)

715
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,795
You'll see even more upsetting

716
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,673
and even more unfair things
happening all the time.

717
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,802
Will you yell your complaints suddenly
like this whenever that happens?

718
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,888
SOONYOUNG: I see you're upset
because your colleague got hurt,

719
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,348
but I've seen

720
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,934
a colleague stabbed to death by a criminal

721
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,856
and shredded to death by a dog
right before my eyes.

722
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,026
Compared to dealing with felons
and psychopaths like that,

723
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,321
the training you think is so hard
is just...

724
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,405
(laughs)

725
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:38,824
...child's play.

726
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,036
Being patient is part of the training.

727
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,456
Your friend will be treated well,
so don't worry,

728
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,335
and keep working hard
until the training is over.

729
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,295
-But...
-HEESUN: You should go now.

730
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,347
(somber music)

731
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,363
(somber music continues)

732
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:21,825
How did it go?

733
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,539
I told you. It's like banging
your head against the wall.

734
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,125
You'll only end up hurting yourself.

735
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,753
You may not be able
to break down the wall,

736
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,338
but you can make some marks at least.

737
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,881
Even if nothing changes,

738
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,425
I just wished to let them know
something's wrong. But...

739
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,928
(sighs)

740
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,639
If you really want to change it,

741
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,934
you should talk to the person involved.
Don't avoid it.

742
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,396
As long as that person
doesn't realize it's a problem,

743
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,855
nothing will change.

744
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,032
HYUK: Who was it that went
to the dean's office?

745
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,829
Come out!

746
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,253
I did, sir.

747
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,137
(approaching rapid footsteps)

748
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,352
-(thuds)
-(grunts)

749
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:34,940
(groans)

750
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,943
HYUK: You little brat. Am I a joke to you?

751
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,821
-Stand up.
-(breathes heavily)

752
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,911
No...

753
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,205
You're not.

754
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,959
-I'm scared of you.
-What did you say there?

755
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,545
Answer me!

756
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,381
I said it was wrong
to beat students like this.

757
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,925
(dramatic music)

758
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,803
HYUK: You're getting beaten
because you don't get your act together!

759
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,932
Even if we do,
you always punish us somehow.

760
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,650
-What?
-We didn't come here to get punished.

761
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:23,447
Please stop the verbal and physical abuse
so we can respect you.

762
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,032
You little...

763
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,204
(tense music)

764
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,215
Stop it.

765
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,134
You two. Get down on your heads.

766
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,762
Didn't you hear me?

767
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,602
You're not getting up
until these two get down.

768
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,480
HYUK: Am I understood?

769
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:01,985
(groans)

770
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,908
(tense music continues)

771
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,093
(students groaning)

772
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,725
(students grunting)

773
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,032
(thuds)

774
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:00,836
I affirm

775
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,297
that I will be an honest

776
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,924
and honorable KNPU student
who will not give in to injustice.

777
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,177
I affirm that I will be an honest

778
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,347
and honorable KNPU student
who will not give in to injustice.

779
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,517
-I affirm that I will be an honest
-I will be an honest

780
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,353
BOTH: and honorable KNPU student
who will not give in to injustice.

781
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,482
I affirm that I will be an honest
and honorable KNPU student

782
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,692
who will not give in to injustice.

783
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:27,195
...and honorable KNPU student
who will not give in to injustice.

784
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,823
-I affirm that I will be an honest...
-I will be an honest

785
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:33,076
BOTH: and honorable KNPU student
who will not give in to injustice.

786
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,330
STUDENTS: I affirm

787

789
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,504
and honorable KNPU student

790
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,382
STUDENTS: I affirm
that I will be an honest

791
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,843
and honorable KNPU student
who will not give in to injustice.

792
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,345
Sit down.

793
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:55,182
STUDENTS: ...and honorable KNPU student
who will not give in to injustice.

and honorable KNPU student
who will not give in to injustice.

796
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,229
Sit!

797
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,274
-Can't you hear him?
-I affirm that I will be an honest

798
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,318
-and honorable KNPU student...
-Sit down! All of you!

799
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,070
-...who will not give in to injustice...
-Silence!

800
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,279
-What are you doing?
-...and honorable KNPU student

801
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,614
who will not give in to injustice.

802
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,991

806
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,377
(tense music)

807
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,519
So they're refusing the training
for two days.

808
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,063
Yes.

809
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,314
(breathes deeply)

810
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,150
This is a written protest
signed by all the freshmen.

811
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,110
LETTER OF PROTEST

812
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,613
They're going to refuse training
until their demands are met.

FEBRUARY 23, 2017
KNPU FRESHMAN, WI SEUNGHYUN

814
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,157
The public relations department...

815
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,495
got a phone call
from a reporter this morning.

816
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:03,083
I'm not sure how they learned about it,
but they wanted to interview you.

817
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,047
What should we do?

818
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,967
We're reforming...

819
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,095
Cheongram Education.

820
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,558
We need to avoid...

821
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,812
the rainstorm for now.

822
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,483
In this new era of human rights,

823
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,571
I believe KNPU needs a change as well.

824
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,616
From now on,
we will avoid military-style training

825
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,789
and focus more on creating an environment
where our students can develop creativity

826
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,541
and practice professionalism.

827
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:45,667
(camera shutter clicks)

828
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,295
KNPU'S NEW GOAL IS TO PRODUCE
CREATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL OFFICERS

829
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,963
THE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE HUMANE OFFICERS

830
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,506
IN THIS NEW ERA OF HUMAN RIGHTS,
THE POLICE NEED TO CHANGE TOO

831
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,633
KNPU INITIATES REFORM IN ADMISSIONS SYSTEM

832
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,011
THE NEW GOAL IS TO PRODUCE
CREATIVE AND EXPERT POLICE EXECUTIVES

833

KNPU'S NEW GOAL TO PRODUCE
CREATIVE OFFICERS

834
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,264
KNPU ANNOUNCES REFORM IN THE SYSTEM

883
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,065
JUCHAN: Hello.

884
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,652
I'm Jang Juchan,
the president of KNPU student council.

885
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,864
Whenever I see freshmen
at this time of year,

886
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,449
I'm glad to have new colleagues

887
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,619
who will share
similar problems, similar lives,

888
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,371
and similar experiences with me.

889
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,253
Wi Seunghyun.

890
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,631
-Guys, don't let them scare you.
-Humans can adapt to any environment.

891
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,424
It's all the same where people live.

892
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,384
I'm dying.

893
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:42,969
STUDENTS: Colleagues!

894
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,512

900
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,899
SUNYU: That wastebasket.
Is it supposed to be there?

901
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,618
-ARI: You should turn around.
-Right. Sorry.

902
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,454
(slurps)

903
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,039
DAEIL: I'm going to be traumatized
by noodles.

904
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,333
TAK: It's because
you brought too many at once.

905
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,668
You should have made it subtle.

906
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,671
BUMJU: Sorry. I shouldn't have
told you guys about the noodles.

907
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,471
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

908
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,311
You're the one who did it, right?

909
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,272
(screaming)

910
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,941
HYUK: Has anyone filmed it secretly?

911
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,943
Make 30 laps around the gym.

912
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,071
EUNKANG: We didn't come here
to get punished.

913
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,823
Please stop the verbal and physical abuse.

914
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:45,740

928
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,699
We believe you will do

929
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,326
a great job here.

930
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:30,827
Freshmen,

931
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,163
welcome to KNPU.

932
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,749
(applauding)

933
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,878
(students cheering)

934
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,434
(students cheering, applauding)

935
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,728
(cheerful music)

936
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,864
(cheering continues)

937
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,922
JUCHAN: You did a great job today.

938
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,423
Now, we're going to have

939
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,759
a casual Q and A session
about school life.

940
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,095
If you have any questions,

941
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,557
the public relations members here
and I will be happy to answer.

942
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,562
MALE STUDENT: How should your grades be
for the student exchange program?

943
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,481
Well, it depends on the program each year,

944
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,442
but I think you should be
at least one of the top ten.

945
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,360
(students clamoring)

946
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,778
Are there places to hang out
near the school?

947
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,029
(students laughing)

948
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,156
If you like video games,
you can go to internet cafes.

949
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,826
JUCHAN: If not, you can hang out
at billiard halls and bowling alleys too.

950
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,328
I heard we're not allowed to date
other students. Is that true?

951
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,371
(all laughing)

952
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,248
If you think you can fool the school,
give it a try.

953
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,625
(students clamoring)

954
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,961

I believe in you.

960
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,616
Your hard work will pay off.
You can do it.

961
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,827
If you come to our school,
I'll buy you food every day.

962
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,246
As if I asked for it.

963
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,623
Well...

964
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,959
Who knows? If we eat together...

965
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,171
(stomps feet)

966
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:47,464

(chuckles)

968
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,718
Calm down.

969
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,554
(clears throat)
Let's get in first.

970
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,350
I'll say it with confidence.

971
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,436
-Say what?
-Never mind.

972
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,812
JUCHAN: Any other questions?

973
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,482
You just want to start drinking already,
don't you?

974
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,151
Hey, isn't that president guy cute?

975
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,361
I heard he doesn't have a girlfriend.

976
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,113
Maybe I should hit on him.

977
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,909
Gosh. You have a new crush already?

978
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,828
Wake up. He's definitely super popular.

979
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,164
There must be tons of girls
who are crushing on him.

980
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,834
Is that so?
That makes me more competitive.

981
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,212
Goodness.

982
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,255
(Juyoung clears throat)

983
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,673
STUDENTS: Cheers!
(cheering)

984
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,052
Bottoms up!

985
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,596
-Drink up.
-You should drink it all at once.

986
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,599
(cheering, applauding)

987
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,478
(emotive music continues)

988
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,860
(indistinct chattering)

989
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,664
BUMJU: Man, this is great.

990
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,208
I love drumsticks.

991
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,460
Here's a drumstick.

992
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,380
Wait. Did you eat it?

993
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,180
BE A WARNING TO THE PEOPLE

994
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,265
It's tasty.

995
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,892
-Guys.
-What?

996
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,563
(emotive music)

997
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,263
(emotive music continues)

998
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,030
(chuckles)

999
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:35,882
(music stops)

1000
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,843
(indistinct chatter)

1001
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,389
(reflective music)

1002
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,143
I hope we get along.

1003
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,938
I hope you pass the exam.
So we can study together.

1004
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,148
Study...

1005
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,942
together?

1006
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,911
(somber music)

1007
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:15,588
(gasps)

1008
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:19,300
(somber music rises)

1009
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,640
(sighs)

1010
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,940
(closing theme music)
