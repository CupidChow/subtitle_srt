1
00:00:06,428 --> 00:00:07,638
Thank you.

2
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,808
(dreamy music)

3
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:24,488
-Are you...
-(scoffs)

4
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:26,318
(scoffs)

5
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,448
What are you doing here?
This place isn't for anybody...

6
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,458
EUNKANG: What? Is he a student here?

7
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:37,418
No, wait.

8
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:40,548
If he's Minyong's friend, he must be...

9
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:41,588
(gasps)

10
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:45,758
Excuse me, but are you my senior?

11
00:00:48,678 --> 00:00:50,008
Damn it.

12
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,348
Wow. Hello.

13
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:53,928
How have you been?

14
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:57,478
It's funny we meet again here.
(laughs)

15
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,858
What a small world.

16
00:00:58,938 --> 00:01:00,938
I know. I'm surprised too.

17
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:04,028
Did you get home safely that night?

18
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,358
In one piece?

19
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:09,568
Well, thanks to you,
my sister and I got home safe.

20
00:01:09,658 --> 00:01:10,488
(Eunkang laughs awkwardly)

21
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:13,448
My. I just can't thank you enough.

22
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:18,748
I knew it. He's still holding a grudge.

23
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,048
Was the unpleasant issue resolved?

24
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:26,758
We sent him the bag. Have you heard
anything about it, by any chance?

25
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:28,008
-So what?
-Pardon?

26
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:31,678
Did you think sending it back
would make him feel better?

27
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:32,808
(Seunghyun breathes heavily)

28
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:34,888
You don't get the point, do you?

29
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,978
The reason he mentioned the bag

30
00:01:39,398 --> 00:01:43,398
wasn't because he wanted it back,
but because he wanted her apology.

31
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:45,938
He wanted her to apologize
for playing with his heart.

32
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:48,988
I'm sorry, what? Play with his heart?

33
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,618
My sister said she actually mourned
for her relationship

34
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:55,328
with your friend after the breakup,
though it was for a short while.

35
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:57,208
She started dating the other guy
after that.

36
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:59,208
I'm saying she wasn't two-timing him.

37
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:00,668
I think we should make that clear...

38
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:02,248
(snickers, scoffs)

39
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:04,918
EUNKANG: What was that? That was so rude.

40
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,218
SUNYU: Ms. Ko Eunkang.

41
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:09,928
Yes. I'll be right there, ma'am.

42
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:12,638
Excuse me,
but can we talk about this later?

43
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:14,308
I'm afraid I have to go now. Bye then.

44
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:15,768
Wait...

45
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:19,058
(scoffs)

46
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:21,478
(alarm clock ringing)

47
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:22,808
ROOKIE COPS

48
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:25,228
(theme music)

49
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:07,228
This is Ko Eunkang, your new roommate.

50
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,358
SUNYU: You should introduce yourselves.

51
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:14,948
Tell her about the basic rules
in the dorm after lunch.

52
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,448
ALL: Yes, ma'am!

53
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:26,838
Hi.

54
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:28,798
(crockery clanging)

55
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:30,968
EUNKANG: I was so bummed out.

56
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:33,178
Then I was told
I was given an extra place.

57
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:35,048
Gosh. It was crazy.
(chuckling)

58
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,758
Man. I wish I got an extra place.

59
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:41,308
-It sounds so exciting.
-Not for me. I hate the jitters.

60
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,098
So you came here
right after the call yesterday?

61
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:46,268
Yes, I couldn't sleep a wink.

62
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:48,148
But I'm not even tired.

63
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,858
Now that I'm here,
I can tell I belong here.

64
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:52,738
-Hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

65
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:57,908
Good. Enjoy it while it lasts
before you bawl your eyes out.

66
00:03:58,278 --> 00:04:00,748
I hope this excitement lasts long.

67
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,118
Good luck.

68
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:07,458
-I'm done.
-Oh, okay.

69
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:09,798
All right. See you later.

70
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:13,088
(indistinct chattering)

71
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:15,388
(crockery clanging)

72
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,298
ARI: That's not how you socialize.

73
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:20,888
When you're in a big group,
you need to be kind and cooperative.

74
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:21,888
But she's neither.

75
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,188
She's such a wet blanket.
She spoils the mood all the time.

76
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:26,728
She was like that even before you came.

77
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:28,398
Maybe she's busy.

78
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:30,938
No, she's not.
We all have the same schedule.

79
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,398
I can't wait for this training to end.
Because then I'll have new roommates.

80
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:36,528
Wait. They are going to change
our roommates, right?

81
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:39,658
You never know.
But there are only 12 girls.

82
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,788
There's a good chance
she'll be your roomie again.

83
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:44,658
No way! I'm going to
get her switched no matter what.

84
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:45,918
(rapid retreating footsteps)

85
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:47,498
(scoffs)

86
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,748
I'm Bang Heesun.

87
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:55,048
I majored in psychology
and I'm teaching criminal psychology.

88
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:58,388
As you're not
official students of KNPU yet

89
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:00,638
and this is an orientation,

90
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:05,268
today, I'm going to talk about the school
and what you're going to be learning here.

91
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:09,808
(whispers)
She certainly has charisma.

92
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:12,018
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY
INTRODUCTION

93
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:14,188
Does anyone know what this is?

94
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:19,238
It's the emblem of our school.

95
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,158
HEESUN: Good.

96
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:22,788
The bird on the hibiscus is a sea eagle.

97
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:25,248
What do you think it means?

98
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:29,748
The sea eagle symbolizes the police

99
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:32,038
and the hibiscus symbolizes
the country and its people.

100
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:34,378
It's an image of the police
protecting the people

101
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,548
and soaring to the sky,
with the hibiscus in its claws.

102
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,798
(class murmuring)

103
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:40,428
Look at her, so desperate for attention.

104
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,508
Hey.

105
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:51,978
(clears throat)

106
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:53,728
(door closes)

107
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:57,948
(whispers)
Who is he?

108
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:00,988
(scribbling)

109
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:04,538
THE CHIEF TRAINER
HELL

110
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:07,498
For the next four years,
you'll be studying

111
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:11,288
specialized theories
and how to put them into practical use.

112
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,878
HEESUN: Including general studies
like humanities, sociology,

113
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:14,998
and natural science,

114
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:18,298
starting the second year,
you'll be learning about police science,

115
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,678
which includes subjects like law

116
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,968
and public administration,
depending on your major.

117
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,598
Your goal is to learn
the current security policies

118
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:30,808
and eventually,
to develop creative policies.

119
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:32,648
All right.

120
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:34,768
That's it for today.

121
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,358
In the next class, I will tell you

122
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,448
about your career paths after graduation.

123
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:43,158
If you have any questions, write them down
and ask me in the next class.

124
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:44,778
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

125
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,618
-CLASS: Thank you.
-(applause)

126
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:52,668
Gosh, that was so boring.

127
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:55,208
Aren't classes after lunch just horrible?

128
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,878
I'd rather run.

129
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:01,928
What are you writing? What is it? Show me.

130
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:04,258
-SUNYU: Everybody back to your seats!
-ARI: Goodness.

131
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:06,968
(suspenseful music)

132
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:22,568
Those who were dozing off during class
may stand up now.

133
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:29,698
How dare you doze off during class
when your tuition is paid by taxes!

134
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:33,118
Don't you call yourself a KNPU student!

135
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:34,708
(thrilling music)

136
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:52,308
If you don't stand up yourself,
you'll be in bigger trouble.

137
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:54,558
This is a warning.

138
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,558
Be honorable.

139
00:07:58,688 --> 00:07:59,608
(sighs)

140
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:15,828
You. Why are you sitting?

141
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:19,338
Me? I wasn't dozing.

142
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:21,128
I saw you dozing.

143
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,008
Who is she? I haven't seen that face.

144
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,178
-She must have gotten an extra place.
-EUNKANG: No, I wasn't.

145
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,758
I was pretty sleepy
because I didn't get much sleep,

146
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:32,848
but I pinched my hand
not to doze off. Look.

147
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,148
Hey. Do you think this is a joke?

148
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,818
No, that's not what I...

149
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:41,068
Stand up!

150
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,108
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-You'd better fly right.

151
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:49,028
-I'll be keeping my eyes on you.
-Yes, ma'am.

152
00:08:49,118 --> 00:08:52,698
Those who stood up
will be given extra training.

153
00:08:52,788 --> 00:08:54,658
Assemble at the lounge
after classes. Understood?

154
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,118
STUDENTS: Yes, ma'am!

155
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:21,318
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB
ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS

156
00:09:21,398 --> 00:09:24,398
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

157
00:09:26,738 --> 00:09:27,568
(hidden cam beeps)

158
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:29,318
-(thuds)
-(grunts)

159
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,278
I'm sorry!
(groans)

160
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:32,828
EUNKANG: I'm sorry!

161
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:33,948
I'm sorry!

162
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:35,618
-SUNYU: Can't hear you.
-EUNKANG: I'm sorry!

163
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,828
DAEIL: I'm sorry!
(grunts)

164
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,748
-EUNKANG: I'm sorry!
-(Daeil breathes heavily)

165
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:42,838
-(loud thud)
-(grunts)

166
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,588
I'm sorry!

167
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:45,968
(groans)

168
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:48,338
(metal clanks)

169
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,058
Everyone, stand up.

170
00:10:05,528 --> 00:10:07,988
-You.
-Yes, sir. Freshman Ko Eunkang, sir.

171
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:10,108
Do you know why
you're getting this extra training?

172
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:13,408
Do you still not understand
what you did wrong?

173
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,948
Honestly, no, sir.

174
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:18,498
(foreboding music)

175
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,078
I really wasn't dozing off.

176
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:24,128
I can't say I was when I wasn't.

177
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,758
Are you saying
it's your senior's misunderstanding?

178
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,178
Yes, sir.

179
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:34,348
I apologize if I sounded rude
earlier in the afternoon,

180
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:36,808
But I don't think...

181
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:40,978
I did anything to deserve
a beating with a baseball bat.

182
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:45,518
Fine.

183
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:48,028
Let's say
it was your senior's misunderstanding.

184
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:49,898
Still, you're getting the extra training.

185
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:52,108
May I ask why, sir?

186
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:54,868
Let me tell you why. Listen carefully.

187
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:58,158
HYUK: First, your actions were misleading.

188
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:02,578
Second, you responded to
your senior's initial warning playfully.

189
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:04,538
Third,

190
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:08,088
you defied your senior.

191
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,628
-But...
-You can't disobey your seniors' orders.

192
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:13,928
That's the rule in this school and
fundamental of the police organization.

193
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:18,058
-Do you have a problem with that?
-But...

194
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:33,908
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

195
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:35,698
-(running water stops)
-(Eunkang sighs)

196
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:36,908
(sniffles)

197
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,868
(blowing nose)

198
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:45,498
(sniffles)

199
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,128
(sighs)

200
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:49,588
I'm not even allowed to say it's unfair?

201
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:51,418
Just hold it in.

202
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:53,758
Otherwise, you'll get on
the wrong side of them.

203
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,138
They were harsher on you
because you talked back at them.

204
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:58,008
JUYOUNG: She's right. "The nail
that sticks out gets hammered down."

205
00:11:58,098 --> 00:12:01,018
Try not to stand out. Just say "Yes, sir",

206
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:03,768
"Sorry, sir", "I'll get it right, sir."
That's all you have to say.

207
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,598
EUNKANG: It's not like I married into
a Joseon-era family.

208
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,518
I can't just remain silent like that.

209
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:09,018
Then what, will you butt heads with them?

210
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:11,608
I can at least say
what's not right is not right.

211
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:14,198
-I just don't get it. It's...
-(door opens)

212
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:26,498
(water trickling)

213
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:29,548
(objects clattering)

214
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:52,148
Gosh!

215
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,818
DAEIL: I can't sleep
because I'm so hungry.

216
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:57,868
I can't go to the canteen or outside.

217
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:00,578
Like this is going
to make me a patient person.

218
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:06,708
I want to have instant noodles.

219
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:09,878
I want jjajangmyeon.

220
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,298
I want a burger.

221
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:12,588
I want some fried chicken.

222
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,008
Half spicy, half regular.

223
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:17,128
(all sighing)

224
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:27,848
I know where instant noodles are.

225
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:31,608
(door opens)

226
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:36,398
(door creaks)

227
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:50,708
Do you see the pantry room over there?

228
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,388
TASTY NOODLE

229
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:07,308
(woman singing faintly)

230
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:10,148
BUMJU: I was walking by the pantry
this afternoon,

231
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:12,058
and I saw cup noodles inside.

232
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,818
I think it's for the staff here.

233
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:16,738
So you want to steal them?

234
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,948
-I guess we shouldn't.
-We shouldn't.

235
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:20,448
Stealing is not right.

236
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:25,578
Unless we leave a note.

237
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:28,868
(tense music)

238
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,258
(door opens)

239
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:51,398
(footsteps approaching)

240
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:55,608
(whispering)
Hey, come. Hurry.

241
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:10,118
(all breathe heavily)

242
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,378
(Daeil sighs)
Maybe next time.

243
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:23,838
-Next time.
-Yes. Next time.

244
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,548
Next time.

245
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:28,718
(all breathe heavily)

246
00:15:29,598 --> 00:15:33,098
MALE TRAINER 1: Yell out for five seconds!

247
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:36,728
(students yelling)

248
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:43,528
SEUNGHYUN: Morning roll call report!

249
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:46,078
Total 100 in all. No injuries.

250
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:47,118
No absentees.

251
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,368
Currently 100 present. No issues. Salute!

252
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,208
Recite the honor pledge!

253
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,798
STUDENTS: I affirm
that I will be an honest

254
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:00,758
and honorable KNPU student

255
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:03,678
who will not give in to injustice.

256
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,968
MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR: All students
of this school

257
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:12,558
are required to practice
kendo, hapkido, taekwondo, or judo.

258
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,728
Today, you're taking
your first judo lesson.

259
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,768
I'm going to show you
some of the practical moves

260
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:19,268
that could come in handy
in real-life situations.

261
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:21,438
(upbeat rhythmic music)

262
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:27,448
(sighs)

263
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,368
First, shoulder throw,
which is the most basic skill.

264
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,418
SHOULDER THROW

265
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:38,378
KNPU

266
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,378
First, grab your opponent
by the lapel like this.

267
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,928
Then knock him off balance
and at the same time...

268
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:47,508
-(loud thud)
-(class murmuring)

269
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:51,768
(grunts)

270
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:55,728
You can sit down.

271
00:16:57,858 --> 00:17:01,318
Judo is a sport that requires
physical strength, but there's more to it.

272
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:04,818
You can easily overpower your opponent
even if he or she is bigger than you.

273
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,118
(exhales)

274
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:17,998
When your opponent has a big build
like him, it'll be hard to approach him.

275
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:19,918
In that case,

276
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:24,458
penetrate the opponent's space
and gently turn around.

277
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:27,628
(grunting)

278
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:28,838
(gasping)

279
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:30,548
(grunts)

280
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,598
(sighs)

281
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:35,428
All right. Sometimes,
your opponents are quite athletic.

282
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:37,138
In that case...

283
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:41,518
(groans)

284
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:43,978
(class murmuring)

285
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:46,318
(both grunting)

286
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:50,528
Bend over and kick your opponent's leg
and press him with all your might.

287
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,158
(screams)

288
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:55,078
(class murmuring)

289
00:17:57,748 --> 00:17:58,578
(both grunting)

290
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:09,638
(both panting)

291
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:13,758
(class laughing)

292
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,518
(whimpering)

293
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:17,428
(tapping)

294
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:19,348
-(both panting)
-(class murmuring)

295
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:26,108
(class laughing)

296
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:32,488
(instructor clears throat)

297
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:41,038
(girls giggling)

298
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:50,548
-I was going easy on him.
-(laughs)

299
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:54,928
Hey.

300
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,058
MEN'S CHANGING ROOM

301
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:06,608
You almost got me.

302
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,698
Is it fun lying to others?

303
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:11,858
Why would you tell such an obvious lie?

304
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:13,028
Lie?

305
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:14,488
I didn't lie.

306
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,448
Gosh! When I asked you
if you were my senior,

307
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:19,658
you said yes in the corridor yesterday.

308
00:19:19,748 --> 00:19:21,248
I've never said that.

309
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,788
You're the one who convinced yourself
to believe that.

310
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:26,378
-I convinced myself?
-Yes. You did.

311
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,838
Excuse me, but are you my senior?

312
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,598
You didn't actually say
you were my senior,

313
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,638
but you didn't deny it either.
And that's a yes.

314
00:19:41,178 --> 00:19:43,478
I was so flustered
I didn't know what to say.

315
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:45,648
Wow! You didn't know what to say?

316
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:48,398
What a great excuse!

317
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,738
You should join Mensa
for having such a quick wit.

318
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:51,738
You lie like a rug. Let me see your rug.

319
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:53,068
You know what?

320
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,528
SEUNGHYUN: If this is because
you're embarrassed by your own stupidity,

321
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:58,078
it's okay. I already forgot about it.

322
00:19:58,658 --> 00:19:59,788
What?

323
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:02,368
Hey.

324
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,788
Wait. Stop. Are you avoiding me now?

325
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,628
Gosh!

326
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,378
-He's a hero?
-Yes.

327
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,048
"Please stop. How can she say yes
under this pressure?"

328
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:19,768
He was so cool.

329
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:22,428
Wow. He's acting like
a different person here.

330
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:25,938
Don't let him fool you.
He's actually calculative and petty.

331
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,398
He's one of those who want

332
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:29,778
all the presents they gave to
their girlfriends back after breaking up.

333
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:31,188
No! Really?

334
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:32,438
Yes.

335
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,658
But how do you know that?
Do you know each other?

336
00:20:35,738 --> 00:20:38,028
No, we don't.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

337
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:41,538
I just wanted you to know that
he's not the kind of guy you think he is.

338
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:42,948
(sighs)

339
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:46,168
I see. I thought he was the cutest here.

340
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:49,748
Come on.
Wasn't that other boy kind of cute?

341
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:52,588
Was he Kim Tak? The one who came through
special admission for athletes.

342
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,718
He's got such broad shoulders.
He looks so strong.

343
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:57,548
(grumbles)
He's not my type.

344
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,098
He kind of looks dumb.

345
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:01,218
(water running)

346
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,558
What about you?

347
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:08,648
I'm not interested.

348
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:11,478
We're not allowed
to date other students anyway.

349
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,278
(locker door slams)

350
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:19,988
ARI: It was just a hypothetical question.

351
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,078
She's so annoying.

352
00:21:22,158 --> 00:21:23,828
JUYOUNG: Come on. Leave her alone.

353
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,748
At least she's honest.

354
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:27,038
I don't care!

355
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,418
(whoops)

356
00:21:43,058 --> 00:21:43,888
(clears throat)

357
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:49,188
I heard you were an athlete.
What did you do? Soccer? Judo? Wrestling?

358
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:50,108
Judo.

359
00:21:50,188 --> 00:21:51,018
Aha.

360
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:54,068
I did some sports too when I was little.

361
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,948
(shouting loudly imitates punching)

362
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:05,328
I wanted to become a short-track skater
when I was in elementary school.

363
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:06,578
(exhales sharply)

364
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,118
DAEIL: All right.

365
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:11,288
From now on, you're on Team Yoo.

366
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,088
Team Yoo.

367
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:16,838
I'll help you grow. You can count on me.

368
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:23,258
(quirky music)

369
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:26,268
But I'm bigger than you.

370
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,808
Huh?

371
00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:32,768
(Daeil sighs)

372
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:36,228
Hey, your body build isn't everything.

373
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,818
Brain. You need to have a smart brain.
My brain with your...

374
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:42,738
body.

375
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:44,658
We'll be invincible.

376
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,788
Let's be good friends.

377
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:54,708
Hey.

378
00:22:59,168 --> 00:23:00,258
You'd better watch out.

379
00:23:02,968 --> 00:23:05,928
Hey! Watch out for what?

380
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:07,218
-That burns!
-Oh, no. I'm sorry.

381
00:23:08,478 --> 00:23:11,098
DAEIL: It burns!

382
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:12,398
BUMJU: Water!

383
00:23:12,688 --> 00:23:14,808
(Daeil screaming)
Stop! It's cold!

384
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:18,688
(yelping)
It's cold!

385
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:21,948
Cold! It's so cold!

386
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:24,408
-DAEIL: It's cold!
-(laughing)

387
00:23:27,988 --> 00:23:31,328
By the way, are we not allowed
to date other students?

388
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:34,538
Right. I heard it's like an unspoken rule.

389
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:37,628
I heard the student council would give you
a warning if you hang out with a boy.

390
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,208
Because it distracts the students
from their studies.

391
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:41,928
That's so mean.
They don't even let us date?

392
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:43,218
I actually think it's a great rule.

393
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,968
What if they break up?
It's going to be so awkward.

394
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:47,848
It's a small school. No way.

395
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,468
(indistinct chattering)

396
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:52,308
Do you have a boyfriend here?

397
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:54,148
What? No.

398
00:23:55,898 --> 00:23:58,648
-Yes, you do.
-No. Not yet.

399
00:23:58,858 --> 00:23:59,988
"Not yet"?

400
00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:00,988
(Ari breathes deeply)

401
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:03,778
-Who is it?
-No.

402
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:06,368
Is he our senior? Which year?
Come on. Just tell me.

403
00:24:06,448 --> 00:24:07,578
I don't.

404
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:10,498
Yes, you do.

405
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:11,578
(chomps)

406
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:18,548
(dreamy music)

407
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:21,758
I'll get going. I'll see you around.

408
00:24:21,838 --> 00:24:23,428
-Are you already finished?
-EUNKANG: Yes.

409
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:40,188
(sighs)

410
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:43,448
I never got to tell him I got accepted.

411
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:50,118
Where did she go?
She didn't even take her jacket.

412
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,208
-All right. See you around.
-TAK: Bye.

413
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:57,828
(Ari grunts)

414
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:00,128
-SEUNGHYUN: Sorry.
-ARI: It's okay.

415
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:05,628
(object clatters)

416
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:14,678
Is it Eunkang's?

417
00:25:14,768 --> 00:25:15,938
(suspenseful music)

418
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:23,648
Which one is mine?

419
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:27,278
HYUK: Left, face.

420
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,738
Forward, march.

421
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:34,748
Left, left, left, left,

422
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:36,578
left, left.

423
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:39,248
Left flank, march.

424
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,418
STUDENTS: One, two.

425
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,708
SUNYU: Keep the formation!

426
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:43,298
MALE TRAINER 1: Synchronize!

427
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:46,378
HYUK: Left, left, left.

428
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:49,838
To the rear, march.

429
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:51,548
STUDENTS: One, two. three.

430
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:53,848
MALE TRAINER 1: Mind the person
next to you!

431
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:55,558
HYUK: Change step, march.

432
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:56,598
STUDENTS: One, two.

433
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,398
HYUK: Left, left.

434
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:01,478
SUNYU: Keep your distance!

435
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:04,318
MALE TRAINER 2: Focus!

436
00:26:09,908 --> 00:26:12,368
(Yugon on computer)
It shows that the perpetrator was

437
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:17,828
continuously stabbing the victim
while chasing him.

438
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:18,748
(chomping)

439
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:19,708
Using logical reasoning,

440
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:24,168
this is presumed to be
a premeditated crime motivated by grudges.

441
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:28,298
However,
there's still a question unsolved.

442
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:32,218
The crime was committed
in a busy subway station

443
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:34,428
on a holiday afternoon.

444
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:38,018
How could the culprit be so bold?

445
00:26:38,228 --> 00:26:39,058
(keyboard clacks)

446
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:40,188
That was nice.
(sniffs)

447
00:26:40,268 --> 00:26:41,898
I sure have increased the show's ratings.
(chomping)

448
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:45,978
Let's see how high it was.

449
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:48,818
YUGON (in singsong voice):
Let's have a look-see.

CONGRESSMAN SEO KICHUL
PROPOSES BILL TO ABOLISH KNPU

454
00:27:04,838 --> 00:27:07,668
YUGON: Have you seen the newspaper?
(sips)

455
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:10,678
Of course I have.
It's the eighth most trending topic now.

456
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:12,428
(students shouting in distance)

457
00:27:12,638 --> 00:27:14,388
Gosh, my head hurts.

458
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,348
SOONYOUNG: I took some headache pills
on an empty stomach

459
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:18,268
and now I feel queasy.

460
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:21,478
Why is he doing this to us?

461
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,558
What have we done to him?

462
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:25,358
There are many reasons.

463
00:27:26,518 --> 00:27:27,358
He thinks it's absurd

464
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,898
that recent graduates lead the cops
because they lack practical experience.

465
00:27:30,988 --> 00:27:32,948
That's the same with the prosecution.

466
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:35,198
Those young prosecutors
are still wet behind the ears,

467
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,868
yet they boss around the older cops.

468
00:27:37,578 --> 00:27:38,828
Let's be honest.

469
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,958
It's because the constables have
issues with getting promoted, right?

470
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,748
-(shouting in distance)
-(whistle blows faintly)

471
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:47,748
(gasps, chuckles)

472
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:49,048
It's okay.

473
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:51,878
I'm not from this school,

474
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:54,588
but I'm a KNPU person now.

475
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:57,718
What do you think, Professor Cha?

476
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:58,848
(breathes deeply)

477
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:01,228
Well, they always bring this up
every now and then.

478
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,478
No, but it seems
a little more serious this time.

479
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,188
-They're even holding a hearing about it.
-Then...

480
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:10,898
the school might actually
get abolished this time.

481
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:12,398
Professor Cha.

482
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:15,238
Well, to be honest,

483
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:18,408
over 40% of police executives
are KNPU graduates.

484
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,948
Of course, the rest feel excluded.

485
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:23,038
That's what causes
continuous internal conflict.

486
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,998
What are you talking about?

487
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,378
You don't just become
an executive officer.

488
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:30,338
You need to get the training
and pass the promotion exam.

489
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,048
How could you trivialize

490
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,928
your seniors' and juniors' efforts
when you're a KNPU graduate yourself?

491
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:37,348
I'm not trivializing anything.

492
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:41,638
-That's how it looks to outsiders...
-Stop it.

493
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,598
You're not here to have a fight.

494
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:46,098
I called you in to tell you to make sure

495
00:28:46,188 --> 00:28:48,648
to take extra care of the students
since it seems serious.

496
00:28:48,938 --> 00:28:51,648
Professor Cha will be
in charge of freshmen this year.

497
00:28:52,358 --> 00:28:55,068
And Professor Bang,
you're the guidance counselor.

498
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:57,658
You know what will happen
if students cause trouble at this point.

499
00:28:58,068 --> 00:28:59,658
It will only help the abolitionist.

500
00:29:01,288 --> 00:29:02,908
Fall into four rows!

501
00:29:02,998 --> 00:29:04,118
-BUMJU: Mark. One!
-Two!

502
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,958
-Three!
-Four! End of order!

503
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:08,538
-JUYOUNG: Fall in.
-TAK: Fall in.

504
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:09,748
Fall in!

505
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:10,668
(screaming)
Come out!

506
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:14,088
-TAK: Run.
-MALE TRAINER 1: One.

507
00:29:14,758 --> 00:29:15,718
Two.

508
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,428
Three.

509
00:29:18,138 --> 00:29:19,098
Four.

510
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:21,808
One, two, three, four.

511
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:26,308
-HYUK: You disappointed me greatly.
-MALE TRAINER 1: One, two, three, four.

512
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:28,648
-You're not improving at all.
-MALE TRAINER 1: One, two.

513
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:30,518
HYUK: You think this place is a joke?

514
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,608
STUDENTS: Sorry, sir!

515
00:29:33,228 --> 00:29:34,108
Get up.

516
00:29:34,528 --> 00:29:35,568
(grunting)

517
00:29:37,238 --> 00:29:38,278
-HYUK: Get down.
-(sighs)

518
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:41,528
-HYUK: Get up.
-(Daeil grunts)

519
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:46,708
Do burpees
until your colleagues finish running.

520
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:48,708
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

521
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:52,338
STUDENTS: One.

522
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:55,008
Two.

523
00:29:56,418 --> 00:29:57,628
STUDENTS: Three.

524
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,848
STUDENTS: Four.

525
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:03,468
STUDENTS: Five.

526
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:06,098
STUDENTS: Six.

527
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:08,018
(suspenseful music)

528
00:30:11,358 --> 00:30:12,358
STUDENTS: Eight.

529
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:15,488
STUDENTS: Nine.

530
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:17,448
STUDENTS: Ten.

531
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:20,818
STUDENTS: Eleven.

532
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:23,238
STUDENTS: Twelve.

533
00:30:26,248 --> 00:30:27,708
STUDENTS: Thirteen.

534
00:30:30,418 --> 00:30:31,458
STUDENTS: Fourteen.

535
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:34,958
STUDENTS: Fifteen.

536
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:38,218
STUDENTS: Sixteen.

537
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:41,468
STUDENTS: Seventeen.

538
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:43,758
STUDENTS: Eighteen.

539
00:30:43,848 --> 00:30:44,928
You. Stop.

540
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:46,098
STUDENTS: Nineteen.

541
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,348
Can't you hear me?!

542
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:48,888
STUDENTS: Twenty.

543
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:51,848
-Twenty-one.
-Is this yours?

544
00:30:51,938 --> 00:30:53,108
Well...

545
00:30:53,188 --> 00:30:54,478
-STUDENTS: Twenty-two.
-Answer me.

546
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:56,988
Yes, sir. Freshman Ko Eunkang, sir.

547
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:59,148
Starting now, you're out of the training.

548
00:30:59,238 --> 00:31:00,108
Yes...

549
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:03,448
-Pardon?
-Wait in your room until there's an order.

550
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,778
What?

551
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:13,128
This is...

552
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:18,758
Why did you film this in secret?

553
00:31:19,048 --> 00:31:20,548
I didn't film it.

554
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,798
Will you keep denying it?

555
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:26,058
I, your senior, saw it
fall out of your jacket!

556
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:31,638
I don't know either
why it was in my jacket.

557
00:31:32,228 --> 00:31:34,308
If you don't come clean about it,
as the chief trainer,

558
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,228
I'll tell the authorities that we should
consider canceling your admission,

559
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:40,488
-as you have disgraced the school's name.
-What?

560
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:42,528
Student Life Act,
Section four, article 45.

561
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:44,948
"The school's education and facilities
are supposed to be kept confidential.

562
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:45,948
Disclosure of the information

563
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:49,408
or possession and distribution
of any documents, photos, or videos

564
00:31:49,498 --> 00:31:51,158
that may damage others' honor and dignity

565
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:53,788
can be a good reason
for the cancellation of admission."

566
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:57,088
I really didn't do it. Please believe me.

567
00:31:57,168 --> 00:31:59,298
A student disciplinary committee
will be set up soon.

568
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,338
Save your breath until then.

569
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:17,858
HYUK: You'll stay in the detention room
until told otherwise.

570
00:32:18,858 --> 00:32:20,318
(somber music)

571
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:28,868
(sighs)

572
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:38,958
(Yangchul humming)

573
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,548
-(phone ringing)
-(humming continues)

574
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,378
Yes.

575
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,138
Hi, Uncle. How are you feeling?

576
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:50,768
Oh, right. Have I told you

577
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:54,728
that Eunkang got into the school?

578
00:32:55,188 --> 00:32:56,808
You know, KNPU.
(chuckles)

579
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:00,778
Korean National Police University!
(laughs)

580
00:33:00,858 --> 00:33:04,148
When she graduates from school,
she'll be a lieutenant right away.

581
00:33:04,238 --> 00:33:07,318
A lieutenant is as high
as a chief constable.

582
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,908
Oh, come on. Not that high.

583
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:13,288
Why won't he pick up the phone? Come on!

584
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,038
Geez.

585
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,168
Hey, Uncle. It's me, Yangchul.

586
00:33:18,838 --> 00:33:21,048
Your nephew living in Seoul.

587
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:27,258
Anyway, I feel so safe now
to have a cop in the family.

588
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,258
Actually, if you ever have
to go to a police station, call me.

589
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:32,808
Don't hesitate to ask.
(laughs)

590
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:35,268
And please say hi to Aunt.

591
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:37,478
Okay. No need to come.

592
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:38,768
Bye.

593
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:40,518
(laughing)

594
00:33:41,358 --> 00:33:43,648
Why would you say something like that?

595
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:45,858
What if he actually calls you?

596
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:48,448
I'm just trying to be nice. Don't worry.

597
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:49,948
You know my uncle.

598
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,408
He's never visited Korea
ever since he moved abroad.

599
00:33:53,488 --> 00:33:56,408
Because he didn't want to spend
money on airfare. Don't you worry.

600
00:33:56,498 --> 00:33:57,618
YANGCHUL: Uncle, check.

601
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:00,288
Hey, did you call your friend too?

602
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:01,458
My friend?

603
00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:03,628
You know, your friend
from elementary school

604
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,378
who lives in Hannam-dong
and always drives foreign cars.

605
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:08,508
(yelps)
You mean Miran.

606
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,258
-I can't call her.
-Why not?

607
00:34:11,388 --> 00:34:12,598
(laughing)

608
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,388
What is it?
(chuckles)

609
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:15,728
(laughing)

610
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:18,558
What is so funny?

611
00:34:19,018 --> 00:34:20,478
You know, her daughter was preparing

612
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,568
-for the college entrance exam again.
-Yes.

613
00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:24,778
-I heard she wasn't accepted.
-Again?

614
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:27,608
Yes, and I heard Miran totally
lost her mind and is in misery

615
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:32,068
because she practically poured money
into her daughter's tuition.

616
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:35,658
She always said
kids need expensive private tutors.

617
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,248
(scoffs)
We never got our daughter any tutor,

618
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:40,828
but she got in anyway.

619
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:41,998
(Yangchul scribbling)

620
00:34:42,128 --> 00:34:45,878
That proves money isn't everything.

621
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,008
(both chuckle)

622
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:49,878
Look at you, all excited.

623
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:51,758
Hang on.

624
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,048
Let me see.

625
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:56,178
Are you so happy to hear
that Miran is in misery?

626
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:57,428
Are you?

627
00:34:57,518 --> 00:34:59,268
No, I'm not!

628
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:01,188
-Stop it!
-(both laughing)

629
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:07,318
But why was that in here?

630
00:35:08,318 --> 00:35:11,408
Gosh! I just can't believe this!

631
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,838
Hey, did you hear?

632
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:35,138
Eunkang secretly filmed us
getting training and punishment.

633
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,888
I think it's serious.
I heard she'd be expelled.

634
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,018
ARI: Is it Eunkang's?

635
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:48,898
Which one is mine?

636
00:35:49,738 --> 00:35:50,568
(clicks tongue)

637
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:52,318
Oh, well.

638
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,618
That was a spy cam?

639
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,788
(sighs)

640
00:36:00,078 --> 00:36:01,658
Whatever. It's not mine.

641
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:04,458
It's not mine, so it must be hers.

642
00:36:06,788 --> 00:36:07,628
(exhales sharply)

643
00:36:34,488 --> 00:36:35,818
(quirky music)

644
00:36:37,368 --> 00:36:38,198
(door opens)

645
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:55,928
(moaning)

646
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:57,088
I love this.

647
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,678
-(slurps)
-(swallows)

648
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:02,808
(sighs)

649
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:06,938
The salt is invigorating
all my cells. Right?

650
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,228
DAEIL: This is why salt is essential.

651
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:12,858
Even Napoleon told his subordinates
to bring salt before they had a battle.

652
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:15,318
Stop that and give it.

653
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:17,818
TAK: Leave some.

654
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:20,278
I know you're going to finish it all.

655
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:24,158
(blows, slurps)

656
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,038
(slurps, munching)

657
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:27,378
(exhales)

658
00:37:28,878 --> 00:37:30,668
Did you leave a note?

659
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:32,208
Of course.

660
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,478
TASTY NOODLE

661
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:53,608
BUMJU: Let us borrow
some of your noodles.

662
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,278
We're just like Jean Valjean,

663
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,278
the man who stole bread out of hunger.

664
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,828
We promise to give you the money
when the training period is over.

665
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,538
SEUNGHYUN: I wonder why the guy
on night duty wasn't there today.

666
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,038
DAEIL: I think he went to a meeting.

667
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:08,668
At this time?

668
00:38:08,748 --> 00:38:11,668
Well, it's an emergency. They're probably
having an emergency meeting.

669
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:14,548
(slurping)

670
00:38:14,798 --> 00:38:16,838
Do you think Ko Eunkang will be expelled?

671
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:20,968
Of course. They'll definitely punish her.

672
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,178
-But isn't it a bit too much to expel her?
-BUMJU: I know.

673
00:38:23,258 --> 00:38:26,268
DAEIL: You guys really have no idea
what this means.

674
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,648
This is actually a serious matter.

675
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:34,018
If the video of us getting punished
and harassed spreads on the internet,

676
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:38,528
in the worst case, the dean can get fired.

677
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,738
I don't think that was her intention.

678
00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:44,288
She was trying to
screw over the chief trainer.

679
00:38:45,038 --> 00:38:47,498
Anyway, it's only a matter of time
until she's expelled.

680
00:38:48,288 --> 00:38:50,208
She's in the detention room now,
so be careful.

681
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,538
-We're not allowed to talk to her.
-Why?

682
00:38:52,628 --> 00:38:54,088
Did you doze off at the orientation?

683
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:57,008
According to school regulations,
we can't talk to students

684
00:38:57,088 --> 00:38:58,918
who are being punished.

685
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:03,218
-But did she really do it?
-(Daeil slurping)

686
00:39:03,798 --> 00:39:05,218
Of course!

687
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:07,178
They found the evidence on the spot.

688
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:09,888
TAK: Hey, that's enough for you.

689
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:12,018
Hey, stop eating. Leave some for me.

690
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,188
MALE STUDENT 1: That's Ko Eunkang.

691
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:16,278
(students clamoring)

692
00:39:22,198 --> 00:39:23,238
MALE STUDENT 2: Eunkang?

693
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,828
How does she even have an appetite?

694
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,128
DAEIL: She's one tough cookie. Right?

695
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:36,998
What did you eat?

696
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:38,838
I don't know. My stomach hurts.

697
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,338
-Again?
-Hey, I've got to go.

698
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:43,298
-Hey.
-EUNKANG: Ari.

699
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:44,928
Ari.

700
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:55,188
Sorry. I know you're not
allowed to talk to me right now,

701
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,818
-but I have a question for you.
-What is it?

702
00:39:58,728 --> 00:40:01,898
I'm looking for the person
who took the video, but I'm lost.

703
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,698
As I remember, I took off
my jacket exactly twice yesterday.

704
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,828
At the martial arts class
and in the cafeteria.

705
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:08,738
And?

706
00:40:08,828 --> 00:40:12,038
And you took my jacket
when you left the cafeteria.

707
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,538
-Did you...
-Hey, are you suspecting me?

708
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:19,128
No. I'm just wondering
if you saw anyone touch my jacket.

709
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,508
I don't know. I didn't see anyone.

710
00:40:20,758 --> 00:40:23,128
Please try to remember.
This is very important to me.

711
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:24,298
I don't know.

712
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,258
You left your jacket,
so I brought it to you. That's all.

713
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:29,558
(door opens)

714
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:36,438
-(sighs)
-(door closes)

715
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:38,898
(suspenseful music)

716
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:53,458
OFFICE PANTRY

717
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:04,838
YUGON: She denies it?

718
00:41:04,928 --> 00:41:05,968
Yes, sir.

719
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:08,138
Did you check the security cameras?

720
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:10,638
The cameras on the first and second floor
in the dorm are taken way

721
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,308
for the time being
because of the waterproofing repairs.

722
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:14,058
So you couldn't check the cameras.

723
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,938
-No, sir.
-Then how are you so sure

724
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:17,648
that Ms. Ko Eunkang did it?

725
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:19,898
First of all, she was the one
carrying the evidence.

726
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,398
The video clip was filmed
after Ms. Ko entered the school.

727
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:25,948
Nothing was filmed before that.

728
00:41:26,988 --> 00:41:27,868
(sighs)

729
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:29,408
(breathes deeply)

730
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:33,158
We can't cancel the admission
just because she could have done it.

731
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:37,918
Just like we can't arrest someone
for having a weapon in his or her jacket.

732
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,788
Plus, you said she denies it.

733
00:41:39,878 --> 00:41:42,758
But she's been showing a bad attitude
throughout the training too.

734
00:41:43,798 --> 00:41:46,878
This is a serious issue,
so we've got to be discreet.

735
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:50,298
Make sure this doesn't get out.

736
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:52,138
Have you reported this to Professor Bang?

737
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,268
-Not yet.
-YUGON: I'll do it.

738
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:57,558
We need to set up
a student disciplinary committee anyway.

739
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:59,978
-Yes, sir.
-You can go now.

740
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:06,488
(door opens)

741
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:08,818
-(breathes deeply)
-(door closes)

742
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:13,448
(Yugon exhales sharply)

743
00:42:13,538 --> 00:42:16,328
While the security cameras
are taken away...

744
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,208
(breathes)

745
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,458
It means this person knows
well about what's going on here.

746
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,548
NAMGI: The Gangneung Poseo-dong Case
is a case

747
00:42:33,098 --> 00:42:36,348
where a perverted man
broke into over 40 empty apartments

748
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,188
where single women lived

749
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:40,848
and stole their money, valuables,
and lingerie.

750
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:43,268
The culprit has been arrested.

751
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:46,608
A special fluorescent material was used
to solve this case,

752
00:42:46,688 --> 00:42:48,568
which is not visible to the naked eye.

753
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:50,488
You apply it to the places
where the criminal is likely to touch

754
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,368
as he or she enters the house.

755
00:42:52,448 --> 00:42:54,198
Then, under a UV light,

756
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:57,828
-as you can see, it appears like this.
-(class murmuring)

757
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:03,628
This material was developed in the UK,
but now it's produced in Korea too.

758
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,998
So it's easy to purchase online.

759
00:43:07,088 --> 00:43:08,588
Next, luminol.

760
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:11,428
It's used to detect bloodstains.

761
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:14,098
It reacts to oxidants or metals...

762
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:16,598
It was so upsetting.

763
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:18,728
I wish I could take lectures
like this every day.

764
00:43:20,518 --> 00:43:23,268
(sighs)
I wish we have special lectures every day.

765
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:24,938
Today's lecture was really interesting.
Wasn't it?

766
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:26,648
What? Right.

767
00:43:26,728 --> 00:43:27,818
Shin Ari.

768
00:43:29,448 --> 00:43:30,778
Can I talk to you for a second?

769
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:31,948
(mouthing)
Me?

770
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:33,528
I'll see you around.

771
00:43:39,078 --> 00:43:40,118
ARI: What is it?

772
00:43:40,408 --> 00:43:41,868
Do you want me to say it or do you?

773
00:43:43,628 --> 00:43:45,748
I saw you in front of the cafeteria
that day.

774
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,208
SEUNGHYUN: All right. See you around.

775
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,048
Sorry.

776
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:53,888
(object clatters)

777
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:55,548
(Ari grunts)

778
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:00,598
Is it Eunkang's?

779
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:10,278
I'm not sure what you're talking about?
What did you see?

780
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:11,358
You know what I mean.

781
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:14,658
Is that it? Then I'll get going.

782
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:16,448
I gave you a chance.

783
00:44:17,158 --> 00:44:19,908
A chance to be honest. And you blew it.

784
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:34,678
Ari!

785
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:37,548
I'm so happy for you.
What did he say? Did he ask you out?

786
00:44:37,638 --> 00:44:38,718
Get off me.

787
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:51,318
JUYOUNG: What's wrong with her?

788
00:44:51,738 --> 00:44:54,698
MALE TRAINERS: One, two, three, four.

789
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:55,818
MALE TRAINERS: One.

790
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:57,278
MALE TRAINERS: Two.

791
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:58,868

00:44:59,368 --> 00:45:00,488
MALE TRAINERS: Four.

MALE TRAINERS: One, two, three, four.

794
00:45:04,158 --> 00:45:07,078
MALE TRAINERS: One, two, three, four.

795
00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:08,628
(whistle blowing)

796
00:45:14,218 --> 00:45:15,428
(suspenseful music)

797
00:45:20,388 --> 00:45:21,598
MALE TRAINER 1: One.

798
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:22,848
Two.

799
00:45:23,228 --> 00:45:24,268
Three.

800
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:25,558
Four.

801
00:45:26,058 --> 00:45:27,058
One.

802
00:45:27,648 --> 00:45:28,768
Two.

803
00:45:29,148 --> 00:45:30,018
Three.

804
00:45:30,398 --> 00:45:31,228
Four.

805
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:32,608
One.

806
00:45:33,068 --> 00:45:33,898
Two.

807
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:35,358
Three.

808
00:45:36,198 --> 00:45:37,608
(suspenseful music continues)

809
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:40,778
(crockery clanking)

810
00:45:50,168 --> 00:45:54,378
EUNKANG: Cafeteria, gym,
cafeteria, restroom.

811
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:57,888
Dormitory, schoolyard.

812
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,088
(sighs)

813
00:45:59,888 --> 00:46:00,718
(breathes deeply)

814
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:03,268
It has to be here.

815
00:46:06,268 --> 00:46:08,268
(exhales)
I should ask Ari again.

816
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:13,318
(gasps)
Goodness.

817
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,948
Did Wi Seunghyun tell you anything?

818
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,948
Wi Seunghyun? Tell me what?

819
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:24,038
Ah...

820
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:25,748
Well...

821
00:46:29,418 --> 00:46:30,328
I did it.

822
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:32,748
The spy cam.

823
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:34,458
I put it in your jacket.

824
00:46:34,548 --> 00:46:36,258
-What?
-ARI: I'm sorry.

825
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:38,678
I didn't know it was a spy cam.

826
00:46:38,758 --> 00:46:41,008
-I thought it fell out of your jacket.
-Hey!

827
00:46:41,088 --> 00:46:44,678
Why are you saying this now?
Because of you, I'm...

828
00:46:45,218 --> 00:46:46,058
(sighs)

829
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:47,978
I'm about to be expelled.

830
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:51,978
But it's not mine either. Believe me.

831
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,278
-Let's go.
-Where?

832
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:57,318
The training corp's office, of course.

833
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:58,528
No.

834
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,908
Eunkang, I'll help you find who did it.

835
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:03,488
So please don't tell them about me.

836
00:47:03,578 --> 00:47:05,328
If we find who did it,
it will be all right.

837
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:07,328
-What?
-Once this gets out,

838
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:10,168
I won't be able to study here.
(sobbing)

839
00:47:10,248 --> 00:47:12,538
Whatever. That's none of my business.

840
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:14,248
I have to clear my name.

841
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:21,548
Eunkang.

842
00:47:22,088 --> 00:47:22,928
(sentimental music)

843
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:23,848
(sighs)

844
00:47:27,098 --> 00:47:30,768
ARI: But it's not mine either.
Believe me.

845
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:34,648
I'm not a saint. This is not the time
to worry about others.

846
00:47:37,528 --> 00:47:40,238
(breathes deeply)

847
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:47,158
Once this gets out,
I won't be able to study here.

848
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:05,638
(clears throat)

849
00:48:05,968 --> 00:48:07,308
-How could you do that?
-What?

850
00:48:08,178 --> 00:48:10,348
I understand you don't like me,

851
00:48:10,428 --> 00:48:13,558
but how could you not do anything
when your colleague is being framed?

852
00:48:13,648 --> 00:48:15,768
I can't lie just to clear your name.

853
00:48:15,858 --> 00:48:17,518
I heard you saw Ari putting
the spy cam in my jacket.

854
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:19,938
No, I didn't. I don't have super eyesight.

855
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:22,318
-How could I have seen it?
-What?

856
00:48:22,398 --> 00:48:24,068
Did you lie to Ari then?

857
00:48:24,158 --> 00:48:26,198
I said I saw her putting something
in the jacket,

858
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,778
but I never said it was a spy cam.

859
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:29,748
I guess she was feeling guilty.

860
00:48:29,828 --> 00:48:30,658
(scoffs)

861
00:48:31,748 --> 00:48:33,498
Are you happy now? I'll get going then.

862
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:34,708
Ari said it wasn't her.

863
00:48:35,918 --> 00:48:37,668
She was just afraid
she'd be accused of it.

864
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,208
She didn't film the video.

865
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:42,168
Which means it's done by someone else.

866
00:48:42,258 --> 00:48:43,378
We need to find that person.

867
00:48:43,468 --> 00:48:46,298
-Are you going to find that person?
-Of course I should.

868
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,968
It's just not fair

869
00:48:49,058 --> 00:48:51,678
that innocent Ari and I have to fight
because of that person.

870
00:48:51,768 --> 00:48:53,518
I just can't let that happen.

871
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,728
Great attitude. Good luck.

872
00:48:57,188 --> 00:48:58,438
Are you just leaving like that?

873
00:48:59,438 --> 00:49:00,608
Help me.

874
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:03,528
I can't do this alone.
I'm in detention now,

875
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,698
so I'm not allowed to talk
to the other kids.

876
00:49:05,778 --> 00:49:08,528
I have to find this person before
the disciplinary committee is set up.

877
00:49:09,118 --> 00:49:11,238
Otherwise, I'll be expelled.
(whimpering)

878
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,328
That's not your thing.

879
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:16,958
(clears throat)

880
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:19,338
I'm sorry, but you'll have to do it
on your own.

881
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:21,418
I hate getting involved
in others' business.

882
00:49:22,008 --> 00:49:24,088
That's not true. You like it.

883
00:49:24,168 --> 00:49:27,428
The girls said you were like a hero.
You meddled with my sister's business too.

884
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:30,258
-I had no choice then. But now...
-I am...

885
00:49:30,678 --> 00:49:32,018
an innocent citizen.

886
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:37,768
Will you just sit back and watch
an innocent citizen suffer like this?

887
00:49:37,898 --> 00:49:38,768
(quirky music)

888
00:49:38,858 --> 00:49:41,068
You shouldn't be like that.

889
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:45,148
If you want to be a cop,
you should protect innocent citizens.

890
00:49:45,238 --> 00:49:47,908
Could there be any better reason
why you should help me?

891
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:49,618
(scoffs)

892
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:54,198
(zipper zips)

893
00:50:05,508 --> 00:50:06,338
(both gasp)

894
00:50:06,758 --> 00:50:08,338
(both grunting)

895
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:10,888
(breathes heavily)

896
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:12,388
(grunts)

897
00:50:15,428 --> 00:50:16,728
(breathing heavily)

898
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:19,768
-TAK: Were you caught?
-Gosh, we were almost caught.

899
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:26,028
-That's so many.
-One for each of us.

900
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:29,608
What if they notice it?

901
00:50:29,698 --> 00:50:32,198
Even if they do,
they wouldn't know it's us.

902
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:33,158
(both laugh)

903
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,118
(knocks on door)

904
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:39,418
DAEIL: But there's no such thing
as a perfect crime.

905
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:44,798
(knocks on door)

906
00:50:48,468 --> 00:50:50,048
(knocking on door continues)

907
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:52,468
May I help...

908
00:50:53,558 --> 00:50:54,388
(grunts)

909
00:50:55,098 --> 00:50:56,098
All right.

910
00:50:57,058 --> 00:50:58,518
My, you're one good-looking boy.

911
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:03,688
It was you, right?
The ones who stole my cup noodles.

912
00:51:05,778 --> 00:51:06,988
DAEIL: She was...

913
00:51:07,778 --> 00:51:09,988
Mrs. Sherlock.

914
00:51:11,028 --> 00:51:13,658
THREE DAYS BEFORE THE ARREST

915
00:51:17,748 --> 00:51:20,118
One, two, three, four,

916
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:23,708
five, six...

917
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:25,548
Six...

918
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,298
Oh, boy.

919
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,178
LET US BORROW SOME OF YOUR NOODLES...

920
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:54,488
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ARREST

921
00:51:56,118 --> 00:51:57,908
(janitress exhales sharply)

922
00:52:01,408 --> 00:52:04,128
DAEIL: She realized the cup noodles
in the pantry room were disappearing,

923
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,878
so she started to observe
people around the room.

924
00:52:14,638 --> 00:52:18,808
♪ The person ♪

925
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:24,398
♪ In a yellow shirt... ♪

926
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,278
Is it her?

927
00:52:34,278 --> 00:52:36,698
NAMGI: A special fluorescent material
was used to solve this case,

928
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,198
which is not visible to the naked eye.

929
00:52:38,658 --> 00:52:40,198
DAEIL: She got
a special fluorescent material.

930
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:42,408
Then when it's under UV light,

931
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:44,618
and applied it on the cup noodles.

932
00:53:08,898 --> 00:53:09,818
(door closes)

933
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,338
(suspenseful music)

934
00:53:33,798 --> 00:53:34,628
(gasps)

935
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:36,008
(laughs)

936
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:38,928
I got you, you punks.

937
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:45,188
DAEIL: We stole the cup noodles,
having no idea we fell into her trap.

938
00:53:46,688 --> 00:53:48,188
-May I help...
-DAEIL: And...

939
00:53:49,228 --> 00:53:52,278
-she caught us red-handed.
-JANITRESS: It was you, right?

940
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:53,988
JANITRESS: The ones who stole
my cup noodles.

941
00:53:54,738 --> 00:53:57,358
There will be a brief inspection.

942
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,698
Let me see your hands.

943
00:54:00,328 --> 00:54:01,448
Good. I can see it very well.

944
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,448
My goodness.

945
00:54:05,748 --> 00:54:06,958
You punks.

946
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:11,088
They say the sparrow
near a school sings the primer.

947
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:15,418
I've been cleaning at this school
for 30 years now. Okay?

948
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:19,588
I've been listening to these lectures
of criminal investigation for years.

949
00:54:20,468 --> 00:54:23,098
Now, get on your knees!

950
00:54:23,558 --> 00:54:25,478
Move. Move!

951
00:54:26,518 --> 00:54:27,978
Hands up. Come on.

952
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:30,148
-Hands...
-That must hurt.

953
00:54:30,228 --> 00:54:31,898
Go easy now.
(chuckles)

954
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:38,738
EUNKANG: Ari said she found the spy cam
in front of the cafeteria.

955
00:54:39,278 --> 00:54:41,618
Which means it was already in the jacket.

956
00:54:42,118 --> 00:54:43,658
(breathes deeply)

957
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,448
(suspenseful music)

958
00:54:46,618 --> 00:54:48,158
Maybe it was planted in the cafeteria.

959
00:54:55,088 --> 00:54:58,088
No, that's not it.
Then Ari must have seen it.

960
00:54:58,168 --> 00:54:59,048
Hmm...

961
00:55:00,178 --> 00:55:02,298
We had a martial arts class
in the morning, right?

962
00:55:02,718 --> 00:55:03,638
It's not there.

963
00:55:04,308 --> 00:55:06,598
We all put our jackets in the cabinets
and locked them.

964
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,518
(metal clanking)

965
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:12,228
EUNKANG: And I put it on again
right after the class.

966
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,438
Nobody would have been able
to put anything in there.

967
00:55:16,278 --> 00:55:18,648
-Maybe the jacket was switched.
-What?

968
00:55:18,738 --> 00:55:20,988
Maybe it wasn't that
someone put it in your jacket

969
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,448
but your jacket had been switched.

970
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:25,698
Switched? When...

971
00:55:27,498 --> 00:55:29,208
It was just a hypothetical question.

972
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:31,248
She's so annoying

973
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:41,838
EUNKANG: Right. If it wasn't Ari's...

974
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:44,638
Whose is it?

975
00:55:46,558 --> 00:55:48,638
-What do I do now?
-NAMGI: Don't worry.

976
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:51,388
There were no security cameras there,
so no one would know it was you.

977
00:55:51,478 --> 00:55:53,228
I might be in trouble.

978
00:55:54,478 --> 00:55:55,318
(sighs)

979
00:55:55,688 --> 00:55:57,648
Whatever, I don't know.

980
00:55:57,728 --> 00:56:00,398
I was just doing as you said.
Even if someone finds out, I'm not...

981
00:56:01,988 --> 00:56:03,568
POLICE

982
00:56:07,078 --> 00:56:08,828
Hey. Who's there?

983
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,958
I think I'm lost.
I'm looking for the dorm.

984
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:14,538
The dorm is that way.

985
00:56:14,628 --> 00:56:15,538
(chuckles)

986
00:56:15,628 --> 00:56:16,788
Hurry and go.

987
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:19,958
It's time for roll call soon.
You're not supposed to wander around here.

988
00:56:20,048 --> 00:56:21,218
Yes, sir.

989
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:23,548
(ominous music)

990
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:27,928
(thrilling music)

991
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,488
EUNKANG: If Ari took the jacket
because she thought it was hers,

992
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:42,818
it has to be someone
who used the cabinet nearby.

993
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,158
I'm not interested.

994
00:56:45,738 --> 00:56:47,698
We're not allowed
to date other students anyway.

995
00:56:49,488 --> 00:56:52,618
EUNKANG: The person who left the jacket
right next to her was...

996
00:56:54,168 --> 00:56:55,378
I'm done.

997
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:57,248
EUNKANG: Maybe she's busy.

998
00:56:57,338 --> 00:56:59,838
No, she's not.
We all have the same schedule.

999
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:07,348
(sighs)

1000
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,428
PORTABLE FLASHLIGHT

1001
00:57:11,268 --> 00:57:12,808
(suspenseful music)

1002
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:24,528
If the camera was rolling...

1003
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,778
-Sorry, sir!
-Sorry, sir!

1004
00:57:26,858 --> 00:57:27,738
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

1005
00:57:27,818 --> 00:57:29,778
EUNKANG: There's got to be
a charger somewhere.

1006
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:31,828
Where did she put it?

1007
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:36,248
(suspenseful tense music)

1008
00:57:53,018 --> 00:57:53,888
(object clatters)

1009
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:13,748
(suspenseful tense music continues)

1010
00:58:54,238 --> 00:58:55,828
(music intensifies)

1011
00:59:04,048 --> 00:59:05,048
(doorknob clicks)

1012
00:59:15,008 --> 00:59:16,268
(door opens)

1013
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:24,818
(closing theme music)
