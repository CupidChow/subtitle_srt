JASMIN
HOW NOT TO FAIL YOUR FIRST KISS

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,514
(uplifting music continues)

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,725
(page rifles)

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,937
5 WAYS NOT TO FAIL YOUR FIRST KISS

6
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,524
EUNKANG: I once read from a book

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,153
that the moment comes at unexpected times.

8
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:30,739
(gunshot)

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,452
(sloshing)

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,121
(gasps)
Yes!

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,461
(uplifting music)

12
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,555
And that I shouldn't avoid it.

13
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,894
(uplifting music continues)

14
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,150
An eyelash.

15
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,155
(reflective music)

16
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,949
(sighs)

17
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,369
(in a low voice)
I must have lost my mind...

18
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,247
(exhales sharply)

19
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,333
(sighs, mumbling)

20
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,588
(thuds)

21
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,216
(groans)

22
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,262
(crickets creaking)

23
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,389
(reflective music continues)

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,976
(heart-pounding)

25
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,236
(heart-pounding rapidly)

26
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,781
An eyelash.

27
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,789
(laughs)

28
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,753
EUNKANG: That night,
someone was excited...

29
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,133
NEW YORK SCHOOL OF FASHION ART

30
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,218
(reflective music continues)

31
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,887
(breathes heavily)

32
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,560
(sniffles)

33
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,232
...while someone else was
preparing a goodbye.

34
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,777
So when are you leaving?

35
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,405
After this semester.

36
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,907
Are you sure you won't regret this?

37
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,368
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,996
SUNYU: It may be late,

39
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,415
but I want to do what I want.

40
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,625
(emotive music)

41
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,381
(sighs)

42
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:05,310
EUNKANG: As the flowers bloom and wither,
spring was also leaving campus.

43
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,813
(theme music)

44
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,200
EPISODE 7

45
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,369
INSIK: Freshmen,
assemble in the yard immediately.

46
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,329
(Tak snoring)

47
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:28,458
INSIK: Freshmen, put your uniforms on
and assemble in the yard in five minutes.

48
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,126
(Tak snoring)

49
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,337
Tak.

50
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,506
Tak.

51
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,468
Hey. Get up.

52
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,929
SEUNGHYUN: Get changed.

53
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,723
(upbeat music)

54
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,904
(upbeat music continues)

55
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,247
(sighs)

56
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,374
-Hey. It's an emergency muster.
-(exclaims)

57
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,292
So it wasn't a dream.

58
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,628
BUMJU: Hurry up.

59
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,049
(upbeat music continues)

60
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,432
Gosh!

61
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,060
Hey, Juyoung. Get up!

62
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,437
It's 3 a.m., and we need to assemble.
Come on. Hurry.

63
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,106
We need to hurry.

64
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,694
(upbeat music)

65
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,620
BUMJU: Run!

66
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,249
(students clamoring)

67
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,884
(upbeat music continues)

68
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,804
(grunts)

69
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,900
BE A WARNING TO THE PEOPLE

70
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,027
(music fades)

71
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,406
(tense music)

72
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,503
Hey, Daeil.

73
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,595
(exhales sharply)

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,690
(tense music continues)

75
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,279
INSIK: I said, five minutes!

76
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,572
STUDENTS: Sorry, sir!

77
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,491
Lazy bastards.

78
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,958
You. What's this?

79
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,338
Right. I was rushing and...

80
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,924
You get ten penalty points
and the rest gets five.

81
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,718
INSIK: Hand in a report on it
by the end of today. Understood?

82
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,969
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

83
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,806
(indistinct chattering)

84
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,853
(crockery clinks)

85
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,027
Where's Ari?

86
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,946
She went back to sleep again.

87
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,906
EUNKANG (sighs):
I didn't get any sleep either.

88
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,908
I'm glad my classes are in the afternoon.

89
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,244
If I had morning classes,
it would've been horrible.

90
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,206
(groans)
I hate that darn emergency muster.

91
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,458
It'll be the first thing I abolish
once I become a senior.

92
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,085
I want to abolish the penalty system.

93
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,089
I'm so sick of it.
I'm becoming a slave to penalty points.

94
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,132
Mm-hm.

95
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,217
I already got 45 points.

96
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,970
At this rate, it'll reach 100 in no time.

97
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,013
Mine is much worse.

98
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,099
I got over 70 points.

99
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,017
(objects clattering)

100
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,858
I heard the penalty points
would affect our grades too.

101
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,443
We're in serious trouble.

102
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,031
(quirky music)

103
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,076
Oh. Hey, Seunghyun.

104
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,494
I need to hand in a report.

105
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,455
Could you bring this
to Insik's room later?

106
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,456
Okay.

107
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,419
-What did you order?
-I ordered some books online.

108
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,838
RECIPIENT: WI SEUNGHYUN

109
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,841
(rustling)

110
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,177
Hey.

111
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,638
-This is yours. Here.
-Thanks.

112
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,352
(quirky music continues)

113
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,897
What was that?

114
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,274
Did something happen between you two?

115
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,651
What do you mean? Nothing happened.
(chuckles)

116
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,528
Then why can't you look at each other?

117
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,322
(gasps)

118
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,908
Maybe he has a sty.

119
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,159
(chuckles)

120
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,702
I guess so.

121
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,038
What's that?

122
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,166
(rhythmic upbeat music)

123
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,300
Wow.

124
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,344
(exclaiming)

125
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,095
She's indeed
a science high school graduate.

126
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,223
-She went to a science high school?
-You didn't know?

127
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,601
She's definitely
a science high school graduate.

128
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,563
(upbeat music continues)

129
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,401
There.

130
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,238
(group applauding)

131
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,241
Sports festival?

132
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,243
We're having
Cheongram Sports Festival soon.

133
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,204
I heard they're going to film it
with the drone and post it online.

134
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,914
Oh, so you're in charge of this?

135
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,125
Yes. Ari will be commentating,
and I'll control the drone.

136
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,045
A drone for a school festival?
That's too much.

137
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,046
Mm-mm.

138
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,674
It's not too much.
It's the school's biggest event.

139
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,803
Especially you, Eunkang,
have to put everything into this festival.

140
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,971
Huh?

141
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,973
It's a golden opportunity
to make a fresh start.

142
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,809
The winner gets 100 points.

143
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,187
That's more than enough
to deduct all the penalty points you got.

144
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,482
You can deduct your penalty points
with the prize points.

145
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,608
Did you know this?

146
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,403
(sighs)
Does it matter?

147
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,572
It won't be easy to win.

148
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,324
(exclaims)

149
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,040
(groups clamoring)

150
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,667
(whirring)

151
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,712
(upbeat music)

152
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,550
I should at least join a team
that has a good chance,

153
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,385
but that's not something I can control.

154
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,724
EUNKANG: A team that has a good chance?
Is there a front-running team?

155
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,933
JUYOUNG: There is.

156
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,435
EUNKANG: Which team is that?

157
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,520
DAEIL: The best team is...

158
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,981
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

159
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,483
...either one of the two.

160
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,363
First, Student Squad One,
where Jang Juchan is the leader.

161
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,825
He brings his team together
with his smooth leadership skills,

162
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,493
which is why his team has good teamwork.

163
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,579
GENTLE YET STRONG LEADERSHIP
JANG JUCHAN

164
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,081
But it doesn't mean he's always so gentle.

165
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,125
(crowd cheering)

166
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,960
(screaming)

167
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,964
DAEIL: He's as hard as nails
when it comes to competition.

168
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,508
(water splashes)

169
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,303
Juchan's team has always won.

170
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,056
But this year's game
will be hard to predict.

171
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,517
Because he and his legendary partner
are on different teams.

172
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,686
EUNKANG: "Legendary partner"?

173
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,564

HYUK: Head!

176
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,785
-HYUK: Head!
-MALE STUDENT: Head!

177
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,582
-DAEIL: Juchan's archrival...
-HYUK: Head!

178
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,751
DAEIL: ...Um Hyuk of Student Squad Two.

179
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,461
A COOL HEAD AND POWERFUL CHARISMA
UM HYUK

180
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,380
As you know, he's really good
at pushing people.

181
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:17,176
He pushes his team to the limit
and brings out the best in them.

182
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,428
He's like a general.

183
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:24,308
And Hyuk has two reliable assistants,
Sunyu and Insik.

184
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,185
Sunyu has always been

185
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,355
the winner of women's triathlon
since she entered the school.

186
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,149
She's the ace of KNPU.

187
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,111
(upbeat music continues)

188
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,864

189
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,743
(group clamoring)

190
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,834
So we should join one of the two.

191
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,794
-How do we do that?
-It's obvious.

192
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,507
We...

193
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,468
-don't have a choice.
-Damn it.

194
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,846
We'll be sorted
by our rooms automatically.

00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,524

KO EUNKANG

208
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,796
-We're on the same team.
-Of course. We're roommates.

209
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,715
What?

210
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,467
Of course. Right.

211
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,302
Let's crush them all.

212
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,303
(in English) Okay.

213
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,099
EUNKANG (in Korean): None of that matters.

214
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,269
No matter how good the guys are,
the women's games are the most important.

215
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,314
Even if the men win all the games
like volleyball, rugby, and trench fight,

216
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,817
if their female teammates suck
at the triathlon, they'll all lose.

217
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,737
The points you can get from women's games
are more than twice as high.

218
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,948
That's why the guys train
their female teammates.

219
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,950
Wait. Then who gives the training?

220
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,536
Depends on the team.
Your team might assign a trainer to you.

221
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,288
Or maybe you can ask someone personally.

222
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,042
Why? Is there someone
you'd like to train with?

223
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,044
No. But I know
who I don't want to do it with.

224
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,212
Yoo Daeil and Seo Bumju.

225
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,715
Those weaklings are on my team.
Seriously. Can you believe it?

226
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,925
(laughs)

227
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,968
-What about you? Who will you ask?
-Me?

228
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,179
(breathes heavily)
I'm not sure.

229
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,144
(footsteps receding)

230
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:34,814
Hanna?

231
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,899
It'd be nice if one of her colleagues
could take her.

232
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,860
As you know, none of the seniors
want to take her.

233
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,196
JUCHAN: Many of them still don't like her.

234
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,614
I'd love to do it myself,

235
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,950
but I don't have much time
to prepare for it.

236
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:47,952
Hmm...

237
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,039
-Would that be difficult?
-No, sir. Anything for the team.

238
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,542
Thanks, Seunghyun.

239
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,130
(indistinct chattering)

240
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,722
(indistinct chattering)

241
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,602
(clears throat)

242
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,148
My. Who should I ask?

243
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,026
Maybe not one of the seniors.
I might not be comfortable with them.

244
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,820
I guess I should ask one of my colleagues.

245
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,655
No. Seniors will be better.

246
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,200
Are we meeting in front of the dorm
after class tomorrow?

247
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,119
-Yes.
-Okay. I'll see you then.

248
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,754
-Are you helping her with the training?
-Yes.

249
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,966
Man. You're a hero.

250
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,472
(indistinct chattering)

251
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,933

252
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,774
Professor Cha wants to see you
after class.

253
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,319
Okay. Thanks.

it over this time,

261
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,718
but don't you ever let others
provoke you again.

262
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,137
You even got accepted
through special admission for athletes.

263
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,388
You need to be extra careful.

264
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,308
Your one mistake can abolish
the special admission.

265
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,811
-I'll keep that in mind, sir.
-Those who work in uniform...

266
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,772
should always be careful.

267
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,025
-That's the weight of responsibility.
-Yes, sir.

268
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,861
I checked your school records.

269
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,447
You played judo in high school.

270
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,283
Why did you decide to come to KNPU?

271
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,870
-My brother went to this school.
-Is your brother a graduate here?

272
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,497
He didn't graduate.

A week before he graduated,

276
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,634
he had died in an accident.
That's ten years ago.

286

It's okay, sir.

287
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,094
Are you alone then?

288
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,640
No, sir. I have a grandmother
and a little brother in Gimhae.

Come on. Eat more.

292
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,525
Hey. He'll be watching
the security cameras all night.

293
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,068
Being full will only make him sleepy.

294
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,114
Sir.

295
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,743
Don't you think you're being
too harsh on him?

296
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,703
Look at his eyes. They're all red.

297
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,372
POLICE OFFICER: He's been watching
the security cameras for days.

298
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,498
Then you do it.

299
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,127
Oh, no. A mosquito.
(groans)

300
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,213
By the way, sir.

301
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,966
Which class were you in?

302
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,471
Don't suck up to me
because we went to the same school.

303
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,265
Nepotism is what I hate the most.

304
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,100
Sorry, sir.

305
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,352

How are you doing?

313
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,986
I'm a sergeant on my last leg.

314
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,155
I'm also graduating soon,
so I have a lot of free time.

00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,950
Right, sir.

316
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,536
I heard you're on
Seoul's Drug Investigations Unit.

317
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,329
I head from Constable Park.

Yes, sir.

00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,273
My name is Kim Hyunsoo,
and I'm a fourth-year law student at KNPU.

00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,989
Lieutenant Cha told me about you.

328
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,200
He said you're a brilliant
and responsible person.

329
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,535
I'm flattered, sir.

330
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,373
We're planning an operation.

331
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,671
(foreboding music continues)

332
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,759
(police siren wailing in distance)

333
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:45,517
THE LATE KIM HYUNSOO

334
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,042
(thrilling music)

335
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,350
(thrilling music continues)

336
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,697
(dramatic music)

337
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,582
UGON: But he was following your orders.

338
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,043
You should at least go to his funeral.

339
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,129
CAPTAIN OF DRUG INVESTIGATIONS UNIT
WI GIYONG

340
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,840
Officially, both my team and I

341
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,135
don't know that student.

342
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,679
(pen scribbling)

343
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,098
Is that so?

344
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,726
(dramatic music continues)

345
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,565
All right, sir.

346
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,913
(door opens)

347
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,207
(door shuts)

348
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,839
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

349
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:47,139
SCHOOL RECORDS
NAME: KIM TAK

350
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,684
(birds chirping)

351
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,941
STUDENT DORMITORY

352
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,486
(zipper rasps)

353
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:10,996
(door chimes open)

354
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,583
(door closes)

355
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,549
-(sighs)
-(cellphone buzzing)

356
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,717
(cellphone message tone)

357
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,225
Huh?

358
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,019
(footsteps approaching)

359
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,442
What do you mean by training?

360
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,528
You need to practice. It's only two weeks
until the sports festival.

361
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,073
I thought you were helping Hanna.

362
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,866
I was.

363
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,660
Then why are you helping me?
What about Hanna?

364
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,120
Well, Hanna...

365
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,039
(zipper rasping)

366
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,211
-I'll help Gi Hanna with the training.
-What?

367
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,089
(sucks teeth)

368
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,091
You can take care of Eunkang.

369
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,344
It seemed like she was
looking for a training partner.

370
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,555
Tak is helping her.

371
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,099
-Tak?
-Yes.

372
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,809
Let's go. We have a lot to do today.

373
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,769
Hey, wait.

374
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,272
Why? You don't want to do it with me?

375
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,736
(stammers)
No, that's not it...

376
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,864
(light music)

377
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,242
(sighs)

378
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,576
All right. Let's go.

379
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,372
I'm already out here. So why not?

380
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,462
EUNKANG: You want to ride this?

381
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,801
The first game of the triathlon is biking.

382
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:53,056
Consider it a lower-body exercise.
Let's go bike around this neighborhood.

383
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,770
I haven't ridden a bike in so long.
I'm not sure if I can ride it.

384
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,273
(dreamy music)

385
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,612
EUNKANG: Gosh. This is really nice.

386
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,073
I had no idea there was a place like this
near our school.

387
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,034
We're not here to hang out.
This is a part of training.

388
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,829
-It's a long course, so take it slow.
-Okay.

389
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,873
(Eunkang cheering, laughing)

390
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,542
SEUNGHYUN: Be careful.

391
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,752
(laughing)

392
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,921
(cheerful music)

393
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,300
(tire screeches)

394
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,887
All right. This is where
the uphill segment begins.

395
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,847
Take it slow.
Don't push yourself too hard.

396
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,266
Don't worry. This kind of thing
should be done at once.

397
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,601
Or you get tired soon.

398
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,145
SEUNGHYUN: I said, take it slow.

399
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,825
(music fades)

400
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,041
You're the weakest
and the least athletic freshmen.

401
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,667
You're in the bottom five percent.

402
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,046
By what standard, sir?

403
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,965
Based on your fitness scores
from the entrance exam.

404
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,092
(quirky music)

405
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,720
HYUK: You're supposed to be
excluded from the games,

406
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,264
but according to the regulations
of the sports festival,

407
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,309
all students must participate in
at least one game.

408
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,938
We won't have much time, but we,
seniors, will help you with training.

409
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,023
So bite the bullet and follow our lead.

410
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,274
Understood?

411
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,692
STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

412
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,902
Yoo Daeil. Seo Bumju.

413
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,028
BOTH: Yes, sir.

414
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,571
Choi Insik will be your trainer.

415
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:33,990
Follow me.

416
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,200
Shin Ari. Woo Juyoung.

417
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,201
BOTH: Yes, sir.

418
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,702
Baek Sunyu will be your trainer.

419
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,496
(in English, Korean) Okay. Follow me.

420
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,040
(in Korean)
And I'll take the remaining two.

421
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:42,958
Follow me.

422
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,254
Here.

423
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,216
(students chanting)

424
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,802
SUNYU: You're going to participate
in the Women's One-Leg Fight.

425
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,555
You need a strong lower body
and good balance to play this game.

426
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,306
So I want you to jump rope
1,000 times a day.

427
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,183
-One thousand...
-SUNYU: All right. Go.

428
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,687
(male students shouting indistinctly)

429
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,772
(quirky music)

430
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,444
(cellphone buzzing)

431
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:13,989
Yes.

432
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,198
Now?

433
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,659
Okay.

434
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,831
SUNYU: I need to go somewhere.
Keep practicing until I'm back.

435
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,292
Those have counters on them,
so no funny business.

436
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,334
BOTH: Yes, ma'am.

437
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,338
JUYOUNG: Darn.

438
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,382
(birds chirping)

439
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,679
(sighs, groans)

440
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,723
(clears throat)

441
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,890
Well, this is surprising.

442
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,101
-What?
-JUYOUNG: You're not bad.

443
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,519
Did you take a private lesson?

444
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,354
-Yes.
-Really?

445
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,399
To get a good grade in gym class
when I was in elementary school.

446
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,193
I also took rollerblading lessons
and kickball group lessons.

447
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,571
Looks like I still remember it
because I paid for it.

448
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,905
It's worth the money.

449
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:01,328
Those Gangnam kids spend money like water.

450
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,831
JUYOUNG: Hey. Is that Tak?

451
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,293
I guess Tak is helping Hanna
with the training.

452
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,754
I thought Seunghyun was helping her.
I guess they changed it.

453
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,176
(emotive music)

454
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,858
(emotive music continues)

455
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,572
(Hanna panting)

456
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,824
You run better than I thought.

457
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,370
I guess having company helps.
(breathes heavily)

458
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,663
(breathes heavily)

459
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,997
Let's call it a day.

460
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,708
You should take it easy on the first day.

461
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,001
Here.

462
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,711
Okay. Thanks.

463
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,672
Wait.

464
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,800
Why did you switch with Seunghyun?

465
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,969
Oh. He's helping Eunkang.

466
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,765
-Ko Eunkang?
-Why? Are you upset that we switched?

467
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,645
No. I was just curious. See you tomorrow.

468
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:09,813
Okay.

469
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,277
(tire whirring)

470
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,995
(grunts, clears throat)

471
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,583
(light music)

472
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,004
(panting)

473
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,133
(Eunkang breathes heavily)

474
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,638
(light music continues)

475
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,890
(panting)

476
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,643
(Eunkang grunts)

477
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,524
(Eunkang grunting, panting)

478
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,867
(panting, grunts)

479
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,290
-(sighs)
-(brakes squeal)

480
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,585
(groans)

481
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,256
Here.

482
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,301
(panting)

483
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,723
(exclaims)

484
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,434
EUNKANG (breathes heavily): Hey.

485
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,021
Why is this uphill road so long?
Where does it end?

486
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,398
I told you it's a long course.

487
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,983
And yet you would just speed up.

488
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,027
Well, I didn't know it'd be this long.

489
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,029
And when you take a difficult path,

490
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,157
you should just push yourself and
get it over with. With a fighting spirit.

491
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,409
You shouldn't drag it out.
Then you'll get tired.

492
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,703
Hey, not everything is
about having spirit.

493
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,413
SEUNGHYUN: That's why you easily tire out.

494
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,666
If you don't know where your path ends,
you should pace yourself.

495
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,543
-Only then you can finish the course.
-Okay.

496
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,170
Anyway, good luck.

497
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,088
It's a downhill slope soon,
so hang in there.

498
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,215
I'm off.

499
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:01,758
Hey.

500
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,010
Hey, wait.

501
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,804
(Eunkang yelps)

502
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,224
EUNKANG: Hey! Wait up!

503
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,935
(emotive music)

504
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,314
Oh, no. I can't slow down!

505
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,275
(yelping)

506
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,153
(screaming)

507
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,655
(Eunkang laughing)

508
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,914
(Eunkang screaming)

509
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,466
(music fades)

510
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,595
-Let's take a short break here.
-EUNKANG: Okay.

511
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,559
(Eunkang clears throat)

512
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,686
-SEUNGHYUN: One second.
-My legs hurt.

513
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,647
-EUNKANG: What is that?
-Wait.

514
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,565
(Eunkang chuckles)

515
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,568
-What are you doing?
-SEUNGHYUN: Sit.

516
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,319
(Eunkang laughs)

517
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,406
(Eunkang exclaiming)

518
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,033
-I just did it since I had it.
-(laughs)

519
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,287
Well, this is nice.

520
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,496
SEUNGHYUN: It is.

521
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,790
-(birds chirping)
-(water trickling)

522
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,714
So, you do mountain biking
and shooting for fun.

523
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,800
You have many hobbies.
When did you have the time to study?

524
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,927
I'm not good at them, though.

525
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,804
I just tried them a bit.

526
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,015
Come on. You're just being modest.

527
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,308
(both chuckle)

528
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,559
(exclaiming)

529
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,312
EUNKANG: I also had so many things
I wanted to do.

530
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,480
(clicks tongue)
But only my sister got to go to academies.

531
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,026
Right. Are you an only child?

532
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,110
I have a big sister.

533
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,155
But she's been studying abroad
ever since she was little.

534
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,158
-So I grew up like an only child.
-Why didn't you go abroad?

535
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,285
Because my mom was lonely.

536
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,537
But she has your father.

537
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,582
My father is busy... all the time.

538
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,292
Ah...

539
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,502
(emotive music)

540
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,588
My father is a police officer.

541
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,590
-Really?
-Yes.

542
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,507
Wow.

543
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,636
Is that why you came here?
To become like your father?

544
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,220
(gasps)

545
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,140
You must be really close to him.

546
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:20,563
When I was little,
my father once gave me a pat on the head.

547
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,690
He barely gives out compliments,

548
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,236
but when I said I'd like to be
a police officer like him,

549
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,447
he seemed so proud.

550
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,241
I think that's when...

551
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,954
I started to dream of
becoming a police officer.

552
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,875
Your father must be really happy then.

553
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,835
Since you'll be an officer
after graduating.

554
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,129
-I hope so.
-EUNKANG: I'm sure he is.

555
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,507
Many parents want their children
to be civil servants.

556
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,926
Because they never get fired
and get a good pension.

557
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,428
My mom and dad also started
treating me differently

558
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,638
since I got into this school.

559
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,975
Before, they used to nag me all the time.

560
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,686
They called all their relatives
to brag about me.

561
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,022
I mean,
what are they going to do if I quit?

562
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,152
Don't quit.

563
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,531
Let's see through it to the end.

564
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,534
(emotive music continues)

565
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,203
(birds chirping)

566
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,540
(clears throat)

567
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,457
(sucks teeth)

568
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:22,917
I'll think about it.

569
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,463
If I stay here until I graduate,

570
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,258
it would be because of
what you said today.

571
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,676
(both chuckle)

572
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,764
(leaves rustling)

573
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,891
(music fades)

574
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,020
(indistinct chatter)

575
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,149
Jeez.

576
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,152
-I saw you practicing with Hanna.
-Yes, I'm training her.

577
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,697
So? How's it going?

578
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,575
Well, she's more athletic than I thought.

579
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,119
Really?

580
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,288
Okay.

581
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,332
-Good luck.
-Okay. Good luck to you too.

582
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,003
(quirky music)

583
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,880
I want to do it too.

584
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,924
-What?
-The training. I want you to train me too.

585
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,802
-But you're not on my team.
-So what? You don't want to do it?

586
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,513
No, I mean...

587
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,308
Shouldn't you practice
with people from your team?

588
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,350
No?

589
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,520
-Others will think it's strange and...
-Yes or no?

590
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,813
Tell me your answer.

591
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,649
I'm afraid that will be difficult.

592
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,110
I won't have enough time
to help two people.

593
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,404
(quirky music continues)

594
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,867
Okay.

595
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,037
(footsteps receding)

596
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,002
SEONGHYUN: Sounds like she likes you.

597
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,963
-No way. Why would she like me?
-Why would she be upset then?

598
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,633
I think she's jealous
because you're training another girl.

599
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,720
-Okay.
-Come on.

600
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,015
(in English) Yes!

601
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,645
-(in Korean) Stop cheating.
-I'm just that good.

602
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,439
-How was training? Was it all right?
-It was all right.

603
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,358
-What did you do?
-Biking.

604
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,485
TAK: You had a date.

605
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,821
(scoffs)
It was training. It was tough.

606
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,032
Come on. We both know that's a lie.
I know you like Eunkang.

607
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,076
-No, I don't.
-TAK: Like hell, you don't.

608
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,994
You may fool others,
but you can't fool me.

609
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,288
I'm sensitive
and very astute about these things.

610
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,873
(clicks tongue)
I get what's going on.

611
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,043
Keep it a secret.

612
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,294
SEUNGHYUN: Hey.

613
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,548
If you're so astute,
how could you not know Ari likes you?

614
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,259
Well, because
there's no reason for her to like me.

615
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,594
She's so smart and pretty.

616
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,764
Hey. You should be more confident.
It's all about confidence.

617
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,975
-Mind your own business.
-What?

618
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,435
Be confident and ask her out.
Do you want me to call her out?

619
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,353
-Hey.
-Eunkang!

620
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,271
Hey!

621
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,355
SEONGHYUN: You little!

622
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,731
-Eunkang!
-Ari!

623
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,191
Ari!

624
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,652
Ari... Ari!

625
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,695
Shin Ari!

626
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,904
Ari!

627
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,364
-Eunkang!
-Ari!

628
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,533
-You...
-Eunkang!

629
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,619
You...

630
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,372
-Eunkang!
-Ari!

631
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,040
(both laughing)

632
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,667
Darn it. Are you okay?

633
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,127
-SEUNGHYUN: Shin Ari!
-TAK: Ko...

634
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,421
-TAK: Ko Eunkang!
-SEUNGHYUN: Shin Ari!

635
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,548
(Tak coughs)

636
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,800
(dramatic music)

637
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,636
What are you doing?

638
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,015
Oh. Just some tonic for Seunghyun.
I packed some snacks too.

639
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,018
You said you're having a special lecture
at his school tomorrow.

640
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,644
Please make sure to give this to him.

641
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,939
I'm not going there for fun.
I won't have time for that.

642
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,151
Come on. Just call him out for a second...

643
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,363
Or maybe I should go with you.

644
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,282
(breathes deeply)

645
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,161
It's just...
(clicks tongue)

646
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,456
I miss Seunghyun, that's all.

647
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,373
(clears throat)

648
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,293
He hasn't come home for three weeks now,
and doesn't even call.

649
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,297
Gosh. I can't believe
this is how he repays his mother's love.

650
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,633
No news is good news.

651
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,510
He's not coming
because he's enjoying school.

652
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,054
Do you think so?

653
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,515
What time is the special lecture tomorrow?

654
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,392
AUDITORIUM

655
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,019
JUCHAN: Everyone, stand up.

656
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,523
Salute to the dean.

657
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,192
STUDENTS: Salute!

658
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,362
Salute.

659
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,240
At ease.

660
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,743
JUCHAN: At ease.

661
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,121
(chairs thud)

662
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,668
It seems like yesterday
when the new semester started,

663
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,378
but we're already halfway through.

664
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,130
SUNYEONG: Especially this year,
there had been many changes

665
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,840
inside and outside of school,

666
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,761
which probably confused some of you.

667
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,348
So today, we invited one of your seniors

668
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:51,936
who will give you valuable advice
on what you should prepare

669
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,814
as future police executives,
in this fast-changing world.

670
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,024
Let me proudly introduce your senior,

671
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,568
a KNPU graduate of Class 15,
Commissioner Wi Giyong

672
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,487
of the East Gyeonggi Provincial
Police Agency.

673
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,198
Please welcome him
with a big round of applause.

674
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,617
(students applauding)

675
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,253
Hello, my juniors.

676
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,921
STUDENTS: Hello, sir!

677
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,717
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

678
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,468
As you'll probably experience yourself

679
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,554
when you actually start
working in the field,

680
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,473
one of the most frustrating things
that can happen to cops

681
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,102
is when arrest warrants are rejected
for no apparent reason.

682
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,438
While the arrest warrants
are rejected and requested again,

683
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,064
the criminals destroy the evidence,

684
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,276
and eventually,
the cops miss this golden hour.

685
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,529
According to Article 12,
Paragraph 3 of the Constitution,

686
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:49,076
only prosecutors have the authority
to request arrest warrants.

687
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,037
The police believe

688
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,999
that the prosecution's exclusive right
to request arrest warrants

689
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:58,836
is one of the fundamental reasons
of corruption.

690
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:03,090
It's unfair that they have all the rights
to request arrest warrants.

691
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,550
(clears throat)

692
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,137
(sips)

693
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,222
-(cup clinks)
-(dramatic music)

694
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,223
(Giyong clears throat)

695
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,391
That's about it.

696
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,642
Do you have any questions?

697
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,442
(dramatic music continues)

698
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:22,902
You.

699
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,490
I'm a KNPU freshman,
and my name is Wi Seunghyun.

700
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,408
I agree

701
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,620
that a lack of checks
on the power of prosecutors is a problem.

702
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,081
But if the reason
for the prosecution's corruption

703
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,791
is the right to request arrest warrants,

704
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:40,336
when the police are given the same right,
it can corrupt them too.

705
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,798
How can we prevent
the corruption of police?

706
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,760
(dramatic music)

707
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,265
That should

708
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,476
not happen.

709
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,605
Which is why your role is important.

710
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,275
GIYONG: The controversy
between the prosecution

711
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,195
and the police over jurisdiction
may be seen as a power struggle.

712
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,532
At the end of the day, the structural
reform of the investigation system

713
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,951
can only be done by developing
competence for investigation.

714
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,830
In the near future, we'll have
the National Bureau of Investigation

715
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,832
in Korea, just like the FBI in the US.

716
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,419
I want you to build
expertise in your field

717
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,422
and eventually grow
into a professional investigator

718
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,257
when the day comes.

719
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,552
(students applauding)

720
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,183
(dramatic music)

721
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,236
Thank you so much for coming, sir.
I know how busy you are.

722
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,320
GIYONG: Don't mention it.

723
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,073
I haven't seen young students in a while.

724
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,576
Seeing them reminded me of my past.
It was nice.

725
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,827
(both laughing)

726
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,164
This is probably why you're in school.

727
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,165
(both laugh)

728
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,209
Well, it is indeed nice
to be around young people,

729
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,712
but young people these days are not easy.

730
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,965
They don't blindly accept
what the school says.

731
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,552
They would even break into my office
if they have something to say.

732
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,511
(Giyong chuckles)

733
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,306
Well, we had students like them too
when we were young.

734
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,310
Kids around this age
are ignorant of the real world.

735
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,897
Which is why the school plays
a crucial role.

736
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,399
We need to tame these kids.

737
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,696
(dramatic music)

738
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,406
I'll do my best, sir.

739
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,367
Oh, no. I hope I didn't sound
like I was pressuring you.

740
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:41,290
Please think of it as a parent's concern.

741
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,875
Don't worry.

742
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:47,546
The billiards hall incident has been
smoothed over.

743
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,049
There won't be any more big trouble.

744
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,842
"The billiards hall incident"?

745
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:57,431
SEUNGHYUN: I'm sorry. I didn't tell you
because I didn't want to worry you.

746
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,184
It soon turned out
it was just a misunderstanding and...

747
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,479
GIYONG: I think you shouldn't
hang out with that boy called Kim Tak.

748
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,692
He was trying to protect me.

749
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,861
-He's a good friend.
-A good friend

750
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,780
doesn't put his friends in danger.

751
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,156
(sighs)

752
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,285
Cops who get involved with corruption
and resign weren't always bad people.

753
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,206
They resign because they can't
turn their backs on old friends,

754
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,833
because they feel sorry
and want to return favors.

755
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,255
A friend who cannot control his temper

756
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:32,633
will put you in trouble one day.

757
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,804
Choose your friends wisely.

758
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,098
(dramatic music)

759
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,643
He's my friend.

760
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,562
I'll take care of it myself.

761
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,314
I'll go now.

762
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,405
(dramatic music continues)

763
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,703
We should've called
Seunghyun and Tak over too.

764
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,081
I would have too
if we had four drumsticks.

765
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:07,334
-We only have two.
-Then order one more chicken.

766
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,586
Jeez...

767
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,255
Hey.
(munching)

768
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,716
This is not about money.

769
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,261
DAEIL: This is a quasi-state of war.

770
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:20,097
They're our enemies who we'll be
fighting against in the finals.

771
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,974
We can't eat with our enemies.

772
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,312
Stay strong. Okay?

773
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,189
Don't even look at them
until the sports festival is over.

774
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,774
Just don't do anything. Okay?

775
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,651
Okay.

776
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,403
MYEONGHUN: Did you see Wi Seunghyun

777
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,238
challenging his father
at the special lecture?

778
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,619
Looks like they don't get along.

779
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,329
INSIK: Hey, they're putting on a show.

780
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,832
-He met his father after the lecture.
-What?

781
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,418
I saw him getting out
of the Commissioner's car.

782
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,837
MYEONGHUN: Well, having such
a powerful father,

783
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,422
I'm sure he has nothing to fear.

784
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,548
INSIK: Of course.

785
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,550
-No way.
-Gosh.

786
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,177
That's just ridiculous...

787
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,721
I mean, his name is Wi Seunghyun.

788
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,097
What was the Commissioner's name?

789
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,058
-Wi Giyong.
-Wi Gi...

790
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,143
(foreboding music sting)

791
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:08,979
(Seunghyun exclaiming)

792
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,148
Is it a special day today?

793
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,733
(shredding)

794
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,446
No, it's not.
I think of you whenever I eat good food.

795
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,406
(quirky music)

796
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,617
Eat up.

797
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,703
You must be tired from
practicing for the sports festival.

798
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,541
Here.

799
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,712
-Thanks.
-Sure.

800
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,215
(Seunghyun munching)

801
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,175
(clears throat)

802
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,346
Though we have to be enemies
for the time being by a quirk of fate,

803
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,514
we are actually one.

804
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,224
We're like brothers. No,

805
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,893
even real brothers aren't
as close as we are.

806
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,395
-Isn't that right?
-Yeah.

807
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,773
(sighs)
I see what's going on. Trying to bribe us.

808
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,484
-You'll ask us something weird again...
-Bribing? I'm...

809
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,364
I'm not bribing you. Stop talking
like that. You're hurting my feelings.

810
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,282
I even prepared this for us.

811
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,909
DAEIL: Look.

812
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,539
They're friendship rings.

813
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:09,832
-What?
-What?

814
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,625
-Grab him.
-Excuse me.

815
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,668
-What...
-Just a second.

816
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,253
Hey, wait. No.

817
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,213
We're more than just friends. Okay?

818
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,425
Let's always be good friends.
Let's be friends forever.

819
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,052
Here. Bumju.

820
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,805
All right. This is for me.

821
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,889
Tak.

822
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,015
(ring clanks)

823
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,308
Have you lost your mind?

824
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,102
(crickets creaking)

825
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,479
Let me put it on your finger.

826
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,983
Give me your finger.
Come on. Give me your finger.

827
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,360
Give me your finger!
Just give me your finger...

828
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,195
(grunting)
Hey!

829
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,698
(Tak screaming)
My finger!

830
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,616
-SEUNGHYUN: Eat up.
-DAEIL: Put it on!

831
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,077
DAEIL: Put it on your finger.

832
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,956
Well, that was hard.

833
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,419
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

834
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,298
(indistinct chatter)

835
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,186
(quirky music)

836
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,270
(sighs)

837
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,696
(quirky music continues)

838
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,164
Is this seat available?

839
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,416
Yes.

840
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,758
EUNKANG: Oh, boy.

841
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,470
You're finally going home this week.

842
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:49,181
-You always stayed at school.
-Right.

843
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,558
JUCHAN: You haven't gone home
in a while either.

844
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,268
Your mom was worried you didn't call.

845
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,562
-EUNKANG: Did you talk to my mom?
-JUCHAN: Yes.

846
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,273
JUCHAN: She said I should come over
this evening to try the new menu.

847
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,859
(gasps)
She called you too?

848
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:04,071
My gosh!
She's making a huge deal about it.

849
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,156
(quirky music)

850
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,452
It's okay. I didn't have any plans anyway.

851
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,412
I haven't seen her in a while,
so it'd be nice.

852
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,374
EUNKANG (laughs): I can't believe her.

853
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,711
(engine revs)

854
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,676
(engine revving)

855
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,556
(light music)

856
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,317
(beeping)

857
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:50,993
(door chimes)

858
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,414
Hey.

859
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,292
-Hi.
-HANNA'S MOTHER: Have you eaten?

860
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,045
I'm not hungry.

861
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,092
(door closes)

862
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,556
(seering)

863
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,100
It's okay. I don't want to eat much.

864
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,727
HANNA'S MOTHER:
It's your first time back home.

865
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,021
I don't want you complaining
about no soup on the table.

866
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,564
Even if I did, you wouldn't listen.

867
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,400
Gosh.

868
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,113
Why do you have to put it like that?
That's heartless.

869
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,197
How rude.

870
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,952
Call Detective Kang.

871
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,162
(chair scrapes)

872
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,833
I got into a fight with a customer
who wanted to pay later on a tab.

873
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:44,171
So I went to the police station,
and Detective Kang was there.

874
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,758
-Did you ask him for help again?
-He recognized me and came to me first.

875
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,678
Anyway, thanks to him, I got all the money
that the customer owed me.

876
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,763
Mom.

877
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,514
So hurry and graduate.

878
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,891
Once you become a cop,

879
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,019
I won't have to ask others for help.

880
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,396
(Hanna sighs)

881
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:04,942
Don't worry.
I can help her with those things.

882
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,444
Tell her to let me know
if she's in trouble again.

883
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,196
But I have to run your errands then.

884
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,033
You seem pretty angry.

885
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,620
I understand.

886
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,623
You can't enjoy your college life
because of what I asked you.

887
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,500
HANNA: I'm not there to have fun.

888
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,252
But I'm not there
to run your errands either.

889
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:25,879
I just...

890
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,134
want to live my own life.

891
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,262
Hanna, once you learn
why I'm asking you this...

892
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,848
I'm not interested in why you're doing it.

893
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,268
I did it because I trusted you.
There's no other reason.

894
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:44,314
But I'm not sure
how long I'll be able to trust you.

895
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,192
Whenever I trust someone,

896
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,903
it never ends well.

897
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,827
(birds chirping)

898
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,127
(uplifting music)

899
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,472
(uplifting music continues)

900
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,891
(sizzling)

901
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,357
(crunches)

902
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,113
(uplifting music)

903
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,161
How much longer?

904
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,663
YANGCHEOL: It's almost ready!

905
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,373
(in English) Okay.

906
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,208
(in Korean) Here it comes.

907
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,628
Come on. Take one each.

908
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,797
-JUCHAN: Thank you.
-Thank you.

909
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,175
-MIKANG: Thank you.
-Be careful. It's hot.

910
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,010
MIKANG: Thank you.

911
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,219
(exclaims)

912
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,598
How is it? It's a very special chicken.

913
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,059
The chicken was fed
organic blueberries only.

914
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,351
Do chickens eat that?

915
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,187
They're omnivorous. They eat bananas too.

916
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,730
YANGCHUL: Right. Bananas.

917
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,900
I told the owner of the chicken farm
that he should feed them some bananas.

918
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:13,153
Apparently, bananas are
really good for your immune system.

919
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,947
I don't think
it'll make much difference, though.

920
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:19,117
They're much better than those
that weren't fed bananas.

921
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,788
People these days are really sensitive
about their well-being and their food.

922
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,665
So tell me. Do the drumsticks
taste like blueberries?

923
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,918
It only tastes like oil.

924
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,130
But it's tasty and well-seasoned.
It's crispy too.

925
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,299
Then try this one.

926
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,385
YANGCHUL: It's sweet
and sour lemon chicken.

927
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:41,056
Dad, but doesn't this menu already exist?
I think I've seen it somewhere.

928
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,643
It's the sauce.
Our sauce tastes different.

929
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:48,146
We put a lot of lemons
in this sauce. So...

930
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,273
(quirky music)

931
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,569
It doesn't taste greasy at all.

932
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,322
(all laughing)

933
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,365
I'm not sure.

934
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,992
The batter feels a little different.
It's a little chewier.

935
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,286
-Because it's made with sticky rice.
-I see.

936
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,622
I think this will sell well.

937
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,874
It's a good alternative
for those who can't eat pork.

938
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,084
Do you think so?

939
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:10,544
Right?

940
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,421
Honey, we should listen to Juchan.

941
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,882
Juchan is a very prudent boy.
When he says something,

942
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,592
he says it for a reason.

943
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,719
-Okay.
-YANGCHUL: Okay.

944
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,514
So this is our new menu then.
It's decided!

945
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,391
-Decided.
-Decided!

946
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,308
(all laughing)

947
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,394
Are we done? I'm off.

948
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,854
-HUISUK: Where are you going?
-Home.

949
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:32,315
Sit. Juchan is visiting us today.
And we haven't seen him in a while.

950
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,693
Juchan. Are you free?

951
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,902
Sure.

952
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,576
-YANGCHUL: Cheers! Cheers. Good.
-EUNKANG: Cheers.

953
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,871
HUISUK: By the way, Juchan,
how come you are free this weekend?

954
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,414
You said you were busy.

955
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,624
Well, since I've become a senior,
I have more free time.

956
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,877
YANGCHUL: When you belong to a society,
the longer you stay in it,

957
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,961
the easier things get.

958
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,880
In schools, armies, and soccer clubs.

959
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,882
Even in prisons, someone I knew...

960
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,341
-Gosh.
-Okay. Forget this one.

961
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,219
You must have been really busy
if you had a girlfriend.

962
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,597
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-Pardon?

963
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,807
Mom, you're making him uncomfortable.

964
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,727
-He'll take care of it.
-Can't I even ask him a question?

965
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,063
Well, if he doesn't have a girlfriend,

966
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,568
I wanted to set you up. Do you have one?

967
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,362
(sighs)

968
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,907
(munching)

969
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,909
No. Not now.

970
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,911
HUISUK: "Not now"?

971
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,662
See? I told you.

972
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,039
YANGCHUL: Really?

973
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:32,918
Then what do you think of girls
who are older than you?

974
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:34,711
JUCHAN: Older...

975
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,379
(sighs)
I haven't really thought about it.

976
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,173
Then think about it now.

977
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,591
-Now?
-HUISUK: Yes.

978
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,969
People these days say
that older girls are more understanding,

979
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,430
so they barely fight
with their boyfriends.

980
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:49,226
Well, since a police officer's job is
rather formal and conservative,

981
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,311
a frank and easy-going type of girl

982
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,813
-would be a great match for you.
-She's right.

983
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,441
-Don't you think?
-Mom. What are you doing now?

984
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,318
-What?
-Are you...

985
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,029
trying to set him up with me?

986
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,197
(coughs)

987
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,323
What?

988
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,866
(gasps, exclaims)

989
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,370
Mikang is two years older than him.

990
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,413
MIKANG: Stop it.

991
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:14,125
-Do you want us to be in a love triangle?
-"A love triangle"?

992
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,754
Eunkang has a crush on Juchan.
Didn't you know that?

993
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,881
What are you talking about?

994
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,383
MIKANG: What? You do.

995
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,551
You went to that college because of him.

996
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:28,974
Mom. When he was her tutor,
she even stole my makeup.

997
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,434
And the pass candy you got from Juchan.

998
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:35,647
I only ate one,
and she pulled out a chunk of my hair!

999
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,024
Mikang, that's a long time ago.

1000
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,442
Now, I don't...

1001
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,153
The same profession? That's even better!

1002
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,364
It is!

1003
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,991
He's right. How nice is that?

1004
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,659
You can go and leave work together.

1005
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,412
You'll be able to understand
each other better. You won't fight much.

1006
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,080
HUISUK: Gosh! Eunkang!

1007
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,749
How could you not tell us
anything about this?

1008
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,001
That's not it.

1009
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,337
Seriously. It really isn't.

1010
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,589
-I'm sure she doesn't.
-"I'm sure she doesn't."

1011
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:02,716
Sure, let's say it's not.

1012
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,217
Gosh!

1013
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,220
MIKANG: Since this came up anyway,
I hope you get along.

1014
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,264
EUNKANG: Seriously.
I really don't like him.

1015
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,890
MIKANG: Yes, you do.
You even stole my clothes

1016
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,559
the other day before meeting Juchan.

1017
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,768
OPERATOR: The person
you have reached is...

1018
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,603
-She's not answering.
-(cellphone beeps)

1019
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,063
Did she go to bed already?

1020
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,402
(cellphone buzzing)

1021
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,947
-Hey.
-INSIK: Cheers!

1022
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,116
-Cheers! Today is the farewell party.
-Where are you?

1023
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,743
-Where is he?
-CUSTOMER: Another beer, please.

1024
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,827
OWNER: Okay.

1025
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,121
-(indistinct chattering)
-(crockery clinking)

1026
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,582
The seniors called me out.

1027
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,588
Daeil, can't you see all your seniors
are looking for you?

1028
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,381
I don't know. Hurry and come over.

1029
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,176
Why would I go there?
It's Student Squad Two's party.

1030
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,886
No, it's not.

1031
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,888
-Thank you, Sunyu.
-Okay. So...

1032
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:50,847
FEMALE STUDENT: Sir.

1033
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,557
I think this is
a farewell party for Sunyu.

1034
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,892
"A farewell party"?

1035
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,894
DAEIL: Insik got drunk and told me.

1036
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,563
Sunyu is going to study abroad
after this semester.

1037
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,274
Is she taking a year off?
Why would they throw a farewell party?

1038
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,485
No, she's not taking a year off.
She's going to study abroad.

1039
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,402
Study...

1040
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,113
She's quitting school!

1041
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,823
Okay?

1042
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,116
Yes!

1043
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,286
I don't know. I heard
she broke up with her boyfriend too.

1044
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,747
Well, it's her life.

1045
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,083
Anyway, I don't want to go.

1046
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,751
It's getting late too.

1047
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,337
Don't drink too much. Okay.

1048
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,464
(phone beeps)

1049
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:26,341
So they broke up.

1050
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,096
Okay, Eunkang. Good night.

1051
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,724
It's dangerous at night,
so please walk her home safely.

1052
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,142
-Mom, please.
-JUCHAN: Don't worry.

1053
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,145
-I'm going home too.
-You'll wait.

1054
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,772
Mom. Dad.

1055
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,149
I really don't have a crush on him.

1056
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,901
There's nothing going on between us.

1057
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,152
Fine! We get it.

1058
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,029
So go now. Go.

1059
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,823
Come on. Go.

1060
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,700
-Gosh.
-All right. Let's get back inside.

1061
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,371
Gosh. This is just unbelievable.

1062
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,498
What's wrong with them?

1063
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,584
STOP

1064
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,378
Juchan, why did you lie?

1065
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,922
They're like that because you said
you didn't have a girlfriend.

1066
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,299
Whatever. I'm going to just tell them.

1067
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,345
I really don't have a girlfriend.

1068
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,681
We broke up.

1069
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,183
Sunyu and I.

1070
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,853
(emotive music)

1071
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,066
(train approaching)

1072
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,699
INCOMING TRAIN

1073
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,413
(chain clattering)

1074
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,542
JUCHAN: She wants to study fashion.

1075
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,463
I knew she thought about it a lot,
so I couldn't stop her.

1076
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:51,843
I thought being a cop really suited her.

1077
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,845
(crickets creaking)

1078
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,974
(emotive music continues)

1079
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,520
JUCHAN: It's a full moon.
(sighs)

1080
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,274
Juchan, you know what?

1081
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:11,237
You know how people make wishes
when they see a full moon.

1082
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,783
But you're not supposed to wish
for something you want.

1083
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,913
You're supposed to wish

1084
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,332
for something you want to be gone.

1085
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:24,918
Is that so?

1086
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:29,589
Try wishing for
all the sad and negative feelings

1087
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,425
inside of you to be gone.

1088
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,427
It'll make you feel much better.

1089
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,721
(emotive music)

1090
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:42,936
Gosh. The little freckled girl
has all grown up.

1091
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:46,648
-Look at you, comforting me now.
-I'm all grown up. I'm 20 years old.

1092
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,400
-(meows)
-(gasps)

1093
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,486
(chuckles)

1094
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,905
It's a cat.
(chuckling)

1095
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:54,948
(clears throat)

1096
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,283
-It's a cute cat.
-(laughing)

1097
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,079
Juchan, let me give you a question.

1098
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,165
What does a cat say

1099
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:07,293
when you say "meow" to it?

1100
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,091
-"Why-meow?"
-(both laugh)

1101
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,343
That's not fair.

1102
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:17,303
You should've said it's a trick question.

1103
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,180
Okay. Do you want to try another one?

1104
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,182
Okay. Shoot.

1105
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,519
What's the most common blood type of cops?

1106
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,062
Blood type?

1107
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,191
Take your time. I'm going to the restroom.

1108
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,401
Okay.

1109
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,697
(crickets creaking)

1110
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,659
I've read that somewhere...

1111
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,327
Was it A?

1112
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,330
(cellphone buzzing)

1113
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,583
WI SEUNGHYUN

1114
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,044
Blood type...

1115
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,630
-(keypad clacking)
-(cellphone buzzing continues)

1116
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,801
WI SEUNGHYUN

1117
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,555
(light music)

1118
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,481
-SEUNGHYUN: Hello?
-Hey, Seunghyun.

1119
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,568
Is that you, Juchan?

1120
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,569
Yes.

1121
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,654
Eunkang went to the restroom.

1122
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:18,031
Where are you?

1123
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,198
Are you together now?

1124
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,494
(closing theme music)
